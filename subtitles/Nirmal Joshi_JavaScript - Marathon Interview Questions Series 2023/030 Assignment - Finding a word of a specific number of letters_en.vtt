00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:13.680
In this exercise, we are going to find a solution of finding a word of a specific number of letters,

2
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.510
for example, finding one letter word or three letter word.

3
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.390
In this exercise, we have to find the word of specific number of letters.

4
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.940
Let's take a sample string, you and I, flying in the sky.

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.690
Now, if you want to find one letter word, then the result will be I.

6
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.280
If you find a three letter word, then the result will be you and the and sky.

7
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.630
Obviously, we have to find a word.

8
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.620
So first we should use the word boundary slash B around the pattern, slash W four word characters and

9
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.760
quantifier, where we use curly brackets and number of letters.

10
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.640
So it can be one or three in curly brackets, quantifier curly brackets, one for one letter and curly

11
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.430
brackets, three for three letters.

12
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.640
So the pattern for one letter search will be slash B slash W, one letter word again, slash B, and

13
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
for a three letter word instead of one, we will use three.

14
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.900
Let's call it practically.

15
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.080
First, we will write the code for a single letter.

16
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.830
I will declare the variable.

17
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.600
Let str is equal to you and I flying in the sky.

18
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.920
Let pattern is equal to slash b w of course one letter slash B again and slash G.

19
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.070
For global search, let's use the match method.

20
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.570
I will say console.log string dot match the pattern.

21
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.040
So now we have AI as a result.

22
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.610
Now let's try to search for three letter words.

23
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.570
I'll just change one and replace it with three.

24
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.660
Let's run the code now in the output.

25
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:17.760
We have all three letter words you can use quantifier to fix number of letters with slash W, and if

26
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.210
you give slash B, then it's going to find the whole word for that many number of letters.
