00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,520
In this exercise, we are learning how to validate a credit card.

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,990
This is a very common validation a developer has to do if a payment gateway is to be implemented.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,900
When it comes to validating a credit card.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,170
There are different companies having different formats.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,360
In this exercise, I'm going to validate a few commonly used companies like MasterCard, Visa, American

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,130
Express, Diner's Club, Discover and JCB.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,920
Let's understand each company's format so that we can create a pattern for it.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,470
I will begin with MasterCard.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:54,210
The number begins with 51 through 55 or 2 to 2, one through two 7 to 0, and the length is 16 digits.

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,250
So it begins with a carrot sign.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,880
We will use parentheses as we have to use a pipe sign to apply our condition here.

12
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,810
But at the same time we won't be capturing the group.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,020
So using question mark and Colon, hope you remember the non capturing group concept.

14
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,670
If not, then you can check it again in the respective tutorial.

15
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,030
Now comes 51 to 55.

16
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,930
That is, first digit will be five and second can be any number between one and five.

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,760
Next two digits can be any number between 0 to 9.

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,930
This will satisfy the first four digits condition for numbers, starting with 51 through 55.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
But there can be another situation.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,610
So we will add a pipe sign.

21
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,590
That is the our condition.

22
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,810
Now we think of 2 to 2 one through two 7 to 0.

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,650
The number can be triple to and the last digit can be any number between one and nine.

24
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:08,100
So this will cover numbers like two, 2 to 1 or let's say two, 2 to 8, etc. or it can start with 22

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:17,280
and third digit can be any number between three and nine, and fourth digit can be any number between

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
zero and nine.

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:28,350
That is two, two, three, five or 2263 or let's say 2 to 4 eight, or it can start with two.

28
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,830
Then the next digit can be between three and six.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:42,000
That is all numbers between 2320 600, where the last two digits can be any number between zero and

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,650
nine.

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:53,910
For example, 23562687 or let's say two, four, five, three, etc. or it can start with 27.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:01,500
The second digit can be zero or one third digit can be between zero and nine.

33
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:09,660
So this will cover all numbers between 2700 to 2719.

34
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,160
Now the last number remaining is two 7 to 0.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,120
So we'll add a pipe sign and say two 7 to 0.

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,690
So we are done with the first four digit validation as the total length is 16.

37
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,320
For the rest of the 12 digits, it can be any number between zero and nine.

38
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,880
So this is how a master card validation pattern will look like.

39
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,480
Now let's try Visa card validation.

40
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,380
This one is little easier compared to MasterCard.

41
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,190
The card number begins with digit four.

42
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,019
The length can be 13 for old cards and 16 for newer ones.

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,350
So we will begin with a carrot and four as it starts with four.

44
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,870
Then next 12 digits can be any number between zero and nine.

45
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,850
That is in the square bracket.

46
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,660
We'll say zero, dash nine and quantifier 12.

47
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,040
So this validates a 13 digit credit card number.

48
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,560
And there can be three or more digits between zero and nine.

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,720
And these three can occur zero times or one time.

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,330
So we add a question mark for zero or one occurrence of this group, which we don't want to capture.

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,200
So the pattern for visa will be something like this.

52
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,770
And this is all for the Visa card validation.

53
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,430
Now let's see.

54
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,420
American Express validation.

55
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,500
As for American Express, the validation is even simpler.

56
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,160
It begins with 34 or 37 and the length is 15 digits.

57
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,530
So I will straightaway show the pattern.

58
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,210
The pattern will be something like this where it begins with a correct sign.

59
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,950
It begins with three.

60
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,410
Now it can be four or seven.

61
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,450
That is 34 or 37.

62
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,880
Then the rest of the 13 digits may have any number between zero and nine.

63
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,750
The next validation we are going to see is for the Diner's Club credit cards.

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:43,160
The validation for Diners Club includes number beginning with 302, 305, 36 or 38.

65
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,070
The length of digits is 14.

66
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,760
There are few who have 16 digits, but they have tied up with MasterCard.

67
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,410
So for those, the validation will be the same as of the MasterCard.

68
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:02,120
So we will have to just check 302, 305 36 or 38.

69
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,380
That's the beginning and the length should be 14.

70
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:11,710
So here it begins with a carrot and then we have three for next three digits.

71
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:20,780
After three there can be zero and numbers between zero and five for validating 300 to 305.

72
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:29,720
Or there can be a six or eight after three for second digit and any number as the last digit.

73
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,600
And for the rest of the 11 digits, it can be any number between zero and nine.

74
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,760
So the pattern for Diners Club credit card will be like this.

75
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:15,670
Four JCB cards beginning with 2131 or 1800 are 15 digits long and cards beginning with 35 are 16 digits

76
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,240
long.

77
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:26,830
So in a non capturing group we will write to 131 or 1800 or 35 and three digits after eight and rest

78
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,900
of the 11 digits will be with quantifier that is curly brackets 11.

79
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,880
So the final pattern for JCB card is like this.

80
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,870
And the last is the Discover Card.

81
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,140
Discover card numbers begin with 601 are 65 and are 16 digits in length as the pattern is simple and

82
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,510
we have seen quite a few combinations.

83
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,360
I just show you the pattern directly.

84
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,310
This is how it looks.

85
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,730
So we are done with various credit card validations.

86
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,430
Now comes a very important point.

87
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,760
We can either apply different patterns with different conditions or we can merge with a single pattern.

88
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:02,900
This totally depends on the code requirement, but we have seen individual validations so far.

89
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,850
If at all you are willing to merge, then the complete pattern will look like this.

90
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,660
First we'll put MasterCard, then Visa.

91
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,330
Then I will add American Express, Diner's Club or JCB or Discover.

92
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,190
So it alteration with a pipe sign.

93
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,620
We are going to just give all the patterns together.

94
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,450
Or you can try individual patterns in the code which we have seen so far.
