00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
In this section, we are going to discuss the Fibonacci series algorithm.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.500
The problem is that we are going to get a number from the user and playing Fibonacci series numbers

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.090
until the enter number.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.310
When the program is executed, it will ask for a number like this.

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.370
It will display enter a number.

6
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.790
For example, the user enters hundred here.

7
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.270
It means that it should display the Fibonacci numbers less than 100.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
So in this case, the output will be like this.

9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.580
So it will go till 89.

10
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.720
Let's try to find the solution for this program.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
The first question is what is a Fibonacci series?

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.630
A Fibonacci is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of two preceding numbers.

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.950
Here.

14
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.850
In this case, zero and one are the beginning.

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.200
Then the next one is sum of zero and one.

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
Then two is some of previous two numbers.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490
That is one plus one, two.

18
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.590
Once we have two, that means the previous two numbers we have are two and one.

19
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.660
So the sum will be two plus one.

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.470
That is three.

21
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.690
And this goes on until the limit we decide.

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.000
Let's try to understand the solution.

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Using the pseudocode.

24
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.890
Here we are taking a variable called limit where the user is going to enter the end limit for the series.

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.040
We are also taking two values here.

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.760
That is E, which is the first value zero and the second B, which will be one.

27
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.260
We are also taking one more variable, which is the Fibonacci number.

28
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.490
We are going to store that is previous two numbers.

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.710
Some will be stored in this variable F and because we want to print zero and one from the beginning,

30
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.160
here we are writing a logic where we are directly printing the value of E, so here the output will

31
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.310
be print.

32
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.330
That means the zero value is displayed.

33
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:24.020
Now we are putting a loop where we decide that unless F reaches a limit, it should keep on repeating

34
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.830
a process.

35
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.780
The first thing we are doing here is we are printing value of F and so the output because we have initialized

36
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.920
F an is equal to a plus B that is zero plus one F and will have value one only.

37
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.750
So that will be the output.

38
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.050
So now the output is zero one.

39
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.560
The next thing is we need to change the value of Effen because we are going to add previous two numbers.

40
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.600
So that is zero plus one.

41
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.110
So Effen we are writing A plus B, so now our friends value is one again.

42
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.650
Then we need to change the value of E.

43
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.680
We are assigning value of B here.

44
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.450
So we will have one now and we need to have the newer value, which is the sum of previous two values,

45
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:25.390
and that we have stored in a variable called F and we are assigning B is equal to F and this means now

46
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.130
it has value one and B also has one.

47
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.260
Again, it will go to print the value of F in which is still one.

48
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.630
So again, the output will be one.

49
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.660
So print F in will print value.

50
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.190
That is one again.

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.660
Now our friend is equal to A-plus.

52
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.990
B, both A and B are one and one, so that will be two.

53
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.740
So F in will have two.

54
00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:03.130
Now again, we are changing the value of A by B, so Ariel, how value one and B will have the newer

55
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.500
value which is in F and that is two.

56
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.520
Now when we go to the print statement, it is going to print value to here.

57
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.660
Again, Afin is equal to A-plus beat.

58
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.810
That is is one and B is two.

59
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.760
So F will have three.

60
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:30.840
We are changing the value of E by B, so it will have now two and B will have the value of F and that

61
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.740
is three.

62
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.180
Again, it will go to print and it will print the value.

63
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.460
Often that is three.

64
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.350
So now we have it is equal to two and B is equal to three.

65
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.990
So FN will have five in it.

66
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.850
Again, we are changing the previous values that is eight and B both by changing the newer value of

67
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.740
B and FN to F in has value five.

68
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.210
So that also gets printed on the screen.

69
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.020
This is how we repeat a process.

70
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.750
We try to add to preceding numbers to get the new Fibonacci series number.

71
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.410
Now let's try to do the coding for the same thing.

72
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.920
First thing, we are going to take a variable limit where we are going to get the input from the user.

73
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.620
Of course we need to convert it into integer.

74
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.170
We are also taking variable E that is zero and B equals to one.

75
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.850
The next thing we are taking the variable F in for the Fibonacci value and that we are keeping a plus

76
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.120
B.

77
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.720
Of course we display the value of A from the beginning.

78
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.870
That is also one more logic where A and B are displayed, but there are different approaches to achieve

79
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.560
the same thing.

80
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.090
Now we are taking a loop here where the condition is that until effort is less than limited, repeat

81
00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.960
this process, the process where we're going to print the value of effin will, say AFN is equal to

82
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.920
A-plus b.

83
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.680
Of course, is equal to B and B is equal to F in.

84
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.160
Let's try to run this call and see what is the output, as you can see now.

85
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.240
So asking for a limit number.

86
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.270
So we enter 50 here.

87
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.800
That means it's going to display all the numbers which are under 50.

88
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.110
So this will go till 34.

89
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.250
Let's try to run this code again and we enter the number hundred.

90
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.830
As you can see, the output.

91
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.270
The Fibonacci series is repeated till value 89.

92
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.120
So this is how we can achieve the Fibonacci cities.
