00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.360
So this section is all about assertions.

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:17.290
Assertions are provision of forcing a regular expression pattern where you can decide maybe a line or

3
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.650
word boundaries or end and beginning with a specific word or a character.

4
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.760
The first assertion we discuss is also known as anchors.

5
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.320
That is a carrot and a dollar sign.

6
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.600
There are two anchors.

7
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.650
One is the carried sign and second is the dollar sign.

8
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.930
The carrot denotes beginning and dollar denotes end.

9
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.920
For example, if you write console.log.

10
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
Now I'm going to write a pattern here where I'm using the carrot sign.

11
00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.260
And I write this dot test and I'll pass.

12
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.710
This is a string.

13
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.379
Let's run the code.

14
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:15.160
The output is true as you use the correct anchor, which says if string begins with the this keyword,

15
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.780
then return true.

16
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.000
Otherwise return false.

17
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.680
Let's try to change the string and run it again.

18
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.420
I'll remove the T now because I've removed T from the string.

19
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.670
It does not begin with this anymore and thus it returns false.

20
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.520
In short, for checking string is beginning with a pattern or value.

21
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.730
You can use the carrot anchor dollar checks the same for end of string.

22
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.630
That is.

23
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.980
For example, you want to check whether string ends with a word.

24
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.610
Hello.

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.250
Then you can write the code like this.

26
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.860
I will say console.log log Hello and the dollar.

27
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.170
Of course, I'm using the test method to check whether it is true or false.

28
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.940
So here we say this is a string.

29
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.550
Hello?

30
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.070
Now, if we run this, it returns true.

31
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.170
Let's try to remove Helo from and and try to run it again.

32
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.290
Now you can see that it returns false.

33
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.580
So Carrot and Dollar are anchors which help to check whether a value exists at the start or end of a

34
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.180
string.
