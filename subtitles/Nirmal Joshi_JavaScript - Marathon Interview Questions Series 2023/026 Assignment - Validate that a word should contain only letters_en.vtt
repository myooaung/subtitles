00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.450
We are going to check that a word should contain only letters.

2
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.730
So the problem here is that we are checking for a word which contains only letters, no digits spaces

3
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.920
or any other special characters.

4
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.630
Here, we are going to create a pattern with anchors like a carrot sign and the dollar sign.

5
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.600
Let's declare a variable which has only letters, no number spaces or any special characters.

6
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.430
Now comes the pattern.

7
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.070
So I'll say Slash.

8
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.950
We begin with a carrot and end with dollar anchors.

9
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.370
So it handles the beginning and end of the string.

10
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:09.440
Now, giving the range of all uppercase and lowercase characters by providing Capital A to Z and small

11
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.410
A to Z in the square brackets.

12
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.390
Of course, in this case we can also use Capital A to small Z as well.

13
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:29.720
The next we give Quantifier Plus, which gives an instruction that at least one or more matches should

14
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.850
be found for the range that is Uppercase A to lowercase Z.

15
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.410
Thus we get only letters pattern here.

16
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.380
Let's try to run the code and see the output.

17
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.720
It says true because the STR contains only letters.

18
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.570
You can try adding spaces or other characters in the string to see the result.

19
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.660
Let's add at least a digit somewhere in the string and run to see the output.

20
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.020
Let's add seven somewhere in the string and I will run the code.

21
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.190
So now it says false.

22
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.310
As not all the characters are letters only in the string.
