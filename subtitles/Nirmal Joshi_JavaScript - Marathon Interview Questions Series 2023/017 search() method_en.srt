1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,600
The next method we are going to look at is the search method.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:17,450
This method helps to check whether a pattern is existing in a string or not, and if exists, then it

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,340
returns the index number.

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,400
Let's see the syntax string dot search and we give the regular expression pattern.

5
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:32,210
This is a very simple method which searches for the first occurrence and returns the index number.

6
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,920
Let's practically see a code sample.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:44,880
To understand this, we'll use this string variable, a pattern and console.log.

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,530
Let's run the code.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,060
You see that the value is two.

10
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:58,760
That means on the second index number, second position that is zero one and two is is found.

11
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:07,670
Let's try to find a value which is not existing in the string we replace is with that in the pattern.

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,020
And let's run the code.

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,530
So now it returns minus one.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,190
This means when and there is no match found, it's going to return minus one.
