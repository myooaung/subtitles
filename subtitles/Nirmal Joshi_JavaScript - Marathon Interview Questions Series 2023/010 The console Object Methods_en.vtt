00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
Now let's understand the console object in this lecture.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
The question is explain different console object methods.

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.180
First, let us understand what exactly is the control object.

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:22.330
The console object provides access to the developer tool debugger console from inside the code.

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.480
Cancel is part of global window object so you can ride windowed out console or you can directly see

6
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.460
console because it's part of global objects or directly available.

7
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.920
In the cord here on this button, click.

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.800
I will show you different console object methods.

9
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:50.210
There are various console object methods among which we have already seen a commonly used console dart

10
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.420
log method, which is basically used to print logs in the developer tool console.

11
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.560
Let me click on the button and the log is displayed.

12
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.320
Let me define a variable here.

13
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:13.310
See the is equal to document or get element by ID as three dot inner HDMI and let's say console log.

14
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.670
Let's save the file and run it.

15
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.810
So the console.log method prints the log messages in the console and used to evaluate and inspect the

16
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.760
variable values in the program.

17
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.760
Another method is cancelled out info which outputs the informative log messages to the console.

18
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.280
Unlike the console log method for example, instead of log, if I say console dot info and remove this

19
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.210
dot inner HDMI, let's save this and run.

20
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.820
So it displays the HTML tag with its content and information related to attributes.

21
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.580
Let me add one more button here and change this to button.

22
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.470
I'm changing this to get elements by tag name and here I say button.

23
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.210
And now let's save this and let's click on the button.

24
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.870
So as you see that the information related to the elements is displayed.

25
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.320
There is one more method that is used to display core data in a tabular format in the console, and

26
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.770
that can be done using console dock table.

27
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.690
So I have a string at a having few values and displayed this added data saying cancel the table and

28
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.300
I give SDR in the browser.

29
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.430
Let me dog the developer tool to bottom first and click on the button.

30
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.330
The first is the index of the added element field and other shows their values along with the added

31
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.080
length below.

32
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.310
If you click on the filenames, it sorts in ascending or descending orders.

33
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.980
This console can be used to write JavaScript directly for testing purposes.

34
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.490
I can write this code here as well.

35
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.110
Now let me press enter and I'm going to inspect the result.

36
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.970
When you want to provide any custom bonding, for example, I will use console dot one and here I give

37
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.440
the warning message.

38
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.560
It displays a warning in the console.

39
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.200
As my console has too many outputs, I want to clear it.

40
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.020
So I will use the console to clear matter directly in the console and press enter.

41
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.270
This will clear the console with a message that says console was clear.

42
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.750
Now this you can use when you want to make sure that before you console log anything you want to have

43
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.690
a clear console.

44
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.680
So this can be a very handy method to use now to display any error message in the console.

45
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.860
The console lot error method is used.

46
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.690
Just as here I used the true statement.

47
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.970
Let me change it to cancel out add.

48
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.260
This will not work as an exception anymore, but simply provide the error message that saved the file.

49
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.830
And let me do only one value and click on add.

50
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.470
So the error message is displayed here.

51
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:34.700
This sidebar shows different log messages like error message, user message and warning, etc..

52
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.360
To debug any function or code snippet.

53
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.510
There is a method called console or debug.

54
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.720
I will create one more button on click event will call the function named function debug.

55
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.060
Under the script tag.

56
00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.170
I will call the function and c console dot debug and will debug this function.

57
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.990
And let me change this two elements.

58
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.830
Save the file and let's click on the button so it debug.

59
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.360
The function and error message is displayed.
