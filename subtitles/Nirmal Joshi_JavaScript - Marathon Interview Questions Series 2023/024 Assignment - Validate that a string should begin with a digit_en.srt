1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,430
The second problem we are going to see is we are going to validate that a string should begin with a

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,100
digit.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,390
Here we will use the anchor for beginning.

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,620
That is a carrot sign and we'll check for the digit.

5
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,700
Now, there are two ways to check for a digit.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,970
Either we use the range that is 0 to 9 in square brackets, or we can use the slash DX character class.

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,620
Let's try both the ways, but we'll begin with giving a range from 0 to 9 in square brackets.

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,270
First of all, I'll declare a variable.

9
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,050
I'll say 88 New Street.

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,940
I'm going to define the pattern where I'll say a carrot that is for the beginning.

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,310
I want to give a range that is 0 to 9.

12
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:10,280
So I'll put in square bracket and let's try to apply the test method on the pattern.

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,340
As you can see, it displays true.

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,240
Let's remove this 88 and run the code again.

15
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,500
Now you can see that it displays false.

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,910
The second way is we use the slash D character class.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:37,420
So in the same code again I will add 88 and in the pattern, instead of giving this range, I'll say

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,380
slash D.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,700
Let's run the code again.

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,720
And now you see that the output is true.

21
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,200
That means the first character of this string is a digit.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:00,450
We can also remove 88 from this and run it again to check whether it is working fine for the false situation

23
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,200
or not.

24
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,740
As you can see, it returns false.
