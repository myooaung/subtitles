00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.230
If you observe output, the data is fixed.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.610
That is, it is apple only.

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.880
Ideally it should be something like this.

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.160
The product card element should have attributes maybe like P name, price, p image and the product

5
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.250
status where user can pass the data.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.280
Like here you can see that each product may have the product, name, price and image.

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.510
The component should receive it and behave accordingly.

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.460
Let's start implementing this.

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.780
I'll go to the HTML and we'll add the P name as an attribute where I'll just say Apple.

10
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.240
Now let me copy this P name and paste it for three more times with the individual products.

11
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.750
And let me change the text to orange grapes and of course, banana.

12
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.370
All right.

13
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.150
Though the values are passed from this place, but they are not actually appearing anywhere at the moment.

14
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.740
So let's go into the code.

15
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.010
Now, here in the edge tree, we don't need this apple and dollar 40 because that's where we want the

16
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.150
dynamic value.

17
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.630
The next step is to assign the value to attribute each tree so I can say this dot shadow root dot query

18
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.690
selector in the brackets.

19
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:51.440
Each three dot inner text is equal to this dot get attribute.

20
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.530
In the brackets, I'll say the attribute name.

21
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.440
Now we have given the P name as the attribute.

22
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.500
Now the moment I write P name, you can see in the output that the apple is getting displayed.

23
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.090
Not only that, if I scroll down, you see that the orange, the grapes and the banana, all the values

24
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.350
are getting displayed.

25
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.410
Now because in the output we had product price displayed together.

26
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.150
Either I can take separate element to show the price or can join the string.

27
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.240
I will just join the string here.

28
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.350
So with this get attribute p name, I will join the price as well.

29
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.050
But let me first of all, add the price to this product card.

30
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.080
Let me also indent this properly.

31
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.430
I'll bring p name on new line and we'll say price is equal to dollar 40.

32
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.930
Let me also add the price to other products as well.

33
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.720
Now let's go to product card DJs and here I want to join the price.

34
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.410
So let me copy this get attribute.

35
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.070
Now let me add a plus sign to join.

36
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.110
I'll add a comma in between, first of all, comma and space.

37
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.840
And again, I'll paste the P name and we'll change this to price.

38
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.620
And now you see that the product name and prices are also getting displayed as desired.

39
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.880
Now let me add the P image and the p status.

40
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.220
I'll say p img is equal to.

41
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.170
I'll keep it blank at the moment because I have the path which I will paste later on.

42
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.510
Let me add the P status as well.

43
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.230
Which will be not sold.

44
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.220
Now let me copy this p image and p status and paste it for the rest of the cards.

45
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.930
All right.

46
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.020
Now, let me bring the URLs for the images.

47
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.500
All right, so now I'm done with the URL pasting.

48
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.540
Now let's go to the product card JS and here I want to configure the attributes.

49
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.460
Okay, so now let me remove these Z from this place.

50
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.350
I'll simply say IMG, and that's what we are going to configure at runtime.

51
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.100
Let me also remove this paragraphs not sold.

52
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:55.160
Now I will say this start shadow root dot query selector img.

53
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.830
Dot HRC is equal to this dot.

54
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.480
Get attribute.

55
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.280
And the attribute which we have is the p img.

56
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.440
Now let's check the images.

57
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.950
You can see that the apple image, the orange grapes and banana image is getting displayed.

58
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.970
Now let's do the same for the status that is not sold.

59
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.080
I'll just copy this shadow route line.

60
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:28.990
Based it here.

61
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.910
Instead of IMG, we have the paragraph for the status and here I'll say in our text, and instead of

62
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.260
p img, I'll say P status.

63
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.990
Now the component is ready with the dynamic data using custom attributes.

64
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.290
Now we have custom component custom attributes.

65
00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.040
The next is binding custom events that is dealing with events for your own component.

66
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.620
But before we understand the events, we need to know one more concept called life cycle matters.

67
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.360
And that's our next topic.
