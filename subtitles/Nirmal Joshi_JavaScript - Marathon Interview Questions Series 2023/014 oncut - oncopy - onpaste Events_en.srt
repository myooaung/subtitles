00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:07,320
There are three more events on Uncut, on copy and on paste, which we can use with input elements.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,540
There are two related questions with this topic, so let's start discussing it.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,990
I'm again using the same layout where we have a text box and I have an H1 where I am displaying if that

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,980
is an event occurred.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,630
So let's go to the coding.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,610
We have this division here, some CSS as applied and also for input.

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,200
I have font size and margin.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,410
Now here, what I have done is I have an input box, but I am going to configure the three events which

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,400
we are talking about.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,760
So the first year and I am talking about is on cut event.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,360
So I'll say on card, what I want to configure is I want to call the function E handler.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,800
And inside of this I'm just passing that on.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,480
Got fired or something like this.

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,950
The next event I'm going to configure is on copy and then on paste.

15
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,080
So let me just paste the event.

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,730
So I'll say on copy where I'm going to pass the string on copy and on based.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,280
I will say on paste is fire.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,790
That's it.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,340
And we have this e handler where every string is passed, then the message is assigned.

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,340
Let's go to the browser and I refresh the screen.

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,330
Let's type.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,520
This is a test.

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:28,580
Now I just select the test word and if I press control C then you can see that it says on copy.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,360
If I just say control X, then the anchor is fired.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,530
And if I press control V, the on paste event is fired.

26
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:43,880
This is a common practice that we have got paste and copy kind of actions for any text boxes.

27
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,240
We don't actually write anything to make it happen, but in case if we want to stop this cut, copy

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,340
or paste behavior, which is the default behavior of text box, we can stop that as well.

29
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,270
If you want that.

30
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,700
What you can do, let's say I do not want this guard event to be fired for this text box that is for

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,360
this element.

32
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,540
So when we is that I can say return false.

33
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,690
This will cancel this event or let's say in case of paste, I don't want that the paste should happen.

34
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,110
So another way is that the event object has a method called prevent default.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,030
If I do this, then this will also stop the event execution.

36
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,210
This shows that the default event is prevented.

37
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,110
So two ways.

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,440
You have to stop the event execution.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,630
Remember, you can cancel only those events which are cancel label.

40
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,510
There are few events which are not cancel label so you can't write return false for those events.

41
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,660
Let me just save this and I will refresh and again I'm going to type.

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,370
This is a test.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,060
Now if I press control C, then the copy event is executed because we have configured it.

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,130
But if I just press control x here then there is no event executed.

45
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,940
Or even if I say control V, that also doesn't execute the UN.

46
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,240
So both the cut and paste events are stopped.

47
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,480
So it's easy to understand this cut, copy and paste event.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,040
But this is a tricky one that how do we stop the event execution?

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,430
Let's discuss do questions of this topic.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,390
Now the first question is just that.

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,660
Somebody may ask you what is a card event or how do you manage some code when something is copied in

52
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,880
the element or maybe based event?

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,150
Right.

54
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,100
So the question can be related to that.

55
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,510
So now you know that that is on copy on Carter on paste event which can be used, which can handle the

56
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:38,810
card.

57
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,770
Copy paste.

58
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,670
Action coding.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,780
The second question is how can you stop an event of card copy are based for an element.

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:57,880
So the way to do it is like this that you return false either or you just say event or prevent default.

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,730
Then it will certainly stop that particular event to be executed for that particular element only.
