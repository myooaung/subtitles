Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,540
Welcome to the Algorithm Series.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:11,760
In this section we are going to discuss about how to check a character is a vowel or a consonant.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,160
This is how the program will be when we run the program.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,990
It will ask user to enter a character.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,520
Let's say the user enters E, then there is a message displayed that is a vowel.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,570
If a user enters are, then the output will be r is a consonant.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,310
Same goes for all vowels or consonants.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,210
Let's discuss the solution and the pseudocode.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,550
So first we will get a character.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,250
Now what we have to check is that enter character is eei0 or you.

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,660
Then it is a vowel.

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,150
Otherwise it is a consonant.

14
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,440
Because we have to check conditions here.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,020
We can use F or switch case in the respective programming languages.

16
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,960
But here we are going to try the pseudocode.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,510
So we are using the F condition.

18
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,920
And because we want to check more than one condition, there is actually five conditions to be precise.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,010
For a e, i or and you.

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,280
So we are going to join each condition with or why are we using R?

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,770
Because here we have to check that character.

22
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:44,110
That is the variable C which has E or I or you are any other value.

23
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,180
So at the time, not all values can be inside this variable.

24
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,990
So we are joining the condition using order here.

25
00:01:54,510 --> 00:02:05,770
So we'll see if it is equal to a r e or I, r o or you then will print.

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,720
It is a vowel, otherwise it's a consonant.

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,600
So this is a very simple logic behind it.

28
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:20,970
Of course, there is a possibility that when the user enters a character, it may not be small keys.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,220
Let's say the user enters capital E.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,490
Now here we do not have any condition which checks in the pseudocode that risk capital are not to implement

31
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,010
that in respective programming languages.

32
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,320
There are various functions which can convert the value of variable into uppercase or lowercase.

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:50,940
Let's say I can update this pseudocode for the moment, I'll simply convert c it is equal to two lower.

34
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,810
Assume that there is a function called to lower of c it.

35
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,030
So whether the user enters small case or capital that will be always converted into small case.

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:09,720
So here you have checked all the conditions for small case only that is lower case only.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,540
So depending on the programming language, you can also apply this lowercase function to convert the

38
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,160
value into lower and then you check the lower case value only.

39
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,430
So now let's try the coding practically.

40
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,650
We'll take a variable and we'll have a function to get the value.

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,970
We'll have the prom statement to get a character.

42
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,680
Now we are going to put an if condition variable sketch.

43
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:47,060
We are going to check whether it is e, e, i or u.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,480
Then we print C is vowel.

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,340
Otherwise it's consonant.

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,130
So now let's try the lowercase values.

47
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,550
So as you can see, let's enter a.

48
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,210
It says it is Volvo.

49
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,300
Let's enter you.

50
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,470
It says it is woven.

51
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,050
Let's enter via.

52
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,450
It says it's a concern.

53
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,770
Now, these values which we have entered so far are small cases.

54
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,480
That is lower cases.

55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,620
Let's try to enter a value capital a.

56
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,350
Now it's this consonant.

57
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,630
Now let's try to apply the lowercase logic here.

58
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,460
So after the input of character, I will convert the character into lowercase.

59
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,360
So now let's try see it not to lowercase to convert the value into lowercase.

60
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,180
Now let's run the code again and we will try to enter capital here.

61
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,840
Now it says it's available.

62
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,260
So this is a basic logic to convert the value into lowercase because you are checking lowercase and

63
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,680
if condition, if you can write capital in if condition are capital values, uppercase values that is,

64
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,990
then you can convert it into uppercase.

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,550
That's the whole idea behind keeping the single condition and converting the value smartly in respective

66
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,120
cases.
