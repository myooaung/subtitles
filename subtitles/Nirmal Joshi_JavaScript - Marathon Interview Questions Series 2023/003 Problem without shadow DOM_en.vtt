00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.830
Now let's try to apply some styling with this H1.

2
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.590
I will say style tag, first of all.

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.220
And inside.

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.620
Let me give each one and the color blue.

5
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.270
As you can see, the header section, each one turned blue, but at the same time, the one inside the

6
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.520
component is also blue.

7
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.680
I want them to be red.

8
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.170
So let's go to the component.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.310
And inside the tick I will say style.

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.880
And let me end the style tag here.

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240
And here each one.

12
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.070
And let's say I want the color red.

13
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.130
So I'll say color colon red.

14
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.480
Now the problem begins.

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.090
As you can see, the main header section, each one is also read.

16
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.500
So what is the problem?

17
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:20.770
The problem is the main page and the component at the moment is part of the DOM, which is a common

18
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.510
scope.

19
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.390
So style is applied kind of globally.

20
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.450
Ideally the component should have its own scope, or in other words, it should have its own dom which

21
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.800
does not clash with the page dom in which it is added.

22
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.520
And to make its own dom, you need to use the shadow dom.

23
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.050
Shadow Dome is a way to provide encapsulation to the web component or in other words, shadowed arm

24
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.600
is a way to provide separate hidden dom to web components.

25
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.570
That is the web components own dom.

26
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:14.780
So let's practically add shadow dom in the current code to solve this existing problem where the CSS

27
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.830
is shared across the very same scope.
