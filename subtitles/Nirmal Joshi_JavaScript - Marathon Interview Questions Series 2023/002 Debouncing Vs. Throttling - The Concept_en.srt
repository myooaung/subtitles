00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,450
Before I start the call, let me explain the difference between deep bouncing and throttling, as they

2
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,270
both are used to improve the performance.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,930
Let's see your mom brought cookies at home.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,870
The moment you came to know you started eating after every few minutes.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,650
So your mom put a condition that after every two hours, you can have one cookie.

6
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,490
In between, if you ask, you won't get it.

7
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,640
That is the event will not fire every time.

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,340
It's going to fire after every two hours.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:59,820
For example, you had a cookie at eight a.m., then the next cookie you can have at 10:00 only if you

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,950
ask at 9:00 to have one.

11
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,600
You cannot have it, but you will get it at 10 for sure because you had the last cookie at eight.

12
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,010
Why am I emphasizing on timings?

13
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,560
Well, you'll come to know in a few minutes when I discuss the bouncing.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,000
In fact, this timing thing is the key to understand the bouncing bill.

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:36,790
Anyways, so this is throttling where events occur after a certain time only regardless of when and

16
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,910
how many times they actually fired.

17
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:49,310
For example, the mouse event may occur 100 times in a second, but you configure the code in such a

18
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,240
way so that it gets executed only after two seconds and not 200 times.

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,710
Now, let's talk about the bouncing.

20
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:10,500
So in the same kooky example, your mom says that I will give you a cookie if you did not ask for last

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,380
two hours.

22
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,080
You get it at eight and then 10.

23
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:22,160
But if you ask at nine for the cookie, then you will have to wait for two more hours.

24
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,360
That is, now you will get the cookie at 11.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,140
Now, assume that you get the cookie at 11:00, then the next cookie you are supposed to get at one.

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,480
But if you ask at 12:30, then poor, you now wait for two more hours.

27
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,750
Your next cookie time is two 30.

28
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:54,800
So, for example, mouse event is configured to fire at every one second, provided there was no mouse

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,090
move for one second.

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,830
If the mouse moves in half a second, that is 500 milliseconds, then again, wait for one more second.

31
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,430
Seems complicated, but it's not the moment we implement the code, it becomes easy.

32
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,700
But if you understand this cookie example, it will really help you to quickly get the idea.

33
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:25,640
Let me summarize both the concepts once again, throttling is about firing event after every certain

34
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,090
time.

35
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:33,180
That is bouncing will execute after every certain time provided in between.

36
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,550
There was no call of the event.

37
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,010
Now, let's begin with the throttling first, and that's what we are going to check with mouse more

38
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,490
event.
