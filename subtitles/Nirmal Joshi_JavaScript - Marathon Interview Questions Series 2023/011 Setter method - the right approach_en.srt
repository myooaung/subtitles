1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,070
Now as such we are done with the component, but the code can still be improved.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,560
One improvement, which I can think of here is using setter and getter method.

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:26,060
You can check the setter and getter method related lecture in the O'Jays section if you need to understand

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,900
the basics.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,190
Here.

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,630
I am not adding the getter method, but let me add this setter method.

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:40,220
Instead of this set attribute, I will rather assign to a property of the component.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,830
Let me bring this on new line.

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,890
Now I'm going to say this dot B status is equal to sold.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,450
Now, important point is when the value is assigned to the property that is here, when the sole is

11
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,890
assigned to p status, that has to be the setter method which sets the attribute.

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,140
So now I am going to add one setter method.

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll say set p status.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,470
That is the property.

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,540
Inside this method, I am going to put the set attribute line.

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,360
And because it's a settled method, I need to have a value because there will always be the value passed

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,460
and the value passed should be assigned to the property.

18
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,240
So here I'm going to say, well, now this is the actual way.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,340
You should also have a getter method.

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,760
But right now we just need to understand the concept.

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,370
Let's save this and check whether the functionality is still working or not.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm going to click on the buy button and you can see the attribute.

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,450
The value of the attribute is changed, but this time we are using the correct way.

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,490
That is using the setter method.
