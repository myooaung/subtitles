00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.780
So now we are starting a series of practical assignments and practical work used with regular expression.

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.730
The first problem we are going to look at is we're going to find a condition where the first letter

3
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.460
of a string should be in uppercase.

4
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.220
Here we have to check for the first letter.

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.440
That is the beginning of the string.

6
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:33.860
We can use the anchor carrot to check the beginning and also use range that is A to Z between square

7
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.700
brackets.

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.740
Let's practically try the same.

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.800
We can use the test method or match method depending on the requirement of the program.

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.370
At the moment we just have to make a decision.

11
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.790
So we will use the test method and try it.

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.860
Let's declare a variable.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.880
Hello world.

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.220
Now I'm going to declare the pattern.

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.600
The pattern is I'm using the carrot sign here because I want to show that there has to be the beginning

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.830
of the string.

17
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:12.980
The next thing is, I want that it should be an uppercase letter that is between Capital A to Z.

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.020
Now, let's try the test method.

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.640
I'll say console.log, pattern or test string.

20
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.840
Let's run the code.

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.850
Now, as you can see that the output says true.

22
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.440
Let's change the first letter to lowercase and run the code again.

23
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.620
Now you see that the output is false.

24
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.710
So this is how you can check.

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
The first letter is in uppercase or not.
