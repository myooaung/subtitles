00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,600
In this section we are trying slash p that is trying Unicode property.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,360
We have already seen various fundamentals of Unicode.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,630
Now let's try practically slash you modifier.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,150
To use slash modifier.

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,300
We will also make use of property class called slash p slash p takes unicode property or symbol as an

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,110
argument like capital L for letter and for number and S for symbol.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:45,360
The syntax of using slash P is we use slash P and then we give the Unicode property.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:54,240
For example, you want to search all letters in a string, then you can use pattern slash P and uppercase

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,140
l l is instruction to the class slash P that search for all letters.

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:10,710
Similarly, there are many options like N for number and S for symbol, etc. Let's create a simple example

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,810
to try both Unicode property class slash P and modifier slash u.

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,770
Let's create a string which has few letters and symbols as well.

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,870
I'll say this is my face.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,700
Tell me how do I look?

15
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,400
And we'll try to display it.

16
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,860
As you can see, the output is null because we haven't used slash U, which specifies to deal with unique

17
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,790
core values.

18
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,760
So let's add slash U after G.

19
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,070
Now it is able to find letters, but of course there is no search for symbols.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
So let's try that too.

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,490
Using uppercase as property.

22
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,600
Now you can see that there are two symbols searched and displayed.

23
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,270
If you try to remove slash you, then the unique search won't happen.

24
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:18,970
In case you want to search for currency symbol, then you can write uppercase S and small C Let's try

25
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,870
it practically.

26
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,610
Let's say I have a string.

27
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,370
I found 300 and displaying with the match method.

28
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,850
So here are two values are returned.

29
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,300
Now let's add C with SE, which will return only currency symbols.

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,890
Now you see that that is only currency symbol return.

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,310
So like this, there are multiple options for every Unicode property to implement variety of patterns

32
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,970
to get unique code values.

33
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,640
So now you know that.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,820
Why do we use modifier slash?

35
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:03,140
You remember JavaScript uses UTF 16 encoding and that is a lot you can do with Unicode characters and

36
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,510
its search with various encoding.
