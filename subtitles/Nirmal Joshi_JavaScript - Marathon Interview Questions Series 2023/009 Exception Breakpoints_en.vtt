00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.150
Let us now see how exception breakpoints work.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.170
There is one related question.

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.630
When you want to pass the execution on a line that is throwing either caught or uncalled exception,

4
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.810
then exception breakpoints are used.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.450
Here in the debugging pane, this icon is used to set exception breakpoints.

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.640
When I hover on it, it is saying don't pause on exception because it is not active right now.

7
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.320
Clicking on it to enable it.

8
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.740
And now it says Pause on exceptions.

9
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:51.130
But if I checked this option to pause on court exceptions, debugger will also pause on court exceptions

10
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.500
in addition to and guard exceptions.

11
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.890
Selecting this option is optional.

12
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.140
Going to school in this some function.

13
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.460
I will see if N1 or N2 are empty.

14
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.880
Then the function will throw an exception that one or both fields are empty.

15
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.130
Let's save the file and I will enter value in only this field.

16
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.470
Now let's click the button.

17
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.470
And the debugger poses as the exception occurs.

18
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.790
It is shown in the scope pane also.

19
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.940
Now in the code, I will call the function that is not defined.

20
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.350
Let's say add.

21
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.470
Let's save the file and let's go back to the browser.

22
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.800
As soon as the page is refreshed, the debugger pauses here as the exception occurs, showing a reference

23
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.370
error that says function and is not defined.

24
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.300
When I resume the execution, the error message is displayed in the console.

25
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.660
So that's how it works.

26
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.420
Now, let's talk about the related questions.

27
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.130
The first question is how to debug the code with exceptions.

28
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.710
So exception break point is used to debug the code when exceptions occur to parse on the exception animal.

29
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.660
This icon in the debugging pane and by selecting this option will break the execution on guard exceptions

30
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.460
along with uncalled ones.
