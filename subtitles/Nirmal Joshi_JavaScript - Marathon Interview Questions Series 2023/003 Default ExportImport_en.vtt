00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:07.530
Now we have seen about importing and exporting, but with a named syntax in this section we are discussing

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.320
about default exports and imports.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.600
When I say default export, it means there will be one module per file.

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.620
Generally, you see this approach in frameworks where one function or a class is exported.

5
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.100
In other words, you export one container, which has many things inside it, and you import that one

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.760
module only while exporting one module.

7
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.280
That means you are also dividing the functionality into various modules.

8
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.210
It's also a good practice in a longer run that you divide your modules into logical pieces.

9
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.750
For example, the code which we have has some and.

10
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.060
Q There are two different functions which we are exporting from Kalsi Dodgers.

11
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.129
The Kalsi Dodgers does the export, but with the named syntax that means we are exporting the function

12
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.320
with some name and the Q name.

13
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.790
So naturally we have to import with the same name.

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.260
Now, if I have to convert the very same thing with the default import and export approach, then it

15
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.740
has to be something like this where let's say I have this cube dodgers file, I'll create a separate

16
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.990
file, in fact, but I already have created.

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:38.750
So this cube function I should put inside this cube dodgers and then I'll just say export default function.

18
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.070
Q That's it.

19
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.890
At the same time this Chelsea function we have this some function assumed that we keep this name Kelsey

20
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.040
only or we can rename this let's rename this with some dodgers I would say some dodgers.

21
00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.100
And inside this I'm going to say export default function some.

22
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.620
So this is the default export.

23
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.490
It means that we have only one export per file.

24
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.400
Naturally, this is going to increase number of files, but that is a newer approach anyway where you

25
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.210
have more files, which is actually the separation of gold.

26
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.630
Now, as long as importing these modules are concerned, you do not need to use the column bracket.

27
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.410
So now let's say I want to import some from the file card, some dodgers, and I want to import Q from

28
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.760
the file called Cube dot g's here.

29
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.290
You must observe that.

30
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.420
Now, I'm not using the curly brackets.

31
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.350
You use the curly brackets when you have named export, but when you have default export, you do not

32
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.060
write those curly brackets.

33
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.300
It means you write import and then the name.

34
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.850
Now this name is also open for you.

35
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.860
You decide what name you want to give.

36
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.820
At the moment we keep some and cube, let's just run this to see whether the default, export and import

37
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.080
is working fine or not.

38
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.060
I'll go to the browser, refresh the page, and now here we have the output working.

39
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.990
Absolutely fine.

40
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.390
But the difference here is now we are not using the named export and import.

41
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.610
Instead we are using the default one.

42
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.890
So ideally we put various modules in different files.

43
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.770
So one file, one module, that's what we do with default, export and import.

44
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.050
Another thing I would like to mention here is that in case, let's say instead of some I give total

45
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.530
and here also I'm going to say total.

46
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.970
Let's try this.

47
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.230
Still it is working absolutely fine.

48
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:51.180
Now, the export default basically says that you export with any name that doesn't matter.

49
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.560
Name does not have to be the same with the default syntax.

50
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.010
This also means I may remove this some.

51
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.050
This is also absolutely okay.

52
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.800
Generally we see that if we have, let's say, a class to export, we write like this, we say export

53
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.030
default.

54
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.870
Then we have the class name, whatever name you want to give you can all you just avoid name and it

55
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.000
is absolutely value syntax.

56
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.980
So let's try this now.

57
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.330
We do not have any name for this sum and here we give total or let's say some.

58
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.830
Doesn't matter, but I keep some.

59
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.680
Let's save this and refresh the beach.

60
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.730
And you see that still the output is without any added.

61
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.000
That is also one more syntax where you can export the function.

62
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.900
Let's say you have this function which you are writing just like this.

63
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.210
So you have the sum function.

64
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.890
Now you want to export at a later stage at the end of the file.

65
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.420
That is so you can write export default and some.

66
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.060
So you are exporting the module at the end.

67
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.220
This is also a valid syntax.

68
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.280
Let's again go to the output to check.

69
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.840
Everything is working fine.

70
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.420
Another syntax you have to export is you can use export in the bracket.

71
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.340
You can see some as default.

72
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.470
This is also a valid syntax.

73
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.820
Let's just refresh the page.

74
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.120
And you see that output is same.

75
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.870
So as long as exporting default is concerned, you have a keyword called default, which exports the

76
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.690
default module which you can later on import with whichever name you want to.

77
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:47.120
And you generally export one module per file when you are implementing the default exports.

78
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:55.100
So this means that named exports are explicit, whereas with default exports you decide the name.

79
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.230
So now let's discuss about relative questions.

80
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:05.590
The first question is what is a default, export and import and what's the difference between named

81
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.490
and default?

82
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.690
Export and import.

83
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.940
These are the differences, the syntax.

84
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.720
First of all, this is how we deal with name, export and import.

85
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.720
Whereas here we do not use curly brackets and we have export with a default keyword.

86
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.900
So this is the major change in terms of syntax.

87
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.370
As long as conceptual difference is concerned, there can be many modules per file when you say a named

88
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.700
export and import, whereas with default you generally have one export for each file.

89
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.570
Explain various ways of implementing default, export and import.

90
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.270
So these are the different ways we have where we can use the default, export and import.
