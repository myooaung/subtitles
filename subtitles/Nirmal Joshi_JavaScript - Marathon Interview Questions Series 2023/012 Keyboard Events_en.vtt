00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.640
In this section I'm discussing about keyboard events.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.670
There are three related questions to this topic.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.950
So let's begin with keyboard events.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.120
There are three main events which are directly related to keyboard and they are key down key press and

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.750
key up.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.150
Of course, key press is a kind of event which is not used nowadays.

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.400
So you can consider only two main events of keyboard that is key down and key up.

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.260
If you are thinking that these are the events you should use with input boxes or input elements, then

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.510
the answer is no because there are many ways nowadays users can enter in a textbox or any other input

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.020
element.

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.960
For example, you right click and paste that is also input.

12
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.490
And there are other touchscreen devices who allow the user to send input.

13
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.459
So for proper input events, we have another section where we are going to discuss on change, on input

14
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:12.140
like events, but still to know most of the events and behavior, let's just discuss keyboard events

15
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.740
and of course in some cases it is useful as well.

16
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.910
So I have created a piece of code here where there is a division and some formatting is given to the

17
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.330
division.

18
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:32.120
Also I'm having one each where I am showing no events text by default and I have placed two text boxes

19
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.220
input one which is having two events configured that is on key up.

20
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.030
I'm calling the E handler and I'm passing the string card key up and on key down.

21
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.890
I'm passing a string key down.

22
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.720
Also the other input element has on key press event.

23
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.270
So I also configured that as well.

24
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.280
Very easy to understand.

25
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.460
So not typing the code, rather just explaining it.

26
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.760
So this is the output of the code.

27
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.180
Now the first textbox has two events configured that is on key up and on key down.

28
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.729
Let's say I press all the key.

29
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.700
So you see that the key down is executed.

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.090
And if I release the key, the key up is executed.

31
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.860
I pressed the alter key.

32
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.510
Let me press control key now.

33
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.770
So I'll say control and I will release this similarly.

34
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.230
Any key you press, there will be an event executed for both key up and key down.

35
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.730
You also must remember that when you press the key, it is the key down event and it has a property

36
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.840
called repeat.

37
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.310
In fact event dot.

38
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.640
Repeat is a property which is set to true when an event which is getting repeated, for example, when

39
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.960
I press the key down and if I do not release it, then it will repeat to generate the key down event

40
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.480
multiple times, and at the end it is going to generate the key up event like this.

41
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.510
So that is a repeat happening with key down.

42
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.830
This is the other textbox where I have configured the key press event.

43
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.260
So when you press the key, the moment the key is pressed down, this event is fire.

44
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.200
But as I mentioned in the beginning, this event is not used often these days because there are various

45
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.660
ways to deal with this kind of event.

46
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.820
Also, the key press event doesn't give you any key values.

47
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.110
So let me try that.

48
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.550
Let's try another piece of code now where I'm going to remove the key press and we will keep just the

49
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.040
on key down event in this piece of code I've just removed on key up and the second textbox as well.

50
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.720
And also I'm displaying the value of event DART code and event dart key properties.

51
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.530
Now these two properties are filled with some value when a key is released or pressed.

52
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.700
At the moment I'm configured on key down, so when I press the key down, I will get the code of the

53
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.100
key and the key value as well.

54
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.350
Let's try to run this and see what happens.

55
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.780
Here is the output.

56
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.420
Now let's see this.

57
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.200
I hold down the alter key.

58
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.100
What happens?

59
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.660
The code is all to the left and the key value that is event dot key is LTE.

60
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.200
Now let me also press the control key.

61
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.060
So it says that control left is the code and control is the key value.

62
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.670
Now, let me press a normal character.

63
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.970
I press E here with code.

64
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.750
It displays key e remember the key is capital.

65
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.900
So in case if you are checking the value with F condition, make sure that you consider key as a capital

66
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.320
letter.

67
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.440
Let me also try a numeric key.

68
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.370
Now you see it is digit one and here it is one.

69
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.100
So the key will be like this.

70
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.800
And the key code is this way.

71
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.930
Even if I press caps lock, then in both cases the value is same.

72
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.940
Let me try the shift key.

73
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.030
Now you see shift left and shift.

74
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.750
So these are the values you can use to further implement some program.

75
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.280
So when you have to try a combination of keys like under control and you put an end condition here,

76
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.970
you join it and you may try, let's say key, that means control is pressed.

77
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.080
Then you want to execute some piece of code.

78
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.580
You can try like this.

79
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.760
So these are the basic keyboard events.

80
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.900
As I mentioned, these are not the events which you are going to use to deal with input or input elements

81
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.700
like on change, on input and copy and various other events as well, which we will see in the forthcoming

82
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.360
sections.

83
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.870
Now let's discuss a few related questions of this topic.

84
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.270
The first question is how can you check if Control and Z is pressed or not?

85
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.460
So this is how you can check it.

86
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.660
You put any condition, you have the event or control key value.

87
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.310
If that is true and if the event code is key Z, then you write the statements.

88
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.430
The second question is what does event called return?

89
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.860
So it returns key like this.

90
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.450
For example, you press shift.

91
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.830
So it says shift, right?

92
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.550
Was pressed.

93
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.620
If you say A, it returns.

94
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.740
Key was pressed.

95
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.570
If I press number, then it will say digit four was press.

96
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.080
So the key code returns values like this.

97
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.040
And the third question is explain the difference between event DART code and event DART Key.

98
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.360
So we have already seen that God returns value in this way, whereas Key just gives you the actual value.

99
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.100
That is, if you press a the gold will return key, whereas key will return just the value that is a.
