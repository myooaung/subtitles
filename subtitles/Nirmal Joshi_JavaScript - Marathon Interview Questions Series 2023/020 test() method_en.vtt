00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.740
The next method.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.400
The very simple, easiest method is the test method.

3
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.460
This method tests for a match and returns.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.630
True or false?

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.400
The syntax is like this regular expression pattern dot test and we give a string.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.950
This string is a value in which you want the search to be performed.

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.440
The pattern is a pattern of regular expression That is something which you want to search.

8
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.200
And of course it returns true if match found otherwise returns false.

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.790
Let's try it practically.

10
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.810
I'll declare variable str with some string.

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.170
I'll say let pattern is equal to is that is something which I want to search and I'll say pattern or

12
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.910
test.

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.800
As you can see, that it returns true because the word is existing in the string.

14
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.910
Let's try one more example where it should return false.

15
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400
I'll replace is with now, which is not existing in the str variable.

16
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.510
Now if I run this, you can see that it returns false.

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.800
All right.

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.250
So this is all for the regular expression methods.
