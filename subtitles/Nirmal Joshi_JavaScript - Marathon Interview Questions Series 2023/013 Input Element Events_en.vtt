00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.600
In this doorman web category section, I'm discussing a very important topic related to input element

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.170
events.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.320
There will be five related questions to this topic.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.640
Whenever you make a web application or a page, you will always have different types of input elements

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.990
like textbox checkbox, radio button, button, etc. And because you have these elements, you also

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.140
have a fantastic range of events to deal with.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.189
User Input.

8
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.760
First, two such events I'm discussing are on focus and on blur events.

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.090
When an element receives focus or when cursor is placed on the element, the on focus event is fired.

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.580
For that particular element on blur is opposite to on focus.

11
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
That is, when an element loses the focus, the on Blur event is fired.

12
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.260
Let's check it practically.

13
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.470
I'm continuing with the same previous application where I have a division and that is an action where

14
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.150
I'm displaying the event status.

15
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.760
Now I have placed two text boxes here.

16
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
The first textbox has both the events configured.

17
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.730
The first event I return is on focus, but I'm calling the E handler function and passing the text on

18
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.330
focus.

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
The second event I configured with the same textbox is on Blur.

20
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.480
That means when I come out of the textbox, it should display on Blur in the H1 because the E handler

21
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.470
is called and there is a message passed and I am receiving the on blurred text in message and that I

22
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.000
am displaying in the edge one.

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.100
So let me just save this code quickly and go to the output.

24
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.690
Here is the output now.

25
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.510
Now when I click here, you see that on Focus is displayed.

26
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.980
Let me also try to come out of the textbooks and see what happens.

27
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.870
It says on Blur.

28
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.660
So when the cursor comes inside this text box, the on focus is fired.

29
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.560
And when it loses the focus, the on blood is fired.

30
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.010
Now comes the very important event, and that is the on change event and also on input event.

31
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.640
The On Change event is generally configured with dropdown list that is this select and option, but

32
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.960
it can be attached with the textbox checkbox and even radio buttons for text box.

33
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
The change event is fired when it loses the focus.

34
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.690
So then what is the difference between on Blur and on change?

35
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.650
That is a question that we will discuss once we configure the event.

36
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.140
So now let's try on change here.

37
00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.240
At the moment, I'm keeping on focus as it is, and instead of on Blur, I will just say on change.

38
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.550
And here also I will change the text.

39
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.260
I'll see on change.

40
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.320
Let's go to the output.

41
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.670
The moment I come in the text box, the on focus is fired.

42
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.610
Now, let me just type some text here and I come out of the text box.

43
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.100
So the on change is also fired.

44
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.890
So you might think that was the difference between on blur.

45
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.800
This is same as on blood, but that's not the case.

46
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.420
Let me show you that.

47
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.970
Also, I'm going back to the text box.

48
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.150
You see now it says on focus.

49
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.050
That's fine.

50
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.050
Now, I do not change the text here.

51
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.020
I do not make any changes to this text box.

52
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
And if I come out, you will observe that the on change is not fired.

53
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.380
If this was on blur, then it would have executed.

54
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.210
But right now, because I have written the code on on change that gets fired when the element loses

55
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.640
the focus, but provided that there is a change in the value.

56
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.340
So let me try to change the value.

57
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.740
Let's say cancel t and again I go out, then the on change is fired.

58
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.420
So the on blur also gets fired on losing the focus.

59
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.339
Same does the on change, but on change is fired when that is also some content changed in the element.

60
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.290
That is the major difference.

61
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.380
So that on change is also very useful for other elements as well.

62
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.810
Let me add a checkbox here.

63
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.320
Instead of this textbox, I'll just say checkbox.

64
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.210
Now what I want is I'm going to call the on change on the checkbox also.

65
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.190
And here again, I'm going to call the E handler.

66
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.420
Now I want to pass the value of the checkbox.

67
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.480
That is whether the checkbox is jagged or not.

68
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.010
How can I do that?

69
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.840
If you want to get the status of checkbox, that is, is it checked or not?

70
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.150
You can get that by using a check the property.

71
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.070
So what will I do?

72
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.180
I will say this.

73
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.940
That means it is going to refer the checkbox itself and that has the property card checked.

74
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.930
That means if the checkbox is checked, it will send through.

75
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.030
Otherwise it will send false.

76
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.980
Let me also add some text here.

77
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.930
I'll say check me.

78
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.980
Right and also put a break here.

79
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.890
So I'll say break.

80
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.150
So it comes on a new line.

81
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.520
Now I'll refresh.

82
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.140
Now see this click.

83
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.620
You see, the event is fire and it has passed the the value again click now it is false.

84
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.600
So every time I change the content is changed off checkbox.

85
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.310
So it does call it and then I'm passing the value of checkbox.

86
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.620
Now let's try the event with radio buttons.

87
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.350
Let's have two radio buttons.

88
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.770
I'll put a break tag and will have a radio button.

89
00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.160
So I'll say radio one and input type is equal to radio.

90
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.980
Let me also have a value property here.

91
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.320
Say Radio one.

92
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.780
Now I'm going to create group of it.

93
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:14.170
So I'll say name is equal to same because the next radio will also have the same group that is name

94
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.280
will be are only.

95
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.720
Now I see on change I'm going to call the E handler.

96
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.130
What I want is I want to pass the value of radio button that is it tagged or not, but which radio is

97
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.240
checked for that?

98
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.150
I will also pass this dot value.

99
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.090
I'll join it with a dash maybe.

100
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.390
And this dark check.

101
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.330
That means the status, whether it is checked or not.

102
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.140
Let me convert this into single quotes so that it doesn't give any issue.

103
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.190
All right.

104
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.710
And now I'm going to end this radio button.

105
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.490
I'll just copy and paste it.

106
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.430
And this I will name as radio two.

107
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.490
This name will be same because it's a common group.

108
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.920
And here I'll say Radio two.

109
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.360
Both have on change.

110
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.210
The value will be Radio one and Radio two.

111
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.180
Let's see and refresh.

112
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.920
Now, if I click on this, you see it says Radio One, and that is true.

113
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.470
Next is Radio two is true.

114
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.770
So on change event, that means the content is changed and that's the reason why it is getting fired.

115
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.630
This is a very common thing, but mainly the on change event is used extensively with dropdown list

116
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.460
that is the select and option.

117
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.300
So let me quickly use a selected option here.

118
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.030
I'll say break select on change.

119
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.130
I'm going to call the E handler.

120
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.140
Let me keep it as it is for the moment, because there is something else I want to discuss here.

121
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.420
Now I'm going to say option, which you already know how the options are created.

122
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.690
I said list item one and so on.

123
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.120
Let me also have a value here.

124
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.000
I'll say value is equal to one.

125
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.380
And this I will repeat at least four times.

126
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.530
I'll say list one, two, three, four, two, three, four.

127
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.640
And for each option, I'm going to give different values.

128
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.050
Two, three and four.

129
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.220
That's it.

130
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:25.330
Now, when a dropdown list is present in your page and when there is a change in the item, the on change

131
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:26.080
will handle it.

132
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.580
Let's say I just want to pass the value, so naturally I am going to set this dot value.

133
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.340
So for each option, the value is given and that value will be assigned.

134
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.970
Let me also give some CCS to this with input.

135
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.510
I have already given some input elements CSIS, so I will use the group selector and will write select

136
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.400
as well.

137
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.890
So the same access will be applied to select as well.

138
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:57.160
Also, let me increase the height of the division so that is a decent color for all the elements.

139
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.390
Let me refresh.

140
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.040
Here we have the list.

141
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.740
Now, if I click any of the list, you see the value is displayed.

142
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.820
You see this list for.

143
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.910
So the value is displayed.

144
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:19.180
Now, the question here is what if I want to get the value of this list itself instead of value property?

145
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:24.090
So whichever item is selected, I want the text of this lesser list to be selected.

146
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.430
Then I want list two here.

147
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:32.140
That is an options property which is available, which contains an array of all the items.

148
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.340
And there is also one more property called selected index.

149
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.140
So it is something like this.

150
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.710
So looking at the figure two, you can understand that internally.

151
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.410
Options is like this and each element can be referred using the selected index.

152
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.540
So what I can do, I can.

153
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:58.150
Instead of passing this stored value, I can see this dot options, which is actually an ADI and that

154
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.600
has the index number, which is the selected index.

155
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.200
And I want the text of that selected index.

156
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.710
Let me save this and refresh the page.

157
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.650
Now, if I click, you see the data is appearing as we are expecting.

158
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:24.870
Also, if I just move the cursor here, if the value is changing and the event is fired, I'm just using

159
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.740
the up and down arrow and you can see that the event is executed.

160
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.940
So that's how on change can be used with various elements.

161
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:40.170
There is also one more event which can be used for text boxes and that event is on input.

162
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.170
So let me quickly talk about that also.

163
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.360
I'm going to put one more text box here.

164
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.010
I'll say input type equals to text.

165
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.940
And on input we are going to have the E handler.

166
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.060
And I can pass the value here.

167
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:08.860
Whatever value one enters in the textbooks that we get it now on input is somewhat like a key price

168
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.980
or maybe key that is a keyboard and that means every character you press the on input is fired.

169
00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.900
Let me just go to the output.

170
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.070
Refresh the screen.

171
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.220
Here is the on input event.

172
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.040
You see this every time I type something, it gets fired.

173
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.300
So on input is a very commonly used event with textbooks.

174
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.030
If you are comparing it with key press or maybe key up, then that is again a major difference.

175
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:41.110
And the difference is that input here can be given by, let's say control v, that is, I am pasting

176
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.220
the content, right?

177
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.950
Or maybe I might use some voice input.

178
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.310
Right.

179
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:51.850
In all the cases, whether you paste it, whether somebody adds the data by speaking in all the ways

180
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:56.230
the on input is fired, whereas the key press will not fire in such cases.

181
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:02.080
So key press anyway is not used often these days, but keep this kind of event or maybe key down if

182
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.070
you are comparing it with an input that on every character changes.

183
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.080
And the major difference is that even when you right click and paste it, for example, again, I paste

184
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.980
it, then it gets fired every time I see paste or maybe it's a paste this way control we then also input

185
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.550
is fired.

186
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.890
This doesn't happen with the key press events.

187
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.610
Now let's discuss related questions of this topic.

188
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.100
The first question is what is the difference between on blah and on change event?

189
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.510
So the on blur gets fired on losing the focus.

190
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:42.430
Same does the on change, but on change is fired when that is also some content change in the element.

191
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.380
That is the major difference.

192
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.960
The second question is how will you handle events of checkbox and radio buttons?

193
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:57.220
Well, we have already seen that we can use the on change event for textbooks, for checkbox or even

194
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.860
radio buttons for CheckBox and radio buttons.

195
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.770
You can also use the click event as well.

196
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.540
So it depends on the type of event.

197
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.330
But yes, on change is one of the event which is generally used with checkbox and radio like elements.

198
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.210
The third question is differentiate on key press or on key up and on input even.

199
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:26.010
So as I just mentioned that when we use the on up, if somebody, let's say right click and paste the

200
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.540
content or maybe the audio that is device input is going to the text box.

201
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.780
In those cases, the on key upper key press will not be fired, whereas on input is a kind of event

202
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.670
which fires in all the cases.

203
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:44.340
When that is an input by any media weed control, we are maybe device input.

204
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.040
The fourth question is which event you prefer with the select that is the dropdown list.

205
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:57.680
So on change is one of the event which you can use often with the select that is the dropdown list.

206
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:06.860
The fifth question is how will you get the text value of selected item from a select element that is

207
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.880
a dropdown list?

208
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.130
So this was the code we tried.

209
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:17.630
That is we use the options A-D and we use the selected index to get the current value of the dropdown

210
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:17.990
list.
