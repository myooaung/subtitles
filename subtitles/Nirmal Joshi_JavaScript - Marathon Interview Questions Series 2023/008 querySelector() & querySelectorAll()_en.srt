1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,510
Now I'm discussing query selector enquiry selector all method.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,340
There will be three related questions to this dormant web category topic.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:17,680
The way we have get element methods which search elements using their I.D., name tag, etc. that is

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,300
also graffiti selector methods which search using the CSA selectors.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:29,020
There are two such methods commonly used and one must know as a JavaScript developer, and these two

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,080
methods are gratis selector and gratis selector.

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:40,990
All the query selector method returns the first element that matches a specified CSA selector inside

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,920
the method.

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,280
Given as an argument, it searches in the entire document instead of the first element.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,780
If you want all the elements, then you can use the query selector all method.

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,010
Let's see a practical example for both the methods.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm going to refer the same code which we have seen by learning the get element methods.

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,550
So this was the code where we have the division.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,100
I'm just going to remove this additional thing.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,720
We don't want it even this name.

16
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,650
Now we have one paragraph with Class A and Edge three as class A though there is no such class, but

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,700
that's fine at the moment.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,580
Now I'm declaring a variable called I'll say element and document or query selector.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:28,870
Now I want all the elements where the class name is a so I'm going to say dot e when you do this, it

20
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:35,200
is going to search in the end document and it will get the first element where this condition matches.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,890
So let's try to display the element only at the moment.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,390
I'll just save this and let's try what is the output?

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,390
So now you see that the enter element is return.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,200
And this paragraph, the one which is having the third value, is the first element which satisfies

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,920
this condition.

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,050
Now insert of this query selector.

27
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:02,740
If I simply give, all right, now, it doesn't matter whether I change the name or not, but let's

28
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,230
say elements even we keep element.

29
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,680
That's also fine, but we declare more meaningful variables.

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,690
Let's go back to the browser and just refresh and I click the button.

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,300
Now it has returned two elements.

32
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:24,220
Both are having the class A so we have beat out an edge three dot E So the query selector and selector

33
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,640
all both the methods are very useful when you have to search to document and find the elements on the

34
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,320
basis of CSS selector.

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:39,340
You can also use these pseudo classes, say for example, instead of dot e, you will have.

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,490
However, it means that all the elements which are having the pseudo class hover will be returning to

37
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,390
the elements.

38
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,410
Variable Graddy selector is also a very useful search method though all these DOM search methods are

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,930
less in use as Dom searching and DOM manipulation is very well handled nowadays by JavaScript frameworks

40
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,560
like React, JS, Angular or even Vue.js.

41
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:12,070
But still as a JavaScript developer, you should know what all methods you have to search through the

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,490
DOM.

43
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,120
Let's discuss the relative questions of this topic.

44
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,980
The first question is explain the difference between grade selector and query selector all.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,010
So we have already seen that the query selector returns the first matching value, whereas the query

46
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,890
selector all will return all the elements.

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,870
The second question is how can you search elements using pseudo classes?

48
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,610
So the query selector or query selector all both the methods you can use to search the elements through

49
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,260
pseudo classes like this one.

50
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,470
For example, you want that all the elements with whoever class, whoever pseudo class should be returned.

51
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,090
Then you can write this statement.

52
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,300
The third question is between get element by methods and gratis selector matters, which is better to

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,720
use.

54
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,760
Now, that's a tricky question, actually.

55
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,150
The reason is when you see that element by all the methods have like for example, get element by ID

56
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,140
is one of the most perfect method to search a specific element.

57
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,530
But when it comes to the class name or maybe selectors, then query selector matters are equally useful.

58
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,130
As long as the performance is concern, you will get better result with get element by it kind of method.

59
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,040
But as long as other get element by methods are concerned, they also loop through the same document

60
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,530
and the query selector also does the same thing when more differences query selector was introduced

61
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,590
at a later stage.

62
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,120
So Internet Explorer eight, that is IEEE eight and above will definitely work with query selector,

63
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,770
but below IEEE eight.

64
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,960
That is a problem while using it.

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,190
So you need to take care of this when you are using the query selector methods.
