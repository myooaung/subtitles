1
00:00:01,524 --> 00:00:03,633
Thank you very much for taking my course.

2
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:04,515
I, like you,

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,993
have been challenged over the years in how to best migrate

4
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:10,937
and transition to the Agile/Scrum world.

5
00:00:10,937 --> 00:00:13,540
I hope and trust that this course has been able to

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,276
provide you with the essential tools, methods,

7
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,058
approaches,

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,284
and renewed confidence to help you and your teammates to be more

9
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:22,680
successful in the Agile and Scrum world and,

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,529
in particular, with sprint planning.

11
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:27,633
Lastly, I hope to see you again at one of my other courses,

12
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:33,000
and I wish you the best in your professional journey, and never stop learning.
