1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:04,027
Backlogs are the fuel driving Agile projects forward.

2
00:00:04,027 --> 00:00:07,590
I want to impress on you that you need to ensure you

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,289
have a healthy backlog process,

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:13,045
which means having quality backlog items and a

5
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:14,865
quality backlog management process.

6
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:18,562
This course will provide you with what you need to know.

7
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,680
Now let's define the product backlog.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,117
In the simplest definition,

9
00:00:22,117 --> 00:00:25,428
a backlog is simply a list of all things that need to

10
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,492
be completed within the project.

11
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,172
It replaces the traditional project management

12
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:32,295
requirement specification documents.

13
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:36,301
These items can have a technical nature or can be user centric,

14
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:39,341
for example, in the form of user stories or epics.

15
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:44,263
It is a single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

16
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:47,043
The product owner is responsible for the product backlog,

17
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:51,454
including its content and ordering, that is its prioritizations.

18
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:54,377
Please note the backlog items will typically still

19
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,931
have a reference to a document, a wiki,

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,864
or something that would further clarify the business rules.

21
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:03,167
Agile still needs documentation,

22
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:07,425
albeit of a lighter weight and written over time and not all at the

23
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:11,276
beginning like in traditional Waterfall projects.

24
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:14,448
Okay, now let's talk further about backlogs.

25
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,062
To be clear, there is really just one backlog,

26
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:22,671
but at times, there are other monikers for different views of that backlog.

27
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:23,821
So we have the product backlog,

28
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,276
the total list of all product features we would like.

29
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:30,480
We may also have a release backlog.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,948
It's a partial list of the product features slated for

31
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:37,324
this release or a particular release.

32
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:39,015
And we have the sprint backlog,

33
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:44,571
partial list of the release features slated for this sprint or iteration.

34
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:48,915
There is always truly just one backlog per se, but it can be partitioned.

35
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:50,961
And also, they're not in concrete.

36
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,463
Backlog items can be moved, added, removed, as required.

37
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:57,634
More on that in the next module.

38
00:01:57,634 --> 00:02:01,334
Now let's look at where backlog items come from.

39
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,746
So how does a backlog get started in the first place?

40
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,475
Typically, there's a kickoff meeting,

41
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,517
which is the Agile project planning meeting,

42
00:02:07,517 --> 00:02:09,653
the participants or the product owner,

43
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:12,863
and possibly a sponsor or other key business person,

44
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:16,817
also the technical lead, and maybe another technical subject matter expert,

45
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,489
and the Scrum Master.

46
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:21,495
And if we are not in a Scrum shop, possibly a project manager.

47
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,431
There might be a few more people.

48
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,527
Some may be excited for the project, and also,

49
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,376
you might need to pull in a few more qualified people to get

50
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:31,026
everyone's viewpoint and expectations.

51
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:31,422
Of course,

52
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:34,133
the product owner shows up with the prioritized product

53
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,951
backlog and describes the top items to the team.

54
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,984
Not all items should be discussed,

55
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:43,374
but only the top most value-based items to help the

56
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,015
team get a good understanding.

57
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:48,155
Now let's see what an item in the backlog may look like.

58
00:02:48,155 --> 00:02:50,825
Though most items in the backlog will be items that

59
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:53,015
are software development tasks,

60
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,608
they really can be anything whatsoever that is required to

61
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,191
deliver the product for this Agile project.

62
00:02:58,191 --> 00:03:00,440
User stories and features.

63
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:00,963
By far,

64
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:04,416
the main way for a team to specify features on an Agile

65
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:07,513
product backlog is in the form of user stories,

66
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,554
which are short,

67
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,099
simple descriptions of the desired functionality told

68
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,150
from the perspective of the user.

69
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,412
We will go into detail about user stories in the next section of this module.

70
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:17,794
Bugs.

71
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:22,416
Because there's really no difference between a bug and a new feature in a sense,

72
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,244
each describes something different that a user wants.

73
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:29,139
Bugs can also be put on a product backlog.

74
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,102
Research.

75
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,780
There could be many research activities that requires you to

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,896
understand and/or help determine the product.

77
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:37,299
For example,

78
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,779
a research item may be determining the best cloud

79
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,718
platform and how to configure it.

80
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:45,771
The product owner was not likely the source of that backlog item,

81
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,653
but instead the development team.

82
00:03:47,653 --> 00:03:50,058
The product backlog may be mostly user- oriented

83
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,389
features written as user stories, of course,

84
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:54,295
but may also have other items.

85
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:54,939
Analysis items.

86
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:58,845
It may be that a feature really needs more analysis in order to

87
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:02,727
create quality user stories or even if some feature is worthy of

88
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,848
being in the backlog in the first place.

89
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:08,355
So there is nothing wrong with having analysis items.

90
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:12,361
An example of analysis related to knowledge acquisition could be a

91
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:16,049
backlog item about researching various JavaScript libraries for

92
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,310
the user experience such as Angular, React,

93
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,647
or Vue.

94
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:20,983
Environmental items.

95
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:24,046
There could be items that are required such as software licenses,

96
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,118
computers, office space, who knows.

97
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:30,794
An example would be to upgrade all developer's workstations to Windows 10.

98
00:04:30,794 --> 00:04:34,933
All this is still part of the overall backlog items that must

99
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:38,250
be in place for the success of the project.

100
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,048
There's no point in having another list that would not

101
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,803
be visible to the product owner.

102
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:45,345
Technical debt, which means your code base has,

103
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:47,967
well, less than perfect design and coding in it,

104
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:53,418
so you may need to shore that up a bit for the long-term quality of the project.

105
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,723
Now the life of a backlog may not be so perfect.

106
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,262
Let's see why.

107
00:04:58,262 --> 00:04:58,892
As you know,

108
00:04:58,892 --> 00:05:02,666
a product owner is a person from the business who typically represents

109
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,466
their business community and represents their needs.

110
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,916
As you'd imagine,

111
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,399
product owners come in all makes and models with various

112
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,887
backgrounds from purely business to highly technical.

113
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:18,720
Therefore, the nature and quality of the backlog may widely vary.

114
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,188
The items in the backlog may be unclear.

115
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,413
The English language can have a lot of ambiguity,

116
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:23,762
plus,

117
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:26,673
the team is learning about the domain and its

118
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:29,304
terminology for the first time possibly.

119
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:32,252
So discussions may ensue; all good.

120
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:34,535
They may have multiple styles.

121
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,099
Many times,

122
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,882
a product owner is gathering requirements from all over

123
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:39,615
their department or organization,

124
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,494
hence different people wrote different items

125
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:45,306
resulting in different writing styles.

126
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:50,074
It is the goal to refine those writing styles and try to standardize them.

127
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:53,682
We will discuss that in the next section of the module on user stories.

128
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:54,814
Very high level.

129
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,243
Sometimes the backlog item is at such a high level it

130
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,654
would require additional refinement.

131
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:01,491
Very low level.

132
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,258
And on the flipside of that,

133
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:07,360
some items can be way too detailed to be on the backlog.

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,284
Maybe they're more like a task in nature.

135
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:12,087
Product owner still learning.

136
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:15,511
The product owner may be learning not only about their business domain,

137
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:19,116
but also about backlogs, Agile, and other things,

138
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:24,268
so please give them the time and respect they need to come up to speed.

139
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:26,452
Prioritize based on need.

140
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,984
Now, need is interesting and can be tricky.

141
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:33,173
Initially, you might be presented with an item of high need,

142
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,308
and you believe it just is not that important.

143
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:38,820
For now, please just sit tight.

144
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,001
Don't presume you know everything.

145
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,504
Now you might be right, but give it time.

146
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:47,527
Listen, seek to understand, and show empathy for your product owner.

147
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,893
They don't need the new system for fun.

148
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:51,554
They have a business to run.

149
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:54,107
So it'll be up to you and your team to normalize them,

150
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:55,285
if you will,

151
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:58,135
the originally presented backlog into more

152
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:05,000
actionable material such as user stories. That is what we'll be doing in the next section.
