00:00:01.256 --> 00:00:03.479
This is the project release flow for a single release,

2
00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:07.100
and the Agile release is composed of the following:

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.009
It begins with release planning, followed by one or more iterations or sprints,

4
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.437
and ending with a release retrospective.

5
00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:18.423
So this is the entire release from end to end.

6
00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.187
The term sprint and iteration represent the same concept.

7
00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.730
Sprint is used in Scrum, and iteration is a general Agile term.

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.961
Now let's go into the next level, the agile sprint.

9
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.456
This is the project sprint flow for a single sprint,

10
00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:35.401
and it's composed of the following: It begins with sprint planning,

11
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.350
which is the focus of this course, followed by one or more daily work activities,

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.884
and ending with a sprint retrospective, demo,

13
00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.588
and review.

14
00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.426
So this is the entire agile sprint from end to end.

15
00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:51.225
Now let's go into the next level, the daily work.

16
00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:53.208
This is the agile daily work,

17
00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.969
and it's composed of the following: It begins with a daily standup,

18
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.204
followed by one or more daily work tasks and activities,

19
00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:04.074
and includes daily work progress updates and actions.

20
00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:11.000
So this is the daily work from end to end. Now let's see how all this fits together on a single slide.
