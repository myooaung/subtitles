00:00:00.887 --> 00:00:05.338
The sprint review is focused on improving the process that created the product,

2
00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:09.444
and only the development team attends, not the product owner.

3
00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:09.750
Now,

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.060
here are the topics or agenda items that should be

5
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.006
discussed in your sprint review.

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.829
Review velocity trends.

7
00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.250
How are we doing?

8
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.670
Is the velocity increasing?

9
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.653
Well, we hope so, but it could also be decreasing, sure.

10
00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:26.645
Either way, discuss why you think the trend is what it is.

11
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.593
Review committed verses completed features.

12
00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:30.388
In other words,

13
00:00:30.388 --> 00:00:34.078
review what your sprint goal was and how much of that was completed.

14
00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:34.681
Who knows?

15
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.679
You may even have finished even more than the original commitment amount.

16
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:40.379
If so, understand why.

17
00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.438
Always have a burnup or down charts available.

18
00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:45.624
In our example in the previous section,

19
00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:48.473
we missed our goal by about 12 story points.

20
00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:50.200
Review the build process.

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.661
Did the build process work for the team?

22
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:54.190
Any improvements to be made?

23
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.590
Also, tally and discuss the defects found and fixed.

24
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.113
Are the defects found normal and reasonable?

25
00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:01.828
Come to a consensus.

26
00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.970
Tally and discuss the defects remaining.

27
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.308
Is it an unusually large number?

28
00:01:06.308 --> 00:01:10.501
Understand why and what you can do to prevent it in the future.

29
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.014
Track metrics for process improvements.

30
00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.966
For example, if the defects remaining keep rising,

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.418
then maybe you need more automated testing or maybe even

32
00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:22.089
better regression testing as examples.

33
00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:27.992
Lastly, create a sprint review checklist that can easily be used for each review.

34
00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:32.101
Basically, the checklist will act as your agenda for the review meeting.

35
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:37.558
Take good notes, and apply your lessons learned in the very next sprint.

36
00:01:37.558 --> 00:01:38.973
Okay, let's face it,

37
00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:43.418
the customer is by far more interested in the demo than the review.

38
00:01:43.418 --> 00:01:48.349
Typically, they are focused on what was done and not so much on how you did it.

39
00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:51.049
The how is what the review is all about.

40
00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.156
Also, these items discussed are more quantitative.

41
00:01:54.156 --> 00:02:00.000
In the retrospective, they are more qualitative. Let's check that out.
