00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:03.629
Now let's talk about daily work and daily scrums.

2
00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.557
This is where the rubber really meets the road.

3
00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:08.355
Let's do a quick context check.

4
00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.437
Remember, after sprint planning,

5
00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:13.126
the daily work is what the team does in the sprint

6
00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:17.677
working towards the daily goals, which are all part of the sprint goals,

7
00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:20.432
such as user stories, coding, testing, etc.

8
00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:23.023
And at the end of the sprint, there is a demonstration,

9
00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.424
review, and retrospective.

10
00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:28.168
Okay, now let's get down to the daily nuts and bolts.

11
00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:29.887
So what is daily work?

12
00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.629
It is executing the sprint or iteration.

13
00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.792
It is the lowest level activity in the Agile/Scrum framework.

14
00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:40.958
Work is represented as tasks as identified and assigned in the sprint plan

15
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:44.464
using the SMART template we discussed in the last module.

16
00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:48.359
The development team creates technical tasks for each user story or across

17
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.570
user stories in order to meet the goals of the sprint.

18
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.699
The team members begin the work that they had chosen in sprint planning,

19
00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.572
such as user stories and technical tasks.

20
00:00:57.572 --> 00:00:59.389
If a team member has completed the assignments they

21
00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:00.976
have committed to in the sprint,

22
00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.715
then the team member may pull more sprint backlog user

23
00:01:04.715 --> 00:01:07.803
stories and/or tasks to work on that were originally

24
00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:09.891
assigned to someone else on the team.

25
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:12.154
Also, typically in sprint planning,

26
00:01:12.154 --> 00:01:16.257
the team will identify a few more user stories and tasks that are on deck,

27
00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:16.955
so to speak,

28
00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:19.343
and would be candidates to work on in the event

29
00:01:19.343 --> 00:01:21.300
someone did finish their work early,

30
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.380
or any other appropriate task for the sprint,

31
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.789
or lastly, from the next sprint's backlog.

32
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.411
The team is empowered to make whatever decisions are necessary to

33
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.170
complete its work in keeping with the sprint goal of delivering

34
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.758
working software by the end of the sprint.

35
00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:43.000
Now let's see how the team communicates its progress as they perform their daily work.
