00:00:01.154 --> 00:00:05.446
Now that we have covered a few other topics, I would like to revisit slack.

2
00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.198
You might consider scheduling no work on the last day

3
00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:10.060
or two of your sprint iteration.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.857
This could give you slack, but would be a bit wasteful if you have no issues,

5
00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:17.832
or you could pull forward a backlog item slated for the next sprint.

6
00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:18.162
In fact,

7
00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:21.373
it never hurts to have your eye on a couple of backlog items to

8
00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:24.116
pull forward in case you have some slack to fill.

9
00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:27.538
Schedule work in each sprint that is not time critical that could,

10
00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:29.990
in the event of an unforeseen issues,

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.760
be repurposed to act as slack to solve the problem.

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.043
What would these non-time critical items be?

13
00:00:36.043 --> 00:00:38.183
Well, reducing technical debt.

14
00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:41.457
So instead of doing that, you could work on the issues at hand,

15
00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:44.310
or they may be research or spike activities.

16
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.425
These are typically not critical,

17
00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:50.131
and that allocated time could be put towards your issues as well.

18
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.238
If you are all out of slack, the team may consider working some extra hours.

19
00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:56.005
I would be careful with this one.

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.007
If you burn people out, productivity that is, your velocity would go down.

21
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.465
But if the team votes to work a few more hours, well, let them.

22
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:08.781
But if they do do this too much, it might provide a false positive,

23
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:11.630
portraying a higher velocity than really exists,

24
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.443
and that's because the team will not always work

25
00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:16.079
those extra hours in the long run,

26
00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:22.000
and it'll appear as if your velocity is sagging because you're not working those extra hours.
