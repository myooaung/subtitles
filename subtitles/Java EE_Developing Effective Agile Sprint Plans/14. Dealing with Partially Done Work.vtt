00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:02.541
Now let's talk about how we deal with partially

2
00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:05.306
done work at the end of a sprint.

3
00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:07.958
At the end of a sprint, every story should be done.

4
00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:09.612
Certainly, that is our goal.

5
00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:12.884
Partially completed stories should be rare and for the

6
00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.778
reasons we discussed earlier in this course.

7
00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:18.586
But if you have partially completed stories, what do you do?

8
00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:19.768
Here are some options.

9
00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:24.138
Delete the code for unfinished stories, and deliver only what is done.

10
00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:26.749
Remember, timeboxing limits the project scope,

11
00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.336
but should not ever compromise quality.

12
00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:30.284
You might be deleting code,

13
00:00:30.284 --> 00:00:33.702
but you are not deleting what you learned since that will

14
00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.985
stay with the team for the next sprint.

15
00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:38.123
Don't let that partial code become technical debt.

16
00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:42.004
That will only cause more trouble downstream as we discussed.

17
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:42.401
Lastly,

18
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:45.910
maybe leave partial stories in the code base if you're going

19
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.897
to work on it in the very next sprint.

20
00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:51.159
I think that'll work, but if you are not sure when,

21
00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.160
if at all, you may work on it,

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.000
it is best to just remove the partially completed stories from the code base. That'll keep everything nice and clean.
