00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.932
Throughout this course, I will be referencing several roles.

2
00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.631
An Agile or Scrum team has a slightly different composition than a

3
00:00:07.631 --> 00:00:10.677
traditional project with three specific roles.

4
00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:14.276
The first is the product owner who is the person responsible

5
00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:17.081
for managing the business requirements.

6
00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.782
Those requirements are also known as the product backlog.

7
00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:23.320
We'll be going into greater detail of the backlog and

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.544
backlog planning in the next module.

9
00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:25.789
Nonetheless,

10
00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.084
the product owner has a very key and critical role

11
00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:33.496
of gathering the requirements, ordering or prioritizing the requirements,

12
00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:37.316
and ascertaining the value of each to the business.

13
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:39.605
Next is the development team.

14
00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.049
And because Agile/Scrum teams are cross- functional,

15
00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.111
a development team includes testers, designers,

16
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.568
OPs engineers, or any other skills or capabilities required,

17
00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:51.321
in addition to developers, of course.

18
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.025
And lastly, in the Scrum world,

19
00:00:53.025 --> 00:00:57.605
the Scrum Master role is added to facilitate the Scrum process itself.

20
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.308
This course will adhere to Agile practices and Scrum practices,

21
00:01:01.308 --> 00:01:04.935
which are very similar, but not necessarily identical.

22
00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.848
I have added here the role of technical lead.

23
00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:09.258
In so many companies today,

24
00:01:09.258 --> 00:01:13.081
this role is very common in the absence of the Scrum Master.

25
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:14.197
Now, to be clear,

26
00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:18.116
the technical lead role still performs the Scrum Master role in

27
00:01:18.116 --> 00:01:20.386
ensuring the Scrum practices are followed,

28
00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:23.759
but also provides some amount of team leadership and oversight.

29
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.001
Now let's add a little more detail and context on the next slide.

30
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:28.768
Here is some additional context.

31
00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:31.334
The product owner may represent a line of business,

32
00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:33.132
steering committee, department,

33
00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:36.467
or other segments of the user or customer communities.

34
00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:40.110
The product owner needs to express the items clearly so they are

35
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.370
understandable by the development team and prioritize them so the

36
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.647
development team knows what to do and what to work on next.

37
00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:51.489
Development teams are cross-functional, as mentioned,

38
00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:53.768
but working concurrently together.

39
00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:58.023
I wanted to emphasize this since in the traditional project model,

40
00:01:58.023 --> 00:02:00.867
typically code is developed, then tested,

41
00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.416
and then moved into pre-production environments as

42
00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:05.749
separate teams and/or processes.

43
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.522
This team is working together concurrently throughout the development process.

44
00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:12.780
Now in the Scrum world,

45
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.389
the Scrum Master is facilitating the adherence to the Scrum process,

46
00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.627
and the team is self-directed, that is, without a team leader.

47
00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:24.492
What I've seen so often in the absence though of the Scrum Master is a

48
00:02:24.492 --> 00:02:28.697
team leader or tech leader that still provides the Agile/Scrum process

49
00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:33.560
guidance along with critical team leadership.

50
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.200
Now for a point of view.

51
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.747
Here is my point of view: Perceived value of the Scrum Master role.

52
00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:42.516
I have observed in many organizations that proclaim

53
00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:45.022
to be using Agile/Scrum processes,

54
00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:49.414
but are not using Scrum Masters because they believe rightly

55
00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:53.440
or wrongly that they "do not do enough",

56
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.264
not my words.

57
00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:57.552
They may be using project leaders or managers,

58
00:02:57.552 --> 00:03:01.006
technical leaders or people with the title of Scrum Master,

59
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.010
but not following the official Scrum Master role.

60
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.920
I suggest to you that, well, this is fine.

61
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.079
Organizations need to adapt and be flexible to meet the needs of the business,

62
00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.449
budgets, and especially available skills.

63
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:16.380
By the way,

64
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.610
the migration from traditional development to Agile

65
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.685
development may take a couple of years,

66
00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:24.285
and I would rather an organization be moving that direction,

67
00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:26.224
albeit not perfectly.

68
00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:30.776
Repurposing project managers to Scrum Masters may also be an option.

69
00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:34.619
Another common observation in organizations that are migrating from

70
00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.285
traditional application development to Agile/Scrum development is

71
00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:43.106
the opportunity to retrain project managers or project leaders to

72
00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:44.945
fulfill the Scrum Master role.

73
00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:47.098
I like this approach a lot since their background in

74
00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:48.926
project management will come in quite handy.

75
00:03:48.926 --> 00:03:53.591
Is there a role for a technical leader instead of the Scrum Master?

76
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:54.730
I say yes.

77
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.164
And quite frankly, I prefer this approach,

78
00:03:57.164 --> 00:04:02.002
especially when you are embarking on the migration to Agile development.

79
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:04.430
Is the product owner up to the task?

80
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.357
Not all product owners have the skills to do what I

81
00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:09.757
described on the previous slide, and you,

82
00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.139
as the team lead or team member,

83
00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.495
must coach and guide the product owner to fulfill his or her role.

84
00:04:16.495 --> 00:04:17.659
In one case,

85
00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.878
I observed the IT organization pairing up a business

86
00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:22.758
analyst with each product owner.

87
00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.661
This was immensely successful in providing

88
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.947
high-quality requirements and backlog.

89
00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.465
This point of view illustrates that life may not be

90
00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:34.494
perfect in your organization, so set your expectations accordingly,

91
00:04:34.494 --> 00:04:41.000
and adapt and be flexible. Now let's examine the Agile project lifecycle in detail.
