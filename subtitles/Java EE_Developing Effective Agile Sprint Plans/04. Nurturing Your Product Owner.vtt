00:00:00.812 --> 00:00:03.804
Yes, I know you will be busy on the dev team,

2
00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:06.438
but do not neglect your product owner.

3
00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:09.404
They may need some tender loving care, and their role,

4
00:00:09.404 --> 00:00:11.477
to me, is the most important role.

5
00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.498
Let's face it.

6
00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:16.877
They are the customer, and you have no requirements or priorities without them.

7
00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:19.040
Now the product owner may say I am too busy.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.541
I just don't have the time.

9
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:22.531
Without their input, you're stuck.

10
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:26.968
Go meet with them face to face, and strategize on how you can help them.

11
00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:29.586
Gathering and aggregating requirements can be challenging,

12
00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:33.292
so product owners may not have the business analysis skills or

13
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:35.706
any additional staff to perform that function.

14
00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:37.671
In one scenario I was involved with,

15
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.268
the IT department provided analysts in the business units to help

16
00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:45.366
the product owners gather and document requirements and to help them

17
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.225
write user stories in a consistent way.

18
00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.537
Limited time to participate in planning.

19
00:00:50.537 --> 00:00:53.153
Remember, they need to be in the project planning meetings,

20
00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:55.796
release planning, and sprint planning activities,

21
00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:57.386
as well as demonstrations.

22
00:00:57.386 --> 00:01:00.633
They must be for the project to be a success.

23
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.615
The product owner role may be stressful and challenging for the product owners,

24
00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:07.071
especially regarding not just time management,

25
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:10.658
but also that they may be new to Agile and Scrum.

26
00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:11.202
Many times,

27
00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:16.136
they are still doing their normal job in addition to being the product owner.

28
00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:17.613
Partner with your product owner.

29
00:01:17.613 --> 00:01:19.832
Be available for any questions, problems,

30
00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:24.155
or issues they are having in doing their job as the product owner.

31
00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:27.873
Be well prepared to offer not only assistance to the product owner,

32
00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:30.906
but have your release and sprint planning activities well

33
00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:34.608
prepared to save them as much time as possible.

34
00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:38.107
Don't burden your product owner with any unnecessary work.

35
00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:41.494
After each demonstration, provide immediate feedback.

36
00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:43.328
So take notes, good notes,

37
00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:46.292
and provide all of the product owner's feedback back

38
00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:49.280
to the product owner and your team, of course,

39
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.000
after the meeting, in writing, with ideas and options as well. This saves them time and is very professional.
