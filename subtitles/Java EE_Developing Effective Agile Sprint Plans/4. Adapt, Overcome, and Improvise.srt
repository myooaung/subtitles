00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:06,966
Here is a great quote: "You adapt, you overcome, you improvise, let's move!

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,393
" by Clint Eastwood in the movie Heartbreak Ridge.

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:11,627
There are Agile and Scrum purists.

4
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:17,671
What I mean by a purist is someone who insists on absolute adherence to rules,

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:19,219
structure, or style.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,865
And that is fine if you would like to apply the Agile

7
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,254
and sprint principles in that way.

8
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:27,912
But life at the workplace is not so simple.

9
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:30,559
You have a confluence of people, budgets,

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,686
personalities, milestones, management, technology,

11
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:37,346
process, the lack of process, business drivers,

12
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:42,231
customers, and more all competing and vying to get things done.

13
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:45,453
I am suggesting to you for you, yourself,

14
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:50,621
to be agile, adapt, and overcome, and improvise as necessary.

15
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:54,244
What I am presenting in this course is the generally known and

16
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:57,018
accepted practices of agile and sprint planning,

17
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:00,665
but I am also giving you the okay, the validation,

18
00:01:00,665 --> 00:01:04,178
to make any adaptations to your Agile/Scrum activities that will

19
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:09,000
improve your product quality and delivery. Let's get started.
