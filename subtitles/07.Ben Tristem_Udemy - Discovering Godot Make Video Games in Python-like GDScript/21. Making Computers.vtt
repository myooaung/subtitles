00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
Hello again you remarkable ghetto people in this video.

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.690
We're going to make a computer.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.570
The computers are going to be used a little later on to allow the player to go up to a spot on a map

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.160
to click on them to get a combination for some of the locked doors on the level and to proceed.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.300
So they're gonna provide a really good gameplay element that sort of funnels the player has to get to

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.720
a little mini objective when not going to yet.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.180
Why are the computers to the combination generator.

8
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.120
We're just going to have them as a functional thing to plug in next time.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.500
What do we need to make a computer.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.430
Well to build a computer you will need one sprite an area 2D node and a monitor that pops up just like

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.880
real life.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.730
That's all the computers.

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.970
That's not what computers are but that's what they going to be in this game.

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
So that's what gonna make we're gonna make a simple little computer scene.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.790
Let's start with a brand new scene and only use 2D.

16
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.910
And when you call this computer.

17
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.490
OK.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.530
Our computer needs to look like something I'm going to use a sprite.

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.540
Now I could use a texture rect but texture rect as you can see here is green and inherits from control.

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.250
We need to be inherited from a no 2D.

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.590
I want to know 2D properties and it's only using a sprite.

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.370
So here's a sprite loop.

23
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.700
And let's given natural texture.

24
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:23.160
So if we open graphics PMG and what you've done in tiles I scroll down here's a big wide screen TV and

25
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.670
he uses tile 5 3 7 right here.

26
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.290
And I'm going to rotate it 90 degrees because our sprites all start facing that direction that feels

27
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.790
like a sensible thing to do something to rotate you by 90.

28
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.760
OK.

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
Now let's put an area city around the place where to click on this anywhere you have because enough

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.430
just like with our doors and our locked doors.

31
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.500
So brand new area study area 2D loop and an air actually needs a collision shape so let's give the collision

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.240
shape add in collision shape.

33
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.630
Judy Davis and she is going to be a rectangle.

34
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.850
Now I know that the tiles on this tile sheet were 64 by 64.

35
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.300
This is clearly not 64 and the expert is 64 on the Y.

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.580
However extents go from the center to the edge.

37
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.730
So I need to make this an extant size 32 on the Y.

38
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.140
So let's put that in except 32.

39
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.500
Clearly we want a slightly wider area than that because right now the player will have to be sending

40
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.990
in the computer to use it.

41
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.220
Let's give you an extent of think 48.

42
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.040
Yeah looks pretty good.

43
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
However right now this is part of the area and this is the area.

44
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.750
Let's move it.

45
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.970
I'm saying my area Judy and I'm going to go to transform and on the X I want to move it by.

46
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.840
Drag it what looks good.

47
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.210
60 64 look like she's 64 looks pretty good.

48
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.990
You have to figure this will be on a desk right.

49
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.210
So play is not going to stand there.

50
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.920
So if you're here that looks pretty.

51
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.310
Yeah I like that.

52
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.830
I use that.

53
00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.460
Okay.

54
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.760
So here is my actual area Judy.

55
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.120
We will weigh this up as a signal but we need a script to do it.

56
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.570
And right now there isn't a script.

57
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.930
Finally I want a little canvas layer for the pop up just like before a backup computer.

58
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.590
Brand new node on a canvas layer loop that's canvas modulate.

59
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.190
That's wrong.

60
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.990
I don't want that.

61
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.440
I want a canvas layer canvas layer Vega.

62
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.950
Okay canvas layer and as a child of this I want to put a brand new pop.

63
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.450
So brand new pop up that will come in here and show it right now.

64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.650
It do anything that will be our computer pop ups that computer pop up.

65
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.530
A brief pause while my cat decides that she wants to join in and she's calling my back Hello caboodle.

66
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.020
Okay back to work.

67
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.480
So we have this kind of pop up which will make in a second.

68
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.610
I do want to Warren's RTD before I forget.

69
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.810
So let's put in a computer script we'll call it computer.

70
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.150
Oh you know what we haven't save this let's save it save this indoors no doors and terrible places make

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.220
a brand new folder chemical that computer

72
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.800
save it in there.

73
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.450
And now we put the new script in.

74
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.590
It'll be in the right place.

75
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.160
So that looks good.

76
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.540
And here's a bright new script from here.

77
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.070
It knows the Eric Judy and to node and to connect to don't I.

78
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.590
I want the body entered a physical body and body exited.

79
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.220
Judy I'm going to connect that computer and then back over here.

80
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.040
Body exited I'm at a computer.

81
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.800
OK so those are now waiting for us.

82
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.490
We can save that.

83
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.470
That's looking pretty good.

84
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.380
All right.

85
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.690
Now let's make our computer pop up.

86
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.430
So I want a nice little pop up which will be its own scene.

87
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.280
But for now let's make it in here so I can see it.

88
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.970
I'm going to start with this nice box.

89
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.630
Now we use a mind patch rectangle before when we use one again.

90
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.410
And I was going to put nine patch Rectangle rect.

91
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.810
OK.

92
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.370
So what's a name patch rectangle going to have.

93
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.210
What's going to have a background of a computer.

94
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.280
So let's find a nice background.

95
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.640
We can't do this with metal plates.

96
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.310
Only back backup to as close tiles back up to interface on the graphics interface.

97
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:19.440
I've got PSG folder here scroll down to metal metal panel Yeah that feels pretty good.

98
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.450
Let's make our computer pop up have a rectangle of a minimum size of six hundred by four each.

99
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.380
I feel like that feels good for 80 not 180.

100
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.720
Yeah.

101
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.090
Pay attention is at a decent size.

102
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.650
That looks pretty good.

103
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.280
But I also want this my patch rectangle to fill it.

104
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.330
So that's in me a computer monitor.

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.310
Clearly right now that's not good enough.

106
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.580
In fact you know what I don't like that metal panel much let's have a different metal palaces metal

107
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.880
plate.

108
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.020
OK so back to nine patch and let's give a patch margin I'd say 10 pixels.

109
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.230
Good.

110
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.500
So ten ten ten ten.

111
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.980
OK.

112
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.360
That now looks a lot more like a computer.

113
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.080
However computer monitors have a little screen so let's give them those.

114
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.200
Let's give it a screen.

115
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.750
I'm going to give it a center container OK.

116
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.260
I want to put a little screen in the center here.

117
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:22.530
So let's give it a send a container underneath this line patch rectangles those a container and I'm

118
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.920
gonna make that full rectangle again and I should probably anchor that.

119
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.200
Let's anchor that to you know full rectangle anchor great.

120
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.210
And I want to give it such a good margin size about 20 pixels.

121
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.560
Yeah those pretty good 2020.

122
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.320
Doing what 20 or minus 20 on this side I want minus 20 on the right and minus 20 at the bottom.

123
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.350
Why minus 20.

124
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.720
Because I've got an anchor full rectangle so that's where it's taking its size from.

125
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.550
OK.

126
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.030
So underneath this center container let's put another nine patch rectangle.

127
00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.960
So nine patch rectangle and I won't use one of these glass panels.

128
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.400
I'm going to use just the standard glass panel.

129
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.550
OK.

130
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.970
You'll notice you can't see it.

131
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.680
Let's take a look why.

132
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.250
If I go to wrecked my size is zero.

133
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.610
OK.

134
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.640
That's no good.

135
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.270
I think a minimum size of five 60 on the X to full 40 on the Y why don't know those side sizes.

136
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.530
Trial and error to be honest I practiced this in the preproduction and that's the size that look good

137
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.030
looking good.

138
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.220
Not quite those nine patch margins don't work.

139
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.160
Let's give another 10 pixels in every direction and we should now have something that looks a bit like

140
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.940
a monitor.

141
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.600
We could have a slightly smaller patch about eight.

142
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.150
We haven't noticed that now.

143
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.590
OK.

144
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.330
So that's what it looks like.

145
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.370
So here is the beginnings of our monitor.

146
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.540
Now a few other things you can do.

147
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.120
I'm going to put in a texture rect.

148
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.830
Some are put in the texture act as a child of computer pop up

149
00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.710
and I'm going to position this at the bottom right.

150
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.570
And I'm going to give this a green dot we now have a power button.

151
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:14.830
Now I want to expand it's what fills the entire dot and all the change the size to 20 by 20.

152
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.190
And one more time that rectangle bottom right.

153
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.970
And we now have a power button.

154
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.020
And here is a lovely monitor.

155
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.940
I do feel like we want to move this slightly so I'm gonna give it a little bit.

156
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.220
You know what looks like this even smaller rectangle size so 10 by 10.

157
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.280
And I should move it by hand.

158
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.040
Now it's seconds position from the computer pop up or the cop computer pop up.

159
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.550
How do I not spot that rename my computer

160
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.920
without a capital P computer pop up.

161
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.410
Okay okay that's looking pretty good.

162
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.620
One more thing I want to add to this.

163
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.020
So as a child of 9 patch Rex 2 I want to be above that right.

164
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.260
So I'm going in order.

165
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:09.830
I'm going to make a brand new label so it's like a label write the word test and you'll notice immediately

166
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.540
we have a problem.

167
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.080
Right we have white on white.

168
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.850
So what I want to do is reuse the theme we've been doing the backups can be the pop up and go to theme

169
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.050
and oh no we haven't saved it.

170
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.970
I've had interface.

171
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.690
There's nothing here.

172
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.070
Let's go back and save it.

173
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:29.310
Let's go to level 1 and click on the locked door so open that scene openly number pad scene and we'll

174
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.530
go to theme which is already open.

175
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.540
Left click it and we go save where we'd like to save it.

176
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:42.120
I want to save it in this folder and interface and I'm going to call it theme dot tr.

177
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.710
Yes.

178
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.830
Okay.

179
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.430
So now I can close this scene.

180
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:52.370
And this one and I can load the theme in here so load interface think two areas and already we could

181
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.050
see a benefit.

182
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.330
So we have the right file.

183
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.940
Click on the theme and order add labels to it.

184
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.170
So go and it theme and class items dot dot dot.

185
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.760
And I'm going to go label and just add that.

186
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:08.690
OK.

187
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.870
So now if you want to give this a different fault.

188
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.040
More importantly though I want to change the color of this.

189
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.410
And we'll do this on this label.

190
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.060
I'm to custom colors and just change the font color to black.

191
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.450
OK.

192
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:26.450
Now I want this to be able to take as much space as possible so first I'm going to have to layout and

193
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.430
I'm in a full rectangle.

194
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.590
And let's make sure we're actually anchored to the full rectangles well that's going to margin and I

195
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.250
want 20 pixels from the left and the top negative 20 from the right.

196
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.910
Negative 20 from the bottom.

197
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.710
So our text is now sitting or situated within the glass which is situated within the monitor with little

198
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.980
green light that's in still slightly the wrong place.

199
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.060
You live here.

200
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.350
That's where you live.

201
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.770
OK.

202
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.530
Here is our computer.

203
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.390
We'll save that.

204
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.140
And let's make computer pop up its own scene.

205
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:02.480
So when a right click on it and save branch as seen it can live in computer it's called Computer pop

206
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.120
up and it is now it's unseen.

207
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.640
So let's just make sure Sona open that scene.

208
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.580
We have a pop up that I can bring up at it and save.

209
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.960
OK.

210
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:17.170
Now let's put in the basics of the script so to do that I want to add one more signal on area 2D.

211
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.700
I'm going to go to node and I want to be able to click it.

212
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.120
That's going to be an input event.

213
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.850
And I've just realized the problem for input events and connect that to computer.

214
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.940
So now we can do the click thing.

215
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.180
However let's go back to 2D and it's actually gonna be measuring on the area 2d sprite doesn't have

216
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.810
click.

217
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:41.020
So what I want to do is just move this back on the left some hold shift.

218
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.100
Just drag it over to about there.

219
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.580
So now that will include the computer.

220
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.880
It will also include this bits but I can live with that.

221
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.050
OK I'm going to hide you.

222
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.540
And let's write some basic functionality.

223
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.340
Let's start with our variables.

224
00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.170
Have an instance variable of can click which defaults is false.

225
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.180
That's probably we need at this stage isn't it.

226
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.620
So let's now make it work on area input events.

227
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:15.320
We did this before so if the input dot is mouse button pressed on and we want button left and very big

228
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.710
and can click

229
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.490
then I want to get the computer pop up.

230
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.060
So computer pop up dots pop up

231
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.450
centered

232
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.330
and that's about it.

233
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.400
So when we click on it if we can't click on it it'll show.

234
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.630
So let's put this in here.

235
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:51.630
So if you enter the area which one change can click equals true.

236
00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:01.650
And if you exit we want to can click equals false and we want to hide the pop up right.

237
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.890
So not just click off of that but if you move out.

238
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.470
Let's hide it.

239
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:12.690
So we want to pop up dots hide ok.

240
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.980
One more thing we should do before we go any further.

241
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.490
Let's go back to the charity.

242
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.800
Just checked the collision later and let's take a look.

243
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.290
We have we're not actually players.

244
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.450
We're not Tom ups when no pieces were left for.

245
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.090
So you know what I'm going to have to make a brand new layer for it.

246
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.820
That's fine.

247
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.810
And we can only interact with a player.

248
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:38.060
So it's got a project the project settings and scroll down to land aims to do physics and let's call

249
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.020
it computers.

250
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.770
Right now that's the only thing that exists in this lab.

251
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.090
That's fine.

252
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.620
Let's make sure is ranked with us.

253
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:50.380
Let's go to level 1 and let's open the play a scene and make sure that we get a collision layer.

254
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.400
Players can interact with Tom apps and pieces and computers.

255
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.310
Let's take a look make sure our area's good just gonna save that that's looking good.

256
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.220
So if you run into him press play.

257
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.030
There we go.

258
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.350
One more thing I do want make sure by the way I've just noticed.

259
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.060
Furniture.

260
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.580
If we get a collision we haven't set these so.

261
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.830
Furniture exists on a tile map and can interact with players and pieces.

262
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.100
OK.

263
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.360
So we want NPC is to be able to be stopped by furniture.

264
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.030
So let's just check that one more time.

265
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.780
That works great.

266
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.810
This door has a ridiculous combination.

267
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.120
And the gods will wander around.

268
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.640
So that is the this video.

269
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.440
So in this video we've gotten started this little computer and next video going to start wiring together.

270
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.510
So great work and I shall see on the next one.
