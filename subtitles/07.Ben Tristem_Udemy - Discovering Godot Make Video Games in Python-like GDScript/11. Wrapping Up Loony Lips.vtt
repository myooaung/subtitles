00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.310
HELLO AGAIN YOU WONDERFUL TO PEOPLE Yan here.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.230
Pretty sure you know who I am and I said Anyway I'm Yan.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.870
Hello.

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.000
I think we've met.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.110
Just want to take a moment to reflect on what we've accomplished so far.

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.020
We just a few lines of code.

7
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.200
Quite a small script.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.860
We can take player input change it somehow store the information and then do something with it.

9
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.200
Right.

10
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.090
That's pretty cool.

11
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.200
I mean that's the concept of most computer games and in fact with the stuff we know now methods signals

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.240
sending information to child nodes counting the amount of children under a certain node the idea that

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.930
we can store information in a node and export variables into the inspector arrays dictionaries constants

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.180
all kinds of stuff here.

15
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.960
Right.

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.660
With all these things we can already do quite impressive things.

17
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.190
Maybe we don't want to make lunar eclipse I've seen wants you to make a very into this game using the

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.640
same techniques but make Hangman.

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.000
OK.

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.910
Maybe we don't want to make a word game.

21
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.530
Cool.

22
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.690
We can now store inventory information for roleplaying game or have a dialog system that remembers the

23
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.860
player's name.

24
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.050
Right.

25
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.400
We can do all kinds of really cool stuff already.

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.450
But next we're going to step it up a notch.

27
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
I think it's time to bring in some actual graphics and a 2D environment and get some gameplay going.

28
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.080
So our next section hoppy days.

29
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080
Let's make a game with a cute bunny.

30
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.420
Really looking for it.

31
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.300
I'll see you the next video.
