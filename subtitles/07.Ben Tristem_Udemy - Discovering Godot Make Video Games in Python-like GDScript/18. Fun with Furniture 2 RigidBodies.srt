1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,930
Hello again.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,040
God the people of pure liquid awesomeness because I wanted to use a different greeting but it ended

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,350
up being mostly the same.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,180
We're going to continue with fun with furniture in this video to make rigid bodies the ones are going

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,310
to be affected by physics before we start.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,850
A couple of quick reminders.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,940
One remember that the origin is the centre of gravity so the origin of the rigid body is what we really

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,140
care about in terms of how is this body going to behave.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,000
Don't be afraid to tweak values if your desk is moving too fast or too slow.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,990
You can tweak the speed of your projectile linkage.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,860
You can tweak the weight of it and you could tweak the weight of the actual rigid body.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,850
Let's get into it and take a look back and aren't models and our furniture we have all of these different

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,480
things we can use.

14
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,070
And you are under no obligation to use all of them but there are some fun ones here by both Kenyan attorneys

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,650
that I thought might be fun.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,940
So feel free to use them.

17
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm going to start with a simple tiny one I want to put a little radio up here so make a new scene.

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,740
And let's make a start.

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,100
With a rigid body.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,290
Right.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,700
And the reason I'm going to do this this way is actually not do the other way and show you why.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,500
If I go into the level that seems to bring in a mesh I would bring in my radio was not really a coffee

23
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,070
machine.

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,130
What I am seeing right here.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,400
Here's a coffee machine.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,050
And I'm going to just move it down to the actual surface.

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,660
Now it's currently way too big.

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,770
We know that I'm going to scale it down to zero point five.

29
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,220
Now I want to turn this into an actual rigid body as a couple things I could do.

30
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,530
I could just give it a sibling.

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,650
But that's just going to put two things at the same level.

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,750
I could also give it a static body but I don't want to be a static body but let's say I give it a convex

33
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,130
static body which is fine.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,250
And I decide I'm going to change this from static body to a rigid body which I can absolutely do is

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,700
now a rigid body.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,710
The origin is here and I need the origin in the centre.

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,200
Actually with this coffee machine it probably won't matter too much because it's quite plonked down

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,910
and let's say I want it you know down the centre.

39
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,460
Actually it's move this off a bit so it's outside the counter.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,660
Great.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,170
If I want to move that I'd have to move the static body and the static body has the collision shape

42
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,190
and that's going to cause me all kinds of problems.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,000
Do I move it like so.

44
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,900
And then just move the colours shake back.

45
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,000
Which is doable but is kind of a pain.

46
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,330
So instead I'm going to use the static body as the parent and add the mesh in.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,990
So let's do that.

48
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,910
I've got my my rigid body right here not static body rigid body call coffee machine

49
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:52,870
and my coffee machine is going to have mesh and you can drop that in there and scale it down so transform

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,140
zero point five zero point five zero point five.

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,270
It is awesome.

52
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,750
And let's add in the collisions so I'm going to give you a sibling This time a convex sibling and that's

53
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,840
too big once again so you can scale that down.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,450
I know.

55
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,290
Don't scale them.

56
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,110
But unfortunately this is my only choice right now unless I want to give it just a capsule or a sphere

57
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,090
which I don't.

58
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,980
And now I can move them meche instance and the collision shape but to move them rough and ready and

59
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,650
then type in the numbers to get them much more centred so take that off.

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,840
So you are what's zero point five.

61
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,150
That makes sense.

62
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,610
OK.

63
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,920
So on the exar point to Fife.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,440
Oh that's scale.

65
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,570
No don't go.

66
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:47,440
So translate mazunte point to five minus zero point five.

67
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,210
And I'm guessing on the Y minus zero point two five.

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,440
And there is my coffee machine at my coffee machine.

69
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,510
It's looking pretty good.

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,530
And the centre of gravity is right in the centre of it which is where I want to save this as a scene.

71
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,840
We go into furniture and make a new folder called rigid body just to make it as organized that can save

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,830
the coffee machine and instance one in so under furniture let's make a new organizing note.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm going to call this rigid bodies.

74
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,810
And incense in my coffee machine motto and drink my coffee one second.

75
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,820
See I've got this cup of coffee next to me and I keep saying coffee machine and it makes me want to

76
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,330
drink the coffee.

77
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,710
So I did apologize for that.

78
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,350
Are edit out the sound of me actually drinking.

79
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,300
What was I doing.

80
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,240
I can't remember.

81
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,980
There's going to furniture and rigid body and bring in a coffee machine and pretend that that's what

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,340
I was doing going to do some scootching so scooched the coffee machine.

83
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,180
And I don't think it needs to be at 40.

84
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:58,580
Whoops that's just rotate you doesn't actually flush because it's a rigid body it's not for it's not

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,150
part of the walls or the furniture.

86
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,150
Was going to put it over here.

87
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's see how that looks.

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,830
Back in the game and I'm not going to toggle full screen.

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,080
And the reason why is occasionally Gado can Tasia which is I'm using to record an end video.

90
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,850
Don't like talking to each other and sometimes I hit toggle fullscreen it will record and sometimes

91
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,480
it won't.

92
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,290
I'm going to use this button and there's my coffee machine and it flies and that's really satisfying

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,020
and I kick it.

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,110
Yes I can.

95
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,520
Can I Kick It.

96
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,190
Yes I can.

97
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:39,380
If you are not of Generation X if you're a Millennial or baby boomer you might not recognize that song.

98
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,130
I can't help you with that but there is my first piece of furniture.

99
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,410
Okay there's only so many of those I need to use.

100
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,620
I mean I could put in a microwave.

101
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,930
But let's go with something a bit more interesting.

102
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,540
I'm thinking a table and some chairs so we pick a nice table as an ice table but there's coffee table

103
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,740
and quite like the look of that.

104
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:02,420
There's big table and I've got the small table I think small tables one of what stocktwits here's my

105
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,740
small table.

106
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,430
It's not going to be a child of coffee machines could put it here.

107
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,180
I was taking a look to make sure that the scales go makes sense so I think it should be zero point seven

108
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,730
five.

109
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes it should.

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,230
OK so here is my zero point seventy five table it's actually a little bit high.

111
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,830
Still that's where it should be awesome.

112
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,700
I mean to use that small table and I will pick some chairs to some basic dining chairs.

113
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,890
I could mix and match between them but I'm happy with that.

114
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,620
However this isn't where that lives.

115
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,090
Let's delete this one.

116
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,160
That was just me checking it's going to fit.

117
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:48,930
And let's make a new Richard what he called table which I call a small table.

118
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:57,230
Call it a small table that's keep to the same name the files and you get a mesh instance and you get

119
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:04,130
a mesh instance every everybody sari goes there and scale that down to zero point seventy five on all

120
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:10,850
three axis and this is going to need a coalition shape.

121
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:19,010
Now I think I'm going to go with a trimester for this and the reason why is if this is upside down I

122
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,920
want to able to run through the legs and let the food go through the legs.

123
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,090
If it doesn't it's going to break the illusion some leaves a trimester but I can't see the tremor.

124
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,200
So I'm just going to have to assume that zero point seventy five or work it should do.

125
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,860
I can't see why it wouldn't.

126
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,100
And now let's make sure that they are all actually that's perfect isn't it that's where their origins

127
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,260
should be some so save that as my small table was going to bring a chair.

128
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:51,410
Let's just bring in one chef and how close those scenes Brando saying and do the same thing again so

129
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,640
rigid body.

130
00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:02,220
This one's going to be called a chair and another mesh instance of a chair and the exact same thing.

131
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,090
Scale it

132
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,700
add a trimester.

133
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,340
Collision sibling and scale that

134
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,580
centre of gravity is good.

135
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,630
I like that.

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Save that and I can add those into my scene so let's just see how they look.

137
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm going to start.

138
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,820
Are you not rigid body is going to get another child note and that's be for tables and chairs.

139
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,940
Can you make this as organized as I can so let's instance in a single small table.

140
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,290
And it doesn't matter if it's not fully on the ground because gravity will work.

141
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,450
But.

142
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,240
It is nice to get it as close as I can.

143
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,350
So let's put it right there.

144
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,630
It probably shouldn't be in the doorway should it.

145
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,870
Because of reasons it doesn't make sense to block a doorway like that especially not with the by settlers

146
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,260
coming through.

147
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,580
So let's stick with that and start adding some chairs.

148
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,250
So chair.

149
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,790
And you should probably be somewhere like that.

150
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,420
How's that look.

151
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,450
That looks pretty good.

152
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:22,880
A duplicate a chair and I don't need these.

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,330
On the grid or exactly at 90 degrees because they look more real as if they're not this do this church

154
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:35,020
again rotate it's by roughly that much and zoom it over here.

155
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,380
I'm not going to pull a chair here because I want to know what a light and a chair it

156
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,760
rotates it's Press.

157
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,790
If I rotate not ah.

158
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,350
And how do you look.

159
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,730
You are actually clipping into the other chair you how's that.

160
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,770
Still clipping a cut clip through the furniture on it.

161
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,340
We had objects being thrown up into the air.

162
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,150
Yeah that looks good.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,500
OK.

164
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,630
Start again.

165
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,720
They need to be a lot heavier don't they.

166
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,010
So let's make them heavier.

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:12,610
OK.

168
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,060
Table.

169
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,060
What's your mass.

170
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,410
Pretty small.

171
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,950
OK.

172
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,220
Now as far as I remember those are in kilograms 1 kilograms like a bag of sugar.

173
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,500
So let's go with 10 kilograms as heavy table and shares.

174
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,820
You know I'm going to play with this and see what happens.

175
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,400
I feel like the chair should be roughly the same weight.

176
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,470
Because reasons.

177
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,860
See how that works.

178
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,070
Okay so they now react.

179
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,890
But they're much heavier and I can keep tweaking.

180
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,840
I was right.

181
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah that's looking really good.

182
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,680
I could also make the food less I'm what I'm looking for.

183
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,050
Let's fast.

184
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
I can make the food slower.

185
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,720
That's the word.

186
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,530
And I could make it lighter but that's a good start.

187
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,010
So I have those tables and chairs and you know what let's put in one more object.

188
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,100
How about this nice potted plant.

189
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,580
One of these potted plants I think this potted plant looks good.

190
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,730
So just go through the entire thing one more time.

191
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:18,360
Rigid body with a mesh instance which is a small potted plant which is going to be even smaller not

192
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,610
material transformed there is zero point seven five actually on this one it probably doesn't matter

193
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,080
too much.

194
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,430
But I'm just going to keep it the same.

195
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:38,410
And that one does get a convex mesh I think which will be the same size because otherwise makes no sense.

196
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,960
And finally I now need to move these to the centre of the origin.

197
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,900
Why is the behaviour that looks.

198
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,080
Pretty good.

199
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,140
Let's call you plant small

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,210
that I nailed that right.

201
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,550
No he didn't.

202
00:11:59,690 --> 00:11:59,900
OK.

203
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,730
Plant small save that scene and let's bring in a small plant.

204
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,880
Apparently I have.

205
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,940
I didn't think I did.

206
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,850
I don't have snap on that.

207
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,190
No it was snapping.

208
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,620
How do you look.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,390
You look amazing.

210
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,130
Awesome.

211
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,770
Now those chairs might be a little bit heavy now so I'm just going to make them a bit lighter.

212
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,260
How do you feel about 7.

213
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,090
And that's looking great.

214
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,450
Now Amma's which can sleep off and would do that for that table as well.

215
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,910
And I'm going to do that for the plant as well.

216
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,510
Say all three of those.

217
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:50,170
Now I could switch on continuous contact detection which is great for fast moving objects.

218
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm actually gonna put that on.

219
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,640
It might slow the game down so if your game starts chugging quite slowly once you do this you can switch

220
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,260
it off.

221
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,020
But our project does a very fast so let's see how that works.

222
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,220
Just make sure that haven't broken anything.

223
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,600
Make the screen bigger.

224
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,160
Yes looking pretty awesome isn't it.

225
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,110
I also notice I have a habit of looking down when I'm playing these games before I hand this over one

226
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,980
more trick I want to give you.

227
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,520
In fact I don't know what came out of the game.

228
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,720
Let's go back into the game.

229
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,210
One more trick I want to give you.

230
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,570
And that's I kind of want to see through this wall.

231
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,840
Now currently there isn't an easy way to stop the camera going through the wall.

232
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,510
There is a node we can use in three point one but I'm not using throughput one.

233
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,380
So instead I'm going to change the wall.

234
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:46,680
Let's pick any one of these was doesn't really matter which one I pick and enter that scene because

235
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,070
I'm picking this dark colour as my front and as white as my rear.

236
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,320
All I need to do is change this material.

237
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,590
So let's open the mesh.

238
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,830
Doesn't matter which mesh and find this surface.

239
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,410
And when I click on it and across the top of the flags and switch on Transparent.

240
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,760
Now this material is transparent and want to go to albedo.

241
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,800
If I switch the Alpher down to I don't know how about 100.

242
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,050
It sounds like a good number.

243
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,890
When I save this material that might save the scene and go back in.

244
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,150
You'll notice

245
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,730
that the white of the walls is now semitransparent.

246
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,490
So let's see how that plays.

247
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,190
It's nice and big.

248
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,670
And now I don't lose track of what's happening and I can actually see them looking through the wall.

249
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,800
It's not perfect but it's pretty good for now.

250
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,310
All right.

251
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,580
Which brings me to the challenge.

252
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,380
I think he can probably see where this is going.

253
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,320
I'd like you to fabricate some fabulous furniture create some rigid body scenes.

254
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,110
Add them to your level share them with the community add as many or as few as you like.

255
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,670
Okay now you do need enough room to wander around and remember if you block off the path of the bystanders

256
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,350
they're going to just bump into it but have fun with it.

257
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,610
Enjoy it.

258
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,500
Other great synonyms for you know.

259
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,360
Have a good time.

260
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,780
Pause the video create a level when you come back I'll show you my level.

261
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,720
And welcome back.

262
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,810
Okay so here's my current level now it's a little bit crowded.

263
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,940
I might have put a few more for you too many tables.

264
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,390
In fact let's move some of these Making sure I've got my select all.

265
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:36,130
I'm going to select this chair hopes to try again this chair this table and this chair come up.

266
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,740
Just move them over here.

267
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,340
Did you get figure at this can go over there as well.

268
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,740
And a couple of plants in a big plant shut up go out a foot a bigger plant over here which of hilariously

269
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,580
called bigger plants small.

270
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,790
Well I called it plant small too.

271
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,570
That's what I call it.

272
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,610
But that's looking pretty solid.

273
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,490
I think we're getting close to there.

274
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,050
Not sure this chair wants to be here you know what am I might just give myself a bit more space on the

275
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,530
what axis is that x.

276
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,480
Yeah that's Z.

277
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,470
That's X but that's.

278
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,910
In glorious large screen is pretty cool.

279
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,780
And I could if I wanted to fire was this plant just make it top of it.

280
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,890
I got a coffee machine that can bite the bullet for us by coffee machine.

281
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,200
Yeah we're looking pretty solid.

282
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,620
And just before I finish I've realized that I got a Reece's everything wrong so I've just changed the

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,190
chairs.

284
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,150
But I didn't mean zero point seven five I meant zero point five.

285
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm not quite sure how I managed to get that quite wrong but that's okay I can change these mesh instance

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,790
zero point five

287
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,470
and I will do the same with the collision shapes.

288
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,130
I'm going to do that really quickly for all of these scenes I've opened so plant small you could name

289
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,720
one transformer on the mesh instance to zero point five.

290
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,340
And again with the collision shape.

291
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,040
Save that when a seal doesn't need changing the plant small does.

292
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,340
And it came with a collision shape

293
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,370
and now we're back into my level.

294
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,590
That's looking a lot less terribly crowded.

295
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,310
Let's take a look at how it works.

296
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,030
Much better than other plants did fall down quite comically and things are flying way fast right now.

297
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,730
But I quite like that these tables is small.

298
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,010
I know I like that.

299
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,700
I might do as low off the firing forward on the character later but that can't happen later.

300
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,770
So that brings us to the end of this video.

301
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,330
In this video the old looked at working with rigid body objects.

302
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,100
And with that as a slight transparency to material transparency no transparency to material which is

303
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,950
allowing the camera to see through it.

304
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,680
So don't forget to show your progress how your levels are looking.

305
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:21,450
And if we want to add a lot more levels to this game and excellent work.

306
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,070
And I'll see you in the next video.
