00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.600
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.680
Marvellous God it is.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.220
Let's continue play customization in this video going to create a gooey that's going to switch between

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.440
characters and cycle through materials.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.980
So let's just remind ourselves what a play a customization screen will look like in a food fight.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.230
Well we want to cycle through the textures and that word is important.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.400
If I've got 10 textures and I want texture 10 and I go for texture I need to go to texture one we can

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.620
grab all these textures with firetrap but we already know how to do that.

9
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.300
That's all done.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.350
In fact I've got a folder of play attractions and if you wanted to you could make more play textures

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.440
by opening a texture follow with GIMP or Photoshop or any graphics manipulation package and go crazy

12
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
players in a select player characters from a list at the moment we have to they get pick.

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.350
So they're not going have to cycle through those.

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.290
This is Give me a drop down list that can pick.

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.940
OK.

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.960
Let's get to it.

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.110
I won't get into my scenes into customisation and open character customization and I know I've been

18
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.400
playing a lot with this camera.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440
I think I want this podium to be more important than it is.

20
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.960
I kind of feel like the goalie should be down here.

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.420
So let's just move a little bit slowly transform.

22
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.990
And now you know what I do this manually.

23
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.300
I see this manually.

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
Let's move you to here.

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.770
How's that look.

26
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.510
Dramatic.

27
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.250
A little lower.

28
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.780
Now I see this is it.

29
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.350
This is the position I'm picking it.

30
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460
I'm not moving anymore.

31
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850
If you're curious what that is.

32
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.180
I'm at zero point six five on the Y and two point seven on the set.

33
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.450
Okay.

34
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.230
So the first thing I need to do here is make a gooey and I'm gonna make probably a brand new season

35
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.510
let's make a brand new song.

36
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.070
And I make it a canvas lair as my root.

37
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.510
And I'm going to call this customization UI.

38
00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.780
I want everything right here something to start with a box container and let's put you for the moment.

39
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.630
Anki you full screen but I'm in a position you at centre bottom and let's move you up a bit.

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.450
So margin from the bottom is going to be 100 pixels negative 1 pixels.

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.100
So I struggle to get 100 pixels and just size you like that.

42
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.480
Great.

43
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.450
Let's call you controls.

44
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.250
And I feel like it should have a background.

45
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.920
So let's give it a collar.

46
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.110
The collar rectangle I make this fall right.

47
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.640
And I think a nice black gooey will look good.

48
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.570
I could tweak that later.

49
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.960
Let's look and find for out again.

50
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.330
I want to be able to pick between the different characters on who do is going to create a new control.

51
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.550
I think would do an option button and option button as you can see is a light mosle dropdown.

52
00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.850
Why don't we start with free hours a good name and this isn't exactly part of the theme business versus

53
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.980
load that theme in so into my themes and load it and I've put it in scenes.

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.060
There it is.

55
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.470
And already she's got herself up his text.

56
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.760
Okay.

57
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.900
Let's make this reebok's container put everything in the centre.

58
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:28.620
And I was going to need size business out about that for now I just reposition that so bottom centre.

59
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.960
Centre bottom there it is.

60
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.700
And I call this character select.

61
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.130
And right now it has no options.

62
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.410
Let's go to some items.

63
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.000
Item zero text phraya and an I.D. of 0.

64
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.790
And let's add item 1 which is going to have an I.D. of one and it's going be called Frey kind of feeney's

65
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.470
Nor Scott right now.

66
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.760
It might be a little hard to see these colours but I'm okay with it.

67
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.150
Now we can change those later.

68
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.250
All right underneath there's a wooden box container with a button label and a button start with a text

69
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.580
a button.

70
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.790
I like texture buttons.

71
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.440
They're pretty OK.

72
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:19.530
And for this I need to go into gooey graphics and let's pick this blue slider button it's my texture.

73
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.810
Let's called this left button and let's put in a label.

74
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.720
That's right.

75
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.470
Customize your look.

76
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.530
And I should keep my capitalization good.

77
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.340
Okay.

78
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.140
And one more buttons will give me another texture button.

79
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.900
And that will be the right one.

80
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.080
The textures come here.

81
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.590
They're great.

82
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.670
And you see that this item this has already expanded so we're now getting to the point where this isn't

83
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.620
good size.

84
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.390
What I would like to do is add a bit more detail here so I need a hover ledwich which going to be this

85
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.310
green one.

86
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.070
Actually no.

87
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.820
The hoffer's Remain bulloo.

88
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.120
Let's put the Prest as the green light that looks better and the same with the left.

89
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.080
Why you're a texture act.

90
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.050
I didn't mean texture.

91
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.050
I meant texture but then let's try that again.

92
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.110
One more time.

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:29.520
Okay so left is on normal and on hover let's just see how that looks.

94
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.810
Yes I want to save this scene's customization customization you I.

95
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.410
Great.

96
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.730
I've got that on hover by mistake.

97
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.330
But these can be picked.

98
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.100
That's looking decent again.

99
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.070
So let's just make sure that that's on press not hover.

100
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.570
OK.

101
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.920
So with a clear hover.

102
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.400
And put that on Prest much more like it.

103
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.480
Okay let's fix this thing.

104
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.250
I'm not really feeling that thing with better control saying go to my thien and I'm going to go in to

105
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.770
class item see option button where you option but only option button you should not look like clutz

106
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.770
buttons so let's look at styles.

107
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.410
I'm going to do a new new style box flat that we can click on that a..

108
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.840
Give this a better look.

109
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.940
A background colour.

110
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.200
I'm going to give this a nice.

111
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.890
Black again.

112
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.520
Let's just pick a nice grey.

113
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.170
And you know what I should do.

114
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.950
Oh I just had a really good idea of this life.

115
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.350
Okay.

116
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.860
Okay.

117
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.910
We're at level let's find a pop up menu.

118
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.780
So where did you go pop up a pop up to do paus menu.

119
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.740
They are open that scene that show the pop up.

120
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.780
And that's because this colour rectangle and I click on the colour and let's add this colour to our

121
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.190
favourites put it there.

122
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.360
Now I want to go into this scene and open a Starbucks flat.

123
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.330
I go to the colour I should build it just click this.

124
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.830
And that's looking much better.

125
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.630
Great.

126
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.320
OK.

127
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.850
So I've got my normal press.

128
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:17.670
I do the exact same thing that's going to copy and paste it so let's copy paste it and paste it on hover

129
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.970
as well.

130
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.480
I want this to look just like that.

131
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.070
Let's run this seems Catholics.

132
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.450
Yes.

133
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.220
Looking a little bit better isn't it Now.

134
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.230
Right now it is too far down it's not centred but we will fix that last.

135
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.970
We've got everything else going.

136
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:38.080
I have also noticed that I need to move the texel on some and align that to the centre and that will

137
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.850
be fine.

138
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.880
Awesome.

139
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.830
Finally I need some sort of begin button.

140
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.610
I guess I've got these box containers.

141
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.140
Now I need another box container.

142
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.880
Each box container a number do.

143
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.570
And it's going to have a label and then a standard button.

144
00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:07.130
And as soon as they begin and let's align you to the right and you are going to have a button and it

145
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:12.320
should just be a standard buttonless give you a standard size m. size 30 30.

146
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.060
Great and it's put you to the centre a bad box and here to an alignment Centre.

147
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.180
Great.

148
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.720
All right.

149
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:28.760
Grab all of these to realign them so full rectangle for my ankles and then Centre bottom and then I'm

150
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.490
just going to move you up a little bit so you can hold shift to make sure that I'm only moving my axes

151
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.580
and eyeballs.

152
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.210
All right.

153
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.660
Let's save that back into carrot customization.

154
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.190
Analysis instance that scene ends so good at scenes customization customization you are.

155
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.920
And now want to run this scene.

156
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.890
Awesome.

157
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.860
Now you didn't notice the play I just went through the floor.

158
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.650
I don't want the player to go through the floor.

159
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.600
And the reason they've gone through the floor is I've actually brought the player in not the omission

160
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:11.380
as the lead both these players and let's instance in back to characters back to players into armatures

161
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.070
March Mike arledge armchair male that needs to go to this scene here.

162
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.020
So capitalization I'm a male.

163
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.170
And again I need to scale this down like I did before.

164
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.620
So scale you zero point to five.

165
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.750
I have to remember this because we do this quite recently.

166
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.920
Hope.

167
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.200
And now this has no physics attached so it's not going to move her out.

168
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.260
And let's move you up by a way too much.

169
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.440
Zero point zero point one better.

170
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.110
All right so you can be armature.

171
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.360
Minimize that folder and the most that folder.

172
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:48.950
Now let's.

173
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.560
Instance in the other one as well.

174
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:59.290
And that could be giant a scale that down to zero point zero for sorry zero point zero zero four.

175
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.360
Looking much better.

176
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.260
Okay.

177
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.030
This is really immature.

178
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.830
And let's put the correct capitalization in both of the press caps lock.

179
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.120
That's what it's going wrong.

180
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.700
I'm while I'm at it.

181
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.750
What's going on here is if I do the editable children I put the animation tree play in the armature

182
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.090
here.

183
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:27.840
But in the play a scene for the show and so on open a play a scene so that's scenes characters.

184
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:34.770
Players play the F and let's delete this note.

185
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.340
And go into the armature an instance of it here.

186
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.170
There it is.

187
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.010
And I'm just going to remember to fix those few animations that were different so run becomes running

188
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:55.550
working becomes pick up Punch should stay as punch an Idol should stay as idle and that should be good

189
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.050
to go.

190
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:06.930
So now I save all of these say that on and head on back to here let's hide one of these hide theme now.

191
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:08.680
I'd mail.

192
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.980
Great.

193
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.330
Let's see how this scene looks.

194
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.360
Right now these buttons don't do anything of the are doing next but the fat is starting to look pretty

195
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.210
shiny.

196
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.260
Do you need to move up slowly Let's move up.

197
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.930
Translation 0.01.

198
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.600
No way too little.

199
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.760
Zero Point one.

200
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.400
Back in to my preview camera.

201
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.740
Very nice.

202
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.090
Awesome cool.

203
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.370
Now let's look this up.

204
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.430
So what I need to do is I'm going to have to make some signals.

205
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.760
Someone who edits all children for customization you I don't need an adorable children for this.

206
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.200
It's just tiniest bit and I'm going to connect these signals.

207
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.730
But to do that I need a script.

208
00:11:53.730 --> 00:12:00.800
So let's make a script and I put this my script folder character customization loggi League name.

209
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.620
Fantastic analysis connecting links.

210
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.250
Let's start with character isolette.

211
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.170
I forgot to note and look at my signals.

212
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.140
You'll see that we pass through the integer idae and I put those in when I was making this scene.

213
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.270
Right so if I look at my items there's an idea zero an I.D. Once a week to pass those through.

214
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.280
And we can use that to select which model can be looking at which is or ideal.

215
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.550
So connect that and it's about customization and it's connected.

216
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.960
Great.

217
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:31.900
We got well we've got left and right haven't renamed right ashbery do that now.

218
00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.090
Boop they are right button.

219
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.070
And get back in.

220
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.550
You should have a better name.

221
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.850
They have a better name.

222
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:45.320
Yes you do.

223
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.120
Awesome.

224
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:53.400
Now if I just connect this as it is I will have one function called left button or left button pressed

225
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.910
and one called right button pressed and they're going to do almost the exact same thing.

226
00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.750
So instead I mean that connect them to a single function.

227
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.420
So let's get oppressed.

228
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.230
Well to connect it to casco character customization.

229
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:15.020
And I was going to call this change material but to add one more thing I'm going to add a string as

230
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.370
an argument.

231
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:21.620
So which button are we using using the left button are to put through the string or left.

232
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.170
And I'm going to copy change material and there's my change material and it comes through with what

233
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.370
should be an argument a part.

234
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.880
There's I'm going to through it it is passing through the argument.

235
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.070
OK.

236
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.430
So that function is going to need an extra argument.

237
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.570
I will do the same thing with right.

238
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.580
So connect that I connected to character customization.

239
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:45.710
It's going to pass the same method with a new string and something would be called right.

240
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.060
So we have a single material.

241
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:49.870
Just double check them.

242
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.040
If I click on right button and mouse over the actual cygnets connected to you see it's changed material

243
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.120
and it binds right and this one should be changed material and it binds or left.

244
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.260
Awesome.

245
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.550
So now were going to call that method.

246
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.910
Am I going to pass through a string that says left or right as an argument.

247
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:08.290
So in my script I need to put in the argument then call it direction.

248
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.380
Finally I need to connect this button here which I'm going to rename.

249
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.520
So back to my customer is ition you screen.

250
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.150
I'm going to rename this button.

251
00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:23.820
Start one save that and connect the stop button on Prest.

252
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.990
Connecting to character customization on stop unpressed boon.

253
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.590
Well that was probably my simpliste.

254
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.880
So let's start with this.

255
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.420
I'm going to get a tree change scene.

256
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.010
You should not be zero.

257
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.630
There we go.

258
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.510
And what about changing too.

259
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.980
I sure don't need the strings here because I'm going to go since levels for now.

260
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.040
Level 1 is great.

261
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.230
Drag that in there and that will work fine.

262
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.790
How do I know.

263
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.800
Let's run the scene.

264
00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.320
Look at that.

265
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.400
So now I'm going to add a handful of new materials.

266
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.860
First thing I need to do is actually grab these player materials.

267
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.960
Let's go into the right scene something back into my customization scene and the play materials you'll

268
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.500
see.

269
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:13.930
I've got six materials here and you can make more or if we open any of these up in the inspectors I'm

270
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.140
going to double click on it.

271
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.040
You see this is texture right here.

272
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.360
Catalysis web page he's actually got like a template we can use but all we need to do is change these

273
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.630
colours in gameplay photo shop or whatever criter program you like and you can import it and just make

274
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.500
a brand new tax year.

275
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.610
But here we have six materials and the nice thing is they're going to work on all them so they have

276
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.270
different skin tones different shoe colours and all the rest.

277
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.980
But we need to actually grab this so that we can you very well.

278
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.660
And of course this materials list I want to set this up as a dictionary.

279
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.670
We need a ready function so function already.

280
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.770
And what I'm doing I'm setting materials this materials list.

281
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.250
There it is the equals

282
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:06.700
file grabber and I need the get files function within that gets files and I need to bring in everything

283
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.590
in this false sense go back up one copy path paste done.

284
00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.370
So materials list is now set.

285
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:22.920
I also need a track a few other things that need a variable for kind material and I need to know which

286
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.970
player that's only the player variable rather called Current play.

287
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.390
OK.

288
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.560
We need to decide which one we start with and it doesn't really matter.

289
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.780
I've got them male unselected So that's going be my current player.

290
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:45.620
So let's go in to scripta and current player on ready is going to be mailed current player.

291
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.810
He calls mail.

292
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.690
Now I could make this an Injun But for now let's just make this nice and simple.

293
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.860
And I've got two characters so it's not getting out of hand.

294
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:58.920
If I had 15 characters 24 characters 120 and none would be the way to go.

295
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.980
Maybe even something a little more control.

296
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.530
Okay.

297
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.830
I've unhidden the the armature off so you can see both at the same time because I've got to hide it

298
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:08.550
in script.

299
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.650
So back in the script and I'm not to hide immature so immature F dot.

300
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.790
Hi I'm not in the MASH.

301
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.830
I'm hiding the entire armature.

302
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.940
And now on to play the scene.

303
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:28.080
She is hidden right now right now this isn't doing anything but that's okay.

304
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.310
Now I've got freyer as my default selection but I'm showing phrase you know what I'm actually going

305
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.190
to change your mind.

306
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.570
Can't play is going to be female.

307
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.470
Men get to hide the male character and just to check I haven't broken anything.

308
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.290
Awesome let's make had to select work so we've got to pass through an idea.

309
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.250
Let's make this really simple.

310
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.510
Let's hide both of them.

311
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:54.710
I'm going to go immature F dot height.

312
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.880
Going to duplicate that and do harm a check.

313
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.230
Hide and that is when I've called them both excellent.

314
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.950
At this point we could use an IF condition.

315
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.420
Let's do the slightly differently let's use match.

316
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.320
Match works.

317
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:13.520
Kind of like a forced statement if statement rather than what it's doing is it's matching a specific

318
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.060
value and then changes behaviour.

319
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.240
So match I.D. What I'm saying is take this value and match it.

320
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:31.070
If this value is zero and I need to go down indentation line then current player equals female and I

321
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.150
need to show that that much.

322
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.370
So much F dot Sure.

323
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.320
Okay if it's one current player.

324
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.470
Equals mail.

325
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.140
And once again John M dot.

326
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.690
Sure I'll see how that looks.

327
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.120
Are not too shabby right.

328
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.730
Okay next doubleness change the material so I've seen have minimized that.

329
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.350
There it is.

330
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.730
If you're Cure's what happened there.

331
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.210
You can press the still down arrow and hide bits of code not using right now.

332
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.430
So got match working.

333
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.480
Oh by the way if you are used to another programming language like C++ or C sharp you might be saying

334
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.300
well why haven't you put in a break here.

335
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.490
You need to put something to tell it that you're no longer using this match.

336
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.860
You don't script great it will just stop when it runs out of options so if they match ideas too it just

337
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.520
wont work do anything.

338
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.730
I don't need to put Nelson has got big screen.

339
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.050
OK.

340
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:40.020
Let's start making a new variable and I'm going to call this materials count and that is going to be

341
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.270
the material this size.

342
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:51.850
However materialist is going to be using a key that starts at zero right.

343
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.740
And size is going to count whatever is a key 0 as 1.

344
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.910
So if there's only one entry you'll have kieser over the size you want some of subtract by one just

345
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.040
so that these so we don't have an off by one errors anyway.

346
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.120
Nothing like a new method and I'm gonna call this selective material.

347
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:18.170
In this I'm on a path for direction and the materials count.

348
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:27.730
Couple of spaces give us some room great function to select materials passing through Direction materials

349
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.020
count.

350
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:38.590
All right sort of want to see our say if direction is equal to right which is a string and current material

351
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:48.470
plus equals one else current material minus equal one.

352
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:52.370
Now the eagle eye amongst you will notice that there is a potential problem here.

353
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.170
And you're right.

354
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.750
And that's why we've set this up like this.

355
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.900
But that's coming up later.

356
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:56.560
So not why.

357
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.760
And if you haven't spotted the error Don't panic.

358
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:04.360
It'll all become clear again let's go back up to change materials so when I do select material and that's

359
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.190
just going to change this count that's fine we can do that.

360
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:12.690
And now let's apply it and do that I'm just going to make some short cuts so far.

361
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.820
Male equals immature EMP.

362
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.130
And specifically I don't just want the armature.

363
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:25.290
I want the mesh because it's what I'm applying the material alisyn say for female.

364
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.470
So that equals.

365
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.760
Female mesh.

366
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.030
And to make this work I'm going to use something called a set surface materials.

367
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.540
I guess let's do male set surface material.

368
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.320
Where does that come from.

369
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.140
That's part of mescher So a look at it some scroll down to set surface material and need an integer

370
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.470
for which surface was setting and which material.

371
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:46.750
OK.

372
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.820
So what's material called I can close this mission since for now.

373
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.640
Well let's take a look.

374
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.330
If I do children and look at the mash there is a single material called Zerah.

375
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.330
By the way be careful because I just found this out just now for evitable children.

376
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.840
On the other omniture this one doesn't have a material.

377
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.490
It doesn't matter what the mash has this wanted it once and it's got plight one.

378
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.140
I'm gonna go to the image a female scene right now.

379
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.770
A mesh and a little loader material.

380
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.290
And it's got the material one so they both look the same.

381
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.810
Save that now there's a little confusing because we have a material here and mature on a measurement.

382
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.410
Open the mesh.

383
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.610
I just clicked on the actual much self and remove the material from here in a clear that.

384
00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.560
So there's just some basic troubleshooting.

385
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.690
So look out for make sure that all your assets are consistent or you'll get very different results.

386
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.890
Say that in my script I know it's going be zero and what material do I want you to load it in as an

387
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:44.160
object because I've only got strings and need to convert into objects and monogrammed materials list

388
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.560
and I want a specific key from that.

389
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.470
What Kido I want current material.

390
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.720
So now I'm excrements big duplicate that and change them.

391
00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.990
Mail the second one to female.

392
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:04.120
All right let's see how that works out so I can do switch materials not working.

393
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.550
Awesome.

394
00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.030
Let's check.

395
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.640
Mail you are working.

396
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.130
Why.

397
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:07.990
Why aren't you working.

398
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.500
You should absolutely be working.

399
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.900
Oh no.

400
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.210
Oh my goodness.

401
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:14.060
Okay.

402
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.110
Variable female omniture move their ago.

403
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:20.390
One more time with feeling.

404
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.080
Care.

405
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.210
Much more like it.

406
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.110
And I can go over here.

407
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.570
Great.

408
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.080
But we have a bug.

409
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.060
If I go for a few more materials we're going to crash.

410
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.650
And why are we crashing.

411
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.350
Because there's no indexed six in this dictionary.

412
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.980
So here's my challenge for you.

413
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:43.250
I'd like you to cycle the texture's have the customization script cycle through that lissom materials.

414
00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.450
In other words if we're at the end of the list and I keep pressing right bring me to the beginning if

415
00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.650
I'm at the beginning in a press left brain is the end.

416
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.000
So pause the video.

417
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.670
See which you can figure out and when you're ready come on back and I show you my solution.

418
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.300
And welcome back.

419
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.800
OK so we've already laid the groundwork here.

420
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.350
Right.

421
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.380
And as you can see here I'm passing through the materials count to select material so it's going to

422
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.840
be in here.

423
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.430
And what I really want to do is make a another layer if conditions so if pressing right now only to

424
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.490
check if the current material.

425
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:27.260
Is the same as the materials count then current material.

426
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.530
Equals zero.

427
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.690
In other words if we're at the end of the list OK.

428
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.980
So we have six materials where the six material press right.

429
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.860
Then set it to zero and it doesn't matter how many materials we have because we can just count the size

430
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.660
that lets the more things when that folder the bigger the list will become this will scale find a gate.

431
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.720
When you say very similar here.

432
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.210
So if current no this is what were pressing left.

433
00:24:51.230 --> 00:25:00.440
Come a Terian is zero then the current material is going to be set to single equals this time materials

434
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:06.510
count else and I'll be very careful here.

435
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.870
There should be an else let's put else in and do that.

436
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.820
Awesome.

437
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.590
Now I've done this correctly.

438
00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:20.190
Do do do cycle back cycle forward.

439
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.340
And we keep cycling.

440
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.240
And I'll begin with it.

441
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:28.800
It'll work either with either of them begin as the buttner was looking at outstanding and that brings

442
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.400
us to the end of the video in this video.

443
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.330
We've looked at Applied Materials to measures at run time which is very helpful and cycling to the end

444
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.280
or beginning of a dictionary or a real work just as well for a race.

445
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.490
So really good stuff we get.

446
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.840
We've got a really nice system going on here and running this will scale up.

447
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.790
It doesn't matter how complex your model is or how many different things are customizing.

448
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.110
This will still work.

449
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.840
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
