00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,280
Hello.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,050
Fantastic go to people in this video.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,400
Let's make a game more atmospheric.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,410
We're going to add a light to D.N.A..

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,180
We're gonna make a torch or a flashlight depending on what part of the world you're from.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,020
I'm calling a torch because I'm Kim.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,070
I grew up in the UK.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,350
But if you're from America or someone else that uses the word flashlight and by that I mean the United

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:22,710
States.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,500
I don't know what Canadians use.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,760
You can call it a flashlight.

12
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,090
It's fine.

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,950
We need to know a few things about the way that God handles light.

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,910
So let's talk about light duty nodes.

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,050
First you need to know is that light to these nodes need a light Map Texture.

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,960
I'll show you why in a moment the light map is calculated from the origin of the node not why the texture

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,180
is.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Don't worry what that means too much is that the filter into the back of your brain.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,740
When I show you what that means.

20
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,500
This will click into place.

21
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:58,130
Basically there is a difference between where the light node is and where the texture of the light is.

22
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,210
We're also gonna have to use occlusion other occlusion nodes and inclusions built into top maps.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,910
Inclusion is basically this causes shadow.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,040
If we don't put that in God doesn't know what causes shadows.

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,270
We don't want the floor to cause shadows for example.

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,880
God doesn't know the difference in a flow on a wall so we have to tell it finally light an occlusion

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,920
use layers just like collision.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,770
We're not using that too much in high surmises but it's worth remembering.

29
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,920
You can decide what kind of lights cost what kinds of shadows.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,630
So before we get to God I just want to take a quick moment to do a very professional looking sketch

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,130
to explain how light to Dino's use like maps.

32
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,590
So here we are in a nice whiteboard place.

33
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,410
And here is Bob.

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,340
I haven't seen Bob in a while.

35
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,670
Great.

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,300
Thanks Bob.

37
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,600
Bye.

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,680
What's gonna happen is we're going to draw a light to denote in this nice purple.

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:46,930
Okay.

40
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,270
And here is its origin.

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,810
Then we're going to bring in the texture of a light.

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,620
Now the light to denote is going to say Okay I have this much range.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,550
So is anything in this range that might be blocking that light.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,220
If so block it it is worth knowing that the light to denote is doing this in all possible directions

45
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,410
at the same time.

46
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,670
Just because we see the light map here doesn't mean that's where the light is being calculated.

47
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,670
The light is visible because this is a light Map Texture and we need to be very careful that the light

48
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,390
Map Texture shows where we wanted to show.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,770
But the light is counted from here because when we put it in a second it's going to look a lot more

50
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:30,250
like this.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,100
That's not a very good drawing but whatever.

52
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,890
So we're going to think the light source is here but it's going to be calculated from here.

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,470
We're going to give us some really weird effects.

54
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,400
Let me show you what I mean.

55
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
So back into it.

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,260
So here we are and got it.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,930
And the very first thing I do is I'm going to add a new note.

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,890
It's gonna be a light to denote light 2D.

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,940
And I'm gonna call it torch.

60
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,430
We're going to use this in a lot of different scene.

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,060
So let's make it its own scene.

62
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,700
So I'm going to save branch scene.

63
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm looking right at it and not pressing it safe brunches scene.

64
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,970
And where we put this let's put this it's not level maybe other light maps let's put on the light maps

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,290
torch was a good place to put it.

66
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,150
OK.

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,870
First you notice we have an error warning to texture the shape of the light must be supplied.

68
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,520
Right now we can't see anything.

69
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,050
OK.

70
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,090
So let's bring in our light about texture on a light maps you'll see here.

71
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,080
I've got a torch map.

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,980
I'm going to bring that in.

73
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,060
OK.

74
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,970
Few things.

75
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,110
The first thing is we can't see against the background.

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,430
That's OK.

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,310
We can bring the player in.

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,050
So let's save this and head on over to levels and open template.

79
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:39,010
And now you'll see what I was talking about here is on light map here is a light to denote Now you might

80
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,850
think that's fine.

81
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,290
All I need to do is move it over.

82
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,480
So if we move it over I just move you like that.

83
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,150
So the torch is just outside the player.

84
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,790
You'll notice it's light in the player but nothing else.

85
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,130
There is nothing to light.

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,250
So I was gonna make sure it's outside the player like due to do loops

87
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,800
I was bringing it back a bit let's say.

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,210
Position is 3 3 0.

89
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,490
Good.

90
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,280
That's right on the edge.

91
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:11,540
OK.

92
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,280
OK.

93
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,010
Save that back in the template note.

94
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,660
OK so that looks fine right.

95
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,780
Let's run the scene and yep that looks like a real torch we've got no shadows in but we can put those

96
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,610
in real quick in fact let's put the shadows in.

97
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,860
So we're in template.

98
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's open the tile map and I want to edit the time maps I click on tiles and click on the tile sheet

99
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,460
and edit and all I need to do is decide I'm editing this bit.

100
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,310
It's got occlusion and a square and just like we did before.

101
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,960
I want to fast forward this bit so you don't have to watch the whole thing

102
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,550
and last one there it is great.

103
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,170
I'm not doing this work because we're not using them.

104
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,470
I'm not doing these frequently using them.

105
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:06,790
OK.

106
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,030
So we now have occlusion.

107
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:14,630
So God now knows these these bits cast shadows greatness bring you down but boop.

108
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:21,370
Well you like so awesome case or on the scene and as you know there's no shadows at all.

109
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,830
Okay that's fine.

110
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,960
Why is that.

111
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,160
It's because not every light needs shadows and God is try to save resources so if we go back to the

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,630
play scene go to torch let's open a torch thing.

113
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,700
Let's just get it torch myself and we go to shadow we can enable it.

114
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,180
And the shadow is going to be nice and dark.

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,790
OK.

116
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,530
Say that back into the scene and run it.

117
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,460
OK.

118
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,900
We now have shadows but that doesn't look right.

119
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,100
What is going on.

120
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,410
OK let me bring up my little sketchpad.

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,600
So what's happening is that we think the light is being generated here but if we look at the way the

122
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,740
shadows lie we actually see where is being generated.

123
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,880
I can follow this over here and follow this over here and it's right here off center but it's right

124
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,330
here.

125
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,370
So we know that the light to decode is calculating from here.

126
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,500
Now that clearly isn't good enough.

127
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,790
So how can we fix that.

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,940
Because if I'm backing God which I am right now and I just try and move it this problem keeps going

129
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,770
right.

130
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,900
The answer is not to move the light but to move the texture.

131
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,020
So make sure that my light to the node is just outside the character because when we give the character

132
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,730
shadows we want the light to come out and I need an offset.

133
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,930
Let's move the texture offset by 330.

134
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,330
How about 320.

135
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,530
Perfect 320.

136
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,810
OK.

137
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,810
So now if we run this level the shadows behave as we expect right now.

138
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,680
Doesn't look very dark.

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,780
Let's make it look even darker.

140
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,690
We need a template level.

141
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,600
I'm at a new type of layer called Canvas modulate and what this does is tints the entire canvas.

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,260
Awesome.

143
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,710
Let's give you a nice gray round there somewhere.

144
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,150
And suddenly this is starting to look a little more like a stealth game right.

145
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,540
We have actual shadows have been calculated.

146
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,080
And as these tall maps are rebuilt we're going to have real shadows.

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,170
Awesome.

148
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,270
Before we go any further let's give player a little bit of shadows and this template I'm going to bring

149
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,500
in.

150
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,660
Character template so that we can see what's happening with the player shadows or the character shows

151
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,380
and let's open the Templar character as a scene.

152
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,980
We need to add a light a to 2D awesome and these include a need a shape.

153
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,380
So let's give a new polygon.

154
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,260
OK.

155
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,600
First we need to do is add these points.

156
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm gonna click on Create points and in a moment.

157
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,970
Press the button and nothing's going to happen.

158
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,720
Why.

159
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,920
Because I'm in move mode.

160
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,180
I need to be in select mode one more time.

161
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,440
Point to point to point.

162
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,670
There we go.

163
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,880
Just want to be reasonably close

164
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,090
and close it off.

165
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,680
Let's look good.

166
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,960
Let's save it and see how it looks like that.

167
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,010
It has shadow Templar character has shadow which means everything that inherits from template shadow

168
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,340
has shadow awesome.

169
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,460
Now you might be getting slightly different results to this if you go to template character and open

170
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,630
occluded 2D.

171
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,560
We have different color modes at the moment it's clockwise so it's calling things clockwise.

172
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,690
If we go counterclockwise say that's good because the scene is now not letting that light through right.

173
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,940
We do want the light to actually hit the character.

174
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,370
We only want to call on one side.

175
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,280
What's that mean.

176
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,280
It means it stops drawing in one direction so the light's going to come inside and it's going to stop

177
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:58,580
on the inside and say that by the same and there is awesome.

178
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:58,980
OK.

179
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,140
That's looking pretty solid.

180
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,710
Now I've got a quick challenge for you.

181
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,640
What happens if you want to control the torch being on and off.

182
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,460
We probably won't have this as an actual gameplay element but let's just refresh our memories.

183
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,020
See if you can set the torch to the player and switch on and off of the key press.

184
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,310
Remember you gonna have to go to project settings to input mapping to define a key picture you like

185
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,940
on a no space or something.

186
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,680
But give it a shot.

187
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,470
Pause the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

188
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
I'm ok back.

189
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,510
OK.

190
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,310
First you need to do is bind a key so protect settings input map.

191
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,860
I'm going to call this torch toggle to get name except that should be lowercase torch toggle.

192
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,910
There we go.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,910
Add that and I'm going to bind space right now the key.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,360
Now let's go to the player script.

195
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,390
Okay so what are we going to use.

196
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,090
Well I'm not making you function and it's going to be input event so input when you input.

197
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,090
Here's what to do if input dot is action pressed.

198
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,100
I want just pressed not pressed when I'm holding it down torch toggle.

199
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,330
Okay.

200
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,710
So when the button marked torch toggle has just been pressed do the following.

201
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,130
Okay.

202
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,710
First what do we need to switch on.

203
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,460
Let's look at the Torch thing.

204
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,530
Here's my torch scene.

205
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,000
There is probably heckled enabled right mousing over it will tell me the property is called by typing

206
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,340
enabled in lowercase.

207
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,860
Awesome.

208
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,950
Let's go back into our player scene into the script and I wanted to get the torch right.

209
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,180
If it didn't auto complete you're not in the player scene.

210
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:42,060
Auto complete will only find nodes in the current scene so torch dot enabled.

211
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,780
Now I could put extra stuff here.

212
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,620
I could say and torch enabled.

213
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,190
And so on.

214
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:59,380
But there's a really elegant way of doing this torch dot enabled equals so it's set to not torch dot

215
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,150
enabled.

216
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:06,800
And what that means is set this property here to be whatever this isn't.

217
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,700
In other words whatever your not become.

218
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:19,780
So let's take a look at two demoed and run the sing boop awesome now quite a little trick with this.

219
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,960
If you've made a mistake and it's not working and it's not throwing up an error messages here's what

220
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,990
I did wrong.

221
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,370
Just now all recording it and then edited out so that you would never know torch enabled equals not

222
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,380
torch enabled is not the same as torch enabled.

223
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,660
Does not equal torch enabled.

224
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,970
This says this property is not this property which is nonsense.

225
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,200
I don't change the property.

226
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,630
I want to change the value.

227
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,530
So this will work.

228
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,080
This will not demonstrate that pressing space.

229
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,830
Nothing's happening and no error messages because nothing bad is happening here.

230
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,340
I'm not throwing up anything that is worthy of an error.

231
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
So just put that back here.

232
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,110
Okay so now we have torches we have shadows we have a lot of atmosphere in our game.

233
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,200
I think it's a really good place to stop this video.

234
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,640
In this video we have learned how to use a light to denote we've looked at checking lighting and lighting

235
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,840
map to make sure they're aligned remember move the light map with offset.

236
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,450
Don't move the light to denote we've put an occlusion in our alter tiles and we've used a light occluded

237
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,590
to denote to give all characters shadows.

238
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,440
Awesome.

239
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,900
I think we're off to a really good start.

240
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,380
Game sounds like atmospheric and I'm really happy that progress so excellent work and I'll see you in

241
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,890
the next video.
