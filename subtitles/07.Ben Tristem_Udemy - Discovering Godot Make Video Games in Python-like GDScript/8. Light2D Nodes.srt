1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,020
Hello again you delightful God people.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,100
Let's shine some light on the matter in this video.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,550
We're going to add a flashlight or a torch.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,680
I mostly could be saying torch because I am from Britain and that's what we say.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,850
But if you want to see flash like you say flashlight.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,790
This really is really about light too deep and occlusion before we get down to it.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,840
Couple of things first.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,900
In the final version of our game the player is not going to have a torch.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,930
Cameras and guards will but to get it working and to put it on the player.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,630
As a scene and then we can drop that scene as an instance of the worries and pieces.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,230
Second like 2D has a peculiarities.

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,580
So the first thing I need to know is that light to download needs a light map texture you need to create

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,430
it texture.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,050
To tell it how the light behaves.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,430
Very simply we need is an image of the beam of light and where it is bright the light will be bright

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,700
and when it is black there will be no light.

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,820
I provided you with a little cone of light that starts bright and trails off.

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,040
It's very simple to make.

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,420
Took me a few seconds in GIMP.

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,830
Secondly you need to know is that like map is calculated from the origin of the node not from the texture.

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,010
So one of the bugs you can get is you think your flashlight is working properly but when you actually

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:23,990
activate it or the occlusions and replaces what seclusion occlusion is shadow it's it's a mask you can

23
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,480
put on just like a collision layer that says if the light hits here stop the light you don't stop all

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,500
the light only the light that is on the right layer light on inclusion.

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,230
Use layers just like collisions.

26
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,520
Don't worry about memorizing all that stuff to have in the back of your mind percolating what would

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,310
work.

28
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,250
But let's get to it.

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,360
What I would do is create a new scene and I'm going to use and liked to do you know what.

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,740
I'm going to call this torch.

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,370
And the warning it's telling me if I just mouse over it is that you need to have a texture.

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,380
OK so here's my texture.

33
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,660
Let's get to my light Matt falder this torture map.

34
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,540
And there it is.

35
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,300
You'll notice you can't see it.

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,910
So let's save this for now.

37
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,840
Not what's going on.

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:15,750
So this is scenes and let's open our play a scene and an instance of player will put in a torch.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,180
Okay so here's my torch.

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,640
When we save the play a scene and updates the main scene you'll see there's a thing going wrong here.

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:33,460
Now this is because the texture is on the centre of the torch.

42
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,700
And for look at the plan a..

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,020
The torch is right in the centre of the plate.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,620
And then a move it just a little bit to about here.

45
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,020
Save that hook.

46
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,260
That didn't change anything.

47
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,110
Do not keep moving this texture.

48
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,380
If we look at the torch as a..

49
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:56,100
I don't want to drag it all the way there because the shadows calculate from where this crosses.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,180
If I drag it to here the shadows will calculate from there.

51
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,190
I need to move the texture NOT the notes.

52
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,170
I'm going to use texture offset.

53
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,290
I happen to know that this texture is about three hundred and twenty.

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,010
Yeah.

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,800
So the Tetris offer 640 wide so 320 is half of that.

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,730
So now the light 2D is positioned where the axes but the texture is where the boxes.

57
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,520
If I say that we now have a working torch.

58
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Let's take a look at it.

59
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,870
All right so right now this isn't behaving like a torch right.

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,660
This is behaving like a we are trying.

61
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,250
We need a few things.

62
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,290
One we need the place to be darker.

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,320
This flashlight only works if there's a dark room too.

64
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,640
We need shadows.

65
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,310
Well the first problem is very easy to do as a child of Level 1.

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,950
I don't make a new node and I use canvas modulate modulate allows you to change the colour of something

67
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,860
canvas modulate allows it to change the colour of the canvas the entire viewport.

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,340
So if I minimized this and I pick a nice dark blue very cinematic trick all night is blue.

69
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,070
I actually make this darker in the final game.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,890
But for now it's play.

71
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,200
And already that's looking better at shadows.

72
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,230
Any object can have an explosion.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,530
Right so I'm going to use a node called occlusion which families an object.

74
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,970
So if I want to make a play or an NPC I can give it occlusion just that collision.

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,000
If I want to do an auto tile then uh press walls tile set an auto tile click on auto tiles and here's

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,960
the occlusion tab.

77
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:39,000
And this works exactly like the collision perhaps or I have to do is select a tile make sure that my

78
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:48,090
step is correct only 64 by 64 for each grids point and I'm just going to go click click click click

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:55,460
click so I select the tile select polygon and create my religion.

80
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,690
Obviously I'm going to speed this up as we go because this is a little bit fiddly but I promise you

81
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,260
it will be worth it.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,560
Okay and that should be all of them just going to double check that everything that has collision has

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,310
occlusion and a bit map.

84
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,810
Okay time consuming a little irritating but worth it.

85
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,440
So first mendis must save it and I don't think this will work out the box and I'll show you why.

86
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,520
So first let's save my time and press play.

87
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,820
I haven't switched shadows on just like cameras need to have a current camera set and railcars have

88
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,460
to have enable set lights have to have shadows.

89
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,710
So I go back to torturing and find shadow in the inspector and enable it save that.

90
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,740
And now you press play.

91
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,170
Oh yeah.

92
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,790
That we have shadower if you're not getting shadow by the way something you should be checking just

93
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:25,600
make sure that the occlude are offset isn't set to any value.

94
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,500
So by that I mean go into walls going to order tile and you'll see occlude offset.

95
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,420
What this is doing is it's taking the size of the tile map and halving that.

96
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,820
That means that my shadows are actually 864 by 640 pixels off where I want them to be.

97
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,220
So my shadows are down here to my right I can't see them.

98
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,870
Let's set that to 0 0 and you'll see it's doing the exact same thing with navigation offset.

99
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,280
We're not using navigation but I'm a set to 0 0 anyway because reasons.

100
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,640
Now when you press play.

101
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,550
You should have shadowers to show what it will look like without.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,780
If you're getting this bug.

103
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,390
No shadows.

104
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,200
So just make sure that your shadows aren't being cast off screen.

105
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,440
Right.

106
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,710
I'm now going to do one more thing I want to put shadows on players or one of those on an incense in

107
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,820
just as a test.

108
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,660
The character sing character and then move him somewhere where he could be seen.

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,300
OK.

110
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,720
If I press play we ever play the character the character has no movement to it it can't do anything

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,480
and it doesn't cast in the shadows has occlusion but doesn't cache others.

112
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:39,310
Let's give Shadow to the character and that's gonna inherit down to the player and any guards we put

113
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,260
in later.

114
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,880
So let's open the character scene.

115
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,950
Zoom in and add new note and it's going to be like occlude a hoodie.

116
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,960
So clude a light occlude attorney.

117
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:56,160
Okay I need a new occlude a polygon and now I need to draw a polygon.

118
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,300
This is create.

119
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,630
This is at subtlest you create a zoom in nice and tight.

120
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,000
No I can't use shapes like religion unfortunately so I'm just going to go click with that grid view

121
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,320
on.

122
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,830
I don't want grid as move that point.

123
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,430
In fact you know what let's start that again on the little down arrow clear.

124
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,030
Make sure my grid is off.

125
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,990
I don't want add on.

126
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,470
This can be a little rough and ready.

127
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,330
I was going to click click.

128
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,900
By x.

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,030
I can edit some of these if I mouse over it because he wanted to do so.

130
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,510
I want to remove a points or right mouse button at this point.

131
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,040
And I want to move this one down here.

132
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,000
This one down here.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,930
Just get something that's roughly right.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,180
So let's make this a little bit bigger.

135
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,710
So looks roughly right.

136
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,640
Yes.

137
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,070
Add one in.

138
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,260
So that's what is that that is control and left mouse.

139
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,610
If mouse.

140
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,220
Just move that point over here.

141
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,130
There's a good that looks pretty good.

142
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,630
So it's a little rough and ready you can tweak your heart's content.

143
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,110
What I'm going to do now is well let's test that it works to level one.

144
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,790
How it does work.

145
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,180
With one caveat I now can't see the person because the occlusion mask is stopping light from entering

146
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,210
the sprite at all to fix that.

147
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,870
Back to my character click on includer and change the call mode to either clockwise or counterclockwise

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,270
just a clockwise.

149
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,090
And then we have seen a play that's the wrong thing.

150
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,970
We can now see the character and the character is casting a shadow.

151
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,910
The player will also cast a shadow.

152
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,480
So we now have working light and shadow in our games.

153
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,660
Now you can add static lights if you want to.

154
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,040
If you wanted to put in little lamps just make a little white map for it and place them around the place

155
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,250
of them.

156
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,560
The player walks into them.

157
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,510
They'll be visible but this is really good.

158
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,020
So now I've got a challenge for you and this challenge isn't one that's going to be directly used in

159
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,130
games but it can be the foundation.

160
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,260
So they would do a little later setting the torch so that the player can switch it on and off with a

161
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,270
keypress.

162
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,810
OK so what we want is we want to be able to activate or deactivate the torch by pressing a key.

163
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:44,010
Some quick reminders if we go into project settings input map you can either use for example you select

164
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,280
which is space we can define your own keys.

165
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:52,040
So suppose the media give them a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

166
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,580
Welcome Mac.

167
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,300
OK.

168
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,550
So this is really a script.

169
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,480
I'm a in play for now so we could put a function here called Tomball torch.

170
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:05,860
Right.

171
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,700
And then call that every frame.

172
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,210
That's bad practice to slow things down.

173
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:16,760
So instead let's make some big circuits in them doing instead let's go a function toggle torch.

174
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,560
And what I'm going to do is call that when the player pressed the button.

175
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:32,820
So let's go in put event as a function function input event and if input dot is action just frescoes

176
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,880
as a toggle we don't have to hold down new space which I know is you guys select.

177
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,000
And then I'm going to go toggle torch.

178
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,100
So what do we need to happen and hold torch.

179
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Well I need to get the torch.

180
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:01,540
So if torch helps us on the zero area and now I need to use a property of torch.

181
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,580
So let's look at the properties of torture quick.

182
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,750
And you can see it has enabled so just by mousing over it like I don't toggle torched dot enabled.

183
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,730
And this is a booleans that's a truffaut's.

184
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:27,550
So if the torch is enabled then I want to disable it right so torch dot enabled because false else.

185
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,030
Torch dot enabled.

186
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,430
He calls group.

187
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,170
And now when we press space which would switch the torch on and off.

188
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,790
Not bad.

189
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,950
We now have lights that we can switch on and off.

190
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,890
Now this will be linked to a change in vision mode so this is a little dark right now but there will

191
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,750
be a game play version for it later.

192
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,770
But look at that.

193
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,510
We have some real functionality and already the beginnings of a good looking game with some little lighting

194
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,460
tricks and a few other things you could really make something special here.

195
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,830
And that brings us to the end of the video.

196
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,050
In this video we've looked at how to use a light to dinard.

197
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,790
We have made we've looked at how to make sure your lighting and light matter are aligned and have a

198
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,750
set of a light occlude to do you know as well as how to set up a kloof in an altered tiling.

199
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:21,780
Some of this is a little fiddly but really helpful stuff because now we can make levels that cut shadows

200
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,180
and have collision very quickly and we can make multiple levels.

201
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,650
So really great work.

202
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,770
Go on the next video.
