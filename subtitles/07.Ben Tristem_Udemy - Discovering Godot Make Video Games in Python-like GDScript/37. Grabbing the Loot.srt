1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello again you marvellous God.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,900
People in this video.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,840
We're going to upgrade our game right now.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,940
We've created a game we sneak around a room for no reason.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,850
But this is called heiss Meister's.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,150
Let's come with a heist.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,670
In this video we're going create some loot.

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,770
Grab it and have an exit.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,660
Okay.

10
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,190
Let's get straight to it.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,750
The first thing I do is I'm going to make the exit so let's make a new scene.

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,550
And I think Cole rectangle why colour rectangle.

13
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,150
Because I want a little rectangle that's of a certain colour that I can put a label on it.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,340
And people know that's the exit so let's do that let's make a nice skin colour or a teal ish colour

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,490
and always fix that later.

16
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,600
Maybe make this a bit bigger.

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,640
That's looking like a decent size for now.

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,720
Great.

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,130
Now one thing I do want to do is make sure that this is semi transparent so I'm going to go down to

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:02,290
the visibility and under modulate and lower the Alpher value that makes that semi transparent.

21
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:02,900
OK.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:11,570
Let's say this is a scene and the call this exit so we could see what this looks like.

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:21,220
And I may well rename the actual note may be about that size less incidents that in some instances.

24
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,930
As a child level one as my exit.

25
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,580
That's looking pretty good.

26
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,250
Maybe a little less teal a little more blue to match the interface.

27
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,180
Let's just tweak that colour rectangle.

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,820
But you get the idea which is going to make a nice block of colour.

29
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,750
So that's looking good.

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,680
All right within this point areas hoodie.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,600
Now the two days at zero zero and I probably want it centred on the object.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,660
So let's find out how to drag that to the centre.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,400
I want to put in a collision shape.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,510
A collision shape to a new shape is going to be a rectangle shaped hoodie.

35
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,690
And remember it use the accidents not the scale.

36
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,950
And I can move my area too deep.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,940
Remember to move all children Erica.

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,450
And get that more or less right.

39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,820
If in doubt overlap the area slightly because we want the player to have a little bit of leeway so that's

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,040
looking pretty good when they do.

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,770
Meaning it's a label that's put in a label.

42
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,740
And I write the word exit and put this in theme.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,280
So thien Load theme theme.

44
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,260
Fantastic.

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,280
And that can go in the exit too.

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,640
Let's save that the other looks like in-game pretty good.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,230
Now we could put this in the interface so that it vanishes and only appears when you're in night vision

48
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,680
mode.

49
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,930
For now we leave as that is.

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,400
But so we have something in the works as an exit.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,110
It's not connected it doesn't have a script yet.

52
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,800
We can do that later but this is just something to watch.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,720
Now let's make some of it.

54
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,120
So a brand new scene and the route now is going to be in the area 2D.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,320
The way this is going to work is the players going to walk over the area pick up the item and the item

56
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,100
vanish from the map.

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,790
So I want a sprite so you can see what we're picking up.

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,460
And Sprite has that many letters in it and other graphics.

59
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,210
And the loot You see I've giving you two options as a folder and a suitcase.

60
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,920
I'm going use a suitcase and for the texture.

61
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,570
Do you use the folder you use the folder Now area to do requires a collision shapes Let's put that in.

62
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,360
And there's another new rectangle.

63
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,190
And again use the excess to make it nice big.

64
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,570
Speaking of nice and big.

65
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,700
If I save this I call it briefcase.

66
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,800
Probably rename Eric too deep a briefcase to make a nice and easy.

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,850
So if I save this and insist in this scene you'll see it's a little bit big.

68
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,360
I mean that's there's a giant briefcase so I'm going to go back in my root node the area to.

69
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,930
I'm going to head down to transform and on a scale at zero point five.

70
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,260
Save that and we'll go back in a level that should be a bit better.

71
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,880
Great.

72
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,650
Make sure I don't click on furniture by mistake.

73
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,670
It.

74
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,810
So we have a basic pick up let's put in a script in the briefcase so it can actually do something somewhere

75
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,860
to get a new script scrip for briefcase put it in my script folder call it briefcase and it's got to

76
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,350
go.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,830
Now let's connect it by node to itself so on body entered connect to briefcase before we go any further

78
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,320
let's make sure that both briefcase and exit are on the right coalition led somewhere.

79
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,920
Click on inspector and make sure our briefcase selected find collision.

80
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,240
There it is OK.

81
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,800
You are not a player some Take player off the player but you do interact with the players.

82
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,630
Let's those unmasked and do the exact same thing on exit.

83
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,710
So head up to the area to Dean because that's where the collision mask is.

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,790
And it's not on the player where it is and the player mask so interactive the player it is not a player

85
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,990
that's very important.

86
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,220
We don't want the guards to see the exit that counting as oh I've seen the player.

87
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,490
All right so we have this briefcase script.

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,360
And what does it do.

89
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,220
Well let's make it nice and easy.

90
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:50,690
Briefcase is going to tell the player so global dot player and were going to run a new function in player

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,130
let's call it collect briefcase.

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,280
All right.

93
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,150
So save that.

94
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,680
And now let's head over to the play a script which I happen to have open here.

95
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,900
And remember if you don't have an open head back up your dad's folder go to scripts and find a player

96
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,390
in here.

97
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,000
It's right there.

98
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,720
And we make a brand new function we put it right at the end and I'm going to go function.

99
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,430
Collect briefcase.

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,510
I don't just want the briefcase to be collected.

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,080
We also want it to vanish from the maps once it's called this function.

102
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,010
Q free.

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,860
There it is say that now we you test what's can happen.

104
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,690
So what I'm expecting is we're going to walk into the briefcase.

105
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,300
It's going to trigger collect briefcase on player which currently does nothing.

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,900
Let's make go rent out as we say got a briefcase.

107
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,680
And then it's going to cue free it's going to just erase itself from memory.

108
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,650
It's going to go off the map as Pressplay.

109
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,180
And walk over to the briefcase got a briefcase.

110
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,840
Fantastic.

111
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,030
Right now that's all it does.

112
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,170
I've got a briefcase.

113
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,140
Nothing else happens.

114
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,610
So let's make something else happen.

115
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,780
I don't want it to say print a briefcase.

116
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,630
I want to actually change the game so that we can track that the briefcase has been picked up right.

117
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,650
I need to know the player has a briefcase or doesn't have a briefcase.

118
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,270
And in fact that's my challenge for you.

119
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,530
I'd like you to make get a briefcase case work create a way to track of the player has a briefcase.

120
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,450
Now there's a bunch of different ways to do this and that's going to show you quite a sneaky one.

121
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,360
So feel free to get creative in this instance.

122
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,310
There are a bunch of right answers.

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,090
Don't worry if yours doesn't match mine.

124
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,590
But pause the video may get briefcase work and when you come back I show you my solution.

125
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,450
OK Mac.

126
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,190
So how will I do this.

127
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,470
Well there's a few ways as I said before one thing we could do is we could make an instance variable

128
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,460
make a call it got a briefcase and set that to false right.

129
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,300
And then we go back to them on a script and we could just set that to true.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,600
Okay.

131
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,180
That will work.

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:14,450
Another thing we could do is we could create a dictionary or an array called inventory and we could

133
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,130
either make it an array or we could make a dictionary and have them numbered and then we could add them

134
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,020
to the array or add them to the dictionary.

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,360
That will work fine too.

136
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:31,460
However let's actually use got strengths got an object oriented language so when we use an object what

137
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm going to do if we go over to level 1 I'm going to create a child of player called node.

138
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,710
And when we need to track if the object is there we're just going to look in player and take a look.

139
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,660
How do we do that.

140
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,130
Well nice and easy.

141
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,330
Let's get back down to our Got brief collect briefcase function.

142
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,560
And within this function we make a new variable called Lift.

143
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,470
Loopt not a lot.

144
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:07,550
And Lute is going to be a node that's going to get created right so node.

145
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,430
So it's a it's the basic node type right.

146
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,580
So the simplest node we can make and Dot new means make a new one.

147
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:22,880
Now I'm going to loot dot Saturn Lane and then only give it is brief case.

148
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,000
So what I've done is I've told it OK when I'm saying the word lute.

149
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,770
What I mean is a brand new node.

150
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,260
OK.

151
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,340
So make a brandnew node and set the name to briefcase.

152
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,090
Now add it as a child.

153
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,770
Of the node running the script.

154
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,610
So the player is going to quit brandnew node called briefcase.

155
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,130
So let's take a look if that works.

156
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,310
Now obviously we can't just see it come up on the go because we haven't program that yet.

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,550
But if I press play.

158
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,640
And over on the scene tree while the game is running I wanna hit remote and this is what's happening

159
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,020
right now in the scenery.

160
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,380
So I got out a player.

161
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,200
He can see everything that's happening on the player right now.

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,490
Let's move over to the briefcase.

163
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,680
Look right here.

164
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,880
We've created a brand new node called briefcase.

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,670
It is a child of play.

166
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,200
That's really exciting because now when we go back to the exit we can give the exit the script.

167
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,710
So let's create a brand new script on exit and I put it in my scripts folder.

168
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,950
Do do do do de is can we call it OK.

169
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,680
So now let's go to area to Dee and connect that as a signal to its parrots are on body entered connect

170
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
to the exit.

171
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,550
OK.

172
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,270
So let's get sneaky the players going to enter this area and we're going to assume it's the play and

173
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:48,930
we want to check.

174
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,510
Do you have the briefcase you can't leave if you don't have it.

175
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,780
So if body.

176
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,170
So how would we do this.

177
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,710
Well this too has node briefcase.

178
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,520
And right now we don't have a game over a game one screen we can make those soon so let's make it just

179
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,440
print.

180
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,710
You have a briefcase.

181
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,410
So take a look what's happening here.

182
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,290
We're checking if the body that entered which in this case is the player because only the player can

183
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,470
has a child node has a node with the name briefcase then run this condition.

184
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,760
Let's see how it works out.

185
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,380
So here I am in night vision mode and we can see what's happening.

186
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,700
I can walk into the exit.

187
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,870
Nothing happens but I pick up the briefcase and walk back in.

188
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,730
You have a briefcase.

189
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,640
Phenomenal.

190
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,260
We're now set up to actually have a victory condition.

191
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,940
So next time I do is I to move my briefcase to a more interesting location.

192
00:11:51,940 --> 00:12:00,250
Let's do that let's take my briefcase let's move and drag it all the way down to the sophis.

193
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,220
Which currently isn't locked.

194
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,450
So next thing I do is grab my locked door.

195
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,070
Hit E for rotation mode.

196
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,890
That way up looks good don't they.

197
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,350
It has to be on the side doesn't it.

198
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,940
OK.

199
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,530
So this computer now works for these doors.

200
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,210
Let's move that computer.

201
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,140
Actually let's put it here.

202
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,040
Let's make the plate do all kinds of weird running around rotates.

203
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,690
Yeah.

204
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,390
Perfect.

205
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,740
And that brings us to the end of this video we've now created an object oriented approach to an inventory

206
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,810
rather than create an array or a dictionary.

207
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:44,370
We can just use the same tree and then has node to check if the player or whatever else actually has

208
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,030
what we want.

209
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:52,080
You could put in multiple loop type so you put in a briefcase a suitcase purging cat painting now just

210
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,850
grabbing loot from the excellent boardgame burglar Brothers which I read you recommend either way.

211
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,910
Why not share your level as it is now what kind of loot have you got in there.

212
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,600
How many types of loot.

213
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,490
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
