00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.030
Hello wonderful people in this video we're going to put flaws in our level by the end of this video.

2
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.320
We're going to have a lot more detail on our level with these really cool looking floors and we'll be

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.340
able to change the floors just by painting them using tile maps.

4
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.640
And quickly use auto tiles to tweak our level to add for example this lovely janitor's closet which

5
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.530
needs a floor.

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.200
Like that.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200
We're going to start working towards light and shadow.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.400
But for that to work we need a place for light to fall it's very hard to know if your light shadow working

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.350
less you can see where the light is and isn't.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.180
So we need some floors to do that.

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.780
We're going to make some simple tile maps.

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.990
Now you might be thinking all we just learned how to auto tile.

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.000
Why not use auto tyre while my time being.

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.150
The short answer is we don't really need an auto tile.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.350
There's no need for a bit mask here so we don't need the tile to change depending on what's around it.

16
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.040
That and we're only really going to have a few variations to use at any one time so we may as well just

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.570
paint them manually.

18
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.640
So nice and easy.

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.940
Let's get to it.

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.500
First thing I do is make a new scene.

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.260
I could use this waltzing.

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.290
However every tile is going to need a new Sprite.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.490
So that's going to mess up what we've already done.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
Not mess up necessarily but it doesn't feel quite right.

25
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640
Anyway I've named this one walls using it for floors.

26
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.690
Not the best practice.

27
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.940
So let's make a brand new song and our brand new scene is going to have a note to d route.

28
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.560
Remember this won't work unless the root isn't too deep.

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:46.000
And we called this flaws and one of the do is go into graphics into PRNG into tiles.

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.250
And I'm just going select some floor tiles.

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.380
I'm actually going to select all of these wouldn't tiles like this and just drag them in and they all

32
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.930
come in as sprites.

33
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.290
I can go and rename if I want but they're all in there.

34
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.470
This is ready to go.

35
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.320
Now you might be thinking but why do we put them all underneath like this don't we want to you know

36
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.880
make sure that we can see them.

37
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.620
Not really.

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.020
It doesn't matter what the layout is here.

39
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.410
What matters is they're all here and that they're properly so there.

40
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.990
Speaking of properties we don't need collision maps and we don't need any kind of occlusion right.

41
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.480
The floor won't cast shadow.

42
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.220
So this really is ready to go.

43
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:35.930
So open a safe at inseams floors and seen convert to tile set in my tells its folder because this floor

44
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.450
tiles your sorry can be very clear this is a filter and I must use dot.

45
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.970
TR Yes.

46
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.940
Now back in level one a brain child node in this is another tile map and this one be called floors.

47
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.210
Almost ready to go back into my room folder.

48
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.810
It tile sets drag the floors into here and then they all are.

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.770
Now there's one more thing to do before we get started because right now the floors are over the wall

50
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.810
so I'm just going to put them right at the top of the level Remember unless we tell it otherwise.

51
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.960
Got us going assume that anything the bottom of the list is on top where Remember it is.

52
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm standing right here with no ideas and I'm looking this way so this is the order I'm seeing things

53
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.240
and now I can just paint my level.

54
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.380
It doesn't matter if I get underneath the walls like this.

55
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.670
If I zoom out.

56
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.970
I have this nice floor effect.

57
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.100
I just left clicking to add things right clicking to take them away.

58
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.480
If I wanted to I could do it.

59
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.710
Nice little square like this and you like it phil..

60
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.210
And back to paint.

61
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.590
How so.

62
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.330
I now have the option of having different rooms having different floor covers.

63
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.980
So far so good.

64
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.060
Quick tip though.

65
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.650
I want this to look a little bit more realistic so one I do.

66
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.010
I'm actually going to put in some variations to the floor just every now and again.

67
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.350
Nothing major just a couple of little you know details.

68
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.480
Let's put some more in this one.

69
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.260
This and Abby Downey one isn't it.

70
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.680
I think I've got an I'll be done in detail.

71
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.240
There we go down in detail and the dark wood.

72
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.580
Now I'm actually probably not going to keep this looking like this but it's easy enough to change right

73
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.660
because now I've got my walls and let's say these pillars are in the wrong place because they actually

74
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.790
are.

75
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.470
They go like this.

76
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.560
Maybe I want a side room down here.

77
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.030
Well that's easy enough.

78
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.770
And you know what.

79
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.530
This is a reception room to someone's big office.

80
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.140
There's a nice big office and let's put some flooring in.

81
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.710
And he's going to outline like so and use paint fell.

82
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.200
Well not paint tile.

83
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.250
They're bigger.

84
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.990
Look at that.

85
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.900
Really quick an easy way to make detailed levels.

86
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.680
Right we can tweak we can change if I decide that this room needs to be a little bit bigger like so.

87
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.160
Just make sure you actually got this task light and I keep forgetting to do that.

88
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.000
Let's put some flooring there and you'll notice in the tiles as well.

89
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.000
And that was the wrong floor.

90
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.420
So it's easy enough to change.

91
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.660
That's this one isn't it.

92
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.070
There we go.

93
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.170
You'll notice by the way if we go back to the floor scene and into the graphics which I've put over

94
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.670
here in tiles We've also got some grass that you could use a carpet if you wanted to.

95
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.760
But I think at this point that's everything we really need to know.

96
00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.660
So my challenge to you install some flooring I'd like you to put a floor in your level.

97
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.160
Feel free to tweak your walls and don't forget to add variety to your floor tiles every now and again

98
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.980
so it doesn't feel quite so repetitive.

99
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.760
So pause the video put the floors in and when you come back we'll close the video out.

100
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.170
Welcome back.

101
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:20.980
In this video we looked at how to work with tiles tile maps and auto tiles at the same time.

102
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.420
So really great work.

103
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.490
And we're now in a position where we can start adding lighting to level.

104
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.430
Don't forget the show we've got so far.

105
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.730
Love to see it so put it in the dischord group.

106
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.860
When the Facebook group or in the community forum and fantastic work and I'll see you in the next video.
