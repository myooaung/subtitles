00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.210
Hello again you whimsical go to people.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.420
I don't know why I said whimsical.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.580
I like the adjectives in this video I'm going to continue to work on the numb pads going to wire them

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.220
up.

5
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.750
We're going to pick a combination.

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.390
No not generate them randomly yet.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.090
We're gonna pick the traditional combination of stealth games 0 4 5 1 which you've ever played any 3

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.010
4 days X game should be quite familiar and was apparently the number combination to doses front door

9
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.380
for a while.

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.830
We're going to make the number pad check if that's the right combination and then open the door if it

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.250
is to do that we need to know a couple of things.

12
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.680
First what is the deal with the buttons.

13
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.760
Well we need to know the buttons each have to do a different thing.

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.600
So each of our buttons has to be wired up to provide a different input and the display has to update

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.860
for each number button.

16
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.350
To do this we have to make extensive use of arrays.

17
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.330
Now you might be asking yourself why would we make the combination in array a couple of things.

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.140
One this means that we can make combinations of different size.

19
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.290
So an easy deal might have three a difficult one might have four an impossible.

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.750
We have eight.

21
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.460
We also on the number pad to check a guess ether enough buttons press.

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.800
So if the if this particular combination is six digits long on the sixth press check it.

23
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.170
Press okay.

24
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.960
And this is gonna be easier to handle by using the size function of arrays.

25
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.260
Okay.

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.030
So let's get to it.

27
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.520
First one address is we have this big number pad the middle that really want that.

28
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.530
Let's get rid of it.

29
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.480
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up the locked door and I'm just going to hide the number plate

30
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.070
pop up save this and go back in and it's hidden by default.

31
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.980
It still exists.

32
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.670
It's just hidden.

33
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.140
So I'm fine with that.

34
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.680
Next it will do is we need to go into our number pad.

35
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.410
So to do that when I go to locked door and open up the number of had seen and this needs a script that's

36
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.640
going to script nice blank script called number pad in the interface that looks good to me.

37
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.210
Here it is.

38
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.310
Let's start with the variables we know we're gonna need.

39
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.700
I'm coming to distraction free mode here.

40
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.210
First thing we need we need a combination.

41
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.140
And as I said earlier I'm going to use an array.

42
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.770
Now we've looked at arrays race before so that you're quite familiar as an array of integers so zero

43
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.020
comma four comma five comma one.

44
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.520
So now it knows I'm an array.

45
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.110
I have four entries and they all happen to be integers because this has got it they don't all have to

46
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.550
be integers.

47
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.500
This could be an A for example possibly an A but in this particular case that all integers.

48
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.960
I also want a blank array.

49
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.210
Should we call guests.

50
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.410
And that's where we get to store the information.

51
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.300
So when we're in this particular number pad and we're pressing the buttons that was going to happen.

52
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.240
Let's take a quick look at a number pad because couple more things I want.

53
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.380
The first thing into 2D mode is I want this display.

54
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.010
So let's go into the display container have actually renamed it rename it display.

55
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.580
There it is.

56
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.330
And I gonna make sure this is always aligned to the center.

57
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.940
So whatever's in here will be centered and let's just make sure that we're extending out here.

58
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.900
So I'm going to go to size flags and on the horizontal we can expand.

59
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.590
So if this gets bigger it'll just take up the right amount of room.

60
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.610
Second thing on is I want this light.

61
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.750
So let's go in here and I'm going to use on ready variable.

62
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.270
Now this is useful if I'm using a component that hasn't loaded in yet when got a loads it'll load from

63
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:27.380
the top of the same tree run this script and I keep loading display and this status light aren't in

64
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.940
there yet.

65
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.960
So what I would say is use this as a variable the moment you're ready don't bother checking if it's

66
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.190
there.

67
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.980
So we'll have a display and this is going to be a dollar sign.

68
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.660
And then you could drag the display across and you read the quotation marks is.

69
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.630
Don't need them.

70
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.620
That's my display.

71
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.050
And do the exact same thing with the status light on ready just call status light

72
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.480
quit light statist light is redundant.

73
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.090
And that's just going to be La la la la la.

74
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.200
Where did you go.

75
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.750
Here come back.

76
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.200
No no no.

77
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.400
Get back in the script huh.

78
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.780
Ok fine.

79
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.190
There we go.

80
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.050
Done why I was doing that but we fixed it.

81
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.770
It's all good.

82
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.430
You could also by the way just right click on it and go to copy nose path and put it in that way.

83
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.960
But I want to drag it so I dragged it it says oh I forgot what the word variable in this light was a

84
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.250
lot of work was it OK.

85
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.130
That light is now there.

86
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.520
All right.

87
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.280
Now we need the door to open when the guess is the same as the combination.

88
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.500
Easiest way to do this is with the signal.

89
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.330
So if I go back to a locked door saying I can wire a signal from number pad to locked door except no

90
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.860
pad doesn't is a pop up and there's nothing here that will actually tell me the combinations correct.

91
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.070
We have to create that in script to do that.

92
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.810
Nice and simple.

93
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.700
I just need to make a new signal means the signal key word and call it combination.

94
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.710
Correct.

95
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.390
Not connect.

96
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.100
Now let's save the script and just make sure I'm in the right scene.

97
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.960
I am and I seem to get back to locked door.

98
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.370
You should now see that there's a brand new combination and I can just connect that so many connect

99
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.750
that to locked door and what's going to happen is nice and easy open.

100
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.590
We know what open is because it's in the door G.D. script.

101
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.070
So going can run the open function indoors G.D. when it gets this signal.

102
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.430
Once again that signal when we tell it to in the script.

103
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.110
So that's nice and easy.

104
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.370
All right let's talk about what we're gonna need to do the first thing to do is make sure all the buttons

105
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.610
are wired in on the number pad.

106
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.960
Now we could do it this way right.

107
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.400
We could go inside.

108
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.150
Button one get oppressed to connect.

109
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.990
Don't do this by the way.

110
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.610
I'm just demonstrating what I could do and then get a button to get a pressed and then get a button

111
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.080
three and get a press.

112
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.360
And this is really irritating not least of which because the code in here is going to be largely similar

113
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.040
probably identical.

114
00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.140
This is a real waste of time and effort any time you find yourself repeating code like this.

115
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.360
There's probably an easier way and always go for the easy way the easy way is more efficient more elegant.

116
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.930
It is not as elegant encoding so I'm going to disconnect these signals just made

117
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840
and get rid of all that zombie code.

118
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.210
I don't need by based on my code.

119
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.230
OK.

120
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.420
So what's the better way of doing this.

121
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.050
Well let's make a ready function and that ready function.

122
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.250
I'm going to call a brand new function called Connect buttons.

123
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.950
So what is a function connects buttons What do you do.

124
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.830
Nope.

125
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.260
Buttons typing is easy today.

126
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.900
It's not easy at all online.

127
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.340
OK.

128
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.150
What I want to do is I want to tell it go to this grid container and then get all of these children.

129
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.840
And if they're buttons then why are the minutes connections.

130
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.600
OK.

131
00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:03.450
To do that I'm going to use a full loop a for loop says for whatever this criterion is for criteria

132
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.240
in whatever I'm doing then keep doing this.

133
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.520
So every time this criteria in this range or whatever this is is true.

134
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.690
Run the following code.

135
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:23.220
So in this case I would say for child because I'm counting the children in I'm not in his range I'm

136
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.760
going to use this great container right here.

137
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.180
So let's go to sign.

138
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.590
I'm going to drag the green container in boop.

139
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.360
Aha.

140
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.780
That's so nice.

141
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.570
OK.

142
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.480
So I'm going get the grid container and I'm going to get children.

143
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.150
Let's just make this nice big again.

144
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.600
OK.

145
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:50.430
So this what child could be anything I could call it for button I shouldn't do that and I'll show you

146
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.060
why.

147
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.850
Because now I need to check if the button is a button.

148
00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.990
I don't want to wire in this status light.

149
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.340
I only want wiring the buttons.

150
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:05.760
And if I write if button and then I can use the keyword is and that's going to say if it's a type of

151
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.220
node if it's a class and the type of note I want is capital B UTC or n.

152
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.740
And if button is button is a really silly bit of coding makes perfect sense.

153
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.830
Gotta be fine with it.

154
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:17.520
I'm fine with it.

155
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.110
But now I've got button with a lowercase be a pop with them uppercase B and they mean different things

156
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.210
in the same function.

157
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.150
And it's a really bad idea.

158
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.850
I only use child for child in a grid container.

159
00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.380
All these children so for every child is its container.

160
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:40.410
Check if the child is of the type of button then what I need to do is connect it as a signal.

161
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:46.930
Okay so I only use child dot connect which is exactly the same as wiring an existing signal.

162
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:53.140
And now I need a few things are cyclical what we need we need the string of the signal itself where

163
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.400
it's going.

164
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.520
What the method the function is.

165
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.310
And any arguments we want to bring in.

166
00:08:59.320 --> 00:08:59.580
Okay.

167
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.450
Well let's take a look at these.

168
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.570
First we need is the string.

169
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.470
I mean use the buttons signal pressed and I could see this if I want you by going out to free mode and

170
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.850
looking at their existing signals and that's pressed with lowercase P..

171
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.730
Exactly as it is.

172
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.200
So that's going to use that signal.

173
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.210
Okay.

174
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.410
So where it was targeting its target itself.

175
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.240
And I need a function for it to go to call it button.

176
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.520
Let me use a capital B pressed.

177
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.810
And finally I need to give it a value.

178
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.510
And this is the smart bet that I'm really fond of.

179
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.250
I'm going to use child dot text.

180
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.060
See what we're doing is we're using the label information that we've put on the button itself.

181
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.140
Let's take a look at it.

182
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.660
Hello loud truck and whatever this whatever is written on the button will not be transmitted.

183
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.750
This means you could make no pads with letters words phrases whatever you want.

184
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:56.500
And as long as those texts in there it will now send that text across.

185
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.860
Okay so now let's make the button press function

186
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.110
with a capital B and come on.

187
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.020
So the problem with doing it this way and with bringing this arguments I'm going to call this button

188
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.150
because remember what it's called here and what it's called here doesn't matter.

189
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.630
What matters is the value that's passed through before we do this code let's just figure out what else

190
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.300
we need.

191
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.400
I need to press the buttons I need to check if the guesses is right so let's make a function called

192
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.940
to check guests

193
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.950
and who's going to write pass in here.

194
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.550
This gives us lots of space.

195
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.850
Just get res tabs.

196
00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:36.190
There we go.

197
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.900
OK what else we need we need when you're entering information.

198
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.530
So function and just call it enter for now.

199
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.120
And I want to update the display right.

200
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:54.870
So when I'm pressing the button have the numbers to show so it's got a function Update display.

201
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.750
One more thing I do want to do.

202
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.550
There we go.

203
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.800
One more thing I do want to do is want to make sure that the lock resets itself whenever we've finished

204
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.520
entering a guest.

205
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:12.760
So the guest is right or wrong or if I leave the number pad and come back I want that guest to reset.

206
00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:19.600
So we need a way of resetting the lock like a function reset lock.

207
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.130
There is one more thing I do want to put Emma we'll leave that for now.

208
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.760
These are the key functions right.

209
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.280
So let's start with what happens when a button is pressed well first most of these buttons are numbers

210
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.110
but one isn't.

211
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.860
One is OK let's kind of distraction free mode real quick and just see what the button.

212
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.100
Okay.

213
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.030
Text is I'm going to copy this because the way I've capitalized it does matter.

214
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.370
We are now comparing strings and we need to be precise.

215
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.590
Okay.

216
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:53.840
So if button is equal to remember two equals compare a value one equal set of value is equal to.

217
00:11:53.840 --> 00:12:02.320
Okay then want to check the guests if it's not then I want to suggest something else.

218
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.360
I want to run the enter function and I want to pass through whatever button if pressed so I will not

219
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.300
run that as an argument.

220
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.510
So say you can't do that.

221
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:16.810
You've got too many arguments let's just put it in here OK quick issue here.

222
00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:22.810
When I'm doing this I need to compare numbers because remember these are integers right these are numbers

223
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:29.280
but these on the button are taxed as strings we need to cost that some cost.

224
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.650
This button value as an integer which can put spaces you can see it easily don't need the spaces in.

225
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.970
This is gonna turn whatever string is into an integer.

226
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:47.450
Be advised this means that if any of your buttons don't have an integer and are not okay we're going

227
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.230
to crash.

228
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.720
So if you've written banana banana is not an integer banana is infinite.

229
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.160
Sorry.

230
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.510
Then what you minions again.

231
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.710
All right let's go through these in order.

232
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.980
So next we've got is check.

233
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.430
Guess what.

234
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.420
Check guest do.

235
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:04.790
Well the first thing that is to say if the guest is the same as the combination if the guest is the

236
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.580
same as a combination then we just need to send that information across.

237
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.820
Right.

238
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:16.500
So I'm just going to go to emit signal combination correct and that's all it is to do.

239
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.840
I am going to change that in a moment.

240
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.700
I mean he's a timer at the moment so that you can see it's is there and then the panel will hide and

241
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.940
then the door open just to give people feedback.

242
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.870
But for now that'll work.

243
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:28.040
What else do you do.

244
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.510
OK.

245
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.930
That's actually the bare minimum we need for check.

246
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.960
Guess we will fancy that up in just a moment.

247
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.640
What if it's not what if it's not then I need to reset the lock.

248
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:45.500
OK so if you typed in 0 4 5 2 by mistake he shouldn't say 0 4 5 2 0 4 5 1 because you will never be

249
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.250
able to get that right.

250
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.840
So now we can reset that.

251
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.970
OK.

252
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.200
So let's get to entry the button.

253
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:57.200
Well first thing I do is I can to a guess dot a pen because this is an array.

254
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.980
And what's the information the button.

255
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.090
So whatever value you've pressed append that to the array once you've done that we want to update the

256
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.780
display.

257
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.210
So let's put optic display in there.

258
00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:07.480
OK.

259
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.490
Updating the display.

260
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:11.680
Well I want the display text

261
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.420
to be the guess.

262
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.570
Except we've got two different kinds of variables.

263
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.870
Guess he's an array of integers.

264
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.460
Right.

265
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.770
So we at least see an array of integers because we need to see if it's the same as combination.

266
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:35.250
Text can't display integers and it can't display arrays so we need a way of turning an array of integers

267
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.680
into a string.

268
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:44.730
To do that we're going to use a very specialized cast or pool string array like a quick look at that

269
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.730
pull string array is an array specifically designed to hold a string.

270
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:56.540
In other words we can put this array in here and then use join to turn it into a single piece of information.

271
00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:01.860
Now what we're doing here is when a join and the argument we use is a blank string.

272
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.180
No space nothing.

273
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.880
So we'll now display whatever those integers are as a single string so the entire array we turn to one

274
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.590
string all right.

275
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.470
So currently we have it.

276
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.220
So if you press Okay we'll check the gas but what if you've typed in enough numbers let's do that as

277
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:15.460
well.

278
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:27.140
If the gas dot signs whose size is equal to the combination size then check the gas.

279
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.830
That is a column.

280
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.780
Check gas.

281
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:31.220
Great.

282
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.090
Okay.

283
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.380
Now let's take a quick look at resetting the lock.

284
00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.560
First thing I do is I want to get the display text

285
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.480
to be a blank string.

286
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.070
I also want to clear the gas.

287
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:50.410
So whatever the gas is so the gas has to be blank.

288
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.540
You do need to do both.

289
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.030
If you just do one of these the other won't happen.

290
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:59.080
We could clear the gas and the text will have labels on it before we clear the text but the gas is what

291
00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.760
it's comparing to.

292
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.740
Not the text.

293
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.540
Okay.

294
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:03.790
Couple a little bit of timing on ready.

295
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:09.580
I'm going to reset the lock right here so that's just gonna empty out the display and getting ready

296
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.860
for us and that should be the bare minimum.

297
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.260
Let's take a look see if I mess this up.

298
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.210
I might mess this up.

299
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.220
I have mess this up to see what I've done.

300
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.940
I hope I see one of them.

301
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.520
Okay.

302
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.740
That's my fault.

303
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.220
On this trying to connect this child text is actually part of an array.

304
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.820
All the arguments being passed are in an array so it can't just be a string.

305
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.610
It has to be an array.

306
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.310
It can be an array with nothing but a string in it.

307
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.450
That's perfectly fine.

308
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.940
Now let's try and OK everything's looking good.

309
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:44.410
When I go into this mode for a minute get down to this door and here's some buttons pardon me gods.

310
00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.150
What they may do makes a little bit easier for myself.

311
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.610
I mean you're back to level 1 in 2 demoed why is the number of backup going.

312
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.210
Thank you.

313
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.550
I'm going gonna grab this door is locked or go to move mode.

314
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.630
You move up here so I can play with it a little bit easier.

315
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.980
A second look at that again.

316
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.550
And we have 0 4 5 1.

317
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.420
Door opens and this will fade when I move it out.

318
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:18.730
So now I want a way of fading that's out when we leave we'll do something as a locked door script so

319
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:19.420
you can see here.

320
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.100
Anybody exited.

321
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.220
We're hiding the number pad.

322
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.030
We'll do the exact same thing if the combination is correct socially and part which is the height.

323
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.770
There we go.

324
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.560
So now if I get this right the love a pad will vanish

325
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.500
looking good.

326
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.810
OK.

327
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.860
Now let's add a little bit of juice a little bit of polish to our game.

328
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.950
Let's get back to the number I had seen and I want to add a couple of things.

329
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:51.940
The first thing that we can control a is I want to add an audio stream player.

330
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.510
I don't want the 2D or the 3D.

331
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.760
And studied I want to use this as a 3D game.

332
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.090
I don't look too deep because I has position information.

333
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.680
This isn't based on what's happening in the level as opposed to it's over.

334
00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.220
This isn't based on where things are right so if I'm opening a number pad I don't want to hear it to

335
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.120
the right the left.

336
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.370
This is hard information.

337
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.560
This is game information.

338
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:17.340
So when you use audio stream player and if we get into SFX you'll see here there are these two different

339
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.800
sound effects as two tone one and three tone one I just press that

340
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.570
and Ellen

341
00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.850
one thing you notice they're looping down them looping.

342
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:37.650
That's like both of them get to input switch off loop and press re import remembers plus report.

343
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.620
OK so we have these two sounds let's sets you don't want to set these in script much easier.

344
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:50.600
So now when we what's going to happen we press the button that's feels like good place.

345
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.710
Let's go and pick the audio string player which is right here.

346
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.190
Dot string.

347
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.760
That's the sound effects using equals.

348
00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.980
And this is a file.

349
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.900
So we need to use load to cast the string them about to bring in as a file.

350
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.160
OK.

351
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.190
So I'm pressing a button I'm thinking the two tone one Yeah that looks good.

352
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.140
I bring that in there.

353
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.860
And that should be it boop.

354
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.040
Now we need to actually play it.

355
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.090
So let's go.

356
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.360
All you string plan.

357
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.760
Don't play.

358
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.020
And when we check the gas if it's correct.

359
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.860
Right here.

360
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.700
Let's go.

361
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:31.160
Audio Stream player dot stream equals load because it's not a string.

362
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.100
It's a file and a drag this one in here.

363
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:35.770
Right.

364
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.180
That

365
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.130
you drag this in here.

366
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.350
There goes.

367
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.850
And let's play it.

368
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.780
So audio stream player don't play.

369
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.110
So now we should have some sound effects

370
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.260
quite fond of that.

371
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:00.530
Good.

372
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:00.990
OK.

373
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.140
One more thing want to do.

374
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.840
Let's take a look at this.

375
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.760
Number pad in 2D.

376
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.410
We have this light right.

377
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.680
And we've got it already lined up as a variable.

378
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.160
I want this to go green.

379
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.070
When we're ready to go and in order for the player to see that because this is vanishing remember the

380
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:17.790
combinations right.

381
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.380
We need to delay the combination correct signal being sent.

382
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.440
So that's my challenge to you.

383
00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.020
I would like you to have the light on the number pad.

384
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.880
Turn green.

385
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:35.070
If the combination is correct use timer mode and delay the combination correct signal being sent when

386
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:38.400
that light goes green so pulls the video give it a shot.

387
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:44.870
And when you're ready I'll show you my solution.

388
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.330
All right.

389
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.530
Let's see what we can do.

390
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.200
So back into it.

391
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.810
And I'm gonna come out of this view because this is the wrong view.

392
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.320
First they need to do is I need to make sure I have the right light.

393
00:20:54.330 --> 00:21:04.370
So back into graphics to interface into P and G and we've got right here the area dot red and Dot great.

394
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.950
These are the two I want maybe a different color if you prefer but I mean he's not red dot green.

395
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.560
Admittedly red and green as I've said before really bad colors for critical information but it's tradition

396
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.030
also.

397
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.370
I'm going to stick with it for now.

398
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.070
OK.

399
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:23.070
Let's open a script and what I want to do is I don't need this output for a start and I can press control

400
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.600
and backslash to get rid of that window could mess up a little bit more space.

401
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.410
OK.

402
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:34.030
So on reset lock I'm going to reset the light color to dot red.

403
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:36.630
To do that I'm going to go.

404
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.680
Status lights.

405
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.740
I call it sounds like I call it light dim light.

406
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.870
Light and I call it light I call it light.

407
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.260
OK good and I won't affect its texture.

408
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.380
How do I know it's the texture.

409
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.050
I can take a look at it.

410
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.720
I can press state as light and mouse over it.

411
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.990
And that's the property I want.

412
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.200
Good.

413
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.010
OK.

414
00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.850
So what's it going to be.

415
00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.350
It's going to be load because it's a file of a string.

416
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.440
And then I can just drag that in.

417
00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:58.770
Great.

418
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:09.060
So now if the combination is correct right here we can just go white dot texture

419
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:17.690
equals load and then drag in the green one so far so good.

420
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.380
Whoops.

421
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.490
What am I doing.

422
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.240
I put it in the audio player.

423
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.120
No no no good.

424
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.480
So that's going to be good.

425
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.530
But we probably won't see it.

426
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:25.980
Here's why.

427
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.710
We'll go in here.

428
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.930
I'm going to poop.

429
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.900
Never saw it.

430
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.890
I'm sure it happened.

431
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:33.760
We didn't see it.

432
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.010
So I'm going to add a bright new note as a child and I'm pattern at a timer.

433
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:42.680
I was control a timer set the timer as a one shot and I to connect the signal.

434
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:49.930
So on time it time out up to the number pad you don't need all of these and we certainly don't need

435
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.440
that theme information.

436
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.810
All right.

437
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.090
So now I can take a mixed signal conversion.

438
00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.090
Correct.

439
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.770
Cut it and just put it right here on time a timeout.

440
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.920
And now where that was I can go timer dot stopped.

441
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:14.580
Now this can be a one second pause between the gasping months correct and that's the signal being sent

442
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:15.670
so take a look how that looks

443
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:27.210
are quite fond of that back over here.

444
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:27.880
What time.

445
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:28.510
Zero.

446
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.660
It didn't clear need to check that don't I.

447
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.000
OK.

448
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.590
So when the guess is correct when you start the timer I also need to reset the lock.

449
00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.740
I'm really glad to check that.

450
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:43.700
Let's take one more look I've just realized that I think very silly I've just undone the green light

451
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.330
thing look red.

452
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.000
Why.

453
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.970
Because reset lock switches it to red.

454
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.240
OK.

455
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.610
So we're just gonna take this out and put it on time a timeout.

456
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.610
There we go.

457
00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.800
Let's just pretend I never did that one more time as if I had a brain over here.

458
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.150
0 4 5 1 green light vanishes.

459
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:10.730
DOOR OPENS which means you have a second off to get the combination correct which means you'd better

460
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.520
hope there's no one behind you.

461
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:12.950
There we go.

462
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.470
We now have wired indoors I can read combinations

463
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.580
in this video.

464
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.290
We've looked at how to make four loops.

465
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:26.930
We've looked at wiring multiple child nodes using a full loop and an IS statement checking a node if

466
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.860
it's a specific type.

467
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.070
If child is button and we've played with pull string array and join some excellent work.

468
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.140
And I'll see you on the next video.
