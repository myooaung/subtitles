1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,820
Hello again you delight forgotten people.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,560
Let's finish happy days.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,720
Let's give the player a way of beat in the game.

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:14,400
In this video we're gonna talk about portals and particles what's going to happen is the player's going

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
to hit a portal which is going to be emitting particles.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,270
Let's start by talking about the design of our portal players going gonna beat the level if Bunny touches

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,810
the portal.

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,630
It's an exit a goal.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,480
The portal is going to float right.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Just hang in the air so give us a slight animation.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:29,950
Nothing major.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,130
Just something to you know make it look like it's magical and drifting.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,170
Speaking of magical the portal is going to emit particles little sprites that float around the place

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,940
with a nice beautiful magical thing finding it hard to find the words for it.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,720
Let's just do it.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,930
See how it looks.

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,580
Before we go into that though we should design an end screen right.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,890
We need a scene to go to if the player wins.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,960
Now if we look in levels we've actually got a scene very like that we've got game over.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,690
Try again.

21
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,880
We could make a copy of this scene.

22
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,600
Call it victory a sort of game over.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,850
Say you win or victory is mine or hooray for bunnies and instead of try again play again.

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,830
How would we do that.

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,910
Well what we'll do is we have seen and we go new inherited scene.

26
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,970
Okay what's the base scene.

27
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,990
What scene I'm inheriting from I'm inheriting from game over which is the default.

28
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,710
Great.

29
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:28,450
Open that and we're now in a brand new scene which I'm going to call victory and save that in the same

30
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,780
place and you'll see here that everything is great out everything that is great out is what's being

31
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,710
inherited.

32
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,380
Just like if I go to Level 1 if I go to any of these instant scenes and see the player go right click

33
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:47,730
editable children and then open it up everything that I'm instantly into the scene is great out.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,960
Let's just get rid of the children that really need it right now.

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
What this tells me is I can change any of these things and I'll be able to see the changes for example

36
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,080
in this text box here or is his game over.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,370
Let's just say you win and I'll try again.

38
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,410
I could write play again.

39
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:09,850
You'll notice everything has recent in itself because we use the right containers when we made the UI

40
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,520
element.

41
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,340
So that is actually good to go.

42
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,810
We now have a scene we can go to.

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,730
So that done let's make a brand new scene.

44
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,270
And this will be a 2D scene.

45
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:24,520
I'm going to call it portal and let's save that and let's say the under what's a portal maybe an item

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,100
I guess is an item similar to that.

47
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,370
OK.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,100
So we have a nice empty scene with nothing in it.

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,210
Well we need an area 2D and that's going to need a sprite.

50
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,440
Why not an animated sprite.

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,670
I thought going to enemy this well.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,070
Because if we look into graphics and items you'll see that we have a portal here but there's only one

53
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,780
sprite for it is only one pitch.

54
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,070
So I will put my portal in here.

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,960
And here is my portal.

56
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,080
And let's give that a collision shape.

57
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,140
So collision shape 2D.

58
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,050
There we are.

59
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,810
And we just make this nice simple rectangle it doesn't matter too much if this is pixel perfect.

60
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,160
If Bunny lands here we're going to assume the bunny wants to land in.

61
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,300
Maybe make a little bit smaller.

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,550
Yeah.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,110
Let's get can hide that.

64
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,590
OK.

65
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:22,170
So we want to animate this let's put an animation player and make a new animation called portal stretch.

66
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,520
That's a strange name but it'll do for now.

67
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,510
Two seconds.

68
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:30,730
Going to auto play and loop and it can just have a one second step.

69
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,080
That's fine.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Go to my area 2D transform and on the scale.

71
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,510
I'm just gonna create a key right there and one second.

72
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,580
What do we just stretch this to one point five and see how that looks.

73
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,520
Make a key there and then I press play.

74
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,540
It's not bad.

75
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,800
It's OK.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Maybe a bit too farther.

77
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,580
Get back to my key and I can change it right here in the key one point two five.

78
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,210
Let's see how that looks.

79
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,650
Yeah that looks pretty good.

80
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,400
OK.

81
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,000
So now I have a very simple little portal I'm just gonna put it into my level so we can see what they

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,420
look like.

83
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,230
I guess now right here's a good place to put it an instance in my portal

84
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,840
and move it to the right place.

85
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,830
I feel like putting it here because that gives us a reason to jump down.

86
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,450
So let's just see if I can actually get to it

87
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,860
took some damage that might do to do my own games a little bit tricky.

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,050
La la la la la Oh took more damage but luckily I got life.

89
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,480
That's OK.

90
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,620
Oh this is surprisingly tense.

91
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,600
I made it.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,790
You are animating nice and subtle.

93
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,020
That looks good.

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,980
OK.

95
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,900
Whatever some particles in it didn't night.

96
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,440
Let's go back to the portal.

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,900
Let's add a new child and this is going to be particles 2D.

98
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,590
And what this is going to do is emit a certain thing.

99
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,510
Now you'll notice right now is a warning straight away.

100
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,790
It says you need a material to process.

101
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,130
There is no material to process material.

102
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,300
It says empty.

103
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,180
This is what is the particle.

104
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,630
Now we can look over here and particles and you'll see we've got this portal yellow particle.

105
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,710
Perfect.

106
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:32,180
Let's make a new particles material click on that and we have everything we need right here.

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,030
So first off it needs texture and we should drag in Portal yellow particle right there.

108
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,110
OK.

109
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,030
Here are our particles.

110
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,810
Now a lot of things we can do with it some of it is going to be inside the material some of it's going

111
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,660
to be in the time so I could give each particle a lifetime.

112
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,780
That's how long will each particle last.

113
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,790
I've told it you're allowed eight particles so at any given point there are eight particles.

114
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,570
After two seconds a particle will die at which point another one will replace it.

115
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:14,400
I could give it a bunch more particles 64 to and it'll calculate what that's going to look like.

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,340
I can also make these one shot which means I'll file once and then they won't replace not what I want

117
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,930
in this case.

118
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,000
So I'm going to do that and let's if I switch that off.

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,940
It's easy to go missing off and on.

120
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,440
OK.

121
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,670
Other things we can do.

122
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,060
I can give it a randomness.

123
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,570
What does that do.

124
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,690
Well if I mouse over it'll tell us emission lifetime.

125
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,220
Randomness ratio.

126
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,440
Okay.

127
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,280
So right now a lifetime of two.

128
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,700
But what if there's some leeway in that.

129
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,940
Now you see some are closer together some further apart.

130
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,670
Okay so I've got a drawing process and we've got all these other things here in mission shape is a good

131
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,900
one right now there's a point.

132
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,290
What if this isn't the point what if this is a sphere.

133
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,450
Well I can't see that right now because they're not moving.

134
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,930
You got gravity that's which gravity of okay.

135
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,100
So we've got them here.

136
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,010
They're in gravity.

137
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,430
Now a sphere radius of one mount.

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,730
That's too small.

139
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,020
That's right 64.

140
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,840
Huh.

141
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,310
Okay.

142
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,090
We have some magic happening it's starting to look a little more like it.

143
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,570
Right.

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,980
And what if we get a velocity let's say initial velocity.

145
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,240
Let's give you initial velocity of 15 I feel like we can have more of these.

146
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm basically just playing with options and see what I can make.

147
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,890
Let's have many more to 24.

148
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,100
Okay.

149
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,590
The kind of drifting how going to get them orbiting.

150
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's give you an orbital velocity.

151
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,680
Well that's fast.

152
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,820
Zero point five zero point two five okay.

153
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,690
What if I get rid of the initial velocity all right.

154
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,850
That's looking a little better.

155
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,130
I feel its fear radius needs to be a bit bigger.

156
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,590
About 80 128 double it.

157
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,420
Okay.

158
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,540
Not too bad now as you can see there's a lot more.

159
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,280
Play with it.

160
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,480
Get it out another radial.

161
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,000
So much good is spreading out so I can do this linkage to the online documentation so if we scroll down

162
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,990
we see larger different settings and examples where they look like you can really customize.

163
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,320
This is a lot you can do with particles and that feels like a good place to but the challenge.

164
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,860
So my challenge to you customize your particles find some settings you like play with it explore the

165
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,530
documentation Don't be afraid to mess around with settings.

166
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,200
Worst case scenario you can just remove the particles 2D and start from scratch.

167
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,680
We'll just press on do a bunch of times so pulls the video customize your portal and when you come back

168
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,820
we'll move on from the

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,290
And welcome back.

170
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,700
OK so we've got everything here except the portal doesn't work right.

171
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:43,220
So if I run a game and I somehow managed to get to the portal without dying which might happen if I

172
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,150
somehow let's just pretend that didn't happen get to my portal without dying

173
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,460
I should have given myself an easier level.

174
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,310
And here my particles but the portal doesn't work right.

175
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,440
So let's actually make it work.

176
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,680
So what we do is first I'm going to go to Level 1 open a script make sure I'm in game state and I need

177
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,240
to add a win game function of the end game was at win game.

178
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,160
And what's this going to do it was going to exactly like a change scene game over but instead of game

179
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,950
over I'm going to change scene victory.

180
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:30,140
OK so just go get tree change theme and just drag victory in here.

181
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,260
La la la la la.

182
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,180
Perfect.

183
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,980
Okay so now we need a way of calling this now a couple of things I could do.

184
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,070
I could use a signal right now.

185
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:46,010
You'll notice that portal the way I've set it up is actually in no 2D no 2D don't have that kind of

186
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,570
signal.

187
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,790
I've got the signals page open here I'm cheating a little bit.

188
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,280
Right so as an area 2D here in the portal seeing right here it has a collision shape.

189
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,200
Let's actually make sure that the collisions are correct so you can interact with players and nothing

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,530
else.

191
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,620
That's great.

192
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,480
Here's my collision.

193
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,510
So funny Internet should do a thing.

194
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,770
Woops let's hide the claw shape.

195
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,840
Great.

196
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,940
I was tempted to use a group.

197
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,060
Now I could use a signal.

198
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,810
I'm not going to use a signal because the area do is not actually the parent I'd have to go to.

199
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,010
Eligible children and then connected from here and I'd have to do that for every level.

200
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,880
Now most platform games don't just have one level so that's going to get quite annoying.

201
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:28,100
So instead I'm going to make a very very very simple script on portal and it's going to go like this.

202
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,690
Create the script and let's connect the area to the signal.

203
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,220
So on body entered you'll connect to portal and I was gonna get 23 dots.

204
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,930
Core group games states I don't think that spelt right let's just double check that it is spelt right

205
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,470
and win games.

206
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Going to copy that so I don't have to go through my weird spelling again.

207
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,650
I'm going to call this function.

208
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,380
OK let's see if this works.

209
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,260
Press Play somehow make it over to that portal.

210
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,090
No I'm not going to die one more time.

211
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,290
Let's pretend that you didn't see that.

212
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,120
I'm very good at games.

213
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
Everything is fine.

214
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,160
I know what I'm doing meant to do that.

215
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,270
Totally meant to do that.

216
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,100
Everything is fine and I win.

217
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,330
Excellent.

218
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,350
Look at that with a fully functional game.

219
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,180
And that brings us to the end of Happy Days in this video.

220
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,850
We've had a quick introduction to particles and gotto and we've made a full game now for extra credit.

221
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,290
You could add extra levels.

222
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,520
Right.

223
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,030
Well you'd have to do is put a script in somewhere maybe in game state maybe in portal that keeps track

224
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,530
of what level we're on and moves the next one.

225
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,940
And if there are no more levels go on to victory.

226
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,280
But you actually have the information now that you could start figuring that out.

227
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:50,900
However I think it's a great place to write this project up so don't forget to share what your game

228
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,290
looks like.

229
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,310
I'm really curious to know.

230
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,280
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
