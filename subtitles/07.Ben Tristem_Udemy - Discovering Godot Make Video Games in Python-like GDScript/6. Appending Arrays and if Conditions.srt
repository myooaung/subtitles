1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,030
Welcome back delightful go to people in this video we took about a pending arrays.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,730
And if conditions see I want to use the player inputs in our story and for that to happen I want to

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,960
go through several steps.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,970
The first is I want to prompt the player to type a word.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,910
The player should know what kind of what it is.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,920
Is this a name.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,870
Is this a place a noun an adverb an adjective.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,730
What is it.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,460
Right.

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,170
Second I want to add those play words to a new array.

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,020
I can't put everything in prompts I need to store them separately.

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,820
Third I want to stop prompting the player when we need to and instead display the completed story.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,120
I can't display the story before it's completed because we'll get a bug right.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,980
The lesson is too many arguments or too few arguments I can't put these together as a single string.

15
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,450
So I need that logic in there.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:58,080
OK so let's get in here and the first thing I will do is create a variable and I'm gonna call this play

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,650
out words.

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,650
These are the words the player types and I'm going to initialize it as an empty array.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,020
Why.

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,510
Because when I start appending to this array and I start adding things into it I want G.D. script to

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,830
know immediately I want got to know immediately.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,840
This is an array.

23
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,750
Don't worry about what to do with it it's just an array by the way.

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,730
You will have noticed that I've put the variable here not in ready.

25
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,560
Why.

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,360
Because that we now at a point where all variables are going to have to be needed in multiple functions.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,750
You see at the moment I've got this story variable here and ready but if I try and do anything here

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,140
story equals empty string I'm gonna get an error and the error is identify story is not declared in

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,400
the current scope the current scope is this code block okay but what happens if I hold alt and move

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,230
it up and then I get rid of this indentation which I can either do by deleting it or I can do shift

31
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,670
in tab give it a second top date and now that works fine.

32
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,490
You see now story is available throughout this script it's only available in this script it's not a

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,060
global variable but it's an instance variable is all the way through this script I'm also gonna want

34
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,870
prompts to be here we're going to do going to be using prompts in several functions in this video.

35
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:18,620
So we now have three separate variables we have play words story and prompts while I'm here.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,160
It's also getting a little bit too verbose I'm thinking here my line 18 variable words equals get node

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,700
v box contain a slash x box contain a slash play a text text started to get a little bit hard to read

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,840
so I'm going to make a new variable and this variable is going to be cold let's start with the play

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,600
a text node

40
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,230
and all I need to do is just tell it what that is so that is play a text and I could also drag it across

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:53,010
but I'll get an error here and the error is use on ready variable I need to put a new keyword before

42
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,290
variable on ready why.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,370
Well gotto is going to make the top note of the scene and then work its way down so it'll make looney

44
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,960
lips then background then V box container then display text it's going to run the script on this or

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,050
rather set the script up the moment that note is made however I am referring to something way down the

46
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,910
tree so if I make this script and sell it variable play a text equals this node that node doesn't exist

47
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:32,370
yet the already keyword allows me to say there's going to be a node this variable is that node note

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,230
by the way I'm not going to call it dot text I'm just gonna punch the node because that allows me to

49
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,020
either set the text or clear it will do whatever other function I want this very thing things when I

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:48,780
want later so I want to give myself the option let's also make a new en ready variable called display

51
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,510
text I'm keeping these the same name as the node so it's not confusing and I'm just gonna put that display

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:02,950
text in there to prove this works I can now get rid of this entirely and just write display text and

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,820
when I press play we should get the same functionality as before.

54
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,750
Rules like chocolate milk whatever.

55
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,490
I just like typing stuff.

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,630
Awesome so now the a place where we've got variables that will work and all the functions and we've

57
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:30,410
got shortcuts for these words so I can replace words here with plaintext.

58
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,210
Okay now we're going to massively change the functionality at the moment we're at 26 lines of code with

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,470
pretty much double it by the end of this video.

60
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,720
First thing I do is I'm going to comment out the entire ready function which is press control okay.

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,310
I can also just put this symbol to be in the line we'll put control cake as it allows me to do multiple

62
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,870
lines at once.

63
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,290
Now I won't make a new function and it's add some lines like can see what I'm doing.

64
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,980
There we go.

65
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,470
And this function is going to be called ads to player words

66
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,460
and why I want to do here is I want to take the player words and add a new entry to the array to add

67
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,010
new entry to array I'm going to use append Append is a function built in to an array.

68
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,340
So let's start that.

69
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,300
So I want to play words dot append and just to show what this does.

70
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,070
Hold control and click it append appends an element to the end of an array.

71
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,930
So this is just part of the array search.

72
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,400
I could also go to such and type arrays and hear all the different things you can do with an array.

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,090
Awesome.

74
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,760
And a close that with control W because that and that I've got a bunch of things open I don't want I

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,770
just want the one script.

76
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,770
Awesome.

77
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,600
So what am I appending because of the moment I'm adding nothing or what I want is the player text not

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,660
text.

79
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,250
Isn't that easier and so much easier than all this business.

80
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,070
In fact you know what.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,480
I don't think we need update to display text at all let's get rid of that and let's get rid of that's

82
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,050
passe and let's get rid of this and put pass.

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,890
Okay.

84
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,250
Don't worry it's gonna look a lot less scary I mean I know we've just deleted a bunch of things but

85
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,720
that was there to show us what we can do in future.

86
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,020
Okay.

87
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,160
So now I've got a thing where when text is entered I want to add two player words.

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,060
Right.

89
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,090
Which is that.

90
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,210
However I don't need to be passing this new text yet I need to leave that in because that is information

91
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,220
that is going to be used by the signal but I'm not using it.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
And that's okay.

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,910
I mean God will give me a slight warning about that later.

94
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,790
But we can live with that.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,480
Okay.

96
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,830
So we can now add that to the play of words we're not doing anything with it.

97
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,580
We've also got a slight issue the slight issue we've got is that we're going to keep adding to the player

98
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,390
words forever.

99
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,300
So I need to use if and else so let's make a branding function.

100
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,880
And what am I really doing here.

101
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm checking if the story's done so let's call this is story done and scroll down here.

102
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,550
And what does this need to do.

103
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,610
Well it needs to say return

104
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,800
player words Dot.

105
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,610
Sighs Okay.

106
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:37,370
So that's going to say how many variables are within this array size if I hold control and click on

107
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,500
it is a built in function of array.

108
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,840
So we can see here the size that shuffle is resize as remove this whole bunch of other things we can

109
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,090
do.

110
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:52,190
And it close that with control W and what's returned do return says whatever just call this function.

111
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,690
Send this back to it.

112
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,050
If I put returned by itself it'll say send nothing back to it.

113
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,290
Important point once return has been called in a function.

114
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,420
Nothing below it will be run in that function.

115
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:10,520
So if I put something in here player words equal Bob this line will never be run.

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,480
Now I don't actually want it to say for right.

117
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,960
I wanted to say is the story done in so many ways equals equals which is is equal to and what I want.

118
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,390
I want the size of the prompts array.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,480
Which prompts

120
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,200
dot size.

121
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,470
So this is in return a true or a false it will return true if there are as many things in the player

122
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,110
what array as there are in the prompts array which is gonna come in useful when we want to check the

123
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,210
amount of things in that array.

124
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,420
So let's make a function that does that.

125
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm going to put it we think below let's put it below one function.

126
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,010
What are we doing.

127
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,040
We are check.

128
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,020
Player.

129
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,400
Words like that I call it play a word play words.

130
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,680
Let's keep that nice and consistent.

131
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,960
And here I want to use an if condition.

132
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,270
Well let's get rid of this.

133
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,620
Lots of space.

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,130
That's what I want.

135
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:21,700
So what I do I say if is story done do something.

136
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,440
Okay so what is this going to do if is a key word it says there's going to be something after f before

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,250
this column.

138
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,070
If it's true.

139
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,400
Do the next code block which is indented underneath it.

140
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,440
I can make multiple if statements

141
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,300
and what this will do is it'll run this line here on my 31 and then when it's done that it'll try and

142
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,270
run 33 no matter what the results are.

143
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,200
What if I don't want it to set to do both.

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
Right do one or the other.

145
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:06,440
I can use Elif Elif is else if so it'll try 131.

146
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,790
If it does it will not run 33 right because it's an.

147
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,460
Else.

148
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,400
Else if if it can't run 31 it will try and run 33.

149
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:23,160
I can also use else else means if none of the things above have worked.

150
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,970
Try this or do this.

151
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,540
Don't even try.

152
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,980
Don't check what it is.

153
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:34,010
This is a catch all so if is storied on Elif not his story done is clearly redundant.

154
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,270
I just need an F and an LS okay.

155
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,310
So if the story's done we're going to tell the story which is a function that doesn't currently exists

156
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,580
so God is going to complain.

157
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,790
Else I want to prompt the player which is another thing that doesn't exist.

158
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,590
So God is going to complain again.

159
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,330
So let's make a couple of temporary functions.

160
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,310
Function tell story

161
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,430
and function prompt player which is on this line.

162
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,200
Function prompt to do player.

163
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,100
See this is the problem with learning to type by just using computers for years and years and years.

164
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,770
I make so many typos because I never actually learn to touch type.

165
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,480
Let's put a colon into this so it actually works like a proper function.

166
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,760
Okay so what I'm gonna do now is it's going to when I call this function and remember right now this

167
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,910
function will never be called because I haven't told it to call it.

168
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,730
It's gonna check the length of the player words array and is going gonna do that by checking is the

169
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,000
story done.

170
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,150
What's this story done.

171
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,620
Just return this value player what size is the same as the prompt size.

172
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,250
If that's true tell the story in all other cases.

173
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:58,830
There's only two cases I could have using Elif but elses a little more elegant prompt the player OK

174
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,880
so let's make these functions that start with tell story what's tell story going to be what is tell

175
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:13,980
story is going to be display text dot text equals story modulated by and this time I want the play of

176
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,690
words right.

177
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,730
I don't want the prompts that would make any sense I want to play words

178
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,700
so I should just go and display the words now the prompt and the prompts going to be a little bit trickier.

179
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:40,550
Not much but a little bit what I want is the display text dot text equals can I have can I have may

180
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:52,490
I have may I have is better grammar let's use may may I have space plus and what I want I want the prompts

181
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,030
but I don't want all the prompts I want a specific prompt I need a way of tracking what it is and this

182
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,910
is where it gets fun you see what I can do is I can use the square brackets tell it which entry in the

183
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:18,460
array I want zero one two three and I can be sneaky here I can go play on words dot size so what it's

184
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,700
gonna do is say okay what's the size of the play what's right.

185
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,010
How many things are in it.

186
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,520
Zero.

187
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,340
Okay that number you've just given me that number you've just returned.

188
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,370
Use that as the position in the array.

189
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,070
This one well while we here let's change this.

190
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:42,090
I want a name that's probably not a capital A noun an adverb that's an adverb isn't it.

191
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,320
Okay bird what's this tingle an adverb verbally.

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,630
I think I've just found the name of my next roleplaying character adverb there we go and glorious is

193
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,850
an adjective if you're not sure of the difference being an adjective an adverb adjectives modify nouns

194
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,640
adverbs modify verbs also.

195
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,030
Okay.

196
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:15,410
May I have space a name plus please and let's put a space there and close the string because a when

197
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:22,610
it prompts the player it's going to find what's the prompt at this position and it's going to calculate

198
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,440
the position by counting the things in the play Words Right so we can already use the functions within

199
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,410
gotto to come up with creative solutions to problems.

200
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,540
OK.

201
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:39,410
Now we still have an issue which is this isn't actually going to run right or it'll run but we're never

202
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,480
going to call these key functions we're never going to check the play on words length which means we

203
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,750
never go check if the story's done we're not going to tell the story or prompt the player.

204
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,880
So at some point we need to actually do that so what I'm gonna do is

205
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,320
bring back this function animate change display text or text.

206
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,620
So now I'm put to check player word life in ready.

207
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,410
So the first thing it's gonna do is that.

208
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,510
So now stop prompting also in add player words I want to make sure that I'm clearing the player text

209
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,090
so let's get plaintext dot clear.

210
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,500
Why am I putting it here instead of text.

211
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,670
Button pressed and play a text because it doesn't need to happen.

212
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,150
I don't need to type it in twice right.

213
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,180
I should just type it in once OK.

214
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,850
Moment of Truth.

215
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,770
Is this going to work.

216
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,250
I don't know.

217
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,750
Let's find out.

218
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,930
It should do.

219
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,280
Man have a name please.

220
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,420
Is cat who's one of my cats.

221
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,010
Oh hasn't displayed the next thing.

222
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay so let's double check that.

223
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,660
Why is it doing that.

224
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,760
Oh I see why.

225
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:49,070
Okay I'm only checking the player word length once so I need to make sure that when we add to the words

226
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,510
We also check the player would like a check.

227
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,380
Player would like selling a stake.

228
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,830
One of the most common mistakes I make when I'm programming is forget to call a function I've written.

229
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,120
Let's try that again.

230
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,310
May I have a name please excuse kaboodle my other cat.

231
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,540
May have a now I'm happy.

232
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,830
May I have an adverb puree.

233
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,130
May I have an adjective joyous.

234
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm feeling quite happy right now apparently.

235
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,040
Once upon a time someone called Bootle a happy flavored sandwich which made him I should put a gender

236
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,050
in that feel or parry inside.

237
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,760
It was a joyous day.

238
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,740
Look we're almost there.

239
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,720
There's one more thing I would like to do.

240
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,170
I'd like to welcome the play it's a lips right now.

241
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,900
We're just going straight into a prompt sub so I would like you to display a brief introduction to the

242
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,120
player when they first start the game.

243
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,630
Suppose the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

244
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm OK Mac.

245
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:56,830
OK so the first thing I do before Czech player words length is I'm going to say display text dot text

246
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,440
equals.

247
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,810
And now I'm going to put my happy friendly introduction.

248
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,680
Welcome to looney lips.

249
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:16,400
We're going to tell a story and have a wonderful was a wondrous but we spell it wrong time and now in

250
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,270
a little bit of space there as well.

251
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,390
Now I press play.

252
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,620
It goes away.

253
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,440
Why does it do that.

254
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,570
Because in check.

255
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,670
Play a word length doo doo doo.

256
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,070
I'm saying prompt the player and prompt the player.

257
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:34,160
I'm now setting the display text as something else I'm immediately overwriting it.

258
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,960
So instead of equals I don't use.

259
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,110
Plus equals plus equals means.

260
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,240
Add this to what exists so now in a press play.

261
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,080
Look at this.

262
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,980
Welcome to looney lips.

263
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,360
We're going to tell a story and have a wonderful time.

264
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,890
May I have a name please.

265
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,410
Yes.

266
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,820
As you know let us do Ben.

267
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,740
Ben.

268
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,820
May I have a now please.

269
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,080
Oh we're not clearing it.

270
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,380
OK.

271
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:03,420
Now I could set display text dot text to an empty string his or clear it out and then add it in.

272
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,700
But if I do that I just remove the solution we just put in right.

273
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,360
I mean the whole point of this plus equals so it wouldn't do that.

274
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,330
So instead cut that and I need to find a place to put this.

275
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,810
Well I can't put it in prompt player because that gives us the same problem.

276
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,780
I want to do it when new tax is added so let's put it on at to player words and then we'll put it right

277
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,320
above.

278
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,370
Play a text OK clear.

279
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,160
Why am I putting it here.

280
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,920
Really because visually that's where they are on the screen and it just makes sense to me.

281
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,390
So this press play welcome to linear lips we're gonna tell a story and have a one time may have a name

282
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:36,960
please.

283
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,750
Ben.

284
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,210
May I have a noun please.

285
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,070
Always looking promising computer may I have an adverb please.

286
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,720
Confusedly

287
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,290
May I have an adjective please.

288
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,910
Splendid.

289
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,410
Once upon a time some local band aid to compute to flavored sandwich which made him feel all confusedly

290
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:56,860
inside.

291
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,790
Well that's a good piece of grammar.

292
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,840
It was a splendid day.

293
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,650
Fantastic.

294
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,470
Look at that.

295
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,960
We've now got the basics of our game everything from here is just adding scale.

296
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,290
Which brings us to the end of this video.

297
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,680
In this video we've gotten a specific entry from an array based on its position which is sneaky.

298
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,650
We've learned how to use the append and size methods of an array and we've used an if else condition

299
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,200
to check the logic.

300
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,570
Quite a lot happening here but we've already got a pretty functional game.

301
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,830
Now everything else is just making it bigger.

302
