00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello you.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,920
Gloria's wonderful and lovely God.

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:10,390
Happy for all of you at the same time Yanni.

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,060
And I just thought it'd be a nice idea at it where you probably know who I am.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,210
You've heard my voice quite a lot because you did it.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,040
You made it through the course.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,780
I just thought it might be nice to wrap up by talking about all the things we've looked at so far.

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,670
By the time you reach the end of this course by it's I mean watching this we have gone on quite a journey

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,960
we started off very very simply with learning.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,770
Right we're talking about variables.

11
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:39,460
Dictionaries are raise very basic concepts of what's a signal What's a function and then very quickly

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,480
we start improving.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,310
Right we had happy days quite simple little platform Gameboy we add in things like lives college collision

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:51,630
masks and layers tile maps and then ice Meister's where we can start doing things like very basic line

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,100
of sight.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,840
Lot cogeneration object oriented programming onto 3D with Cube did kick about playing with physics and

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,910
rigid bodies and static bodies and all the other fun things we can do three particles and then finally

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,160
into a food fight.

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,120
I really enjoyed this process and I hope you did too.

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,460
And I'd love to see not only what you've been making throughout this course but what you make next.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,020
Please do stay in touch.

22
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:14,970

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,570

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,210
We'd love to keep in touch and what you do.

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,400
I hope you've enjoyed the God.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,470
And you know I hope you continue to enjoy the kind of engine that you use it for professional games

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:32,610
hobby games indeed games education presentations whatever else you decide to do with it.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,720
Finally on behalf of all here game dev thank you so much for joining us on the journey and excellent

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
work.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,830
I have seen you in the previous videos and I hope to see you in another one.
