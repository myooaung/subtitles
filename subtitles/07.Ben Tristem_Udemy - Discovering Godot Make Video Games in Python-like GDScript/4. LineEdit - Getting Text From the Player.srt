1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,480
Gloria's got people in this video.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,860
We're going to go a step further.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,400
We've looked at how to display text to ourselves as programmers how to put it in the output how to display

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,660
it to the player.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,980
Now let's talk about how to get text from the player right.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,460
This could be a key component not just in our game but it's also a foundational principle in a lot of

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,780
games that we might make in the future.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:25,980
So what do we need to do.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,380
Well to get text we have to have a place for the player to type that's probably going to be a node or

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,910
two we can use going to have to get the words that the player types into the actual script.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,180
Right.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,040
So I'm gonna have to put words somewhere and then the script has to take those words and then do something

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,280
with it.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,260
What's it have to do.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,160
It's going to respond somehow or we can have a little exercise to get it to respond and then as we go

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,930
on in the course will stop making our stories and display them.

18
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,120
So that said let's get into got a hello gotta and let's take a look what we need to do.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Well there's going to be a new type of node put on the click on looney lips and control a or if you

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:07,050
want to control a press the little button a little plus sign and under control there's a couple we could

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,370
use.

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,370
There's a line at it and a text edit it.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,360
Now the difference between them is do you want the player to be able to press return to go to a next

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,050
line or return to enter the text a line edit allows a player to enter a single line of text for example

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,420
if you want to put in a name or single word a text that it is where you want people to fill out a lot

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,050
of information.

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,910
So if you're making a role playing game and you want the players to write their own journals you would

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,640
use a text edit I don't want to do that.

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,680
I want a line edit.

30
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:43,440
So here is my line at it note and it's very small and in the corner for the moment I'm just going to

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,330
drag it over here you'll see and a control note by the way when you move things you see little measurements

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,280
and let's just make it a little bit bigger and see what it looks like.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,710
Press play.

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,360
And here is a box that the player can type in.

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,290
Doesn't do anything but there it is.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,750
Now this isn't a great piece of layout is it.

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,910
What it could do is I could extend it like loops see if the problem already.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,450
I can extend it like this and put it where I want.

40
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,290
But let's try and organize this a little bit better.

41
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,700
I'm going to add a new note on the plus button and I'm looking for a box container.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,720
So if I took a box you'll see there's a couple here there's an H box container and a feed box container.

43
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,690
What do they do.

44
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,160
Well the descriptions isn't showing and this bill have gotta that's a little annoying.

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,030
You can see from the icon the H box container contains things into columns.

46
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,760
That's what I'm looking for.

47
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,810
So every node beneath it will be automatically raised in two columns.

48
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,220
This one will do rows.

49
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's see what that looks like.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,240
If I click on the box container and I'm going to put one edit within the V box container and I will

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,180
put the display text within the V box container.

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,000
Now let's make the V box container.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,140
That's kind of a mouthful to say that the vertical box lets make the container thing full rectangle.

54
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,130
And when I click on the line at it you'll see the light it is actually above the display a little hard

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,080
to see it as I zoom right in.

56
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,920
And what I can do is I can drag the display text above it and it's the other way round.

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,350
So the way that containers and organizers of any kind work in gotto is the order in which you put them

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,260
in in the same tree is the order to be organized a couple of things you'll notice one Everything's at

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,850
the top here.

60
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,880
And the more text we have the more this will move that really one that's what we do is when I go to

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,420
the the options the inspector and let's change the alignment from begin to end.

62
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,660
Now this is about the line at it always at the very bottom a little hard to see there.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,660
So let's put a margin on it.

64
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:51,460
So with the box container still selected I'm going to hit margin and just to get a repeat that 24 pixels

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,880
thing all measurements by the way are in pixels so 24 for the top 24 from the bottom minus 24 from the

66
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,850
right and minus 24 from the bottom.

67
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,900
One more thing I want to do is I want change the font here to match the same font.

68
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:13,120
So on the custom fonts it's going to give it a new dynamic font click on the dynamic font and then I

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,970
can go into my graphics folder and drag it over here.

70
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,380
Now what it could do is I could save this font and if I was using it several times I would click this

71
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,800
little down arrow do save and I could just load that font in but we've only got a few elements in this

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
game so let's keep it nice and simple.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,320
All right.

74
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,200
Now we've got some it looks almost ready but the display text is going to hover down the bottom.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,730
So how what to do here is give it a minimum size.

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:46,220
So with display text selected let's go over to rect over the size it's at at the moment it's 976 pixels

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,190
on the x axis and 63 on the Y.

78
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,440
Let's give it a bigger minimum size I must say the Y has to be at least 400 pixels.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,000
Look at that.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,340
Now when I press play it doesn't work.

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,000
Why.

82
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,620
Because my script is pointing to something.

83
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,590
Okay let's let's fix that real quick.

84
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,860
If you look here this get node the dollar sign is pointing to a direct child could display text so we

85
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,130
are at loonie lips that's where our script is and is looking for direct child.

86
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,780
Well if I minimize that you can see there isn't one.

87
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,010
So what I need to do is update this.

88
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,770
So the path is important and as a couple of ways I could do this.

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,640
I could type in the display text and let it autocomplete.

90
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,410
I could drag it in and then if I wanted to I could get these quotes.

91
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,470
They'll both work just fine.

92
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,200
So now when you press play we have a text that isn't all white on the bottom.

93
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,140
Quite at the top.

94
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,560
It's not quite there but it's looking better and I can type in here but nothing is happening.

95
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:55,180
OK so what I want to do is to make this connect somehow to the script.

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,360
Now the way I'm going to do that is by clicking on the line at it and I'm going to rename line at it.

97
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,510
Let's give it a better name let's say this is player text the text the player enters and with a selected

98
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,560
on the right hand side you see this Travis's perspective is in the Lawrence's note.

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,680
If I click on it I have something called signals.

100
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,700
We also have something called groups which are also very cool but we'll be looking at them later.

101
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,690
For now it's cultural signals and I have all these little options here.

102
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,950
And before we go into those let's talk about what signals and gotto are because they're really key idea.

103
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,160
Each of the nodes in gotto can do something right.

104
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:41,770
So if we have a line at its node it can take text from the player and over here we have a label mode

105
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,160
and it can display text.

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,900
So we want a way of plugging them in.

107
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,900
Now we could do this in several lots lots of little scripts that all tell each other you I've changed

108
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,820
your value of change your function and all the rest of it but this can get very messy very quickly.

109
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:05,000
You want to minimize the amount of times a node or different script can change values in another script.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,380
There are times where it might be unavoidable but for the vast majority of time we don't do that.

111
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,480
The one exception is a parent node so in this case we have our roots node our control node loop which

112
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,940
has the loony looks script which can directly change the values of its children.

113
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,240
OK we're going to allow that Gordo has nothing inside it by default that will stop the line at at node

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,440
from changing the route and from changing the label and the label from changing the line at it the label

115
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,950
from changing the route and is added add more nodes.

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:40,250
It becomes very difficult for us as human beings as coders to track down where problems are occurring

117
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,920
because so many values so many variables and functions.

118
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,760
Everything is being triggered from everywhere else.

119
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,990
So instead we're going to use something called a signal.

120
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:59,300
Imagine that our label node has a handy mobile phone or pager and a line at it node has another one

121
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,190
when a certain thing happens.

122
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:09,440
So when the line at it is told on this thing happening it knows send a signal and that signal will be

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,090
connected.

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,310
Beep beep beep beep beep.

125
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,880
To a specific node.

126
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,640
So we're going to connect a signal from line at it to label.

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,870
It's very much like having a mobile phone and just sending a text message.

128
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,520
Now the key here is line it it doesn't care what happens once that signal is set.

129
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,580
It doesn't care what the label does with it.

130
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,700
All it's going to do is say I've got some text in me.

131
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,300
Here's your message.

132
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,340
And the label node I'll display text doesn't care why the line at it is sending that message.

133
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,880
It just cares that it's there.

134
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,070
So every node is just responsible for what it does.

135
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,330
Okay.

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,140
So how can we make that work.

137
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,600
We have all these signals here and I can look them in the documentation so we could go over to scripts

138
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,850
and such the help and type in the node type which in this case is a line at it or if we wanted to we

139
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,480
could right click on line at it and go to open documentation.

140
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,590
But as we scroll down we've got the methods it has the themes and we have the signals right.

141
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,480
It lists the signals it can do.

142
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,440
So we have a signal on tax changes every time the any of the text values have been changed within that

143
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,440
node.

144
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,910
So if I press backspace or for a space or P or whatever else send the signal and we have another one

145
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,670
when entries and is pressed.

146
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,140
So that's the one I want I want to text entered.

147
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,660
Okay.

148
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm not connected where I'm going to connect it I have to connect it to a place that has a script.

149
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,930
If I try and connect it directly display text it won't work.

150
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,840
Well I can't put a script on display text.

151
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,070
I don't really want to.

152
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,880
I want all of this scene to run on one script as much cleaner way of doing things much easier to see

153
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
what's going on and debug.

154
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:00,940
So instead back on this plaintext note I click on a note button got text entered and connected to looney

155
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:08,950
lips and it's going to create a new method and you function on player text entered when I connect it

156
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,900
you'll see here it's added a new argument the thing in brackets that was that is empty over here.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,390
This is when this function is called you're going to have extra information.

158
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,600
This is X information is a variable that you're going to call new text and that new text variable only

159
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,140
exists here.

160
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:35,380
If I try and say new text equals empty string go very quickly tell me why was this variable you haven't

161
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,130
declared that.

162
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,450
But if I use altered down arrow I put it here that's fine.

163
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,610
We've defined that.

164
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:41,790
Okay.

165
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,660
So this is a new variable defined here.

166
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,410
What is the value of new text.

167
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,450
Well the signal is going to tell us that when we press enter.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,920
So it's a radical way of doing this.

169
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,210
OK.

170
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,980
So when this tax is entered we need to do something.

171
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,960
And here is my challenge for you

172
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,790
I'd like you to have the display text node show whatever I've typed in there.

173
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,980
So we've got a text box no judge I'm calling play a text when I type something into press Enter or Return.

174
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,480
I want the display text node to repeat whatever I've just said to it.

175
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,560
So pulls the video give it a shot.

176
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,290
And when you come back I'll show you my solution

177
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,900
and welcome back.

178
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,220
All right.

179
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,500
So this starts off as pretty simple in fact we can just use this.

180
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,750
So I'm going to duplicate this line with the highlighted and press control B and then ult down arrow

181
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,490
nice and fast and I don't want story modulated by prompts which isn't defined in this function so it

182
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,280
doesn't like it.

183
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,860
I want new text and you know what we don't need this pass because that makes no sense.

184
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,550
Do something now don't do anything.

185
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:58,130
So when a press play I can type in a word and it works.

186
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,180
Couple of things though.

187
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,550
The first we haven't removed this text

188
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,020
OK.

189
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,350
So what I'd like to do is find a way of emptying that.

190
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,550
So what I can do is I can find my player tax load

191
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,310
and I can use this clear function.

192
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:26,360
What does clear do clear is exactly the way as saying text equals empty string.

193
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,530
OK.

194
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,460
So I'm going to do a clear function.

195
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,480
Why me using a function.

196
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,140
Because when I'm rereading it I'm not seeing extra variables of values being put in I can just look

197
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,700
at the say oh this is just a clear function.

198
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,420
Don't even bother with it.

199
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,920
So when I bring up my game and you know it's like full screen has like a small play around with it.

200
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,980
Great.

201
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,350
This is a lovely to do.

202
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,310
Way to type.

203
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,100
Oh what a beautiful morning.

204
00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:01,030
I like my coffee black just like my metal.

205
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,910
Awesome.

206
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,840
Every time I press return it'll work.

207
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,320
Now later I'm going to add a little button here as well as a player has a different option.

208
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,620
And we going to find ways of plugging this into our actual code.

209
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,300
But look at this we've got a fundamental thing we can do.

210
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,320
One more thing I want to do before we wrap this up I want to refactor this code a little bit.

211
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,310
If I press play again it in a way close that in the next video where we one after that I'm not quite

212
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,740
sure yet.

213
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,400
I'll put a little button here.

214
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:26,980
Why.

215
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,610
Because some people automatically press enter when they're typing.

216
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,200
And some people look for a button to press like it's a form and I want to make this as easy as possible

217
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,550
for the player to play by giving them the obvious options that they would expect.

218
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,500
Right you always want to make a game easy for a player to play you always want to meet their expectations

219
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,090
of how the game will behave.

220
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,150
You can surprise them with fun mechanics but they shouldn't be surprised by the way the user interface

221
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,570
the graphics user trace the gooey not behaving the way they think it should.

222
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,150
So if I'm putting a button here it's going to have its own signal and I don't really want to repeat

223
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,990
code.

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,200
So instead I'm going to put in a brand new function and you know what let's put an actual line in here.

225
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,680
I like to put two lines between functions and there's one problem here and remove that comment.

226
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,370
Let's just tidy our code a bit.

227
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:13,960
Awesome.

228
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:28,150
So two lines I want to call this update Display display text.

229
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,940
That's not how I should be writing that.

230
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,770
That should be updated display text.

231
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,750
Great.

232
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,630
Why does this matter.

233
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,060
Well I'm referring to a node here.

234
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:45,130
So when I'm reading this in six months or three years when someone else reads it they should take a

235
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,270
look this function and from the name of the function understand what it does.

236
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,500
This is a key concept.

237
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,750
Every function should do a single thing and that thing should be obvious from the name naming things

238
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,720
in programming is one of most difficult things to get right.

239
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,910
This updates the display text.

240
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:12,330
Now what I want to do is instead of saying go to the display text update the text and then clear this

241
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,390
and remove all of that down.

242
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:26,150
So let's press ult and move that down here and now I can call update display text.

243
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,060
There it is.

244
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,890
However there's a bug there's an error happening here.

245
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,080
Right.

246
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,580
Line 14 his line 14.

247
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,730
The identifier variable.

248
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,000
New text is not declared in the current scope.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,660
What does that mean.

250
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,080
Well I've got this variable here called new text now that's defined in this function but it's not defined

251
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,000
in this function.

252
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,200
So what I need to do is I need to define it.

253
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,220
Now I could go to a variable new text.

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,190
I'm going to get the nodes.

255
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,810
I use the dollar shortcut and go v box container play a text dot text.

256
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,420
What I can do that.

257
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,690
But instead let's do this let's pass the argument in

258
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,880
now I'm passing this argument in and it's saying I'm not expecting argument I can put the same argument

259
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,510
in here.

260
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,140
And we type it correctly.

261
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,480
There we go and now this will work exactly the same way

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,420
awesome.

263
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,840
So I'm doing this because it's going to make this much cleaner and much easier to use my start having

264
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,000
various functions that all have to update the display text and there's another secret we could do.

265
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,470
We don't have to call this new tax we can call this words

266
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,230
and this took me a little while to get used to when I first started using God.

267
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,530
If I press play now it will still work.

268
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,430
Why does this still work.

269
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,940
Well G.D. script is based on Python.

270
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:10,870
And when we pass arguments through which is what these little things within functions are called it

271
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,340
doesn't actually matter what they're called it matters what position they're in.

272
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,190
Let me demonstrate that again here.

273
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,290
I'm calling a function with an argument I can call in several arguments.

274
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:29,140
So I could call this one colors I could call this one numbers et cetera.

275
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,940
I don't have those defined but I could call them my.

276
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,180
And then over here it doesn't matter what I've called them in that function because these are being

277
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,680
created from scratch.

278
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,590
All that matters is what is the value of this variable.

279
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,910
What is it actually called.

280
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,600
So I can call this one new text and I can call it words here.

281
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,660
What matters is the position that they're in not what I've called them previously and that is a great

282
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,180
place and this video in this video we've seen how to use a line at it node.

283
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,450
We've had a quick introduction to signals which is going to be incredibly useful for every game we make

284
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,060
and gotto.

285
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,870
It's one of the core concepts and got.

286
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,390
And we've looked at how to call a function with an additional argument one that we've defined ourselves

287
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,060
so.

288
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,870
Excellent work.

289
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,600
And I'll see you in the next video.
