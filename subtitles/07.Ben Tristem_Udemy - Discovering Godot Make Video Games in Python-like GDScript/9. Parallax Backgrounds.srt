1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,240
Hallelujah you got.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,590
People in this video.

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:13,240
We got talk about parallax backgrounds see right now we have this plain gray looking background.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,790
It's actually a default color that means this is transparent.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,960
Okay we can do that but let's try and create an environment that feels more real more immersive and

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,150
gives the illusion of speed.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,390
And to do that we're going to use parallax before we go any further let's talk about what parallax is.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,050
So when I was a kid here's me as a kid I used to go to school by train.

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,510
Here's me in my school time which I hated.

10
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:42,130
And I had no glasses at the time and I had very messy hair.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,470
So here I am on the train.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,680
And here's Ben who is probably standing on a seat.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,850
He wasn't this small but whatever.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,660
He also had messy hair.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,420
OK.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,570
So he sits on the train on the way to school no way back.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,500
And what would happen is the greenery the trees the shrubs the pieces across by the track would become

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:09,340
a blur in the background things like houses fences and let's say power lines

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,650
would move at a decent speed.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,150
And in the background the sun would seem not to move at all.

21
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,140
Now I'm aware that these things are not moving I'm moving.

22
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,150
I mean obviously we're moving through the cosmos but that's irrelevant in a local scale.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,650
They are still I am moving fast.

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,950
But what's interesting is that the greenery here is a blur because it is moving way faster.

25
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,970
From my perspective and the stuff in the middle distance which is moving way faster than the sun which

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,250
appears not to be moving at all.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,770
What's happening is my viewing angle changes the apparent properties of things I'm looking at or maybe

28
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,960
we could do a test tube.

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,820
So here is a test tube I'm going to a chemistry class and I need to get a reading for the liquid right

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,760
and I will read the liquid here.

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,560
But then when I look again the same amount of liquid is here.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,830
Well why did it move it move because I'm at a different angle right.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:09,890
This is known as parallax error parallax than it is a phenomena where objects seem to be in different

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,720
position based on my viewing angle and the faster we're going the more obvious it is.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,690
Now we can use that.

36
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,620
What we gonna do is follow the following guidelines.

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,600
One the closer Ella is the faster it should move.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,320
This is going to give us the illusion of speed and of space background layers will go slowly foreground

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,520
layers will go faster you'll players will probably not even realize that they noticed this but they

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,610
will.

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,240
The faster a layer moves the performance of the player will think they're going right.

42
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,590
So we can make money look even faster by using this technique.

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,060
Now in Godot we're going to control speed of parallax through scale.

44
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,330
I'll explain that in a moment but essentially what we're doing is we're saying make this layer smaller

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,270
which means it'll repeat more often which means it'll look faster.

46
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,200
OK.

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,160
A lot to take in.

48
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,120
So instead of explaining it further let's do some practical work.

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,950
Now I'm gonna put my parallax layer on the camera to do that.

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,290
I'm going to open the placing because that's where I put my camera.

51
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,560
Somebody uses a little film icon hit over the placing and here's my camera as a child of camera.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,930
So I'm an add a child node.

53
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:19,280
Let's create a parallax background you notice this two things here.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,770
You'll also notice there's a canvas layer a canvas layer is an item that is drawn on the game that has

55
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,970
no position information.

56
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,060
It doesn't care where the thing is it's a piece of artwork that doesn't move with the rest of the game

57
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,520
a parallax background is a type of canvas layer.

58
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,860
Right it inherits from camps.

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,360
So we want that first.

60
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,050
If we look on the scroll there's a bunch of options.

61
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,250
Now we don't need to change any of these right the offset the base offset the base scale don't really

62
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,750
care about that.

63
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,520
We do care is ignore camera zoom and I'll show you why in a moment okay.

64
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,180
So we have a parallax background.

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,620
Now we need some layers right.

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,460
Each layer is going to move at a different speed so let's make the layers cool add a new node.

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,650
And as you might imagine we want parallax layer.

68
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,810
Now that's parallax layer needs a graphic.

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,220
I mean he's a texture rect.

70
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,630
I don't wanna use a sprite sprite as an object that has position information.

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,560
It shouldn't have position information.

72
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,130
It's just a piece of artwork.

73
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,360
Right.

74
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,990
So let's use texture rect okay.

75
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,710
And over here you see I've already selected it onto my g effects background on his background layer

76
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,030
1.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,690
I'm going to drag it into the texture like so cool.

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,560
Now if I press play Now this won't work right.

79
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,040
You can see here it just stops.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,540
What I've done is I've created a texture and that doesn't look right at all.

81
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,020
I need it to repeat.

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,600
Let's go back to this parallax layer and under motion.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,700
What we want is mirroring.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,540
How often do I repeat.

85
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,230
Now I need to know the size of the image.

86
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:52,630
I happen to know the size image but anyway to find out more right click on it show file manager and

87
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,230
then because I'm a Windows machine I can right click on it and do properties on Maximilian.

88
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,210
You'll find very similar ways of doing this.

89
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,380
Got the details.

90
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,700
And you can see right here with 2048 height 2048.

91
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,550
Perfect.

92
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,000
That's the information I need.

93
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,130
So a mirroring on a do 2048 2048.

94
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,490
So every 2048 pixels on the X and on the Y mirror this image.

95
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,670
Repeat this image.

96
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,840
So now when I press play

97
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,240
well it looks better but it suddenly snaps.

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,630
Why is it snapping.

99
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,850
Because we need to ignore camera zoom.

100
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,910
Ignore camera zoom.

101
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,780
Run the game again.

102
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:36,860
Remember we zoomed the camera out so it's repeating 2008 for pixels but then the camera pulls back and

103
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,430
sees the edge.

104
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,760
Now when I move we have a single blue thing that seems to go forever.

105
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,920
The player doesn't need to know the order repeating the image.

106
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,830
It's just the background.

107
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,000
We don't need to think about it.

108
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,840
This kind of smoke and mirrors is what great game experience is all about right.

109
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,690
The player shouldn't even be aware that it's there.

110
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,710
Okay let's duplicate parallax last.

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm going to control deep and there's parallax led to has exactly the same properties.

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,510
So I select the texture rect here and use background led to okay.

113
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,080
But we need to do some tweaks and his wife a press play here.

114
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,060
Clouds all the way down here.

115
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,700
Why they're down there.

116
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,410
Because this is quite a large image right.

117
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,580
If I zoom out you can see how large this images clouds star all the way down.

118
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,690
We want to offset it.

119
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:22,960
Okay.

120
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,050
Well that's easy enough.

121
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,600
Got a parallax led to got a motion and an offset.

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,420
We need to move this up by a certain amount I think are up by 750 is good.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
But remember up on the y axis in 2D is negative.

124
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:46,220
Sony's Move up by 750 and now for his play The clouds are much more visible right there all the way

125
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,490
up here.

126
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,540
That's much better.

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:54,240
Bit of a problem look logjams when I full the clouds flicker past what I need to do here is turn off

128
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,720
the mirroring on the y axis some you set y to zero on parallax led to it's still the same apparel X

129
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,680
layer one but not on two.

130
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,720
Now what will happen is we get a line of cloud and then we'll stop.

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
That's gonna be okay because our final air is the same color as the sky.

132
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,580
So we're gonna have this nice smoke and mirrors effect again.

133
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,650
One more thing I do need to do is I need to make sure that this background land moves quite slowly so

134
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,020
I want to change the scale I needed to change the scale on the x.

135
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,640
So let's change it to zero point five okay.

136
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,080
So it's going to move half the speed that I would expect.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,830
Now let's duplicate parallax led to because most of the properties we need are the same.

138
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,160
Well I do what to do is change the scale here to let's say zero point five.

139
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,860
You'll notice I'm just going up by point to find each because I have two more Esko and I need to change

140
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,600
the background layer three So let's open the texture rect for parallax layer 3.

141
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,030
Put that there and look we have new clouds white clouds subtle effect.

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,580
Right duplicate parallax therefore do the exact same thing.

143
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:01,650
When I put in the fourth layer of texture let's change the scales in motion and that can be a scale

144
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,960
of one.

145
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,960
Now when I press play I run into a problem my problem is I'm not good enough my own game to test this

146
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,330
well.

147
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,680
Right.

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,970
It's very hard for me to do this so I'm trying to tweak the gravity.

149
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm going to say gravity to 150 is the 300 now jump speed is going to be way too high.

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,900
Right.

151
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,110
Because the way we've got it working the press jump look at that.

152
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,070
That's on manageable.

153
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,950
So I'm gonna set this to what you think 3000.

154
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,380
Yeah sounds good let's give that a shot

155
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,280
maybe a little higher than 3000.

156
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,620
That feels good.

157
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,560
And you'll notice that the clouds are moving at different speed and it's quite subtle.

158
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,090
If I want to see this I can that's my level get to 2D and you know what just zoom out and make a floor.

159
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:02,500
So just really quickly here's a lovely big floor and put it on this line and I want to right click this

160
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,260
one and get rid of that's okay.

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,170
So now

162
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,760
the layers are moving at different speed now.

163
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,800
I can change these scales to make them even better right.

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:26,060
I can change this to zero point seventy five on the X this one to zero point five and this once is zero

165
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,210
point two five so they'll repeat even faster.

166
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,000
Press play here.

167
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,590
We've got this really subtle effect that looks like we're in a real environment.

168
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:39,990
Okay.

169
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,910
Get rid of all these and I might wanna tweak my level soon but I'm actually in a wait.

170
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,350
It's like all things to place and pieces coins are solid.

171
00:09:48,350 --> 00:10:00,100
So for now let's just add a few more doo hickeys we jump on.

172
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,640
Nice.

173
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,840
Okay so we have this lovely little parallax effect that works well.

174
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,100
It also cuts me I might want to move these backgrounds up a bit so I'm going to get at a full screen

175
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,870
mode.

176
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:16,660
Now I've put them all at minus 750 with the ultimate minus 750 what I do this properly.

177
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,270
So it's got to pallets the effort to reset my offset with his default button saying on three same awful

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:33,230
let's go back to Patrick's background and use base offset minus 1000 as press play much more like it.

179
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,920
Now the ground starts with the players ground starts.

180
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,990
Now we could tweak these values with the rest of it but that gives us a really good starting point.

181
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,130
And that is how to create a parallax background.

182
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,480
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

183
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,020
We've looked at how to create a parallax background node and how these parallax layers.

184
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,710
We've also looked into how to tweak these values so find some settings that work well for your game

185
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,760
and excellent work.

186
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,110
Don't forget to show your progress in any problems you might be having.

187
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,990
And I will see you in the next video.
