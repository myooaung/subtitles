1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,290
Welcome back to life for God.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,380
People in this video are going to limit ammo.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,290
We're going to refill the food fuel by controlling how much ammunition a player is allowed to carry

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,970
and tracking how much they are actually carrying as well as loing ammunition when they fire it.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,270
Let's talk about the kinds of limits we want to put on food.

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,700
I'm thinking the following one you have a limited amount of food you can only carry X amount whatever

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,100
X is we can change with an export variable.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,570
But I'm thinking 5 is a good start.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,450
Number two picking up food should take time you don't just run over something and instantly have more

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:36,770
food.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,210
You have to stay in an area that's home a picking up food risky which adds a risk reward element which

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,850
I think will make a more interesting gameplay experience.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,030
Finally robot SPCS won't be limited to the amount of food they can carry just like in real life robots

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,180
to be able to throw as much food at you as they like.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,660
Let's start by taking a look at our level and deciding what we want.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm thinking a nice area right in the centre downstage Centre right here.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,880
Nice and risky so not too much cover but the potential of cover the is going to be able to move out

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,650
the way at times can always move it.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,120
I'm gonna start making a new scene and my route is going to be an area hoodie.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,130
Why.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,730
Because I want to track when something is inside it.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,270
Using collision but I don't want to stop things from entering it so areas are a good way of doing that

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,380
and I'm going to give this a mash instance so I can see where this area is.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,990
A simple cube mesh.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,100
Let's scale that down.

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,650
So let's say zero point five all three axes.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,970
And let's actually make it look like something we could pick up so I don't want to be in here.

28
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:50,380
I don't mean material they can use spatial material and I'm thinking a nice transparent onesimus Flags

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,840
and switch on transparent and go down to our bideau.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,340
And I think a nice red colour looks good.

31
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,020
Ours put the alfer on so let's put Alpher at about 100 ish

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,920
looking a little dark you know what.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,950
I might even switch on a mission less emit are out here.

34
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,590
Yeah that's looking pretty good.

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,380
Okay now we also need collision or the area won't work at all.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,940
So let's put in a collision.

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,830
Collision shapes.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,140
It is not a new box shape.

39
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,160
And again I want this to be scaled down so when I go into what shape extensor zero point five want all

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,990
three axes.

41
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,390
Now I could use the layers here but you know what I'm actually going to use.

42
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,930
If body has Matha trick we used recently.

43
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:46,660
So let's rename this mythical it refill area with a save that in scenes or mean scenes as handy.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,920
Now I need to put a script in this because I need to connect signals to it so I won't create this the

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,540
script inside scripts like so.

46
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,460
And now I have an empty think.

47
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,570
Now I'm going to connect notes.

48
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,590
I will use body entered body exited.

49
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,710
I connect them to itself and I'll explain why in a bit so that one and that one.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,690
Great.

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,980
Now I'm going to.

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,830
Instance in this area.

53
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:24,650
So that's just insys it in like so refill area.

54
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,200
Couldn't live like that.

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,600
It's a pretty good place on the ground.

56
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
You are not on the ground.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,180
Get back on the ground.

58
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,700
Awesome.

59
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,520
Okay that looking pretty good.

60
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,160
So why am I connecting it to itself and not the player.

61
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,790
Well right now we have a player as part of the scene.

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,270
But later on were going to put player customization in and what that's going to do is allow the player

63
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,860
to pick between two different Peacey models.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,210
Then were going to all load that p.c model as well as whatever texture the players picked in to this

65
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,830
level which means we can't connect it directly through the inspector would have to connect it through

66
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,150
a script and I can connect through script.

67
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,650
But I'd rather do it by using a simpler method.

68
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,530
So let's just do this.

69
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:25,280
If body DOT has no method how much we call this rieffel area entered.

70
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:35,450
And just to be very clear I'm using this capitalisation because that's how he's used nodes and then

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,320
underscore entered because that's how he would catalysing scripts.

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,810
So if what he has method rieffel area entered then I want to run that method.

73
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:56,160
What a dot refill area and test would do the exact same thing with a refill area exit so if body part

74
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,830
has method

75
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:15,580
refeel area exited option a copy that because it was quite hard to write then body refill area exited.

76
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,970
But not with a start.

77
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,740
And this script is basically good to go on.

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,960
Get rid of the actual lines that I need and save that most of the rest of work is going to be done in

79
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,530
play.

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,000
And before I go any further I've got a whole bunch of scripts I'm not using anymore so I'm going to

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,830
close most of these menus control and W on Windows so one that one that one that one that one that wants

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,480
that light on lots of things I dont need.

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,450
I just want play and refl area for now.

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,460
Let's figure out what variables we need and we go right up to the top of player and will put in some

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,710
new variables in a new groups.

86
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm going to make it a little gap here where I put it here and this is going to be ammo variables and

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,920
let's keep this can sense there where I first think it is an export variable called Max ammo.

88
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,360
I must start this office 5 second thing I need to track is how much ammo we actually carrying and I

89
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,990
start at zero.

90
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,510
So the player will not be able to fire ammunition at the beginning.

91
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,760
Right so you will have to pick some up.

92
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,150
Now it's possible that we're going to have to add some more of these boxes around the place.

93
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,260
Maybe just putting it here is simply too dangerous or not fun.

94
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,790
That's okay we can tweak that pretty easily once we're done we can just duplicate this as many times

95
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,790
we like.

96
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,510
One more thing I want to track.

97
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,120
Are we actually able to pick up ammunition right now for that to be true we need to be inside the box

98
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,170
and not at Max m0 but I can track that very simply with can refill as a billion which is starting off

99
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,860
as false code for you to find to this open the player seen so let's open the player saying there you

100
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,300
are.

101
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,100
And I'm going to add a new time in here.

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,080
Why am I doing this because we've decided that picking up ammunition should take time so I need to track

103
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:09,950
that track that by putting a new timer and I'm on call this rethel timer and and let's leave it as a

104
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,320
second for now and it is a one shot kill file once and then have to fire again.

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,090
This is going to have to be connected as a signal so let's do a time out connection to itself.

106
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,320
And there it is all the way down the bottom because I wanted to put a bunch of extra lines in now in

107
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,930
a moment and put some logic in here I'll check.

108
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,430
Do I need to restart the first thing that's going to happen at time a time out.

109
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,470
Is ammo.

110
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,400
Plus he calls one.

111
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,410
You know what I should probably put some sort of Gooly it shouldn't.

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,970
So let's do that really quickly get to a level one and this is just to be a place holography.

113
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,650
So I mean a make a canvas item capital letter rather a rename to g y.

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,640
And it's going to have a sub node that's a label.

115
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,910
And this label I could call it label.

116
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,200
Now I can always change it later it'll live in the top right which is over there.

117
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,570
And let's give it a theme.

118
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:15,670
Someone load the theman which is in scenes why do I put this in scenes.

119
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,760
I might use it for now and let's just write zero so I could see what it's doing.

120
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,440
I think that needs a margin doesn't it.

121
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,690
Margin the top from 10 Yeah it's looking pretty good.

122
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,050
Save that and let's just see how that zero looks in-game.

123
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,500
Yep there it is.

124
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:34,770
Awesome.

125
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:38,990
All right.

126
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,230
Back to scripts.

127
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,660
I'm going back into the play a script in you function and I call this Czech AMA and all this is going

128
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,330
to is say is the ammo less than the max hammer.

129
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,890
I'm doing this because I'm going to be using that quite a lot.

130
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,070
I may need that when I'm picking up ammunition.

131
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,270
I'm saying Can I still pick up ammunition.

132
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,520
He uses a couple times so let's just put that in.

133
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:13,520
And now I can make a new function and I make this refill area and anted which I may actually have spelled

134
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,200
correctly which is very unusual for me.

135
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
Let's double check that.

136
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,020
Wow.

137
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,830
I think I did.

138
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,850
Did I.

139
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,620
Sorry.

140
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,550
I'm very excited about this.

141
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,350
I wasn't expecting it.

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,190
No I didn't I miss an L.

143
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,330
I was so close.

144
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:35,950
I will never move on if check Amazon and I was going to do is run this function here and then return

145
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,650
true if it's true.

146
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:45,350
So if check ammo then I want to refill time as a start so refill timer got start.

147
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,890
And we also need to say can refill.

148
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
Too true.

149
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,630
So what's going to happen.

150
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,650
We'll walk into the area.

151
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,820
It's going to say do you have less than macsyma.

152
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,290
You can't refill IMO if you're at macsyma.

153
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,060
If so start the refill timer and set calorie felt a treat the refill timer will increase the amount.

154
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,770
Now only on time outs after a second of being in there that'll go up one more thing I need to do is

155
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:21,130
make a whole bunch of spaced and his seal I'm looking at is get rid of that plus have randomly put in

156
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:28,350
make a new function function refill area existed.

157
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,320
Why am I doing this because I need to stop the time.

158
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,920
So timer rethel timer I think is doing this because I'm not in the right scene isn't it.

159
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,660
Yes it is.

160
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,380
Okay that's fine.

161
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,630
Full time adot Stop.

162
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,330
And can refill he calls phos.

163
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,610
Now that's going to work fine but I'm not going to have to see how much I've got.

164
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,380
Right so right now I've got this gooey label go up here.

165
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm not changing this at any point so let's change that in a script.

166
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,990
Let's say Update go is our next function.

167
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,370
Now this is good.

168
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,970
Update The Gooly but the googie is down here in a tree.

169
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,570
The place is here so find do dollar guily even spell it right.

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,600
That's going to apply.

171
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,160
This is a sub node of the player.

172
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,690
It's not a subset of the place of some sort of low level one.

173
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Kevin I could do.

174
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,250
I could call a group called gooey or I could use get a..

175
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,670
I will be using a group later but I haven't made this scene yet.

176
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,800
When we design the gooey I make a prop go sing.

177
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,330
So for now I'm going to get a..

178
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,200
And I'm going to drag this in.

179
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,560
What I will do is make a note in here.

180
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,050
Move to group call when you make a ghillie.

181
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,360
And actually what the label don't I got to go is so slash label

182
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:10,120
dot text he calls Amr except text once a string an M.O. is an integer something that casts this.

183
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,710
Oh I've got insight on this.

184
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,510
I mean to cast this as a string.

185
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,000
So now Pressplay.

186
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,590
Like a stand in here the time or start and the ammo is going up.

187
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:32,440
So what I want do is really go into the placing and I add a new audio stream player.

188
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm not adding a 3D X I don't want to be positional sound.

189
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,900
Make a nice and quiet.

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,500
They're going to call this harp and if going to sound effects.

191
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,780
Harp glissando up sounds like this

192
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,740
perfect.

193
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,170
That's a reload sound I've ever heard when I get back into the script and I'm going to play that so

194
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,130
harp don't play.

195
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,470
And when we exit the area I'm going to go harp dot stop again to see how that works.

196
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,110
Now will also put an animation here so you could tell him in the area but that's like pretty good isn't

197
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,340
it.

198
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,400
No I have no doubts that the number isn't actually going on.

199
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,810
What's happening is the time that's happening.

200
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,770
Once I want to keep going.

201
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,850
So I'm going to increase them by one update the gooey and then check if we want to go again.

202
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:40,840
So if check ammo and then we'll start this time all over again.

203
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,790
And this timer is just called rethel timer.

204
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,120
I don't need to do an else stop because this is not auto starting right.

205
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,890
It's on a one shot timer.

206
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,040
This you have that looks.

207
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,810
I'm going to run into you here.

208
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,040
Lots of ammunition.

209
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,890
Can I get beyond five.

210
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:13,320
I cannot however look I can keep firing the ammos not going down.

211
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,360
So that brings me to the challenge.

212
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,570
I'd like you to lower the AMA have the ammo count drop by 1 whenever the player fires and make sure

213
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,480
the player can't fire when they have no ammo.

214
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:25,990
Right.

215
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,930
Because otherwise that's cheating.

216
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,640
Supposedly you give that a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

217
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,960
And welcome back.

218
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,660
Okay this is not as complicated as it might look.

219
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,610
So what I want to do is I'm go to try to fire.

220
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,590
So if can fire.

221
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,950
Now that's just telling me have you fired recently.

222
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,250
Right.

223
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,370
A fire at the moment once every second.

224
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,040
But I also can only fire it if we have enough gunfire and ammo is greater than zero.

225
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,520
So if I have zero ammunition this won't happen next.

226
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:07,970
I want to actually load the ammunition my legal one and update the jury now.

227
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,850
I can't fire pick up a little clinician.

228
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,510
And fire three to one no more firing.

229
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,740
Again I think we are a bit more variety when we could pick these up.

230
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,880
I'm going to put in a couple more of those three areas.

231
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,080
The court refill areas.

232
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:39,980
So let's duplicate you move one over here and one over here that looks good.

233
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,150
Let's see how that works out.

234
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Now this guy he is still very simplistic but look already this is starting to feel more going still

235
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,830
some more polish to go.

236
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,310
But I'm pretty happy with that.

237
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,380
You guys need to get out that door.

238
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,150
That brings us the video in this video with limited player ammo.

239
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,570
We've put in a brand new scene.

240
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,690
Just a refill area.

241
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,560
Put in a sound effect and a bunch of variables and some very simple logic to make sure that players

242
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,940
can pick up ammunition in certain circumstances and fire in other circumstances.

243
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,530
And we can keep track of how much ammo the player has.

244
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,520
Excellent work.

245
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,060
And I will see you in the next four years.
