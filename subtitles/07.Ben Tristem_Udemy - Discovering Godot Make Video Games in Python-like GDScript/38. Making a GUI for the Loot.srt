00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,240
Greetings glorious God people and welcome to alliteration day which is a thing I've just made up in

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,060
this video.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,320
We want to add a lot of style to the loot.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,490
What's the point of being a heist Meister if the loot doesn't look good so let's make a graphic user

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,010
interface for what for when we pick up the briefcase.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,770
I was an oddly poetic moment wasn't it.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:25,340
Okay.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,670
What do we need to happen.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,730
I'm picturing this the gooey element for the loot starts invisible.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,600
I want context driven UI when we pick up that briefcase.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,660
It's going to become visible and display an icon.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,740
Now in my game at the moment I only have one piece of loot.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,840
But theoretically we can have more so let's make something scalable.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,110
I'm thinking item this is our friend here.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,760
All right.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,700
Let's get in game and get started.

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,560
First thing I do is open my gooey scene so scroll down to see and over this saying I want to put the

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,760
onion right here.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,020
And I wanted to match.

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,150
So I wanna do is make a new nine patch rectangles child of going.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,450
And call this Loopt container.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,120
All right.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,730
Let's give that it's background so I need to go into graphics in two.

24
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,730
Well I put it interface PRNG scroll down till I find the glass panels.

25
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,420
And I want the glass panel with the top right corner because that's going to match everything else I've

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,990
done.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,230
So a glass panel call a top right.

28
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,230
And there it is.

29
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:36,110
And let's for now just move it manually like that tweak at the moment.

30
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,780
Alright let's recite it so we can see it we're doing and make the nine patch margins work.

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,760
So patch margin if memory serves these are all set to 12 pixels.

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,640
But I can double check that yeah everything's at 12 pixels and so are you.

33
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,480
Great.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,140
So 12.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,640
Awesome.

36
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,420
I'd like to match the height of suspicion's Let's do that.

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,650
I go over to suspicion go to size.

38
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,050
And you are too high or we have height.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,470
But okay that's give you too high.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,400
And got.

41
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,540
Slide her for a second there I think something just think Windows is backing up my hard drive.

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,530
The width will be fully there.

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,790
I can tweak that a minute.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,380
OK.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,660
We're off to a good start.

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,240
Let's get this in the right place.

47
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,410
I'm going to anchor it to the full screen or the full rectangle.

48
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,240
So lay out anchors full wrecked.

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,160
Let's put the lay out for now.

50
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,320
At bottom left.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,490
And let's add our margins if memory serves we have 20 picks on margin on each side.

52
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,920
Just going to double check that.

53
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,810
Do do do do.

54
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,090
Yeah.

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,530
20.

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,340
Awesome.

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,060
So let's do 20 from the left.

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:59,680
20 from the bottom like a negative 20 from the bottom.

59
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,810
That's what I meant and.

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,730
Negative 122 in my case from the top.

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,230
And you're not full rectangle again.

62
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,500
OK.

63
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,620
So going to rank this the full rectangle and look at OK.

64
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,730
So this now matches I know we have a nice grid shape.

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,840
Doesn't have to be a grid shape.

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,400
You can move this for now.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,210
This'll do.

68
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,520
Let's give it a label.

69
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,070
And I'm going to put the tax label as the list.

70
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,750
At least I would have clicked in the right box and I probably should put the theme in.

71
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,410
So let's go back to look container and load our theme.

72
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,530
Let's put the margins for that as well.

73
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,260
Memory serves.

74
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,610
It was 10 pixels each side.

75
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,010
So take a look.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,770
You dont actually have the mountaineer 23.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,350
So margin.

78
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,330
Twenty twenty three sounds like a weird number and from the left about 20 again.

79
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:12,760
Finally let's give it an item list so you know I'd like to list and I'm going to place that just here

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,750
and stretch it out.

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,830
In this particular case I'm not going to worry too much about the fact that I'm placing it manually.

82
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,920
I can tweak these later find it too.

83
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:30,370
But what we should do is check these sizes so first columns let's say you can have five items of loot

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,430
for now all the same column.

85
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,100
And let's shrink the icon again so I can scale zero point five.

86
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,150
I could do exactly what I've done here put a script on this item list which I'm going to rename by the

87
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,200
way so let's call this loot list.

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,270
I could get a script on loot list and run everything from there.

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,500
But remember I want this whole element to vanish which means I should probably put the script on the

90
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,200
linked container if I put the script on Luke container.

91
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,070
I can use visible true and false and it'll work for all the children.

92
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,270
If I just put on Luke list that's not the effect I want.

93
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,800
So let's make a new script for Luke contain.

94
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,000
And to put this in my scripts folder

95
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,620
and call it look container and it's good to go.

96
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:36,100
And the very first thing I want is a function for any jobs going to an asset visible to false and just

97
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,180
to check if it's working.

98
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,080
It's it play.

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,930
And you can't see it which is great because that's where wanted.

100
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,370
It seems weird creating a gooey element to immediately test that you can't see it but that's what we've

101
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,820
done now.

102
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,050
Let's make a new function call this collect.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,640
And the very first going can happen is visible equals truth.

104
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,030
Because if that doesn't happen nothing else will matter.

105
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,680
Now if I had multiple forms of loot what I would do is pass an argument here with what they were.

106
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,570
But for now I've got a game that only uses briefcases.

107
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,770
I'm going to do that.

108
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,920
And when this runs what I'm going to do is bring up the item list.

109
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,350
Sorry Hoodless will have called it go go along you use ads icon item.

110
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,820
I don't want any text but if I did I could see she's an icon.

111
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,800
That ad I can lightsome before we go any further let's actually add the briefcase to the global script

112
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,350
on my global script and remember if you don't see it just head on down to Scripsit your file system.

113
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,220
And I want to make a brand new reference to a variable and put it right here though sprite's call it

114
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,010
variable briefcase sprite's.

115
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,550
And here's a trick that I learnt from kids can code on YouTube who just fantastic tutorials and got

116
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,860
a you should absolutely check his stuff but I don't know you could do this and it's awesome.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If we go down to our graphics folder and go to loot and drag the suitcase look at that.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,990
It's copied the path over which is awesome.

119
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,040
That saves a lot of time.

120
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,740
So I'm going to save that back it's a container.

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,030
We need to add this.

122
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,310
Let's check what an item icon needs.

123
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,790
Some individual control a click on it.

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,500
You need the icon and if it's selectable or just added the icon so global dot briefcase Sprite and is

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,730
it's like double no.

126
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,490
All right we're almost good to go.

127
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,850
The one thing we need to do is make sure we actually call this function which is my charge fee.

128
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,450
I'd like you to make the loot gooey actually appear so call the Collect loot function when the player

129
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,390
picks up a briefcase just like the last few challenges.

130
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,010
There are multiple ways you could solve this.

131
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,900
So pause the video will come up with the one that you're happiest with and when you come back I'll show

132
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,850
you my solution.

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,170
And we'll come back.

134
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:11,010
I want to use a group so I'm up a container in two it's ungroup of fact I'm going use the interface

135
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,390
group which were already using double check that spelt that right.

136
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,000
But players do do do well using interface.

137
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,490
Yes I'm using interface gret So you're part of the interface group.

138
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,780
The next thing to do is call it as part of the Collect briefcase.

139
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,850
So right at the top here.

140
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm going to actually know what this does after the node comes in let's get tree call group.

141
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,890
It's not auto complete because I'm not in the right scene.

142
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:56,190
That's fine and we want to call interface and we want to call collect briefcase.

143
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,380
I should probably rename that to collect loot.

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,570
It should actually collect Loopt not collect briefcase.

145
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,760
Let's change that back to collect loot.

146
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,210
And if I had multiple forms of loot that I wanted to collect I would put the argument in here called

147
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,120
briefcase but I don't so I'm not going to know that should be everything we need.

148
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,210
Now you'll notice by the way that I'm using interface's group again an interface is being used here

149
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,320
for night vision.

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,810
What's going to happen if I call a method to a group and it doesn't have it.

151
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,310
So for example the briefcase doesn't have night vision mode.

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,990
It doesn't have dark vision mode.

153
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,400
The gooey or rather the vision mode.

154
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,870
No one ever hear this.

155
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,620
What do you call this.

156
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,420
I've got the name of it.

157
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,750
It's a canvas module that's what I say canvas modulate.

158
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,290
There it is doesn't have access to this method.

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:49,940
What's going to happen.

160
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,550
And the answer is nothing.

161
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,010
It'll call a method to the group.

162
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,150
And if an individual member of the group doesn't have that method it'll just ignore it.

163
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,100
The great thing is now we can have groups that do different things and just listen for certain call

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,470
the bad news is if you miss spell the group name God I won't tell you.

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,730
So you don't know if I've misspelled the name or if my function isn't working.

166
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,620
So double check before we test it and I move my briefcase over to where I can actually get to it so

167
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,810
let's get the briefcase good movement mode and put it here.

168
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,570
I don't really want to run all the way across the map just to test this is working.

169
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,710
Let's find out if it fits.

170
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,400
Here I am again and I crashed.

171
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,220
Why I crash.

172
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,650
Because once again I've forgotten that this is a strength not an object and I should have loaded this

173
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,480
in.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
I don't know why.

175
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,730
But this is a mistake I make all the time.

176
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,950
Let's try this one more time.

177
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,290
Do you do perfect.

178
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,330
I have a loot that needs to be a little bit smaller but that's fine I can do that and head over here.

179
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,440
You have a briefcase.

180
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,250
Fantastic.

181
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:51,620
All right.

182
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,820
Let's tweak the size of that so back to the gooey scene.

183
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
Back to my loot list.

184
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,770
Head down to Icon you're not zero point five user point two flightless you have that looks.

185
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,210
We could also use a fixed icon size if we want.

186
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,170
That looks good.

187
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,580
And you have a briefcase.

188
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,460
Phenomenal.

189
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,820
And that brings us to the end of this video.

190
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,740
In this video we're pretty much good to go.

191
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,960
Our game is almost feature complete the next few things we're doing to me by adding polish and expanding

192
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,130
the game to make a more scalable.

193
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,340
But right now you have enough to make a compelling level.

194
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,950
So that's what I'd like you to do.

195
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,800
Share your level put in as many doors as you want.

196
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,390
Vary the size of combinations put it lots of fun camera positions.

197
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,220
Make this a challenge for the player and I'd love to see what you come up with.

198
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,160
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
