00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,170
Hello again, you energetic, got people in this video.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,220
We're going to keep building our tutorial, going to add objective markers when the tutorials done.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,480
The play is going to be pointed at certain areas that they have to go to and do something so they can

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,960
learn the game.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,480
That pointy thing is what we're doing.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,660
So to do that, we're going to give the player a visual indicator, going to move the indicator around

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,510
to the next position.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,100
And that's pretty much it.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,300
So let's jump into it.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,700
And I'm going to let you know before we go any further, let's put the tutorial on this level, on this

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,420
spy screen.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,060
And to do that, I'm sure to copy these to something to highlight start button and label them on a duplicate

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,270
them.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,820
Now they've got over there, which is a city place for them.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,510
So let's just check our grid container has two columns.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:46,840
That's good.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,860
And I need to drag one of these stock buttons down here.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,940
Fantastic.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,180
Now, obviously, start mission stop mission is wrong.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,080
Let's change the label text for that.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,290
Let's say tutorial or start tutorial or play and automotives will hide the whole thing and bring it

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:02,560
back.

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,440
And it's just going to refresh all of our gooey elements.

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:06,280
Okay.

25
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,990
Now, currently we have two stop buttons, one to rename that tutorial button.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,880
And I'm going to go over to the signals and I'm going to disconnect the signal we have and connect a

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,860
new signal back to the lobby.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,210
And there we go.

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,370
And I can just duplicate this with control.

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,230
B, hold open down arrow.

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,280
And now I just need to change the reference to the scene.

32
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,810
So I'm going to levels, which is on the levels.

33
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,530
And you know what to do.

34
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,170
This way is right.

35
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,680
Click on it.

36
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,890
Copy path may light level one paste and be good to go.

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,090
Let's just take that works.

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,420
Best tutorial multimedia tutorial.

39
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,400
Fantastic.

40
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,770
OK, so energy toil.

41
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,060
Let's make the tutorial work.

42
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,070
So we're in tutorial now in the shita.

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,120
Let's make this story work.

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,500
First thing.

45
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,360
I'm starting to change your mind about these lights.

46
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,560
I think they're a little overpowering.

47
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,020
And all I want to do is turn down the energy on them.

48
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,870
So it's will them go zero point five.

49
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:14,190
So let the other end call it zero point five and let's refresh us our memory.

50
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,010
Let's refresh ourselves now has refresh our memory on what we're gonna learn here.

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,510
So we learn move with this from this foam.

52
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,520
We can learn.

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,330
Open the door.

54
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,080
You're going to learn.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,410
Use night vision mode.

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,530
We learn briefcase with a briefcase.

57
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,150
It's here and exit.

58
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,530
Each of these is going to be a brand new objective.

59
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,130
I don't put them in the scenery first.

60
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,520
Let's just give ourselves a little bit more room.

61
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,060
Everything is very big right now as doors and new objective.

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,090
I feel like the door here is sensible.

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,560
Something to slam a door, make chairman move and just drag it to the end of the corridor and let's

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,040
just see how it looks on press play.

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,440
And you watch a trial and there's a darkened door.

66
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,040
Very nice.

67
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,640
OK, great.

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,660
OK.

69
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,510
So with that done, let's start putting some areas in.

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,340
Now we don't even area for move.

71
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,800
That's going to happen the moment it comes in.

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,910
So we're going to do it on like a brand new organizing notice.

73
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,500
Put a new note in and I'm gonna call this objective areas.

74
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,340
And I'm to fill this with area duties.

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,010
The first one is going to be over here.

76
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,240
So we're moving to let's make a brand new area.

77
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,750
Tutti.

78
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's going to need a collision shape somewhere at in a collision shape.

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,360
Tudi.

80
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,660
Excellent.

81
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,000
And your new rectangle.

82
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,190
It's a good size.

83
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,930
It's a 64 by 64.

84
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:32,500
Great.

85
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,460
So there it is.

86
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,160
And I'm gonna select the top one.

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,450
And let's do.

88
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,160
Don't select children, sir.

89
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,690
Only ever select the parent.

90
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,540
And now I can move that into position.

91
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,560
That's what we gonna move to.

92
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,640
So move over here.

93
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,380
We could make this a little bit more interesting, but putting some some obstacles in this room.

94
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,550
But that's give me my basic move.

95
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,450
Now I'm thinking this door is too close still.

96
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,510
So let's fix that by going to the tile map.

97
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,250
Where is Maternelle map?

98
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,310
It's on navigation, 2D tile map.

99
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,430
Boop, boop, boop.

100
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,270
Too soon.

101
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,960
And that's why the door's going to be.

102
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,650
So now I'm gonna move the door over here.

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,620
And the reason I'm doing that is I want the player to actually have top charts to read it.

104
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,730
No, that's not new objective.

105
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
So the move this door.

106
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,940
And it's not packable.

107
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,210
It's transform, but change that rotation.

108
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,390
Now, you probably put another light in here.

109
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:33,910
So I'm gonna take this light to D and duplicate it and let's move it to right here.

110
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,280
This one is a lot smaller.

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,340
It's two energy, zero point five.

112
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:39,660
You know what?

113
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,710
This one is zero point as well.

114
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,010
Go and let's make sure I've got this correctly selected.

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,440
And on a scale it right down.

116
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,350
So let's say is zero point two five.

117
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,400
Point two five.

118
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,360
How's that looking?

119
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,340
That's looking much better.

120
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,290
And let's rotate.

121
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,680
It's on first etisalat rotation and w to move it.

122
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,000
Each rotated a bit more.

123
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,140
And that's, you know, that's looking pretty good.

124
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,270
OK, so there's a first objective, and I'm going to move that into the corridor a bit.

125
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,560
UPS not rotate it, move it into the card orbit, and it's renamed this one this move objective.

126
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,750
OK.

127
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,340
It's tweaking the but let's duplicate that and with the new one over to the door and I'm going to call

128
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,820
this objective.

129
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,680
Now, this is what we'll do when we go through the door.

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,730
So this so in a move, this objective is going to give us a new objective.

131
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,380
Get the door.

132
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,170
So it's coming with the door objective just to the other side.

133
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,370
And among the planning it through the door, that objective will kick in.

134
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,110
At which point night vision kicks in.

135
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,140
So let's duplicate Dorje objective and move it down to here.

136
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,600
Can I call this night vision objective?

137
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,050
One molas duplicate you and go over to the briefcase.

138
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,150
Nicole, this.

139
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,010
Briefcase objective.

140
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,790
OK, so all of these trigger signals.

141
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,010
I got to let the game know something should be happening about now.

142
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,700
Now I think we should create the Sprite that's gonna tell the player where to go.

143
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,120
So let's go right to the top and add a new Sprite.

144
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,000
If we load a texture.

145
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,030
So on the graphics, on the interface and a Panji, we've got these crosshairs.

146
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,990
I'm thinking this one.

147
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,650
That's the one Anglaise.

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,420
So you could use a pointy finger.

149
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,300
You could use her.

150
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,310
So what if your knees.

151
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,210
I'm gonna use this one.

152
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,010
Now you'll notice first.

153
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,740
This is behind the wall.

154
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,520
That's no good.

155
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,410
That's above the wall.

156
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,630
Let's go to that index and go up to.

157
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,720
Now, it'll always be about the war.

158
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,370
Second thing you'll notice is it looks good now, but how do you look in the dark?

159
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:56,940
Let's find out.

160
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,500
Tutorial.

161
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:02,700
Terrible.

162
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,900
You can barely see it.

163
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,400
So let's give it its own light.

164
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,700
First, rename it to objective.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,880
Object to the point of.

166
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,870
And let's add in a light two days light tutti.

167
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,370
And the texture is way, do the texture going to get to my objective marker?

168
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,200
Copy this.

169
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,560
Now back to my life, Judy.

170
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,010
I want to pace it in ordinary.

171
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,150
I wouldn't suggest doing that.

172
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,370
But we want this light to always be the same.

173
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:35,750
Texas.

174
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm okay with it for now.

175
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,570
Now, I'm not going to move this into position because the game needs to move it.

176
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,370
In fact, that's not true.

177
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,840
I want to move it to the players.

178
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:51,810
So it's right here and now we want to happen is we want the cursor to move from here to here.

179
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,310
And then once you get there to that.

180
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,360
So the next area.

181
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,880
The next area.

182
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,020
First thing we need to do is we need to start to connect these by signals and connect to my signals.

183
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,310
Tutorial must have a script.

184
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:09,510
Let's create a script and let's start connecting these someone to do move objective and body entered

185
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,220
physics 2D.

186
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,880
And each one needs a different signal.

187
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,560
So I'm going to go through them one by one body answered back to tutorial.

188
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,610
Body entered Bachchu tutorial.

189
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,500
Body entered.

190
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,280
Back to tutorial.

191
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,370
Now, usually when we're moving things around and got out, we're going to be using animation play.

192
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,460
Animation play doesn't just move things physically.

193
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,310
It's also it can move properties.

194
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,550
Right.

195
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,400
So we could say, okay, change the color over time.

196
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,080
We could say change the scale.

197
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,190
We could do all kinds of stuff.

198
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,650
But what do you do when you don't know the start and end values?

199
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,430
It's much harder to feed those into an animation player if I know that this area will always be exactly

200
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,850
here.

201
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
That's one thing.

202
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,730
But if I don't know that right.

203
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:06,230
If I need this area to find out where this position is and move there, we're going to be using a tween.

204
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,460
No.

205
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,600
So let's add a tween and I'll teach you how to use it in the moment.

206
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,660
OK, one more thing we need is positioning now.

207
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,550
We could just use the areas.

208
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,270
But I also want to introduce you to a brand new thing that's really used when you're putting levels

209
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,600
together.

210
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,370
I want to introduce you to a position note in this case position Tutee.

211
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,540
And if I move position to the right here for the player, this little cross-hair.

212
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,290
What's interesting about this is this is a position you can use in engine, right?

213
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,540
You could use this as a rotation axis.

214
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,310
You could use this as a place to go.

215
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,620
It's a way that we can mark information.

216
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,430
It's actually just a node to deal with a different graphic.

217
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,970
If I play the game, it doesn't show.

218
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,960
I got go tutorial.

219
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,360
There's nothing there.

220
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:50,790
Right.

221
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,120
This is gonna be really useful for us.

222
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,560
So I'm going to make a brand new organizing node.

223
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,190
And I'm going to call this objective just how to spell.

224
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:05,810
Wow.

225
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:06,380
OK.

226
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,260
Jack, give positions that go and I'm gonna put it right here next.

227
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,100
The objective areas.

228
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,670
I put this position in that and I'm going to call this move objective.

229
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,870
Great.

230
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,100
And let's move that to here.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,900
Now, you notice it's not in the same place as the actual area.

232
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,950
It's a little through it.

233
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,630
That's because when the plant enters it, I want them to still see the objective and then see it move

234
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,270
and where they're going to move to copy that and put it over by the door right on top of the door.

235
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
And then I call this door objective.

236
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,000
And I want a copy that is you're going and put it right here.

237
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,830
And I'm to call this nitrogen objective.

238
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,600
I don't know why I put a capital V in that.

239
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:18,610
And now I need to go to the briefcase under control d duplicate and rename you to Loopt Objective and

240
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,960
Control D..

241
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,850
This was the exit objective.

242
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,440
Now, what's important here isn't what I've called them.

243
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,650
What's important is the order they're in.

244
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,080
You see, I'm about to write a function that's going to go to this objective positions and find them

245
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,620
in order.

246
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,840
Here's how that's going to work.

247
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,100
I may go back to my tutorial.

248
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,190
And.

249
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,570
Am going to make a Branly function, Lefranc functions to be called updates pointer.

250
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,810
Positions.

251
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,130
And it's going to take a point of no objective, no dispassionately objective, no.

252
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:07,680
OK.

253
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,020
The first is going to happen is we did a fine off there.

254
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,430
It's the first variable I want.

255
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,750
Let's go to your big screen mode.

256
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,180
Let's see, we got a variable called Pointer.

257
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,990
And what's the pointer?

258
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,690
It's this objective, Malkia.

259
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,080
So we gonna go pointer.

260
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,680
Which one's point?

261
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,650
Objective pointer.

262
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,190
There it is.

263
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,120
Fantastic.

264
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,790
Next thing, the place we're going to.

265
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,350
Now, ordinarily upright position, but position is already being used.

266
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,250
I can't use that.

267
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,410
So instead I'm going to call it place.

268
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,940
I could call it objective position.

269
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,530
Objective place.

270
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm right place for now.

271
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,410
And what do I want to do?

272
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,150
Well, if we look over here, I will say go to the objective positions node and then get the child that

273
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,990
matches the number.

274
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,550
And remember, we're counting from zero.

275
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,700
Effectively, we've turned this node into an array.

276
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,920
So I'm going to go objective position's objective object safe.

277
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,820
What is so much trouble is what positions.

278
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,330
There it is.

279
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,390
Dot get child's.

280
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,670
And then I want to use objective number.

281
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:21,910
So if I pause zero through here, place will be defined as whatever node is in position zero, right?

282
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,170
Which is right here.

283
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:30,440
One, two, three, three is in the wrong place.

284
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,950
Glad I checked that, let's move three Luling, three two over, Larry.

285
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,060
Over here.

286
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,320
So three great.

287
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:40,770
OK.

288
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,280
Let's go back into our script.

289
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,570
And the first thing to do is go function.

290
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,840
Ready?

291
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,720
And I want to call update point positions or update points, positions, position.

292
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,340
Zero.

293
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,380
That shouldn't be in plural, should it?

294
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,540
Now let's make it actually move.

295
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,790
By the way, I don't think this will move yet.

296
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,480
Explain unexplained in a moment, but just a heads up, that's something that's not going to happen

297
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,620
here.

298
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,520
So what do I need to do?

299
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,320
I need to move it.

300
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,840
To do that, I'm going to use my tween.

301
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,010
Now, tweens are quite annoying to set up with a lot of little variables.

302
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,430
One of the reasons that you really do want to use animation players when that's the right answer.

303
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,580
But sometimes tween is the right answer because we can take any starting value.

304
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,380
Go get an end value and tell it.

305
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,500
Okay, move between them.

306
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,020
Do that.

307
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,200
I want to use interpolate property.

308
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,910
That's gonna take a whole bunch of arguments first.

309
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,560
What am I interpolating.

310
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,630
I'm a interpolating the pointer.

311
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,620
Okay.

312
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,380
Now give me the property as a node path.

313
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,200
In other words, as a string right position.

314
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,480
I want to move it right.

315
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,240
What is my initial value pointer.

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
Dot position.

317
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,160
So whatever, wherever it is now, that's where we're starting.

318
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,150
Let's go to the next line.

319
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,890
Thank you, very loud motorbike.

320
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,370
And let's say, where am I going to this place?

321
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,480
What position?

322
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,230
OK.

323
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,520
How long is this gonna take?

324
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,770
You can play with this plan, it's say zero point five, so take half a second.

325
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,310
What is my transition type?

326
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,420
You got all these different ones to work with.

327
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,030
These are a lot of fun to play with.

328
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,890
I'm going to use sign, but really try to for once.

329
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,570
Hey, I like them.

330
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,870
Finally, what's my transition?

331
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,490
Do you want to in Georgia, start slow and go into it?

332
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,960
You want to start abruptly and end gently.

333
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm Ledoux's ease in and out.

334
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,260
Now this on its own won't do anything.

335
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,350
We also need to run the function.

336
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,610
Tween dot start.

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,210
OK, let's give that a shot.

338
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,640
And remember, I don't think this will work.

339
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,180
Let's find out.

340
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,550
Tutorial.

341
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,730
I was wrong.

342
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,590
OK.

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,710
So if it doesn't work, his boy Y is going to happen.

344
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,060
I'm really happy it did work.

345
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,170
But if it doesn't.

346
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:08,680
The reason is Dotto is going to initialize nodes in the tree in the order they appear.

347
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,670
So if I want to start using this folder, it's possible it's not ready yet.

348
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,440
If that's the case, you want to use yield, which means wait.

349
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,550
And then you tell it.

350
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,160
Elliot wakeful to do that.

351
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,270
I'm going to go get tree.

352
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,710
Tree.

353
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,110
There it is.

354
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,160
Comma, idol frame, weight one frame.

355
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,190
All that's going to do is just tell go before you run the next command.

356
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,340
Just wait affright, let's play.

357
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,020
And if you had problems of that before, it should now.

358
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,220
I didn't.

359
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,180
So, I mean, rid of that.

360
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,580
So that was working perfectly.

361
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,120
Now I just need to update my point of position with the next objective.

362
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,620
I actually don't want to be in full screen mode for this Sakiko Maxim Fort's.

363
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,820
Let's take a look at our objective areas.

364
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,120
And let's see, we have an object, various objective positions, so we have move, the next one is

365
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,160
going to be Dorje objective.

366
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,420
So I'm going to duplicate this and move it down and change this value for one.

367
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,660
And I'm sure duplicate this one done to here.

368
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,810
And there should be two different parts.

369
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,020
And same thing, right?

370
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,900
So Troopergate, you move you down, get rid of that lying.

371
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,210
Three.

372
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,920
And one more Troopergate down.

373
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,710
La, la, la, la law for now.

374
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,660
Have we done it right?

375
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:40,070
Let's find out because tutorial got big screen nose and he's gone horribly wrong.

376
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,990
And I suspect what's happening here.

377
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,590
So if you're getting that bug, go over to your objective areas.

378
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,110
And I think what's happening is the area itself is being triggered immediately.

379
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,930
So just go to areas and each one remove the layer down.

380
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,700
And we should get rid of that bug.

381
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,770
Boop, boop, boop, boop stick.

382
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,310
Look, look.

383
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,050
Tutorial March, we're going to hear.

384
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,190
It's going to move out the door.

385
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,360
We get to the door.

386
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,560
We haven't opened it.

387
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,490
We open the door.

388
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,570
We go through.

389
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,540
Head down to here.

390
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,680
It should go through the briefcase.

391
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,090
So we're going to have to check this area right here.

392
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,750
That is my night vision objective.

393
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,820
It's in the right place.

394
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,190
It was the wrong signal.

395
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,850
That's why they would disconnect you.

396
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,100
And do the right signal, so always check your actual tutorial of working properly.

397
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,460
I can get rid of this line completely.

398
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,510
Move this one up.

399
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,850
There we go.

400
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:51,830
OK.

401
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
Let's check this one more time.

402
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,840
Do you actually check these stories?

403
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,070
A lot of moving parts.

404
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,100
That's gonna move over here to the door.

405
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:00,840
Open the door.

406
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,610
La, la, la, la, la.

407
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,290
Now, you should have the briefcase.

408
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,100
Fantastic.

409
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,120
And the briefcase should now point to the exits at the exit with my loot.

410
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,540
And I finish the tutorial and that's looking pretty good.

411
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,860
One more thing we should add.

412
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,290
Let's just quickly add to the debate.

413
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,020
An audio stream affect our sound effect for this.

414
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,460
So audio stream player.

415
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,780
And at see under doo doo doo doo doo, sfx, SFX.

416
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,050
We have we used a message.

417
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,220
Wow.

418
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,900
That sounds good.

419
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,190
Let's see how that sounds great.

420
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,510
Make sure it's not looping.

421
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,500
Click on it.

422
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,380
Make sure looping is off and then re-import if I need to.

423
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,480
But right now, that's perfect.

424
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
Someone has to drag you into my.

425
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,330
Click on it, drag you back into the stream, and let's make sure the nice quiet Sigmund's five.

426
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,710
And now let's actually play that.

427
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,790
Someone make this up.

428
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,290
I need to rename this.

429
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,460
So let's rename this message and.

430
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,350
And to make that nice and easy, rather than write it for each line and write it here.

431
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,570
So audio straight player, that's our message sound.

432
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,210
Don't play it quickly.

433
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,630
Check that.

434
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:29,940
I'm quite happy with that.

435
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,000
Still a bit loud.

436
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,070
Let's turn that down.

437
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,840
Let's say minus 10.

438
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,630
And one more thing I want to do, I want to quickly move that point out.

439
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,360
So let's say the subjective point to here should be the other side of the door.

440
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,610
I'll take my door objective point to make sure I move and just move it just the other side, because

441
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,020
they know they have to go through this door.

442
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,250
Now, we will have the text in the next in the next video, not the next level.

443
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,920
But that feels like a really good place to end in this video.

444
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,710
We've looked at 13 notes and again, do play with these are a lot of fun.

445
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,310
We've used position to d to mock movement positions.

446
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,580
So just as something we can look at an engine that just helps us make the level.

447
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,420
And we've looked at using the parent load as an array using get child.

448
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,710
So excellent work.

449
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,120
And I'll see you in the next video.
