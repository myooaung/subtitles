1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,720
Hello again you vibrant go to people.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,820
We're now getting to the point now game where we can stop.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,860
Make it exciting right now we have a simple little maze that you can sneak around and see how long you

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,810
can survive the we're gonna have an objective.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,200
We're going to add some loot now the way this is going to work in the game is when you put loot in a

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,890
secure place and I'll level and the play is going to get to it.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,490
And once they have it they can go back to an exit but there's various ways we can do this.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,880
And today I will talk about using as node to create an object oriented approach to inventory.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,940
What does that mean.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,670
It means rather than using a bunch of variables like an instance variable in the player code I have

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:55,740
some briefcases we're going to create a node under the player at runtime called briefcase and then later

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,680
which is going to check does the thing that has entered the exit area.

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:06,720
It's a bit clumsy does the thing who has gotten to the exit have a node in it called briefcase or loot

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,210
if it does you can move on for like several if it doesn't do nothing.

15
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,460
So that's what we're doing today to do that.

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,550
We're going to jump into here and make a brand new scene and I'm going to use an area 2D.

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,190
Why am I using arrow city.

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,160
Because it uses collision which means we can detect if something hits it but it doesn't stop things

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,840
from going through.

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,420
Which is exactly what we want.

21
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:39,450
Nicolas briefcase and let's see on the graphics under PMG you'll see a folder called loot.

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,400
We have two options.

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,370
We have suitcase and loot.

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,940
I'm going to be using suitcase but you can use folder and you could use both.

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,360
I will add a whole bunch to it.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,450
You can make your level is as simple as complex as you like.

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,430
I'm using a suitcase want to do that.

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,950
Add a sprite.

29
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,370
That was control a drag the suitcase over here.

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,490
Now this is 64 my 64 was a little bit too big for me.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,130
So want to transform on the scale and make sure you're doing this on the sprite not on the briefcase.

32
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,410
So don't do it here.

33
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,030
That will mess things up.

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,060
I'm going to scale this down by zero point five.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:30,440
And let's give this a collision shapes on the briefcase control a collision shape 2D and make a brand

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
new Rectangle.

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,590
When I click on that and give it extents of 32 by 32 that may still be too big but we're going to work

38
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,570
with it for now to save that like a brandy folder or.

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,270
You call the items you call objects.

40
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,470
I'm gonna call it loot.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,660
So this way you can make as many different ones as you could.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,840
So you can make bigger and bigger levels with more and more intricate ones.

43
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,390
If you're going to be doing that I would recommend making a loot template like we do with the characters

44
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:05,470
template and each different type of loot will inherit all the properties and just change the sprite.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,850
Okay so couple more things I won't do.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,910
One select briefcase got a collision and we should change the layers.

47
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,620
It will not be on any layer at all and it will only interact with the players.

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,330
This means if NPC is walk through it or if they tried to text it nothing will happen.

49
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,780
So we don't have to do any kinds of fancy if conditions we're just going to use the built in collision

50
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,510
filters.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,220
Next up going to create a very simple script for the briefcase press create and first thing to do is

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,590
go back to and the very first image to put in there and click on briefcase again.

53
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,870
You'll got a note and we do a signal on body entered physics body 2D.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,040
It's going to connect that to itself.

55
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,380
So on briefcase entered the signal is going to come through with this argument body.

56
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,120
This argument is a thing that has entered it.

57
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:06,630
Well it can only be the player because it won't trigger otherwise song to go body dot collect briefcase

58
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,850
so when the player walks into the briefcase the briefcase is just going to go Hey you there run your

59
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,180
function called collect briefcase and then it's not gonna worry about anything.

60
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,770
We're gonna keep the data for the briefcase as simple as possible and the next thing is going to do

61
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,850
is go queue free.

62
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,760
He only pick it up once.

63
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,000
We now have a nice simple function and the briefcase is done so we can go back to our player script

64
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:33,930
suddenly go.

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,890
Here's how I'm doing.

66
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,400
Before we do that let's bring in the suitcase.

67
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,550
I feel in here some ways less dangerous.

68
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,690
Yeah that looks good.

69
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,160
And we can add more doors computers this is a simple test level to say what I'm doing but I'm thinking

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,640
up here.

71
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,190
And don't forget because it's all Tom maps you can make this as complicated as you like.

72
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,100
OK.

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:05:00,440
So let's bring in a brand new node because we're using nodes to organize our level to control a no no

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,620
control Q control.

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,180
A thank you.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:11,240
There's going to be a node and it's this one loop and you know what I want to bring this up here somewhere

77
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,950
just because reasons all this loot the instance and a child saying What briefcase Hello briefcase.

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,670
Make your move and just drag it to the right place.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,300
When you think about who that's mean isn't it.

80
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,350
We could rotate this we do what we want but I feel like that's a good place for it.

81
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:38,720
OK so now we need to make the player able to pick up the briefcase so the player needs a function as

82
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,360
opposed to placing and go into the script and it's right down the bottom on the get the skies or under

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,890
the skies.

84
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,740
Let's make a function called collect briefcase.

85
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,540
I think it's what I call it.

86
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,410
Let's double check on the briefcase collect briefcase.

87
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:54,890
There it is.

88
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,280
Great.

89
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,580
So player you're going to create briefcase.

90
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,390
OK.

91
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,090
So this is going to be adding something to the scene.

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,200
So I'm gonna go.

93
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,330
I'm gonna define what's gonna be.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,110
So then of course will increase that code loot and this is just go be a simple node because doesn't

95
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,790
have to do anything it doesn't have any functionality it's just gonna be a simple node which it can

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,120
check.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,260
Do you exist.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,920
OK.

99
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,710
So that's my node looped dot set's name.

100
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,820
I want this no to have a name in this case I want it to be called briefcase.

101
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,200
I'm giving you the capital letter because nodes have capital letters so just to remind me about it that

102
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,760
it's a node.

103
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,060
OK.

104
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,110
So we've added defined a brand new node was told it this node is going to be called proof briefcase

105
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,260
briefcase.

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:52,490
This is what happens when you record videos of the my brain my speeches slurry child looked up and now

107
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,010
that should be everything to test this.

108
00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:01,280
I'm going to go into here and I'm remote and let's go show you what's happening in life.

109
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,080
I'm going to open player and that's my placing so back into the game I gonna keep that there and make

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,130
this nice and thick.

111
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,200
And now I've got actually a way over there.

112
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,040
All of a sudden 7 0 6 0.

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,950
This is quite difficult 7 0 6 0.

114
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,220
No no no no no don't see me.

115
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,630
This is the first time this has actually been difficult.

116
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,960
Okay.

117
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,860
Thank you.

118
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,590
I'm a box

119
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,510
cheese.

120
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,250
Okay.

121
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,920
I'm enjoying this.

122
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,870
La la la.

123
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,460
Now if memory serves there is a camera up here.

124
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,780
And here is my briefcase.

125
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,080
Now we could make the briefcase visible.

126
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,770
Well I like that I can hide behind this desk.

127
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,170
And it crashes what it crash

128
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,520
because I forgot to make that a function.

129
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,400
I will do the same thing.

130
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,030
I might forward a bit and grab it and look the briefcase now has arrived.

131
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:14,140
So now we'll be able to use has node to detect if there is a node in that call briefcase.

132
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,160
Oh goodness.

133
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,420
We don't have an exit yet so I don't know where I'm running to.

134
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,690
But this is already a lot more interesting.

135
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,250
Right now I've got a reason to go into a dangerous area and I think that's a pretty good place to end

136
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,730
this video.

137
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,750
So in this video we've use an object oriented approach to inventory.

138
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,480
You've already seen this like I'm shown again and we use and we're going to prepare things for has node.

139
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,380
I think that's really good progress.

140
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,000
We've gone from a nice little tech demo to something that's actually enjoyable to play.

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,410
Make this as complicated as intricate as you like.

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,130
Put has lots of different loops have easy sections difficult sections really make this game your own

143
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,070
meanwhile excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
