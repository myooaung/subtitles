00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.770
Welcome back delightful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.420
We're going to create a last NPC we're going to make cloud and cloud comes with lightning.

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.800
When I'm thinking about the cloud in B.C. going to do something a little bit different I'm thinking

4
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.740
that cloud doesn't directly hurt me.

5
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.470
Okay so this isn't an area to D.

6
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.060
We're not going to use that has it's going to do something different.

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.610
What we'll do is check if money is directly underneath the cloud and if Bunny is going to fire lightning.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.730
But we're not going to machinegun lightning.

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.060
Right so every few seconds you can fire lightning if one is beneath you.

10
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.230
If bunny passes beneath you again while you're in time out while you're reloading the lightning whatever's

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.720
happening tough you can't do anything about it.

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.340
Cloud itself is just going to drift left and right in a very similar way to spike.

13
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.030
So let's get to it.

14
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.390
First thing we need to do as you might expect is create a new scene as you mean get rid of that graphics

15
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.940
bug and the scene and make a note to Dee.

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.440
That's going to be my route.

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.610
Why am I using a note to day.

18
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.100
Well in a moment I'm going to bring in something called Cloud clouds.

19
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.100
Look like this and have a little face and it's going to animate left and right and to do that we're

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.510
going to use the position right specifically.

21
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.730
Position X Y.

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.940
However the position X and Y is relative to the parent.

23
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.960
So if we don't have this node here if we just put in a sprite which is what were going to be using we're

24
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.160
going to run into a problem.

25
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.840
Let me show you the problem.

26
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.110
The parent will be NPC an NPC position is 0 0 relative to its parent.

27
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.550
Which means if we animate cloud it'll take its position from this container node and go here left and

28
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.350
right.

29
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.000
That's not what we want to solve that we're going to put in as an extra No two days in between them

30
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.430
and then all the things will come in underneath here like this Sprite and were going to Adamic the Sprite

31
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.570
not the note hoodie.

32
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.050
Want to call the noted cloud and just save it for now it scenes.

33
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.510
Let's actually bring in the graphics graphics on their enemies.

34
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.680
Here's a cloud and whoops actually select the Sprite drag it onto the texture.

35
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.850
And there is a very grumpy looking cloud.

36
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.550
Awesome.

37
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.290
What else we need.

38
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.070
Well we need to animate so let's bring in an animation player animation player is here and that's going

39
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.860
to be a child of the Sprite node code.

40
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.270
So Sprite is gonna be the parent for any do the animation at all.

41
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.010
The rest of it.

42
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.450
This is a container.

43
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.950
OK.

44
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.180
This is what's actually doing the work.

45
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.870
What else do we need.

46
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.560
Well we need to detect if bunnies underneath and to do that I'm going to use something called a Ray

47
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.420
cast or recast to de zoom in you can see it.

48
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.310
This is the long arrow.

49
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.210
Ray Castor very interesting.

50
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.390
They don't actually exist in the world.

51
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.930
Okay.

52
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.630
Imagine if you will that there is this I.

53
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.600
And though I can see Bunny.

54
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.140
This line of sight here that's a recast.

55
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.440
And they're useful because if anything breaks that Ray cast we can then run a signal from it.

56
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.160
That's way too small.

57
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.780
I want a really big break cast I want probably a size or so.

58
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.030
I don't know why it would be.

59
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.330
Three thousand that's about the the level.

60
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.470
Now we have this ridiculously long grey.

61
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.280
Awesome.

62
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.300
And let's just check.

63
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
We're on the right click and ask the right cast to D is only going to interact with the player doesn't

64
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.060
care about anything else.

65
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.750
Doesn't matter if something else intersects with it.

66
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.300
One more thing you need to do with a recasts hoodie.

67
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.940
This is surprisingly easy to forget so let's drill this in nice and early.

68
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.200
When you make a recasts hoodie it is not enabled by default.

69
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.420
So right here.

70
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.940
Make sure you enable it.

71
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.060
Otherwise nothing will happen and it's really frustrating.

72
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.960
One more thing I want.

73
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.080
I want a timer because I want a time when cloud can do stuff.

74
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.350
That's looking good.

75
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.930
Let's eliminate so into the animation player so let's make a new animation and then call it float Hmm

76
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.820
ready to go.

77
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.920
So we to animate the Sprite.

78
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.260
Remember we're not animating the cloud.

79
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.650
No to deal with not animating the parent were animating the Sprite.

80
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.380
We need this key frame of 0 0 that I'm putting in now.

81
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.060
That's relative to its parent.

82
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.990
So we need that gap if we don't have that gap.

83
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.370
It'll be relative to this and that is at the global zeroes or so or a cloud to be in one place we don't

84
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.830
want that.

85
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.350
All right let's look at this animation the animation look like.

86
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.720
Well I need a really long animation I'm thinking 20 seconds that feels good.

87
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.410
I was going to happen it's going to drift left for four seconds wait for to drift right.

88
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.710
Wait for two.

89
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.710
So I'm only using intervals of two seconds.

90
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.000
I'm a changed my step to two seconds.

91
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:07.060
And what that means is the time is going to only be moving to two second intervals as can be helpful

92
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.920
for me because I was zoom out which is this way.

93
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.800
There we go.

94
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.090
And now all I'm dealing with things I don't have to worry about being on second.

95
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.920
Twelve point six or something silly like that.

96
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.190
So let's see one drift left by how far on a go.

97
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.960
Quite a distance this go left negative 800.

98
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.380
So at four seconds you'll be negative 800 make a key.

99
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.450
Wait two seconds.

100
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.740
It can take four seconds to get to the centre.

101
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.490
Another four seconds to get to the right that's positive 800 key.

102
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.370
And make that key run with this line here means it's just waiting there for two seconds.

103
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.700
Couple of more things I want to do.

104
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.780
I want to loop this animation so it gets to 20 it's going go back to the beginning.

105
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.990
That's why here I've got a four second gap to be at that position.

106
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.290
Other thing on do I want to autoloader this animation.

107
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.140
I don't want to have to start it in script started immediately.

108
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.060
There's no reason for this not to play.

109
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.650
And that's going to go that way.

110
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.030
And then that way back.

111
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.860
Let's just play it.

112
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.380
So nice for second rift over there.

113
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.820
Cloud waits for two seconds four seconds to get to the centre.

114
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.790
Another four seconds to get to the right.

115
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.770
Wait for two seconds.

116
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.340
And back again.

117
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.130
All the way to the left.

118
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.490
Awesome.

119
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.460
That's exactly what we want.

120
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.730
It's now time for a script.

121
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.830
So let's get you back to zero and let's make a script.

122
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.470
In cloud.

123
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.720
Let's make a new script put it in a script folder and call it cloud Judy.

124
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.110
Okay what do we want to happen.

125
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.470
Well I don't need anything on ready.

126
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.820
I could start the animation here but I don't need to start an inspector.

127
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.530
There's no reason to do this in code.

128
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.830
So let's start with detecting when Bunnings underneath.

129
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.290
So on the process.

130
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.410
I'm going to check if something is colliding with the ray to do that.

131
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.290
I mean it call the ray.

132
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.290
And then use a built in function to show you there's built in function are going to hold control down

133
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.880
and click on it and is colliding.

134
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.170
That's exactly what you want.

135
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.690
Let's make this a little bit bigger.

136
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.550
There we go.

137
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.460
So back into cloud is colliding.

138
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.490
What do we want to happen.

139
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.720
We want you to fire the define fire in a second.

140
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.290
So very simply if something is colliding with the right cast using a built in function run Firefox.

141
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.110
So let's make a five function function fire.

142
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:53.060
And for now you right pass let's make that nice and tidy.

143
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.060
Okay.

144
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.210
What needs to happen if you're not timed out.

145
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.050
Remember you can only fire if the time has elapsed.

146
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.000
So let's make a timeout for that.

147
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.360
I'm going to go back into 2D.

148
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.570
You and I'm on a connect the timer to this script with a signal.

149
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.210
First off let me get to second time.

150
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:17.790
That feels like a decent interval and I hear time out you can connect it to klout on time a time out.

151
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:18.440
Looks good.

152
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:20.310
Alright.

153
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.370
Now I need a variable call this variable time out.

154
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.920
This is a FOSS at the beginning of the game.

155
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.040
You are not timed out so you can fire.

156
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.700
I can also call this unable to fire and at that time out feels good to me.

157
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.700
Some call that.

158
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:47.200
When the time has finished with a set this back to False time out equals false goes there.

159
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.650
And now we can make a fire.

160
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:53.950
If youre not timed out then what do we do.

161
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.160
We're going to spawn lightning which want to write the comment for now because we don't actually have

162
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.660
a scene to spawn in with a start the timer.

163
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.630
And the set time out to true time out there.

164
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.000
And that should be everything except for the actual lightning.

165
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.840
Before we make the lightning scene and then spawn in here.

166
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.910
Let's look at what we want lightning and see.

167
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.410
Okay lightning is going to drop straight down.

168
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.030
It's not going to accelerate it's not starting slow and it being hit by gravity is being fired.

169
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.060
It's going to move at a constant speed.

170
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.820
It's going to vanish if it hits the train or bunny.

171
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.060
Now this is different from what we've been doing up to this point.

172
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.910
We've been using collision masks and hazards can only interact with bunny.

173
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.260
Now it needs to detect touraine.

174
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.980
However it won't hurt Bunny if it hits torain So we need different logic.

175
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.880
If we just use the hazard script and then set the collision mask to hit Bonnie or touraine every time

176
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.850
lightning hits the ground bunny will be hurt.

177
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.070
I also want the lightning to vanish if it's off screen.

178
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.980
I want this to be q freed right only to release it from memory.

179
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.890
I don't want lightning dropping down the bottom of the world forever.

180
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:16.390
Eventually that will slow the game down and I want to hurt bunny.

181
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.120
If lightning hits Bunny and only Bunny.

182
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.320
So let's get to it.

183
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.710
Brand new seem to leave you.

184
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.170
And it's not going to be an area truly.

185
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:37.880
We've seen these plenty of times so area to and I call it lightning because it's a good name for it.

186
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.080
And let's just close all these things you know.

187
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.750
And if the collision shape before I do that let's see the size of what we're trying to collide with

188
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.020
so let's give it an animated Sprite animated.

189
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.310
No way you could spell animated Sprite.

190
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.450
That's what I'm looking for.

191
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.820
And you know this is not in enemies instead of that look in.

192
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.620
Go back up one and look in particles.

193
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.860
This is originally a particle in Kennie's asit pack but we're going to use it as one not really a particle

194
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.950
as a projectile really.

195
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:17.650
Let's make a new Sprite frame and at the Sprite frame and we're dragging my blue and my yellow.

196
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.910
And let's play that.

197
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.250
Kind of having with that speed.

198
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.080
Alex gets me.

199
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:28.470
We could do other stuff like make it we'll flip or anything like that but I really like that.

200
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.220
If you want to change the speed of it remember you can just change the frames per second so if you want

201
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.660
10 frames per second or two frames per second.

202
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.170
But I quite like five.

203
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.730
Some leave us five.

204
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:40.480
OK.

205
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.370
You are animated.

206
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.300
What else do we need.

207
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.110
We need a collision shapeless make that.

208
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.720
Glad you showed it to me.

209
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.760
And you know what I'm going to stop you flashing for now lightning because that's going to get a little

210
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.600
annoying.

211
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.780
Okay.

212
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.450
New shape you can be a rectangle.

213
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.510
And I've said it before then keep hammering this home for a while longer member to drag the extents

214
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.280
not the scale handles so it's going to be baltz.

215
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.240
That's a bit wide.

216
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.510
Let's.

217
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.440
Let's see.

218
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.220
That is twenty eight by fifty seven.

219
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.900
Awesome.

220
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.560
Can a high glitter shape and make sure whenever I drag lightning around them I'm dragging the whole

221
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.420
thing not just the low child.

222
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.010
And there's one more note I want to use here.

223
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.510
This is a new node would not use before

224
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.280
visibility notifier 2D detects when the node is visible on screen.

225
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.480
In other words this is a way you can check.

226
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.760
Is this on screen.

227
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.800
Which is exactly what we want.

228
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:48.750
Okay now we have this seeing let's say that lightning looks good and give us a script.

229
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.960
Remembering to put that in scripts.

230
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.600
Awesome.

231
00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.050
And I'm going to go global and I will make a new scene location because we need to leave the scene.

232
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.630
I'm going to go into scenes just like I've done before find lightning.

233
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.920
Right click on it and do copy path and just paste it here.

234
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.830
Great.

235
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.520
So now.

236
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.900
This is ready to go.

237
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.990
Let's actually spawn it.

238
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.780
So back in lightning.

239
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.220
How are we going to spawn this.

240
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.930
I want to add a child of the great cast a wanted to happen exactly where that race is so if for some

241
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.370
reason they want to move the race somewhere in the Sprite Let's say I don't want it exactly here I want

242
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.750
it.

243
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.740
More like that like whereas mouth is then the lightning will happen where the detection is just feels

244
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.990
a lot better.

245
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.070
So for that to work what I'm going to do is I'm going to call the ray.

246
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:54.450
And then I'm going to add child add child adds a child node.

247
00:13:54.470 --> 00:14:00.700
Right so it's going to add a node that is a child of recasts hoodie a child to be adding wedding lightning

248
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.210
which you just put in global so global dot lightning.

249
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.090
Awesome except global hot lightning is a string.

250
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:17.550
I don't want a string I want the object itself I want the seam so I need to convert this variable from

251
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:23.460
string to object and to do that I'm going to cast it with load.

252
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:29.720
So in the same way that I can turn a variable into from an integer into a string like we did with the

253
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.270
Gooly which I can show you.

254
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.740
In fact let's show that right here.

255
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:42.350
Since you do so you'll see here where we have the number of coins as an integer.

256
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:49.190
And we're casting it as a string so that the text can be displayed as a text file right.

257
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.430
It can't display integers it can only display strings.

258
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.090
We have a very similar problem right here.

259
00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:01.010
By casting it from a string to an object a file object we can upload this.

260
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.130
One thing we will do we want to dot instance.

261
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.800
That's a function.

262
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.680
What does function do.

263
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.790
It allows us to bring several of these in at same time.

264
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.800
Right so we're going to bring in an instance of this scene and you can bring in multiple instances so

265
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.170
that's exactly what we need.

266
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.510
And that should be good to go.

267
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.440
If we put this in right now the lightning isn't in the movies you hover there.

268
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.250
So I think we should probably put some sort of movement in before we test that first thing to do is

269
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:34.940
only to use speeds or make a constant called speed and lightning is going to travel at two hundred pixels

270
00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.500
per frame.

271
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.100
We can fix that later.

272
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.190
Feels good to me so far but we can make it very fast or very slow.

273
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.700
This is a thing you could change if you really wanted to.

274
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.640
You could turn this into an export variable but to me it feels like a constant.

275
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.910
I mean to make it a constant.

276
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.490
Currently we don't need a body functions let's get rid of it.

277
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.030
Well we do need to do is move on the physics.

278
00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:03.990
Well a new function called Move down screen which is going to let lightning move downstream.

279
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.530
Now you might be asking why don't I just use move and slide.

280
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:14.160
And that's a decent question and the reason is moving a slide which I can show you right here belongs

281
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.760
to kinematic body 2D kinetic body to 2D is a type of physics body.

282
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.860
Area hoodie is not OK.

283
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:28.420
So if I look at lightning and I click on area today that's a collision object.

284
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.950
They don't inherit the same functions.

285
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.890
It's a moving slide is not available to an area to day.

286
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.810
So we need to create a movement.

287
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:43.390
I will bring Delta into it and that's going to allow me to multiply the speed by the delta which is

288
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.850
going to make it frame independent.

289
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.970
Remember Delta is the amount of time between frames.

290
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.680
So how long it's been since the last frame.

291
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.390
Multiply that.

292
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.900
That means we're always going to have a constant movement.

293
00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.330
One more thing on Wanna do I want to make sure that if lightning is not visible then it should be removed

294
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.900
from memory so I'm unclear.

295
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.580
If not we need the visibility modify.

296
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.680
Let's actually make sure I'm in the right scene.

297
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.390
Or to complete one work.

298
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.150
Visibility notified to me.

299
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.130
OK so what do we need.

300
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:20.710
One of the functions is on exactly what we want on a close the things I'm not using.

301
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:27.460
If you're not answering is on screen okay.

302
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.060
If is not on screen.

303
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.870
Q3.

304
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.250
Great.

305
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:39.520
So now we don't have to worry about a whole bunch of lightning instances coming in and slide again.

306
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.780
Next let's make this movement.

307
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.540
Move down this screen.

308
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.900
And that uses Delta.

309
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.570
OK.

310
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.310
What I want to happen.

311
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.120
I want you to move down the y axis so position.

312
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.890
Why.

313
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:03.100
Plus equals speed times Delta.

314
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.090
There's actually an issue here.

315
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.130
I'm going to demonstrate too.

316
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:13.850
Let's bring in a cloud and I'm going to put the cloud somewhere sensible solo.

317
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.360
There's a scene of cloud.

318
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.410
And just drag it.

319
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.010
Member of got move selected so it does matter where I click we'll put it here for now I guess drift

320
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.330
quite far left and right.

321
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.700
What I'm expecting is when Bunny is directly beneath here the lightning is going to fall.

322
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.170
So let's see what happens.

323
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.630
Whoops.

324
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.740
Yes.

325
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.030
There's an issue right there.

326
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.650
Timer is wrong.

327
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.650
Sprite's slash timer.

328
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.800
Honestly I should've seen that coming.

329
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.730
So let's test it.

330
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.960
So here's the cloud and it drifts and it drifts and it fires the lightning and the lightning doesn't

331
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.190
go straight down and so it follows the cloud.

332
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.940
So why is that happening.

333
00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:10.840
It's happening because lightning is being spawned in as a child of cloud which means its position is

334
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:18.820
relative to the parent which means we need to lock that in place so I make a new variable called exposition

335
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.920
expose.

336
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.840
That's a factor too.

337
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.780
And then I am putting the ready function back.

338
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.320
Budget ready.

339
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.270
Why are you doing things because you need brackets setting a function ready.

340
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.300
Much more like it.

341
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.140
What needs to happen.

342
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:47.480
I need to set the Expos as global position dot X. Okay.

343
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:55.840
Now when you move down the screen I need you to reset your horizontal position to expose every single

344
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840
frame.

345
00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:03.160
Keep your horizontal position where it was and let's move that to global position because that's really

346
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.490
what we mean right this global position.

347
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.660
And just to make it consistent Let's make the fall global as well.

348
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.290
And now free press play.

349
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.050
Here comes the cloud.

350
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:20.980
It was the lightning the lightning is moving or it needs to break.

351
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.100
It's currently not hitting this ring.

352
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.840
It's not doing anything with great so let's fix lightning first thing we do.

353
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.190
Make sure our collision lasts correct.

354
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.430
You are not a player.

355
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.700
That's a really silly bug.

356
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.960
If this is a player if it's on collision lay a player then the cloud is going to detect its own lightning.

357
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.780
And every time it can fire if he sees lightning you'll fire again that's going to miss everything up.

358
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.410
It's an enemy not a player.

359
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.620
What it can interact with players and touraine.

360
00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.400
It needs to be able to interact with the train which means that we need a function called manage collision

361
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.650
kind of a clunky name.

362
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.870
You're going to go with it anyway.

363
00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.830
Nice and big.

364
00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:06.260
Let's make this managed collision thing function manage collision or I was just going to do it.

365
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.380
It needs to check what the lightning is touching so I need to see what's in the area.

366
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.120
2d right.

367
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.300
What bodies are in this shape.

368
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:20.730
If the body is the player needs to apply damage and then whether it's the player or not it needs to

369
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:22.540
cue free first thing to do.

370
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:29.480
I need to get the object that's inside the area to do that I need a new variable and call it Collider.

371
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:30.930
What is this.

372
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.580
This is get.

373
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.620
Overlapping bodies.

374
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.050
What is get over that in bodies.

375
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.780
It's a built in function of area 2D.

376
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.030
Right there it is.

377
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.580
And it just returns a list of things inside the area.

378
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.490
Awesome.

379
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:54.250
Now when you use a for loop a for loop does fall and then whatever I want to call this in and then a

380
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.950
variable that it knows whatever I call this doesn't actually matter.

381
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:05.530
Okay I haven't defined all these Xs or whatever I call it they call it object for the object in the

382
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.110
collider.

383
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.190
So while this thing whatever it is while this is there check it and do something.

384
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:18.620
So this is the bit I'm acting on and this is the thing you are checking Let's make the little clearer

385
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:27.720
an example if object equals equals global dot player equals equals because I am checking a value.

386
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:34.050
I am not setting a value why am I making a big deal of this because I've made this mistake so many times.

387
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:42.190
If the object is the player you need to be hurt a global dot game state DOT hurt because that's our

388
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.110
pain function.

389
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.880
Whether or not it's that's on back an indentation whether it's the player or train you need to cue free.

390
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.100
Okay let's check.

391
00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.670
Here comes a cloud of blue.

392
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.290
There goes the lightning.

393
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.600
Didn't take damage.

394
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.550
Also we now have a cloudy ABC with lightning.

395
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:11.730
Ha.

396
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.960
Which brings me to the challenge.

397
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:15.210
Ha.

398
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.640
I'd like you to bring this on puts some clouds around your level.

399
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.270
Don't be afraid to tweak it if you want.

400
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.630
Move some spikes and Spike in and jump pads and everything else.

401
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:28.670
This is a time to make your level real awesome because the next thing to do after this is add an exit.

402
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.190
And then our level is complete.

403
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:35.200
So pause the video bring some cloud in pieces in level that's exciting as you can.

404
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.470
And then when you come back I'll show you my Levellers.

405
00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.200
Welcome back.

406
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:49.680
Okay let's bring some clouts into 2D mode and I want to be in season one which have closed because I'm

407
00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.540
very clever at level one was level one level one is in level.

408
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.370
Found it.

409
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.340
I get I get that actually feels like a good place for you.

410
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.800
So cloud and move it down a bit.

411
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.690
There we go.

412
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.740
Let's make a nother club.

413
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.560
I don't want to put it here right.

414
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.670
It could go through the train.

415
00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.640
But then the lightning is gonna hit the train it's got to useless.

416
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.240
Let's duplicate this cloud was not a good place.

417
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:18.790
I feel like that is a really scary place for it.

418
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:25.240
It's only here can interact with that and then right down here and we'll put one more in keep you nice

419
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.600
and high.

420
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.860
Yea right here.

421
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.530
This can be a little of let us put you here so the player can actually see you.

422
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:36.270
Let's see if I can finish mountable.

423
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.180
Jemmy you go.

424
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.060
And already we've added Our whole layer to this game right now.

425
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:55.830
Spikes try to talk will play very difficult go a spike that might give us the stress or just adding

426
00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:00.410
in the sense of timing having to avoid not just Spike moving left and right.

427
00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.710
But these lightning bolts is making this game a lot more interesting.

428
00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.140
Oh what have I done.

429
00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.470
I've made a game that I copley Square becloud.

430
00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.430
Oh before I forget one more thing I need to do.

431
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.750
Let's go into the lightning season and re-enable this animation because that looks a lot more interesting

432
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.510
was checking.

433
00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.400
Voters like me it's me like that.

434
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.450
There you go.

435
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.690
That's GOSPER geek in this video.

436
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.250
We've looked at some key concepts.

437
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:33.830
How can we bring in a..

438
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.200
How can we.

439
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.810
Instance a scene while the game is running.

440
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.440
How can we use a cast hoodie.

441
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.540
And remember always enable the right cast to.

442
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.670
If you want it to work and how do we check the body that's just entered an area too deep.

443
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.330
Using a for loop.

444
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:53.040
Don't forget to share the level that you've now made and excellent work and I'll see you in the next

445
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.610
video.
