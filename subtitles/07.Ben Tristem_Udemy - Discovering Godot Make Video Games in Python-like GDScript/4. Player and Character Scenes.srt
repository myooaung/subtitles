1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,510
Halloween, you momma's got people in this video way to create a character scene and a play a scene.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,330
So got something to move around all world and get this game started.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,120
Now, why am I talking about characters and players as if they're different things?

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,200
Because in our game, we're going to use character inheritance.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,320
We're gonna have a base current class from which pieces and end pieces are going to derive basic functions.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,870
Now, we don't have to worry about that too much right now.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,060
So we're just going to be focusing on the play a character.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,510
But I do want to set up a system whereby the players inherit from the character.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,290
OK.

10
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,060
To do that, we're going to get into got oh, here's a lovely desk.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,290
Here's a lovely camera.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,510
Everything's looking at Brown.

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,480
We can fix that later.

14
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,860
That desk might be a bit big.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,850
We can fix that later, too.

16
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,790
First binary Hussein custom node.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,080
Kinematic body.

18
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,360
Make sure you've got this red one, the 3D.

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,150
We don't want kinematic body tutee or it's going to go weird.

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:56,470
OK.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,240
So this is gonna be my character class.

22
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:04,150
I'm going to use a mesh instance and just make a basic cube, which is right here.

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,700
And you keep Meche just to see what we're looking at.

24
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,370
Now I'm going to click on the cube and change the size.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,410
It's gonna be two meters on the Y axis, roughly two meters tall, which is exactly two inches tall,

26
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,340
which is roughly six feet.

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,280
And let's say point five on the two axes.

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,140
That's gonna be our basic character.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,300
Nothing in the game is gonna look like that.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,690
That's just so we can work in the editor.

31
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,130
You also notice that the origin is here.

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,840
I kind of want the arch by the floor, but I don't want the mesh instance going through the floor.

33
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,900
So what we do is I'm head down to transform with mission since selected and I'm just gonna move it up

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,200
by Mehta's on the Y axis.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,800
Move it up by one meter and that's perfectly on the floor.

36
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,950
Let's rename this I call this character.

37
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,850
And where to put it now in the previous version, this course, I put all scenes in scenes and all scripts

38
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:52,750
in the folder called scripts.

39
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,530
I've included the scenes here because we've got some fixes to our raw assets that I've put in here for

40
00:01:59,530 --> 00:01:59,980
now.

41
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:04,870
Let's just go into the character scene and I'm just gonna save it in characters to save us.

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,940
And I realize we're not done with the scene.

43
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,680
Safe scene, right?

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,900
Going have two scenes.

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,840
We need two characters and I'm going to put it right here.

46
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,490
Why not put it in place?

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,100
Because employees will also use this script.

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,720
Currently, it's a big white box glowing in the light and kind of like that.

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,980
And we need a collision shape.

50
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,270
So back up to character, new node.

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,740
And I want collision and.

52
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,270
But now we could use a cube, a matchup perfectly, but I won't be using move slide, which means I

53
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,520
want things to slide off and push away.

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,680
And if we have right angles, it's much harder to do.

55
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,140
So instead of is what a lot of games use.

56
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,840
We're going to use a capsule, the capsule, DP rotates and stuff.

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,240
This allows us to get good collision and interesting behavior.

58
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,130
If we don't need the collision to match everybody pop perfectly if we're playing a very, very precise

59
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:54,610
shooter.

60
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,020
This wouldn't work, but we're not.

61
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,600
So it will be OK.

62
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,330
We need to rotate this on the red line, which is the x axis by 90 degrees.

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,590
And we need to move it up by a meter.

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,770
So that's the y axis by meter.

65
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,480
It's also too big.

66
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,370
So let's head over to the shape press capsule and let's set a radius of half a meter.

67
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,240
Look at that.

68
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,830
That is perfect.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,850
We could say that.

70
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,960
OK.

71
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,040
That is our character.

72
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,010
Now, let's go make an armature scene.

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,620
Now, we already have some models we can use.

74
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,710
If we got a models, good players, we have human and woman again, not entirely sure splitting our

75
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,580
characters into human.

76
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,690
A woman is the best idea.

77
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,970
The thing is, I want to be able to drop these in to a character.

78
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,010
I just have them work, and for that to happen, I need everything to be named consistently.

79
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,360
Let's see what we have here.

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,760
We have human armature with human mesh underneath, which is animation player.

81
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,280
Animation player has a bunch of animations.

82
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,440
OK, now let's look at animated woman.

83
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,910
We have armature woman.

84
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,800
I don't know how much a tooth for.

85
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,030
And we have animations with different names and different named buttons to make this consistent.

86
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,090
We'd have to do this.

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,440
We'd have to rename both of these two mesh.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,500
Don't actually do this.

89
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,180
I'm going to explain what's going to have to happen.

90
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,140
We'd have to move the animation player to be a child of the armature.

91
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,510
So that way we could just export the armature, would have to rename the armature as well.

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,690
So let's put that there for now.

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,020
Just there.

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,350
That's consistent.

95
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,640
But now we have a problem right now.

96
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,340
These no longer work because I've moved the mesh.

97
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,780
It's in a different place from the armature.

98
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:45,420
So someone is going to have to go through all of these and change every single one of these manually

99
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,590
for every animation.

100
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,960
And that is a lot of work.

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,330
And the good news is you don't have to do it.

102
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,420
I've done it for you before we look at where these are.

103
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,440
Why is this happened?

104
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,300
This is happened because katanas has very kindly made free and open source assets for everyone to use.

105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,480
But he makes one a month and he doesn't make them consistently.

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,520
Well, when I say consistency consistently, he makes one a month, but he uses a different paradigm

107
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
for each one, different naming conventions, different scales, all kinds of stuff.

108
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,250
So to make them work consistently, I've had to go through and edit them in almost no circumstance when

109
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,380
you're making your own endgames.

110
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,820
Will this happen because you're either gonna be creating or assets or working with someone who's making

111
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,490
them for you or buying a pack.

112
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,890
So let's head over into the scenes, characters, players.

113
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,730
And you see here we have an ominous folder with him, which is much f an image.

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,720
M don't worry too much about much F being missing.

115
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,760
If he has the animation and play any animation.

116
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,130
You'll see this that I have made sure they have identical animation names.

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,030
So if I call.

118
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,030
We don't have a jump, no jump as he's running since upo got lost there.

119
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,750
Forgot term of jump running mate.

120
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,370
We need to rename that so that now.

121
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,870
But they haven't both have a running animation.

122
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,710
Like, so.

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,330
OK, so let's say we want to update the running animation.

124
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,890
Call it run.

125
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,760
Click on animation.

126
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,900
You can rename.

127
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,730
I gonna call it run.

128
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:09,750
Great.

129
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,710
Have I missed any others?

130
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
We have punch working.

131
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,990
Jump Idol.

132
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,830
Death with the male.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,020
We have death.

134
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,440
Idol.

135
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,260
Punch run.

136
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:17,820
Working.

137
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,570
Great.

138
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,170
OK.

139
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,670
So now we have consistent ones.

140
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,940
And if we look at the actual trees armature mesh animation plan, which means if we instance in either

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,880
the male or the female armatures, the script is can have the same exact path to the animation player.

142
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,790
We are going to call the same animation name.

143
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,390
And it's just gonna work seamlessly.

144
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,680
If we hadn't done that, we will have to write a completely separate script for each of these characters.

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:51,780
Furthermore, we have other problems, by which I mean if we take a look at the translation, this really

146
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,100
came like that.

147
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,510
Leave it to us.

148
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,200
However, if we look at the female one.

149
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,130
This is facing the wrong way, right?

150
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,070
So the male is facing the blue line, females facing the right.

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,630
So let's just go to the white and zeroed out.

152
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,880
So there's lots of little tweaks of change.

153
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,140
The biggest pains for you.

154
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,010
So they're not there.

155
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,530
I always said pains in the in the rear, but I'm not going to.

156
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,810
Everything else should be working.

157
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,750
So we have our two lovely armchairs ready to go.

158
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:22,960
OK.

159
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,530
With all that said, let's start using one.

160
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,140
So I'm a dude from a character new inherited scene.

161
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,780
I'm an inherit from character and I'm going to rename this player.

162
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,710
Now, I'm not going to save this player.

163
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,740
I'm gonna say this either as player or player F.

164
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,940
And the reason is later we're going to create code.

165
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,610
Going to allow the player to pick that.

166
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,420
Play a character.

167
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Right.

168
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,630
Putting customization in all this is built with customization mind.

169
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,720
However, I want them both the call player.

170
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,080
That way, if I'm calling, for example, the animation player, x just player, animation player and

171
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,400
so on.

172
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,550
So it all works just fine.

173
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,370
Okay, so we have our player.

174
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,380
I need to save this on the players as player.

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,460
And now I'm arbitrarily choosing the male character because that's just what I happen to pick.

176
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,500
You can pick a different one in here.

177
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,490
I'm an instance in.

178
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,830
My armature m.

179
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,730
And already we can see a bit of a problem here.

180
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,090
Right.

181
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,190
The scale is off.

182
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,090
This character is two meters, four meters, six meters, eight meters tall.

183
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:30,870
OK.

184
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,160
We want two meters tall.

185
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,390
So let's select the armature.

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,470
That's got to transform.

187
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,440
And let's just do point to five in all three axes.

188
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,130
Now I'm changing the armature, which if we look at the scene, doesn't have any collision.

189
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,390
I'm not scaling collision.

190
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,310
You really don't want to scale collision.

191
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,730
And if I now hide this mission instance, look at that.

192
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,900
That's pretty good.

193
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,840
We could probably shrink this collision shape a little further.

194
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,110
But I'm.

195
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,680
Yeah, you know what?

196
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,370
I will shrink a little further.

197
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,820
So let's go to the actual capsule and change it to point to five.

198
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,150
Doing that has made this a little bit too short.

199
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,100
So I'm going to drive the extent to the floor.

200
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,040
Beautifully done.

201
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,440
Here is our brand new player character.

202
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,770
Now, both players are going to be using the same scripts and make a script.

203
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,720
I'm not going to call it player male.

204
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,250
I'm going to call it player Dr. G.D. and let's make it empty, haha.

205
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,960
OK, now I mentioned earlier.

206
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,150
Let's just close this animation window and, you know, gives us lots of room to play with.

207
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,400
I mentioned earlier that we can be using moving slide.

208
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:32,670
Right.

209
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,160
I want things to hit and roll away rather than hit and stop.

210
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,970
So if I'm using the slide, I know I'm going to need a motion variable, which is gonna be a vector

211
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,230
three.

212
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,220
And I'm not running this every frame.

213
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,710
And I won't be doing this on physics, celestial physics process, Delta.

214
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,250
So on every frame we need to move.

215
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,140
OK, let's see what move means.

216
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,860
Like a brand new move function.

217
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,210
I don't need to post Delta through and not using it.

218
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:00,960
All right.

219
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,830
So what we've be doing here is every time, every frame we need to be checking, if any, the controls

220
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,050
are being pressed and move from there.

221
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,190
So let's set up controls.

222
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,460
Only had project project settings, input map.

223
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,300
We've done this a few times.

224
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,480
Right.

225
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,180
And let's say forwards.

226
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,140
Back.

227
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,310
Left.

228
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,110
And right, OK.

229
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,260
I'm just going to set these up with the keys for now, these WSI deep because I'm using a British quater

230
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,760
keyboard.

231
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,910
Obviously, if you using, for example, a French keyboard, set it to AZT, that's fine.

232
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,860
If you need a controller, use a controller.

233
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,490
I might program my controller at another point for Mountain Dew to be OCD.

234
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,210
Get this working.

235
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,040
And we've done this before, too, right.

236
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,740
I want to use the input, get extra strength trick so that if I do this controller, it'll work just

237
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:53,950
fine.

238
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:01,920
So let's make a variable called X and this is gonna be input stopped, gets action strength.

239
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,920
And this is going to be forward and that's a B minus inputs dot get actual strength.

240
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,230
And that's going to be back.

241
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,670
So Ford is is going to be won back is gonna be negative one.

242
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,340
Oh, good.

243
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,120
OK.

244
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,910
So variable Z because we're using 3D here.

245
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,920
Why is up and down.

246
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,600
We're not touching up and down right now.

247
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,150
Input stopped.

248
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,350
Get actual strength.

249
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,080
And I want.

250
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,390
Right.

251
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,290
Minus inputs.

252
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,530
Don't get actual strength.

253
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,440
Left, right.

254
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,880
So now I'm going to set motion to be effective three.

255
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,250
X, zero, Z.

256
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,560
Now we're gonna be changing the mood.

257
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,730
Now, later, we are gonna be changing how movement works.

258
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,410
These are what mouse look and we're gonna have to make sure that the direction keys are actually not

259
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,350
in line with the world and alone and land with a camera which is moving with the mouse.

260
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,330
So it's gonna be some changes.

261
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,220
But for now, that's looking good.

262
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,460
Now, we also need a few other things.

263
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,910
We need a constant

264
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:21,980
speed.

265
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,890
And let's just start with a speed of 10.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,030
We can tweak these values in a bit.

267
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,480
Okay, so we have our speed of 10.

268
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,650
But you'll notice if I run this.

269
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,670
Nothing will happen to demonstrate that and go to my level template.

270
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,140
I'm going to instance in.

271
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,250
Player M..

272
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,780
And run the game.

273
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,370
Here's my character and pressing the keys.

274
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,480
Nothing is happening.

275
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,070
Why is nothing happening?

276
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,320
Because we need to actually call, move and slide.

277
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:56,080
So my challenge for you is to use move and slide to move the player character.

278
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,970
This is really a very simple test to see how comfortable you are with moving slide at the moment.

279
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,920
Now, before we go any further, you'll notice this tip here.

280
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,220
Don't multiply by Delta in moving slide, move and slide automatically multiplies by Delta.

281
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,350
Moving collide.

282
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,380
Does not.

283
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,760
If you multiply it by Delta and move and slide, you're actually multiplying by Delta squared, which

284
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,050
would be acceleration I guess.

285
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,880
So pulls the video.

286
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,870
Give that a shot.

287
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,280
I don't know why my knuckle just cracked.

288
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,170
And when you come back, I'll show you my solution.

289
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:27,700
And welcome back.

290
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,110
OK.

291
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,430
So back into the game again.

292
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,480
And this is going to be move and slide, not moving collide.

293
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:34,930
What am I doing?

294
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,690
Move and slide.

295
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,820
Got too excited there.

296
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,610
And what we need is motion.

297
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,470
However, we also need to put the floor normal.

298
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,540
We're dealing in 3D.

299
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,030
We can't leave this blank.

300
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,500
Couple things we could do.

301
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,970
We can make it brand new cost up here.

302
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,850
Call it up.

303
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,890
We could be a vector three of zero one zero.

304
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,230
Right.

305
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,230
Zero on the X, Y on the Y.

306
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,010
Zero on the Z.

307
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,260
Or we could type that vector three in here.

308
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,310
I'm going make the constant.

309
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,420
And just drop it in.

310
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,590
And that should work as Pressplay.

311
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,800
In big on the screen, and it does.

312
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,150
Now we're moving very slowly.

313
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,120
And we're actually moving globally, so the camera should be over here.

314
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,570
So I'm going to move the camera.

315
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,230
Do Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, look over?

316
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:33,040
Like so you and I need to rotate us off or rotate and rotate by negative 90 degrees.

317
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,250
Look what that looks like.

318
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,540
Yeah.

319
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,180
What postpunk is better.

320
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,890
Now, why is the character going so slow?

321
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,630
Well, because I'm moving by motion.

322
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,760
Motion is one less de motion type speed.

323
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,800
I forgot to put speeded up.

324
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:46,950
OK.

325
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,230
So now we should be moving much more easily.

326
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:50,920
Look at that.

327
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,260
And we can hit the desk and the desk goes flying.

328
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,090
The test is too big.

329
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,230
It gets locked around our heads.

330
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,050
But that works great.

331
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,960
But we are not changing direction.

332
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,220
Let's change direction.

333
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,520
OK, so we want to be facing the direction we're travelling now.

334
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,790
If we had done.

335
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,060
If you're pressing forward and you're not pressing back, move X.

336
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,240
If you're pressing back, end up moving forward, X is minus one.

337
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,490
If we'd done every single step of that, this would be a lot simpler.

338
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,620
But because of streamline this, we going to be a little bit clever with our mathematics.

339
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,280
So first thing we do is we need to change the direction we're moving.

340
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,060
If we're actually moving, if we're not, I don't want to snap back to looking forward.

341
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:37,350
So let's put it an if statement, if motion, rather, if not motion is what I mean is equal to vector

342
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,530
three zero zero zero.

343
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,680
In other words, if you're not still all right, that's the cleanest way I can think of phrasing that.

344
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,080
Then we want to face forwards and we're gonna pass through X and Z.

345
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,650
OK, so now let's make a function called face forward, and we need X and Z.

346
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,630
Now we're gonna be using radians, so if I look at rotation, careful, because rotation is not the

347
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,930
same as rotation degrees, rotation degrees uses degrees.

348
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,930
There are 360 degrees in a circle.

349
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,610
Rotation uses radians.

350
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,380
I didn't study radians at school.

351
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,370
They were never talk to me.

352
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,410
I stopped doing mathematics.

353
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,390
They just 16 and didn't do it again until I did my master's degree in education, at which point we

354
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,110
didn't cover it.

355
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:38,730
But a radion is a way of measuring an angle and two times pi radians is a full circle.

356
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:46,860
So with that said, the rotation is going to have to equal something in that value range.

357
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,070
And to do this, we need some trigonometry.

358
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,520
We can use the octane.

359
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,800
And we need two values.

360
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,020
And we use X and Z.

361
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,900
And we want to do this just on the Y axis.

362
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:58,080
Right.

363
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,510
We don't rotate all three axes.

364
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,300
I'll be honest, I don't know my trigonometry well enough to fully explain a 10.

365
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,760
I just know if I want to take two directional inputs and turn them into a rotation.

366
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:15,360
I need a ten and I'm using two inputs, so I need a ten, too.

367
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,850
Now, when I press play.

368
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,240
We'll find that pressing back makes us look right.

369
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,960
Passing laugh makes us look back, pressing forward makes us look left and pressing right makes us look

370
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,290
forward.

371
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,730
The marshes off by 90 degrees, knows two things we could do here.

372
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,650
We could either do some mathematics here.

373
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,370
And to do that, what I would do is I would subtract half times pi.

374
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,100
So I subtract half Pi or Pi over two if you prefer.

375
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,710
And that will work so I can go into that.

376
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,810
And pressing back left and character now works.

377
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,020
Right.

378
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,520
The other thing we could do.

379
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
I'm actually on leave it as minus pi.

380
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,620
Whatever to.

381
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:06,420
The other thing we could do is we go into the plant and we could take this mesh and we could rotate

382
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,600
it.

383
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,550
I would suggest not doing that.

384
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,350
And here's why it is by 90.

385
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,860
First off, I'm on the wrong axis.

386
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,690
So let's find the right axis or take this by 19 nuke or take this by 90.

387
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,640
Okay, so Verity's by 90.

388
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,840
Are the animations still gonna work.

389
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,050
And the answer is not really.

390
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,150
I mean they kind of do.

391
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,970
It's a bit messy.

392
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,440
You can do it.

393
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,890
I would recommend instead using all radians.

394
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,740
So if two pi is a full circle.

395
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,300
That was my script.

396
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,610
Here's my script to Pisar full circle.

397
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,380
Then one PI is half a circle and half pi is a court circle.

398
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,460
We want to turn by quarter and we'll turn on the anticlockwise.

399
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,140
So we'll be turning by negative half pint.

400
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:56,640
And now for Pressplay, we have a little character who can zoom around.

401
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,330
Now we don't have the animations yet.

402
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,370
That's coming pretty soon.

403
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,500
But we do have something pretty simple.

404
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,110
We can move around.

405
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,790
We can interact with giant physics objects by my desk, push off the edge.

406
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,140
And it's looking pretty good to me.

407
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,040
So I think this is a pretty good place to start.

408
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:13,920
All right.

409
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,650
He's making me laugh.

410
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,070
I think it's a pretty good place to stop.

411
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,190
We've done quite a lot of work, and I think this is a great piece of progress.

412
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,300
So excellent stuff.

413
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,540
And I'll see you in the next video.
