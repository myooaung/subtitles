1
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,440
Hi folks welcome back.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,660
OK.

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,450
Let's get started.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,220
Making lowney Lips in this video.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,230
We're going to focus on the concept of a raise.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:17,500
Now the reason we talk about a raise is we want to make our games scalable and we want to be able to

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,310
take all of our plug-in words all of our prompts into something called an array and use wild cards in

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,130
our story text and then merge the two together.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,540
This will all become clear.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,830
So let's get to it.

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,880
First thing we need to do is open god.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,690
So here it is on my desktop.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,540
And he is God.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,440
I got a spanking new project I'm going to put this in my reposeful because we like to put stuff repo's

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,850
there and I'm gonna make a project and it's going to be called lunar eclipse.

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,960
Create that fall.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,890
And we have got to go so far so familiar we're going to work in 2D.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,420
And let's make a note to decode.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,950
Remember we need a script but a script has to exist on a node it can't exist by itself.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,530
So here's our no too deep.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,770
Let's rename this the convention when you're naming nodes in godot is to capitalize the first letter

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:11,440
of each word and to get rid of spaces so it will let me go Luni spaced level but I'm not going to go

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,010
loony lips just like that.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,710
It will let you put something else.

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,210
This is a convention so I can look at this in the script and know exactly what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,290
This is a not great so is my renamed node.

27
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,810
And let's make a script so script and I'm going use the no comments template.

28
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,100
It's exactly like the other one except it doesn't generate all those comments we saw in the Heller world

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,950
script.

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,200
So what do we need to do.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,010
Well we need to have a story and we need to add in some variables and we need to print it out.

32
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,470
So first let's add our story here's our variable and it's called Story and it's going to go like this

33
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,000
once upon loops a pone a time a person and put it in caps.

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,580
So I myself office isn't important.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,560
It's a thing and felt very feeling great.

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,770
So here is a nice string variable.

37
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,460
I've seen this before and we've looked at something in a world where we can add in more variables and

38
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,230
it can become a variable person a variable called not a car.

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,780
A variable called thing and a variable called feeling.

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,260
Now if you use other programming languages you might be wondering why didn't you say this is a string

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:23,760
variable.

42
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,410
I don't need to.

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,650
In God I remember I can just make a blank variable and then when I tell it it's a string it'll just

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,450
change it to a string and then when I want it to be an integer it'll be an integer and when I want to

45
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,710
be a float it'll be a float.

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,460
God can change its type whenever we need it to is a dynamic language so we know how to do this right.

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,050
Far I could go on spelling my own name right because that's professional a thing would be a pizza and

48
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,690
a feeling would be full and now I want pizza.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,230
So if you want extra credit feel free to get me a pizza.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,230
There is no extra credit.

51
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,650
Maybe I should take this the wrong place.

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,320
There we go.

53
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,000
Forgive Peter not the code important lesson.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't think of Peter when you're coding.

55
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,950
So we've looked at a way we could do this right.

56
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:11,760
I could just get rid of that and concatenate in the variable person spelling it correctly

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,220
and do that.

58
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,970
And if I fast forward as I magically add here and press the Expand thing you can see that and then we

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,090
could just do this again.

60
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,070
Print.

61
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,590
Story I will of course have to declare these variables before I declare the story and why this won't

62
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,790
work on and highlight them all hold out and press the up arrow and it'll just move everything and it's

63
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,500
lovely.

64
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,190
Now I run this.

65
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,990
Do you want to set 34 scene.

66
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,110
Yes I do.

67
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,550
And there it is.

68
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,380
Once upon a time a yarn 8 a pizza and felt very full.

69
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,630
So this will work but it's not what I would call elegant elegance and code is kind of a slippery concept

70
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,470
but it's important.

71
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:04,380
We need our code to be able to run efficiently quickly and simply our code needs to be readable.

72
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't spend 7 lines of code when you can spend one.

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,210
So right here I've declared three variables to put into a different variable to print.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,710
Okay this all works assuming that every story we do has a person a thing and a feeling this will work

75
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:29,570
fine but what happens if I create a story where we might have 7 variables write three people two things

76
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,490
and two feelings.

77
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,030
Maybe we don't have any feelings maybe we don't have any people.

78
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,430
We need something a lot more expandable a lot more versatile that's the word I'm struggling for.

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,790
So instead of using variables I'm going to use a single array and I'm going to call it prompts.

80
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,350
The array is the square brackets.

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,720
Now let's take a moment and discuss what an array is.

82
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,340
OK.

83
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:03,080
Cast your mind back dear lovely people to Ben's idea that a variable is a box right.

84
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,860
And it can be any type of variable we like.

85
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,310
Let's call this one person.

86
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,240
God doesn't mind if it's a string or anything else.

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,360
Well he cares about is this is a variable a box called person.

88
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,680
And we can put the contents in and change the contents whenever we need to.

89
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,720
But what happens when I need a whole bunch of these things in one place.

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,530
Well then I need an array.

91
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,810
So this is a variable.

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,750
This is an array instead of a box we have.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,810
A shelf.

94
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,590
And on that shelf we can put as many boxes as we need.

95
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,750
Now because God is a dynamic language these boxes can all be different types this will be a variable.

96
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,020
This one could be a boolean.

97
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,660
That's a true false statement.

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,330
This one could be a float.

99
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,310
That's a number with a decimal point.

100
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,560
And we can add and subtract as many as we need to.

101
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,250
If you're used to static languages you'll probably have the concept that a an array actually generates

102
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,300
with a fixed size.

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,000
And even if you don't use all the spaces it still has that size.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,600
That's not true here and Didi's script the array is the size we need it to be and it'll constantly resize

105
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,200
a couple of things you should be aware of for the raise.

106
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,540
If I tell God go go find the box and position one.

107
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,460
It's tempting to think that position one is this one right.

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,730
One two three because that's how humans count.

109
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,200
But actually that's not what's happening so here is God.

110
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,480
And God.

111
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:38,170
If I say position one is going to get this boolean variable and the reason for that is I'm not actually

112
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,070
say go to position one.

113
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,110
I'm saying move this many spaces along.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,130
In fact this is position 0.

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,780
That's position 1 that's position too.

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,500
This is one of the most common mistakes people make with an array right.

117
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,250
I think I need the third one along with the third one along is not number 3 0 1 2.

118
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,170
The third one long would be here right.

119
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,450
So just be aware of what is often called an off by one error.

120
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,760
So that's an array It's a shelf full of variables.

121
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,840
A bookshelf a list if you prefer.

122
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,620
So how can we make one work.

123
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,860
All I need to do is put my values in the array so I'll need a string.

124
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,960
A person is going to be an I'll spell my own name right because I'm a professional Yeah.

125
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,600
Okay so we now have an array with one value.

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,150
It could just be a variable.

127
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,560
But wait there's more.

128
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,110
If I put a comma I can put something else in a thing Peter.

129
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,960
And a feeling form.

130
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:41,320
And I can keep adding to these and remember I can mix different types so if I need an array to have

131
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:51,550
strings in it and integers in it and floats in it and booleans in it that is absolutely nil out.

132
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,890
This is expandable.

133
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,090
I just had to add a comment a new value.

134
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,480
And yes there are script commands We'll look at later where we can add things.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,450
Remove things.

136
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,800
Look at things in order.

137
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,950
Whatever we need to is a really useful thing to have an array is great.

138
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,070
Let's have lots of arrays.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,160
So obviously now we have a problem because I'm calling variables that don't exist and God is going to

140
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,670
hate that.

141
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,650
So how can I put these prompts in here.

142
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,850
Don't I need to tell it.

143
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,770
This is this.

144
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,430
This has this name this has this name.

145
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:27,250
I doubt there's one more concept that's going to make this really awesome God O has format strings strings

146
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,530
that can be used as a template and you can make them slightly differently.

147
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,430
All I need to do is use an escape character.

148
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,710
Operator I'm going to use.

149
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,440
Percent.

150
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,380
S.

151
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,840
What does this mean.

152
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,410
Percent.

153
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,110
S means.

154
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,240
Got 0 pay attention and the s means put in a string.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,870
I will put up a link from the documentation of all of these characters.

156
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,860
All I need to do is go in and change these.

157
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,520
All for let's copy this.

158
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,390
I'm going to do is copy this.

159
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,310
Born here.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,910
And let's get rid of this variable I almost forgot that one.

161
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,170
Okay.

162
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:08,210
Now remember I told you that God and most programming languages if you use a string it won't try and

163
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,470
make sense of the string.

164
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,470
It won't pass the string right.

165
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,280
It's just going to repeat it back to you.

166
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,630
And less you draw its attention to it so that's what I'm doing here.

167
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,440
So how do we get it to actually put it in.

168
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,310
Well here's the easy bit.

169
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,610
Ready percent percent.

170
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,590
And then what's the percent prompt.

171
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,790
What I'm telling it is TELL THE STORY and add in the prompts.

172
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,790
Is it as easy as that.

173
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,890
Well let's find out.

174
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,200
Once upon a time a yarn a pizza and felt very full.

175
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,750
Now this is really good right.

176
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,860
I don't need to be putting in a whole bunch of concatenations I don't need a whole bunch of variables

177
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,240
in three lines of code.

178
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm doing what we were doing in 7 or 8 and it's really expandable.

179
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,080
And to show how expandable it is I'd like to introduce you to this video challenge.

180
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,270
I'd like you to make a bigger story make a story with four or more of these wildcards these escape characters

181
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,550
these operations in it.

182
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,440
Right.

183
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,930
Go for five.

184
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,230
Go for six whatever you need to do.

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,040
Make a bigger story using this array and just display in the print function.

186
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,590
Pause the video give that a shot.

187
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,010
And when you come back I'll show you mine.

188
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,170
So I'm just going to copy that because I keep missing on a keyboard.

189
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,400
There it is.

190
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,980
It was a day for all.

191
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,630
It doesn't matter what my story is.

192
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,070
It's just going to work.

193
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,640
Now if I run this I'll get an error.

194
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,030
Not enough arguments.

195
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,810
I'm asking you to put in a bunch of things and I don't have enough things right.

196
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,240
It's saying I have one two three four five of these strings to pull in.

197
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,030
I've only supplied three strings so I just now have to put in two more right sad

198
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,210
cabbages.

199
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,790
Now I can keep adding stuff in here and it doesn't matter.

200
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,940
It doesn't matter if I have too many.

201
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,030
It matches what I have too.

202
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,820
Too few.

203
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:13,440
So it's double check that works out a distraction free mode press play.

204
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,120
And there it is.

205
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
Once upon a time a yanet a pizza and felt very full.

206
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,850
It was a sad day for all good cabbages.

207
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,060
Brilliant really good foundation for our game.

208
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,850
This is going to make it really expandable and look like the advantage here.

209
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,920
I don't need to tell it.

210
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,490
Look for a noun.

211
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,420
I just need to say you have an array.

212
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,740
Just give me the next thing in that array and it's automatically moving forward.

213
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,620
Which brings us to the end of this video.

214
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,070
We've looked at a raise which are key foundational concept here and if you can get your head around

215
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,450
them they're really helpful.

216
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,830
We've looked at the beginning escape characters format strings we started building scalability into

217
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,460
our game.

218
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,700
Really great stuff.

219
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,720
OK folks I'll see you in the next video.
