00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,390
Hello lovely God.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,460
People in this video we're going to be finishing our food projectiles now.

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,330
That's actually a slight lie later I'm going to add the concept of ammunition.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,500
But for now let's get the actual projectile polished off.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,960
If I run the game five food you can see that we can find Baja food at the same time.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,690
And the food isn't actually making any noise.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,740
So these are the two things were going to get fixed by the end of this video by the end of this video.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,550
When I pressed the button it'll file once and I'll have to wait again before it fires again which also

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,350
stop it occasionally firing white.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,900
Every time I press the button occasionally every time.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,090
Not the best grammar rules are going to put in a sound effect that's going to make it sound really cool

12
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:55,170
and you something called the Doppler effect which I talk about in a little bit.

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,940
So what do we need to do to finish it.

14
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,550
Well only to make sure we only file once every X seconds and we need to put a wooshing sound.

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,270
So let's get in to our scene.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,640
Specifically on open the character scenes one player and go into character or characters are going to

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,210
have a new timer.

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,620
This timer is going to be called can fire.

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,510
So here is my time record can fire.

20
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,110
For now I won't leave it as one second.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,130
I'm not going to set it to auto start but I will stick to one shot.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,750
It'll just stop when it gets to zero.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,920
Next thing to do is connect as signals as go to node connect the timeout signal to the parent.

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,460
So we now have everything ready.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,430
I'm going to start another early challenge because I think you are probably capable of doing this at

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,540
this stage but let's see how you go.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,010
I would like you to use this new can fire timer to make sure the character can only fire once every

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,030
X seconds.

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,750
Once I fire we need to make sure that we can no longer fire until the timer tells me otherwise.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,670
A few different ways you could solve this.

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,890
So pause the video.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,720
Find a solution you like and when you ready come on back and I'll show you my solution.

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,130
And welcome back.

34
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,710
Okay so what I'm going to do is I want to give a new variable.

35
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,810
It's going to be a boolean So truffaut's I'm on to call it can add fire and it's a start as true.

36
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,260
The next thing to do is set can fire as true on time.

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,680
And that's all that needs to do right.

38
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,580
Okay from here I go into my plagiary which apparently I have twice that and I won't have it twice let's

39
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,530
get rid of one.

40
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,080
One is my plagiary and put it in this script.

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,770
I do this because I think it's going to behave slightly differently for the NPC.

42
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,580
However you could also put it in here and very simply go down to my fire.

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,060
So my input.

44
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,130
So if the action press is fire instead of fire I'm going to call a new function and call this.

45
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,880
Try to fire.

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,550
So let's make that function and make the function.

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,310
Tried to fire hoops.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,520
Having a little bit of trouble here.

49
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,860
Let's just give myself some rooms across Europe doing gorillas tabs.

50
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,290
Fantastic function.

51
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,280
Try to fire sawdust try to find it.

52
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,840
It's going to check if can fire.

53
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,680
Okay and that's very simply.

54
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,900
If this I don't need to say.

55
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,120
If can find it is true because that's implicit.

56
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,780
It's also already checking if this is true.

57
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,770
If condition.

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,180
Is it saying is this true.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,850
I can see if it's true.

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,630
I don't need to if can fire fire but I don't just want to do that.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,750
I do two other things right.

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,550
I'm also going to start the timer so it can fire.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,320
Which is a dollar some more can fire.

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,830
Double check is what it's called now.

65
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,810
It's not auto completing because I'm in the play a script and player isn't actually in the characters.

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,010
So it's not gonna work so it can fire a dot that's the correct node and I just need it to start.

67
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,600
I don't need to say what needs to happen because the moment that time finishes it will trigger can fire

68
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,250
timeout.

69
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,760
Gates has said about the true one more thing I need to do is set to Fox.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,560
So can a fire which hasn't been saved so that save that there can be calls fops.

71
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,080
OK let's Pressplay and see how that works.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,180
Like file once spamming the button.

73
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,730
It's only spamming once a second.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,410
Now once a second might be too much.

75
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,110
But that's okay I can go into my character into can fire and change this to zero point to 5 so four

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,830
times a second every quarter of a second how is that like.

77
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,530
See I have a lot of control here and I've set it up so that all characters play characters and non player

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,270
characters will have the same restrictions for firing which I think is great.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,880
We don't have to do it this way.

80
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,520
This is when I do it.

81
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,490
I get the other thing I want to do is I want to give projectiles wooshing noise.

82
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,010
So if we go into our scenes.

83
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,990
And we're looking at ammo.

84
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,640
I'm going to put it in the projectile scenes just go here in 3D.

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,500
And the reason I put it here is I want all projectiles to have the same sound right they're going to

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,780
do the exact same thing.

87
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,160
So let's put it once in here.

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,540
All other projectiles all of our models all inherit from here.

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,830
So if it does it he'll do it ever or else.

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,210
I'm going to use an audio streamed player 3D a positional sound.

91
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,330
And this is important.

92
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,910
Here's what I'm looking for.

93
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,360
Imagine your.

94
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,690
I don't know standing by the side of the road in a car a motorbike is going very fast and it goes past

95
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,420
you.

96
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,390
It's going to make a sound nother sound it's going to make it's going to be something along the lines

97
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,170
of Now which is a technical term.

98
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,920
And if you want to use that in future videos by all means.

99
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,600
Now I am the king of sound effects.

100
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,630
However if you're on that motorbike or in that car the sound is constant.

101
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,810
And this is because of something called the Doppler effect.

102
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Essentially it works like this as an object gets closer the sound it makes RAICES in pitch right so

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,760
Carl gets close to you.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,780
Meow.

105
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,620
And then as it goes away it goes down.

106
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Now there is a reason for this.

107
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,560
And you have to forgive me my pen just broke some of his analysis.

108
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:23,090
If I am standing here with my glasses and a big old grin on my face and my little beard.

109
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:24,880
Great.

110
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,550
Looks just like me.

111
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,530
If I'm standing here and here is an object that sets a car.

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,110
A big car.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,290
But it's a car.

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,030
Let's imagine the sound waves.

115
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,360
Okay.

116
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,670
They're travelling from the car.

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,450
To me the engine is travelling at a constant speed it's a constant revs per minute.

118
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,630
I realize that this is very hypothetical but I imagine it is the pitch right.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,820
How high or low the sound is is dependent on the wavelength the length of the wave.

120
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,720
Literally the distance between those two pulses of air.

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,020
So these are all going to be constant let's call them X..

122
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,340
However the car is moving right.

123
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,460
So when the car is here it's going to do another pulse and it's here it's going to do another pulse.

124
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,610
So in fact the waves are not constant.

125
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,390
They look more like this.

126
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,050
So they're in it here and then here and then a little bit closer and a little bit closer.

127
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,500
And then when it gets to me it's going to start moving further away.

128
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:37,250
So what happens is if I picture a wave the wave length gets higher and then lower right.

129
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,960
And that's what the picture's doing now.

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,470
We could program all of this in but instead going to make this really simple for us selves.

131
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,860
So let's go into our Sound Effects which is SFX as I called it right.

132
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,600
Want to put you.

133
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,170
You are around here and that you're right here.

134
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,150
Buses.

135
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,770
The sound here of made called explosion too.

136
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,940
And it's just a very simple bitmaps for Pressplay.

137
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,280
This is just pink noise.

138
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,370
It doesn't go up.

139
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,930
It doesn't go down.

140
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,370
What I want is for this noise.

141
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,350
Let's put on auto play.

142
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,080
I want this noise to be constant and I want God o to figure out how the pitch should be changing over

143
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,050
time and to do that I'm just going to go into the player.

144
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,360
And to the camera.

145
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,620
And you see right here.

146
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,740
Doppler tracking I'm going to put this to physics.

147
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,360
Be advised that at time of writing there is a bug.

148
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,920
Every time any object with 3-d positional sound comes into your godso right is spawned to God.

149
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,900
And you have Doppler tracking enabled the debugger is going to give you a weird error that says I don't

150
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,110
know where this is.

151
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,090
It does.

152
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,910
And the error is completely harmless.

153
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,930
But the more objects you have that rely on Doppler tracking the more times you'll see this error and

154
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,490
I'll demonstrate that right now.

155
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,070
So the press.

156
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,260
So right here.

157
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,900
Condition is inside tree is true returned transform.

158
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,960
You notice it only played once.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,050
That's great.

160
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,720
It can sometimes there more times I've actually raised this as a bug.

161
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,450
So hopefully it'll be fixed in three point once release.

162
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,760
But just in case you see this error that's what it is.

163
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,690
Don't panic.

164
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:17,870
Right.

165
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,650
It's no more serious than this one which has to do with the animation tree play loading in animations.

166
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,000
You can ignore those very safely.

167
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,110
So let's test how that lesson sounds.

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,900
You know what let's make this camera current.

169
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,920
That'll help too.

170
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,090
Let's just play and we like to tweak the volume a little bit.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,950
So you can just hear it dropping a sound.

172
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,950
Let's just tweak the sound a little bit.

173
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,690
OK so let's get our max distance.

174
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,790
And I think some distance of 50.

175
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,740
Now if I don't have a max distance this won't fade out.

176
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,040
Right.

177
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,580
But I wanted to fade out once too far away so if it's 50 this is metrix or it's 15 meters away you won't

178
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,200
hear it at all.

179
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,000
It's might be a bit higher then we'd put it like that for now.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
And also to turn the volume down.

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,880
So let's say our unit decibel sound and good minus 10.

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,470
I want it to be quite a subtle sound.

183
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,320
It's Pressplay.

184
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:18,470
Great.

185
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,980
And if I bounce off the wall towards me.

186
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,070
Fantastic.

187
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,950
Now we could do some fancy code with figure out how fast you are going and that's going to be your pitch

188
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,490
or your volume or anything like that.

189
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,730
But I'm really happy with this.

190
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,180
And what you'll find is when the MP sees arrive in the next few videos and they start fi towards us

191
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,190
we're going to hear the sound of wooshing very dramatically as it whistles past our head rushing and

192
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,780
whistles.

193
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,210
That's a fun w sound there.

194
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,360
But look at this.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,050
Which brings us to the end of this video.

196
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,480
In this video we've used the timer and Boolean to make sure we can only fire once every X seconds and

197
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,720
we have control over what the value of x is and we've enabled the Doppler effect on a camera out which

198
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,270
means our food is almost perfect it's just ammunition to go and we can do that much later.

199
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,000
But excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
