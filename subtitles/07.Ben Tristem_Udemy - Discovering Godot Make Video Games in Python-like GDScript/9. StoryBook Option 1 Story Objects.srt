00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello you fantastic go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,660
We're going to create story objects.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,810
Now you've noticed on the slide it's a story book.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,280
Option one we show a couple of different ways you could do this.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,720
But what I want to do is separate my data from my script.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,200
My script is the things that run the functions right that tells Gordo how to behave.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,580
The data is the things I'm going to plug into that and I don't need them in the same place if I take

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,590
a look at my script you'll see from line five to line 38.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,900
All of this is just data right.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,210
We could put this somewhere else in the optionally to use a day is going to make story objects to make

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,210
new nodes they each hold information.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,140
So here's what I need to do.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,400
First make looney lips less cluttered and to do that I'm going to create a new node and call it storybook.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,530
I want to make each story a separate child of storybooks so I can look at the scenery and see how many

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,440
stories I have.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,060
And the script should be able to scale automatically so if I add one I'll take one away.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,740
It won't break the script.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,370
I also would like each story to use the same script.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,380
I don't really want a new script to hold data for every single story.

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,750
Let's take a look what we mean.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,080
First thing I do go into looney lips and create a new node going to press control a double click on

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,620
node.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,530
This is the most basic kind of note in God.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,560
The only things it can do control pause and hold a script.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,070
Right that's it.

26
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,810
That's all the functionality has by default.

27
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,300
Anything else will have to extend.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,620
Let's rename this two story book.

29
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,210
Hello storybook.

30
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,940
And let's give you a child node which can be another node mythical stories 0.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,940
Cool stories.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,160
You need a script.

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,120
Let's give you a script.

34
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
So new script and I'm going to call it story.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,020
Why.

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,970
Because I don't want a new script for every single story.

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,050
I want them all to use the same script first they have to get rid of the function and give it a variable

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:03,770
call prompts which is a an array right and a variable called story which I don't need to initialize

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,330
but I can.

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,850
It's a string.

41
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,200
Okay.

42
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,200
Similarly I could do going to looney lips.

43
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,430
Take this prompts and just copy this array in some copy it and paste it

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,650
and that what fine right.

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,310
And then I could do the same with the story

46
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,700
copy it

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,900
and pasted OK that will work.

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,920
But what happens if I want to make a new story.

49
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
Want to save this on a duplicate story zero.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,320
I could right click on it and go to duplicate or express control Dee and it'll make the next series.

51
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,580
In this I called this one story zero because then it won't be story one but they're using the same script.

52
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:56,490
Any change I make a story one a happy name is going to show up in story zero.

53
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,060
It's the same script.

54
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,770
I can see that by going to the properties and seeing what script it's using.

55
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,400
So I need a way of using the same script for all eight of my stories.

56
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,560
But having different values in them.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,250
So what I do is I'm gonna clear this array and keep the array initialized and clear the string to keep

58
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,040
the string initialize you'll see 1 a second and then we can you keyword just for variable import export

59
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,050
and what this does is it expose the variable to the inspector.

60
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,870
Now this is important and say that this is important because it means I can change the values for that

61
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,070
node in the inspector but it won't actually change the script.

62
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,970
Let me show what that looks like.

63
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:44,380
To give you good story 1 and write this is story 1 2 3 1 story 1 great and it has here this little circle

64
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,690
button that means set it back to the default.

65
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,360
But if I clicked on story 0 it doesn't have that right.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,830
This is story 0.

67
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:57,490
You would use export variables for tweaking values in a script without having to change the actual script

68
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:04,120
but it also works great for our purposes so we can put our stories in here and it'll work great.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,640
One thing that isn't ideal is easy array size zero.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
We can change the size the array let's say I'm gonna give it 1 value.

71
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,180
You see here says no it doesn't have a value.

72
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,390
And the reason is an array can hold any type of variable.

73
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,510
It doesn't know what kind of variable to put in here.

74
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,970
I can left it on this pencil icon and pick it right.

75
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:29,410
So this is going to be a string and I can type a string.

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,660
Okay now let's add another one and that one's known as well for every single one.

77
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm going to have to go on those drop down menu and that frankly isn't very fun right.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,710
Is going get boring very quickly.

79
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,940
So what I need to do is figure out how to tell gotto.

80
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,880
This is an array of strings.

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,790
Now I can't just do this.

82
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,290
Why.

83
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,480
Because that tells me that the first two are strings but what I want to add another one it's not right.

84
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,650
All I've done has moved the problem along and I need this to be scalable.

85
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:04,500
We need the precise amount of arrays in there for the story.

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,420
I need a way of telling it.

87
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:11,130
This is a specific type of array that can only take the kinetic strings.

88
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,350
So I'm going to use typed G.D. script.

89
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,950
Let's talk about typed and dynamic G.D. script really quickly.

90
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,350
So here is our default variable box that we keep talking about right.

91
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:29,430
And it can hold anything now in dynamic languages like Python and default dynamic G.D. script.

92
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,870
It's called dynamic because the variables can change right.

93
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,780
You can put anything in here.

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,260
This can be an integer a one moment a string of the next moment and array at the next a flow to the

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,810
next.

96
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,400
And we can keep changing and changing changing if it's typed.

97
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,730
It can only hold a single type of variable.

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,540
This variable is for example a string.

99
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,200
It can only hold strings if you try and put an integer in here.

100
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,060
It will just stop.

101
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,760
It won't work.

102
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,930
It'll break most of the time.

103
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm gonna be using dynamic G.D. script right because it's very flexible.

104
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,850
It's very easy great for small projects type G.D. script is usually used for very big projects because

105
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,420
it's very easy to lose track of what variables must be what and this just keeps it all controlled right.

106
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,800
It doesn't allow things to go to wrong.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,070
It's also slightly faster in large projects.

108
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,080
What's happening is gotto is trying to figure out what type of variable this is at runtime every time

109
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,870
you use it and when he gets really really big that will slow it down.

110
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,770
We're not gonna notice it.

111
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,680
The projects we're making but in theory type is a little faster.

112
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,620
So that's great.

113
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,480
But now we have two problems.

114
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,000
One I need to tell you what type of array can only take strings and 2 how to set type G.D. script.

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,770
Well the setup G.D. script.

116
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,060
I'm going to go colon and after the colon I'm gonna tell it the type of variable this is and the type

117
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,480
of array that can only take strings is pooled string array like whole control and click on it a pull

118
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,110
string array is an array specifically designed to hold string.

119
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,950
So this is a kind of an edge case thing right but it's going to work great for our purposes.

120
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,660
I actually now don't need to initialize it because I've told it it's a it's a pull string or I can only

121
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:15,220
help pull strings and now when I try and add a new value it's always going to be a string right.

122
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,920
It can never be an integer.

123
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:23,890
In fact if I try and type a number in it's giving off a value this 25 is actually a string is not an

124
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,940
integer right.

125
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,120
So that's going to work fantastically for our purposes.

126
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:35,050
I could also initially story initially 8 that I could initialize story as a string as well that will

127
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,260
work fine.

128
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,020
And now when I go to story 1 story to that different.

129
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,310
Right.

130
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,530
And it worked great.

131
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,360
So for now what I'm going to do is I'm going to comment out this entire template variable all of it.

132
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,270
I'm not selected all press control case all commented out and I'm just gonna start moving them across.

133
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,750
Now the reason I'm commenting now is another video was shown on the solution to this I'm going to keep

134
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,470
it here.

135
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,610
But once you've moved them you could just delete this template.

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,560
Let's move a couple across just to show how this works.

137
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,090
So that's my story.

138
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,160
Lives in there.

139
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,470
And how many do we need.

140
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,490
One two three four one two three four.

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,070
We have a name.

142
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,150
A noun.

143
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,200
An adverb and an adjective.

144
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,210
Now you can already see that one potential problem here is I can't read the whole story.

145
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,810
Right this isn't easy to resize I this window but even that isn't ideal right.

146
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,180
That's a little annoying.

147
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,700
So copy pasting does make sense here when we look at the Jasons solution.

148
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,100
That's another way we could do this can make this a little easier to read.

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,970
However I'm going to do.

150
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,520
I do 404 so you can do the same process.

151
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,190
I'll show you this one and I'll fast forward.

152
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,990
So this story is there once was a something called something called something and that's gonna live

153
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,470
in a story string and I need for again.

154
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,850
One two three four.

155
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,760
And you are a noun a name an adjective

156
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,940
and another What are you.

157
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,570
Another name

158
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,320
awesome Simon.

159
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,380
Do those for two more.

160
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,920
Fast forward and you'll able see them.

161
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,910
Great I've got four of my eight stories here from book we're counting from zero.

162
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,710
I've got all of these things plugged in.

163
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,810
How do we actually get it to work.

164
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,720
Because look identify template is not declared in the current scopes let's click on that.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,860
See the error set current story no longer exists.

166
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,920
So I need to change set current story in a comment this out can you variable.

167
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,420
It's only going exist in this function because it's the only place it needs to be and it can be called

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,180
stories.

169
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,380
It's gonna be all of them.

170
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:50,200
And what I want is I want to get the storybook note and I want to find how many children it's got right.

171
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,430
I need to count them and to do that I only get get child count.

172
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,470
Literally it's going to say how many children do you have that is going to count them zero one two three.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,870
Right.

174
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,690
Which is four.

175
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,620
It's got one two three four children going to count them.

176
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,610
Okay so now let's select a story so selected story.

177
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,090
And what's this.

178
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:17,550
This is a random story that's a child of storybook how I could do that one of these random integer and

179
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,960
modulated by the amount of stories we have.

180
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,580
Right.

181
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,620
So it's just going to pick a number between 0 and how many children storybook have.

182
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:36,790
And now I need to select current stories and current story and all to go to storybook and I want to

183
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,510
get a child of it and it's gonna ask for a number.

184
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,250
Which number is it.

185
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,070
It's selected story.

186
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,510
OK.

187
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,810
Before going further let's just take a quick look what's happening here.

188
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:54,300
I'm assuming control and backslash to get rid of this handy script list whatever it's called.

189
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,100
So I'm going to say that the prompts in current stories are sorry as a dictionary I'm telling it there's

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,350
now a key called prompts.

191
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:10,300
OK so Adichie prompts and the value of prompts is a child of storybook and it's child number.

192
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:18,140
What have a selected story is we've just found that and now any to find the prompts Qi and I can look

193
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,100
in here prompts is a pull string array and it knows what the values are because we've put them in the

194
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,700
inspector.

195
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:23,950
Right.

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,460
And look here it's going to say these are my prompts it's just gonna add them as a pull string array

197
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,050
which is gonna behave like an array and I will do the same thing.

198
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:46,290
Current story dot story equals and I'm gonna go storybook dot get child so get child number what number

199
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,590
is it.

200
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,590
Selected story Dalton's story.

201
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,990
Let's just double check that that's what it was called.

202
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,830
It is what was called.

203
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,860
OK so now this should work.

204
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,440
Let's find out.

205
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,580
May I have it now please.

206
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,530
The coffee cup.

207
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,340
May I have a name.

208
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Priscilla.

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:10,860
Priscilla.

210
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,040
There we go.

211
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,030
May I have an adjective.

212
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,590
Confident.

213
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,330
Another name.

214
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,980
Sam.

215
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,920
Hi Sam.

216
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,920
There once was a coffee company Priscilla who searched far and wide for the mythical confident town

217
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,600
of Sam that she'd actually be another one hence shouldn't it now be different must fix that story real

218
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,180
quick that there and

219
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,780
you should be another name and you should be another noun.

220
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,850
But look it worked just fine.

221
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,550
Now this can feel like a lot of fiddling around right and we're doing some slightly clever things with

222
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,000
code.

223
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,200
So I'm going to show us what those are in a moment but let's just talk about the advantages of doing

224
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,120
it this way.

225
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,160
I've now separated all the data and storybook and I can look at it here.

226
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,560
I can even minimize this and it just keeps the story separately.

227
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,990
Now I can go into my script and I can delete all of these stories.

228
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,170
I'm actually going to cut them which makes this much more readable rights a lot simpler to see what's

229
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,780
going on I'm going to pace these back for an alcohol and in the next video.

230
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,960
The disadvantage to this is filling these out is a little bit annoying.

231
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,930
And reading this story's a little hard right.

232
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:26,890
I would probably write it insulin like notepad or something like that and then paste it in but everything

233
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,950
is nice and clean.

234
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,980
If I delete story to it gets rid of the number.

235
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,850
But this works just fine.

236
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,350
Right.

237
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,450
Nothing is going to crash.

238
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,090
I have separated everything out but the game is going to look great.

239
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,010
I kind of want that back now don't I.

240
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,470
So can I do that.

241
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:43,880
Boop.

242
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,750
Yep there it is cool.

243
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,720
So this is option 1.

244
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,260
The disadvantage of this is it means that the player can't add their own stories.

245
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,110
If I wanted to do that I would go with Jason which is going to be my next video.

246
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,560
Right.

247
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,210
The second option the other advantages I can look at this as a human and see how many stories we have

248
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,520
right with separate everything out ok.

249
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,170
And that is the end of the video in this video we've looked at exporting variables we've used get child

250
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,850
count and get child to figure out how many children does a node have.

251
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:15,400
And I want to go get this specific node by number.

252
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,480
We've also had a quick look at pull string arrays and a brief introduction to type G.D. script.

253
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,640
Now don't worry if this feels a little bit overwhelming with practice this will all become second nature.

254
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,560
You're not expected to remember every single function every single variable every program I know looks

255
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,250
things up but we have made a really solid starts the game it's actually feature complete at this point

256
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,010
what we gonna do next is look at a different solution.

257
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,270
So excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
