00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,710
Welcome back wonderful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,370
Nice and short.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,710
We're just going to get everything ready to start coding.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,990
We're going to download the assets for our platform games.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,290
So what needs to happen.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,920
Well the very first thing is you need to download hobby days assets zip to your computer.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,320
If you look over to the resources for this lecture you'll see there's a whole bunch of things including

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,260
hobby days asset starts up.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,230
So the first thing you should do before you go any further down lowder's it file and put it somewhere

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:31,960
you can find it.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,560
I'm going to put mine on the desktop.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,650
You don't have to just put it somewhere nice and easy to find.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,180
Right.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,360
So it's on your desktop or wherever it is here's mine right here.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,610
The best thing to do is open godso an to make myself a new project.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,590
And we're going to call this hobby days.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,990
I'm actually calling to underscore hobby days because that's the second project where you don't have

18
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,240
to you can call it whatever you like.

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,600
It's quick.

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,520
The folder just like before.

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,370
And we are good to go.

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,180
At least we will be.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,520
When God is ready.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,190
So right now we have an empty god project so let's get these assets in.

25
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,080
The easiest thing to do is going to be to right click over here and the file system as show in file

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,130
manager and then I can minimize God.

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,380
And I don't need the terminal window either.

28
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,680
Great.

29
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,930
And I want to open hollidays.

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,340
And as you can see we've got a bunch of folders and here I grab them all.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,590
And drag them over copy to hollidays.

32
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,460
Awesome.

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,230
So when we are back into god.

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,960
Ill import everything for us.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,930
And he is a lovely filesystem.

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,510
Before we go any further there is one folder that isn't in here that I would like to have.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,000
Now the reason I didn't include it isn't just I wanted to see if you could right click on stuff.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,110
It's because winds it didn't want me to put in an empty folder.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,770
So let's make the folder for us now going to right click on it to new folder and the folders then called

40
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,180
scripts.

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,390
So do we have.

42
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,690
Well we've got the ground work here not just for the assets but for our file structure.

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,760
We will make every asset easy to find.

44
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,570
So our fonts are really our one font is in the phone's folder and the G effects you'll find all the

45
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,250
graphics whether it's player sprite's.

46
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,210
And as you can see which you have two variations you can have the pink bunny which I'll be using or

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,410
the Brown Bunny.

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,200
We also have particles.

49
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,610
The heads up display elements various items and so on.

50
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,720
And the sound effects you find the sound of music and the scenes this is we're going to put all our

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
scenes and levels and scripts.

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,970
We just made our scripts so what's included.

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,000
What I've done is I've taken a cut down version of the jumper pack by Kenny.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,330
Now we'll link all these resources so you can find them yourself and use slightly different resources

55
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,140
if you want or just see what they've got available just like Looney lips.

56
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm using Kennie's because one I like his artwork and two he's on the creative commons zero licence

57
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,870
which means we can use this for commercial educational and personal products and we don't even need

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,560
to attribute it.

59
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,360
We don't need to pay him anything.

60
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,860
Attributing a tribute to him is one of those.

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,910
Whatever it is we don't need to cite who did we should.

62
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,230
It's kind We only to the sound effects are also from Kenny.

63
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,680
Now I couldn't pick the music so I've got a selection of two or so and see cesÃ¡rio Licences for chips

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,070
used adventure by subspace audio or some a pack by Scribe.

65
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,070
And these are all from open game art.

66
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,530
In fact I found Kenny on open game up to finally the font is candles from default and you can find all

67
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:34,960
of these.

68
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,880
As I said Linked In the resources for this video by the way you don't have to use any of these resources

69
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,050
I encourage you to customize this game to your heart's content if you want to do a complete different

70
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,320
theme.

71
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,050
Make your own graphics go hunting for deep scary sci fi or Lovecraft because in style go crazy I'd love

72
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,670
to see Peg in fact if we do pick different assets please share them on the forums and on the discord

73
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,160
because I think people will be refacing to see me come up with and that's everything.

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,980
So this video was now done.

75
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,860
I'll see the next video where we can start actually using our fancy new assets.
