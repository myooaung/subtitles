00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,550
Hello again you wonderful garden.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,610
People in this video we're going to take that briefcase or folder or whatever loot we have.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm going to show it to the player.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,340
We're gonna make a gooey for the loot.

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,150
How's that gonna work.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,460
Well the gooey is going to start invisible at least this part of it is so there's no sexual mock loot

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:28,630
until the player picks it up at which point we're going to show the loot as an icon let's start to do

8
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,540
by going to our goo gooey peasantry right here Hello.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,080
Aha.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,040
OK so we have disguises.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,630
We have suspicions so it can be very similar.

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,650
Those two in fact I could probably copy it and tweak it but that feels foolish under control.

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,920
I don't make a new 9 patch rectangle and get an interface and I'm going to put it right here in the

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,730
bottom left.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,210
So I want my interface on the graphics interface.

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,650
Keep making that mistake PMG down to my gloss thing and he as one of these ones which one is it you

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,730
are top right corner.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,630
I think you're at it.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,820
You look like it.

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,390
Fantastic.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,290
I don't mean the same with as this one which if memory serves is 300 wide.

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,530
Fantastic.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,160
You know what I'm a McCoy you loot container.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:29,620
Got wrecked and make you 300 wide and suspicion meter cause is gonna be here to line up suspicion meter

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,400
is doo doo doo doo doo.

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,140
Eighty five high let's make you eighty five.

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,830
Hi.

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,140
And when you use the same patch margins we have a four so twelve on each side and let's go layout anchored

29
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:50,220
to the full rectangle but it's going to all be aligned to the bottom left.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,520
Now we're gonna play on margins if memory serves is a twelve of them.

31
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,930
Let's take a look.

32
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,380
Margin from the left is thirty okay.

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,590
That it is boop and it's now smaller is that something bigger again.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,630
So three hundred.

35
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,030
Boom.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,330
There we go.

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,770
And let's take a look at you.

38
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,410
Where are you from the bottom.

39
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,150
You are twenty four negative twenty four from the bottom.

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,350
Let's do that.

41
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:21,040
Negative twenty four is now smaller let's make it bigger Oh I see you can be like that.

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,690
Fine.

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:32,090
Movie up at the line you about Harish negative 24 how's that

44
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,560
you little Lulu.

45
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,380
I'm keeping an eye on the bottom one.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:50,840
That is fine OK v box container the box containing l I wanna make you a full rectangle so you cover

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,050
this entire panel let's give you some margins it's to 12 in each direction negative twelve negative

48
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,560
twelve.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,030
Fantastic.

50
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:04,760
Within that we are putting a label I'm going quite quickly because I cut my label quite quickly because

51
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,890
this is the same thing we did a couple of videos back.

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:17,270
So she's quite fresh but we're going to call this one loot excellent and now on item list and this item

53
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,180
list is going to have seven columns because same with that one and the icons are gonna be zero point

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,860
two five not zero point zero five zero point two five.

55
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,630
Why.

56
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,390
I'll show you why.

57
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:37,280
If we bring in that's going to load in this icon the graphics and PMG on the loot from the suitcase.

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,930
The suitcase is actually twice the size of this this crate because it's a different item pack.

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,950
So here we go.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,820
We can now see it's got rid of that.

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,930
What that's going to look like and I think that looks pretty fancy.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,280
OK.

63
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm going to go back to my items and delete this one because when I start with them we're almost there

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,220
now.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,490
OK but the script for this one on loot container first let's add it to a group that adds the great loot

66
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,850
loop.

67
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,070
There it is.

68
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,840
And let's give this the script for this to the loot container.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,380
Why.

70
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,910
Because it's going to start hidden and it's going to show itself and everything else going to happen

71
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,490
to a child of it.

72
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,680
This tells me that the functionality for it is going to be a blue container.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,780
Now I could in theory put the script on item list and tell it go to your parent go to its parent and

74
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,320
do that.

75
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,700
But that's really bad practice.

76
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,000
You can use functions to call down to child nodes but you should use signals to call up to parent nodes.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,690
Much simpler.

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:50,310
I'm so like a script on loop container and I'm gonna make the really function and it's not with Hide.

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,670
So the very first thing to do is going to hide.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Let's find out.

81
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,360
Press Play can I see the loop thingy.

82
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,450
I can't.

83
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:57,780
Awesome.

84
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,810
So let's make a function called collect loops call its loops.

85
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,690
I'm not gonna posture an argument this I've only got one type of loot.

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,550
But if you have several you're going to want to put a function in that fuzzy as do it's gonna run the

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,080
show.

88
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,940
So when you pass of the briefcase it's going to shut and the next thing to do is bring up this item

89
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:29,070
list item list and we're going to go dot adds icon item just like we did before.

90
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:38,850
So we're gonna start by loading in and let's go find our briefcase which is boop and the pinky on the

91
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,220
loot can drag in my briefcase.

92
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,540
Awesome.

93
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,840
And the other argument to go of here is is this selectable.

94
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:47,880
No it isn't.

95
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,770
This is not a menu item you shouldn't touch it.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,110
It's just going to be used as a piece of interface.

97
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,970
Right.

98
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,390
Now let's go back to the play a script.

99
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,590
Play a script which is under play.

100
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,260
Hello.

101
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,180
Play a script.

102
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,170
Jump into it.

103
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,470
And we've already got Collette briefcase so as well as adding this let's call it get Tre

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,220
Cool group and what we call this.

105
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,970
I forgot.

106
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,280
I mean I remember back some of how I wrote it.

107
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,180
Let's take a look.

108
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,240
We old you looked with a capital L..

109
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:31,290
That's a good name for it looked and we are running collect loot.

110
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,930
I believe the gold.

111
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,880
Let's take a quick look at my lips scripts.

112
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,580
I'm tried to do this for my cats climbing my shoulders.

113
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,670
Thank you kaboodle.

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,670
Collect loot.

115
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,030
There it is.

116
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,620
And let's close that because we don't have to pass through any arguments.

117
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,780
OK let's see if this works OK.

118
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,720
Let's see.

119
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,740
We are at 0 1 3 1.

120
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,750
It's a little tricky 0 1 3 0.

121
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,260
No go too fast.

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,550
OK.

123
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,640
0 1 3 1.

124
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,080
Let's go now now now now now.

125
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,090
Now inside its belt have cellphones and payday 2 as well as fast as you can.

126
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,320
OK.

127
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,340
So we'll pick this up.

128
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,090
OK.

129
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,250
So because I change the screen size halfway through it thinks it's over here we can play with that or

130
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,720
we could just lock the screen sizes through the options menu a little later on that we now have a loop

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,380
menu that shows up correctly and I am pretty happy with that.

132
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:42,410
So loop in this video with finished the gooey we can polish it we can add more details but that is starting

133
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,690
to feel like a real game.

134
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,680
That was kind of exciting running around at high speed avoiding gods and trying to find the perfect

135
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,940
time through the lights.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,080
I'm quite happy with that.

137
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,020
I'm quite enjoying playing it.

138
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,550
So excellent luck and we'll see you on the next video.
