1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,920
Hello again you.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,970
Gloria's got people in this video.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,110
We're going to start having some fun with furniture.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,060
I enjoyed having fun.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,420
Furniture and HI MY SIS of they're doing in here.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,990
But this is the first stage of it because we're going to have two different types of furniture static

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,360
body and rigid body.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,640
And remember static body is not affected by physics right.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,810
So that stuff we don't necessarily want to move.

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,140
In fact I want to move at all.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,990
So I'm thinking things like permanent fixtures anything I don't want to be able to push with myself

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,550
or an NPC or a bystander or some food.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:40,120
We also go to some rigid bodies later which is stuff we do want to interact with physics.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,970
Now we could in theory use a grid map for this but Im going to advise against it partially because Grid

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,440
Maps are a single node with a single position.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,740
If we wanted to change any of these objects to a rigid body it wouldnt work because Grid Maps only work

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,740
with static bodies.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,700
However you could use this with a static body.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,860
Okay so lets get to work.

20
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,910
And the first thing we do is take a look in our models folder in models and furniture as branch of different

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,400
measures here.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,130
We're not going to use all of these but they're in here for you.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm interested in what this kitchen stuff from kitchen bar through to kitchen cabinet.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,980
And then probably sink the stove.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,240
I might get a fridge in maybe a coffee machine.

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,320
I do like coffee and I'm going to put them over here.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,300
One more thing I've noticed by the way is I'm constantly having to rescale everything whether it's the

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,910
walls or the robots.

29
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,150
And I suspect it's because I've made this character too short.

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,750
I could go in here and recite the character then I have to revise the player immature and the robot

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,940
armature then I'm going to have to recite the actual walls right because they're going be half the size.

32
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,290
Then the bystanders that could in theory save me work later because now I'm going to have to recycle

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,280
all the furniture.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,060
However I'm okay resizing furniture going forward and this isn't actually cause a game breaking bug

35
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,230
so just be aware that you could if you wanted go and recycles everything that way.

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:14,670
Alright with all that said let's make a new scene and I'm going to start by just bringing in a static

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,410
body I would call this static body which we start with a song with Kitchen Bar.

38
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:30,320
And I'm just gonna bring in a mesh instance and drag the kitchen bar over here.

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,390
Now I have to know that this is the wrong size.

40
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,030
I can demonstrate that you very easily by just bringing in a kitchen mesh right.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,140
It should be smaller than this.

42
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh snap on.

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,560
I don't want that for now.

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,980
So let's get to the kitchen bar that you are.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,120
This is too big so let's figure out the sights we want.

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,890
I think we're looking at about three quarter size so zero point seventy five all three axes looks looks

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,030
actually it's a little bit high than what is zero point five look like.

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,170
Actually zero point five looks pretty solid doesn't it.

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,710
It's about the height you would expect the kitchen counter to be OK let's call it zero point five.

50
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,700
So let's rescale the mesh instance to zero point five.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,090
And now I need to give the collision shape however I'm going to mesh and do let's just use a convex

52
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,880
gauge and shape doesn't have anything fancy.

53
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,850
Look it's going with the default size so I have to rescale this.

54
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,470
I don't like rescaling it because it can lead to bugs but if I just click on convex it won't actually

55
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,680
give me an easy way of changing that.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,060
It's just going to give me a bunch of separate points and that's going to apply.

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,440
So I'm going to give it this right.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,120
Give it this way.

59
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,030
Do it this way.

60
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,450
Well let's save the scene and see how this works got into scenes into furniture which should be empty

61
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,340
unless you downloaded a very early project to this in which case files in but you can delete those new

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,030
folder and feel like static body is a good name for this static body and kitchen basken live in there

63
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,610
and we can see what it's going to look like someone at the lead this mission since and inside furniture

64
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,770
which is a nice thing we put the template an instance in.

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,210
Bring that in and let's move it to the right place.

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,110
You going to scoop that up slightly.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,650
That's right.

68
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,600
Let's skip over to the orwall I'M DOING THIS Bye for now because mine if this goes into the wall once

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,410
you start to leave too much of a gap.

70
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,960
Now put the snap back on and I'm just going to drag it over this way.

71
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,960
That looks about right so I'm thinking of some sort of canteen environments so let's just duplicate

72
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,070
a bunch of these.

73
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:51,390
One two three and you see how I snap it's fantastic for this four five six as a feel good feels pretty

74
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,770
solid to me.

75
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,670
I could put some more over here maybe before I'm okay with these for now.

76
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:03,900
I could even create a subfolder for kitchen zarmina make a brand new where I note that you are a creep.

77
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:12,660
You call you a kitchen bar and you go drag all the kitchen bano into that just make it nice and easy

78
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,600
to organise a probably only typical kitchen but typical kitchen bar.

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,010
Now one of play.

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,730
How's that work.

81
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,840
Pretty solid.

82
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,350
Now I don't necessarily want a player to come behind here because look I can hide from the food and

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,770
that's going to be a little bit lame.

84
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:40,330
So I'm going to restrict the play and movement on the player behind this bar or in front of this line.

85
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,450
I want to create a new node as part of the level and I'm going to go into the template scene make a

86
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:56,750
new bracket a simple node and call this collisions collision was there at the beginning for a save that

87
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,230
go back into level 1 here's my collision of awls.

88
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,160
So inclusion of all sets make a static body.

89
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,750
And I'm going to call this front wall and it's going to have no mesh instance it's going to be completely

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,370
invisible.

91
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,480
But it is going to have a collision shape so give that collision shape.

92
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,960
Lesin Cape.

93
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,620
Awesome.

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,700
And we use a box Collider for that.

95
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,020
OK shake.

96
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,430
Now if you're going to collision take it off of torain and have it only interact with the player.

97
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,700
So it is on layer and it only masks the player.

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:42,290
Now when I move this to the centre of the room which is roughly here and start moving it extends a block

99
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,810
the entire room off.

100
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,670
And this if you can line it up against that wall show me or yes that doorway.

101
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,730
I want the player to be able to go right up to the doorway but no further.

102
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,330
That's actually pretty good.

103
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,100
Now if I've done this right the food be able to go through here but not the play.

104
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,120
Let's find out.

105
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,650
Yeah.

106
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,090
I can't go past this line.

107
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,850
Bystanders can hear the shot in here.

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,370
And that's pretty awesome.

109
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:17,750
Now I'm going to duplicate this front we'll call this one back home and just scootch it back here scrooched

110
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,570
scootch.

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,090
And I think scootching it right up to where I've put this.

112
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,730
That looks pretty good.

113
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,470
One try to avoid the ability.

114
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,340
I don't want the players to jump on to the counter because then in theory I can avoid a lot of the damage

115
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,610
that way.

116
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,020
So I'm thinking a player can't actually cross this line how I managed it.

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,490
Yes I have or some tightens the amount of space I have as a player.

118
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,340
What are your thoughts of furniture in this area.

119
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,530
But that's off to a good start.

120
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,390
OK so now I want to do is make some more décor over here.

121
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,730
I might leave this corner free for now.

122
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,990
We'll see.

123
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:09,450
But I'd like you to fashion some fun furniture create some static body furniture and design level.

124
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,940
Don't worry about rigid body yet just make the stuff that cannot be moved.

125
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,240
You can make it look like mine.

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,860
You might make it completely different maybe yours as a bunch of desks that can't be moved.

127
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,600
Maybe also as an office but have fun with it.

128
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,660
Pause the video.

129
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,510
See what you can come up with and when you're ready come on back and by the way don't forget to share

130
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,970
the level you've made so far.

131
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,850
And welcome back.

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,970
Here is my beautiful little kitchen.

133
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,140
I've decided to go full Canteen's I've got two stoves and two sinks needs more light in here don't I.

134
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,440
I've got three fridges and I could probably organize us a bit more so I'm going to do that real quick

135
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,600
with you guys here so let's make our fridges and go to find all three fridges which are not kitchen

136
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,800
bars and they live in here.

137
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:05,230
And I think cabinets is another one we could use to make cabinets note and call this cabinets.

138
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,060
Everything that says kitchen cabinet on it can live in there.

139
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,090
And that's starting to look a lot more organized as it sinks and stoves should put them in one minute.

140
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,530
Put them in one cord sinks and stoves.

141
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,330
One more thing to do what we hear.

142
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,780
And I wasn't going to do this for the able to feel like we can.

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,190
Let's go in to our scene.

144
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,910
You know I can just put a lot on this.

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,800
I don't need my furniture but I'm going to look at the player who is here.

146
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,400
And let's open that script.

147
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,390
We need a function called hurt for when the food hits us because the food won't vanish.

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,540
That's why we function called hurt and all it's going to do is pass.

149
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,270
And we do the same thing in pieces.

150
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,450
So where's my robot NPC folder script.

151
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,120
There it is.

152
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,620
Let's put a function called hurt

153
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,040
and just pass the reason for doing this is project was going to check.

154
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Do you have this function.

155
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,700
And if you do I'm going to vanish so now in a press play.

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,570
Let's go full screen again.

157
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,020
In fact you can press this button.

158
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:26,180
The food doesn't hang around after it hits me which is reducing the clutter level by people.

159
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,950
Yeah I'm really happy with how this is looking so far.

160
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,080
I feel like that's a good place for the video in this video with continued making level.

161
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,390
And we've looked at designing lots of physics body objects specifically how to keep them organized.

162
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,690
So excellent work.

163
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,070
Don't forget to share your progress and I will see you in the next video.
