00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.690
Greetings glorious God people because I wanted an alliteration today.

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.570
Today we're going to mix some coins for bollix pick up let's make money rich.

3
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.920
To do that we're gonna use animation player which is a really cornrowed with a lot of versatility to

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.850
it.

5
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.780
What I'm going to do is when I make some coins that can be collected by bunny they can exist on their

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.800
own collision there.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.600
And after Bonnie connects a certain set of coins with which will define in a script but you'll get a

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.320
new life.

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.780
So the first thing to do is we make a new scene and I've got this weird graphics but if I move the camera

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.120
it should all vanish that's fine.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.610
Make sure I can see 0 0 that's the coins I shot.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.980
What kind of note do we want.

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.010
Well let's start with an animated sprites animated sprites.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.040
There it is.

15
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.200
And we're going to have to add some frames to it so new Sprite frames and when click on Sprite frames.

16
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.690
And if we go into graphics items you see we have a bunch of coins.

17
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.070
Let's drag them all in.

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.500
I'll make sure my animation is playing so I can see it.

19
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.910
Well tweak the speed in a minute but I don't like this snapping and the reason it's snapping like that

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.560
is it's jet.

21
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.930
Gently turn to the side and then teleporting back here.

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.910
So let's drag in bronze three and then bronze two.

23
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.050
And that should look a lot better.

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.010
Speed all ten francs a second twenty second.

25
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.510
No that's crazy.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.500
Fifteen.

27
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.780
Pick a speed you like I think 10 was the ideal speed for me.

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.410
Yeah that looks good.

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.180
So we have a coin right now.

30
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.900
This is a sprite.

31
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.970
It won't interact with the world.

32
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.100
So let's give the child of an aerial hoodie.

33
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.520
And you know what for now let's stop this from playing so you actually work on it.

34
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.790
All right this is going to need a collision shape or a clutch polygon a thickeners shape is the way

35
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.610
to go collisions sheep.

36
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.900
To me that you and I need a new shape and this is going to be a circle shape because then well the quiet

37
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.970
is a circle member grab the extents don't grab the bounding box if you grab the bounding box you going

38
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.780
it weird behaviour that looks actually pretty close to perfect.

39
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.080
What's that.

40
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.100
That's 43 was 40 foot is too small.

41
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.460
43 it is.

42
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.290
Well look at that.

43
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.040
All right.

44
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.560
For any further I'm going to make sure that whenever I select this I'm going to select all children

45
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.500
notes and I'm going to hide my coalitional.

46
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.720
So now whenever I move it move the entire coin.

47
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
Otherwise we're going to get some really weird behaviour when we start duplicating this coin at the

48
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.530
level.

49
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.320
OK we have a coin and we want this to do a thing.

50
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.220
When the player enters the body first thing I do is make sure the collision layer is correct.

51
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.260
Let's put the collision there.

52
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.500
On this empty fourth one and you know one set that before we forget sir was my college players there

53
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.700
under physics.

54
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.580
I had a sunny pickup's anything on the pick up player can only interact with the player and that should

55
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.560
be everything we need to do.

56
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.660
I'm also going to add a player to be able to interact with the pick ups just for some redundancy save

57
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.170
that we have a coin nemat coin.

58
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.020
OK let's figure what needs to happen.

59
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.100
Here comes bunny.

60
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.890
Bunny enters the area to.

61
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.760
The coin has to detect.

62
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.600
That will solve that problem right we've created this solution with spikes in the script.

63
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.650
There's now the hazard script.

64
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
So first you need to do is create a new script for coin and call this coin GDP or make sure put it in

65
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.530
our scripts follow so we can find everything.

66
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.070
And it probably doesn't need anything.

67
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.820
Ready.

68
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.640
Let's save the scene so far save then scenes.

69
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.770
It's called coin.

70
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.840
Great.

71
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.090
So what needs to happen.

72
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.810
Air on air is too deep.

73
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.330
We need to on body entered and remember body entered not Area entered because a body is entering connect

74
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.500
to the coin.

75
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.930
So when something is entering the coin that's where the script is.

76
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.010
What do we need to do.

77
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.110
We get to do two things.

78
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.640
Will tell game state you have a coin.

79
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.030
So we need to do is go global dot game state join up.

80
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.400
We need to create that function.

81
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.570
So let's create this function before we go any further.

82
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.540
So in my games egd which for some reason I have two of.

83
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.320
Let's create a coin up.

84
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.190
OK so what's not going to do.

85
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.530
It's going to go a coin.

86
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.830
Coins say plus equals one alright.

87
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.270
We need a variable not a variable called coins.

88
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.430
It has to be up here because it can't just exist in the function we need to keep track of these cards

89
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.640
just to make it very clear for itself.

90
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.290
Let's say coins equals zero.

91
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.080
We'll plug this into the galley later.

92
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.740
For now let's just make the coins work to make sure it's working let's go print

93
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.080
coins.

94
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.980
So whenever you pick up a coin print the value of coins.

95
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.840
Okay so that function is right.

96
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.120
Let's make the coin actually do something.

97
00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.460
In fact let's check that work before you go any further let's create a container note.

98
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.150
I call it coins.

99
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.280
And within that we're going to.

100
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.050
Instance.

101
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.360
Re size.

102
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.920
Move.

103
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.240
You know what.

104
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.100
I should restart using the move like unshorn like just to make sure I scale things.

105
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.130
So OK let's put this coin right here.

106
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.120
OK it's not going to disappear but it will make a quick print out happened so.

107
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.510
First off.

108
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.580
Nothing in output.

109
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.500
And there's a one OK so that's working.

110
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.310
Next we want to check is this interact with anything else.

111
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.110
The reason I'm doing this.

112
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.130
I want to make sure that my collision layers are set correctly so let's make sure that the coin isn't

113
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.530
interacting with the scenery or the hazards.

114
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.700
It's not.

115
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.910
All right Cornelius But you back here for now and save that.

116
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.620
Okay.

117
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.820
Now I want the coin to not just vanish.

118
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.900
I want to have a cool effect.

119
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.130
I want to get slightly bigger and then shrink down and then die.

120
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.070
There's a few ways I could do this.

121
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.830
Initially I thought I'd use something called tween tween as a very cool node that allows you to smoothly

122
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.340
animate properties over time but it takes quite a lot of arguments.

123
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.290
In fact let's look at the documentation of a tween and your soon to be a tween.

124
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.980
Here's everything you need to put in for a tween.

125
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.980
And that's a lot of stuff to remember.

126
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.720
It's quite a lot of work and there's an easier way of doing this rather than toyne.

127
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.120
We're going to use an animation play.

128
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.910
Animation player allows us to use key frame animation.

129
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.830
Let's talk about key frame animation is before you go any further.

130
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.200
So here's three frames I've drawn of Bob in.

131
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.440
I don't know a platform game.

132
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.390
Why is it called Bob.

133
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.180
I don't know I've just always called Bob.

134
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.200
There are several ways we could do this now.

135
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.510
Originally in animation what you do is you would hand draw every single frame that gets really labour

136
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.190
intensive key from animation allows us to do this.

137
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.290
We're going to set this as key one will tell it mark the position and which spring you're using then

138
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.010
will mark the next position in the next frame and call that ketu.

139
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.960
We're not going to muck everything in between.

140
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.270
We're just going to mark the start and end point will do the same for key three.

141
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.450
Why are we picking these because these are end points.

142
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.360
Okay so your first major animation is key one.

143
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.060
Your next was ketu.

144
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.960
Once we have this done the software in this case godso is going to figure out how smooth this line between

145
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.320
these two.

146
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.580
We can choose the shape of this line and then it's going to figure out the smoothest line between these

147
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.100
two.

148
00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.710
And we can put key frames honest x and y positions.

149
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.580
And on the sprite in fact we can animate almost any property.

150
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.490
So let's look at the animation player.

151
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.230
What's a good animation player selected.

152
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.360
You'll see the animation tab comes up first where do we create a brand you animation.

153
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.860
I'm going to call it die.

154
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.640
Why am I giving it this dramatic name.

155
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.500
Because this is the death animation of the court.

156
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.050
All right.

157
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.260
What needs to go in here.

158
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.380
Well I can mimic anything with a key symbol.

159
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.240
Somebody may have coins selected and I can pick any of these.

160
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.470
I can also.

161
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.190
Here are the three major ones right location rotations scale D.C. Like I think set for scale and press

162
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.880
this insert key that's going to insert the key for me.

163
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.440
Okay.

164
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.700
I'm not going to go through everything that the information player can do straight away.

165
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.140
But let's start by setting the length to one and a half seconds.

166
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.190
So it's getting a second half for this coin to vanish.

167
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.700
And zoom in a bit there.

168
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.190
Yeah.

169
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.400
So we have a key here and I think eight point eight.

170
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.680
I mean I can nuki.

171
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.600
So what's the new key.

172
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:45.340
Well there's select the scale and let's go one point five one point five is a good.

173
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.680
That might be a big Let's find it up to create a new key here.

174
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.340
The press the key icon by scale and now you'll see it does that.

175
00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.540
At one point five I'm going to do a scale of zero point one zero point one.

176
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.860
Let's create that key as well.

177
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.000
So let's play the animation.

178
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:09.120
OK.

179
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.340
That's way too slow.

180
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:16.880
So instead let's move this frame to zero point four and this one to zero point eight.

181
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.360
I'm going to call this a 1 second fate once I can get.

182
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:26.860
OK.

183
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.290
Some of the tweaks a little bit and get exactly where I want it.

184
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.710
That feels about half the speed I want so let's put you at point five you're point three and the lake's

185
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.240
zero point five.

186
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.080
And now when I get to the beginning the press play.

187
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.010
Not that that's but you it's your point too.

188
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.710
Great.

189
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.480
So I've got this effect.

190
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.620
And I switch the animated Sprite back on to playing.

191
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.990
His will actually look like.

192
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.160
Okay.

193
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.810
Looks pretty at a switch off the animation for now and put you back to that beginning.

194
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.390
Great.

195
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.310
I'll get back into the script.

196
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.080
Let's call the animation animation player.

197
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.750
There it is Dot clay.

198
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.230
And what we're going to play going to play the die animation awesome.

199
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:29.200
So right now we have a coin that will shrink we pick it up must check how it works.

200
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.220
Oh I forgot to set the prototype.

201
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.340
Make sure you put the actual animation playing.

202
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.480
Otherwise no where at any point for you.

203
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.740
Okay once more feeling as a coin rotating.

204
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.590
I want to pick it up.

205
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.900
It gets tiny.

206
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.530
All right.

207
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.000
Now let's make it vanish entirely.

208
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.960
There's a couple of ways we can do this.

209
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.470
We could put in a timer and time exactly what'll happen.

210
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.110
But to be honest we don't need to do that let's create a function or die.

211
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.290
And that's going to happen is it's going to go.

212
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.710
Q free so how are going to call this because Use a timer.

213
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.730
And we could say okay the animation is this long and when it's done when the time is finished send a

214
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:13.160
signal and that'll call this function or we could just call the function at the right point the animation

215
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.850
and that way we could make the animations long short as we want.

216
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.480
That's right.

217
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.250
We can call functions in the animation player.

218
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.370
So let's do that.

219
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.180
Others go into 2D rookies who are doing oh so small.

220
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:28.150
Get back to full size are in the animation player and make a brand new track which is this plus button

221
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.550
here.

222
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.640
What kind of tracks you want call function track.

223
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.650
What are we going to call we'll give a court coin.

224
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.430
That's where the script is and you'll see here the name it's given it is dot that means just the thing

225
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.590
I'm calling don't fight.

226
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.280
That's just the note position.

227
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.680
So don't change that if you change it it will go wrong.

228
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:53.450
And at this point here we need to add the key frame adichie frame and let's edit it and the Edit thing

229
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.460
is this button here.

230
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.910
So what are we editing in name.

231
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.160
Why the name of the function.

232
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.460
Don't put any brackets in.

233
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.920
Just write the name of the function.

234
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.320
Let's put this back to the full size.

235
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.770
And test it.

236
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.560
Here's a coin.

237
00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.590
There's a coin.

238
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.520
Now it's quite small.

239
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.860
So how we know it's actually gone.

240
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:15.210
OK.

241
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.620
Let's print something.

242
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.980
It's our friends.

243
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.290
Buy clothes and go.

244
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.320
And now I want to pick up the coin.

245
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.190
There it is.

246
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:30.700
OK.

247
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.770
Let's get rid of all of these printing things.

248
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:39.710
We have one there and we have one in giving state don't we don't need to print coins.

249
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.840
Which brings me to the challenge.

250
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.150
I'd like you to make bunny rich.

251
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.590
Let's put coins around the level.

252
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:51.600
A quick tip if you have clusters of coins lots of coins together it's going to tempt players in that

253
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.050
direction.

254
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:57.570
So should either make those really risky or a great way to lead players the secrets.

255
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:02.990
So pause the video duplicate the coins around the place and when you come back I'll show you my layout.

256
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.380
Welcome back.

257
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.060
Okay let's get into the level and look at to.

258
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.450
Now the first thing I'm going to do is take my first coin and place it somewhere fun.

259
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.940
I think this is fun and I'm going to duplicate it.

260
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.420
Is that doable.

261
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.390
That looks pretty good to me.

262
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.500
Let's make sure everyone selected.

263
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.370
I'm going to fast forward while I do the rest of this.

264
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:51.450
OK.

265
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.010
Now remember I have this move to selected which makes this much easier if you have a select thing it'll

266
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.940
still work it just might be a little trickier to get where you need it.

267
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.370
Let's minimize the coins and the spikes.

268
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.740
Let's see how this works.

269
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.330
Okay.

270
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:15.510
My level a little Yahn proof or can I go up to this cake kemal CAKE AND CAKE.

271
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.510
Now what we're not seeing is that gooey updating or hearing any sound effects.

272
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.080
But that's okay.

273
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.190
We're going to do that soon.

274
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.750
Meanwhile that's looking really good to me.

275
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.780
So in this video we've looked at animation player and introduced the concept of key frames with played

276
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:34.490
not just with how to animate things like scale and position and that's the standard things but how to

277
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.270
call a function an animation player which is really versatile.

278
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:44.840
Remember almost any property and all functions can be triggered an animation so you can really save

279
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.100
yourself all the time.

280
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:51.320
Before we sign off of this video I'd like to encourage you to share your current level design with all

281
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.150
the beautiful coins and spikes and hazards with the community.

282
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.280
Put it on Facebook put it on dischord put it in the community forums.

283
00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.210
Show us what you've got.

284
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.210
I'm dying to see the levels you guys are making.

285
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.070
Meanwhile great work and I'll see you in the next video.
