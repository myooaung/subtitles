00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,470
Hello again lovely God people in this video we got to make goals work or them some functional goals.

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,900
So we're going to do is we're going to make sure that each goal of got one highlighted here and the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,810
one here is going to have a way of detecting when the ball at us.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,750
So what we do is I mean to go into the goals because all goals are going to have this area.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,320
And I will add an area note.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,120
Now we've seen area study this area.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,620
It works in a very similar way with an important yet pretty obvious distinction.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,020
It's three dimensional.

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,940
So now when we add a collision

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,040
I need to be a collision shape.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,720
Now you could use a plain shape but I have had mixed results with this and I think the reason for that

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,210
is it matters which direction you come from the plane.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,590
I'm not entirely sure if that's it.

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,850
It might just be that if you're going too fast it might not notice that you've gone through so only

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,560
a box ship and this box is clearly way too big.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,960
So one would do is I'm going to make it oh around.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,140
As I say the same size of this post like a citizen actually have to be the same size of the post.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,500
Let's take a look.

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,930
It's currently zero point three or zero point two.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,610
Like move it over to the post I can see it's a little bit wider from the post.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,620
What's important is it can't go in front of this post so I'll say zero point two is actually fine.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,720
On the Z.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,970
Let's move you back to the centre.

24
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,120
So on transforms I put you back on zero on the axe.

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,930
It needs to be a little bit wider than that.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,410
There doesn't.

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:47,260
So let's say the X the extant on a X is one point five probably two two is just at the limit there.

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,600
But that's going to work to raise it up a bit.

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,600
That's going to be my why not buy one.

30
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,490
Maybe that might be a bit much.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm thinking that's a little bit high.

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,050
But I can probably work with it.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,450
I don't mind if it goes through the floor.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,210
I guess realistically there's very few instances where the ball is going to fly over.

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,760
But just in case let's lower the exanta a little bit and say it's oh quite seven five they'll good.

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,720
Yeah that looks pretty good.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:15,920
OK.

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,600
So what's that.

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,140
That is the zero point seventy five raised by zero point seventy five.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,520
Look at that.

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,780
That's pretty good isn't it.

42
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,500
And I was going to move it back to the actual line right up against it.

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,390
Now when it crosses that line that's going to counsel the gold.

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,700
So let's see where we are.

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,440
We are at zero zero point five zero point one to five almost exactly.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,220
So that makes me very happy.

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,960
All right.

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,510
Next the minister's mission when the correct collision shape.

49
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,950
So my area which I'm going to rename our goal detection

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,580
detection.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,930
There it is.

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,270
What I want to do is I'm going to go down to collision and I take it off the pitch.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,780
It's not pitch it's not a ball it's not a player it doesn't need any of those bit will detect the ball

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,000
not the pitch that's vital and not the play is important.

55
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,840
Why is it vital.

56
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,140
Because it's going to intersect with a pitch immediately.

57
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,580
Right.

58
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,100
It's in the floor.

59
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,700
Not the players because I don't want this to trigger every time the player manages to somehow get in

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,050
here.

61
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,820
I don't know quite when they do it but bad practice so.

62
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,640
The only thing I can interact with is the ball.

63
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,720
Let's put that in there and get in the game.

64
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:35,670
And we should see gold detection is where I on the side right there.

65
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:43,270
Can't see it against the blue and there should be another one over on goal to give to little children.

66
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,330
OK.

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,050
Now we need some form of script.

68
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,750
So let's make a brand new script in our game and I'm going to call this game g-day.

69
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,330
That feels a good name and we put my scrips hold Holder because that's just the structure we've set

70
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,240
up.

71
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,010
No other reason doing this is I want to connect to a signal.

72
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,630
And as you probably know by now you can only connect a signal to a script you can't do it's an empty

73
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,800
note.

74
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:16,030
Now the key here is that this one has to report a score for player one and this one has a report score

75
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,560
for play too so she can at ellingham say opposites.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,290
So what we do is on a get to my first goal detection so our goal detection is right there.

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,310
And I will connect it as a signal.

78
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:38,380
And I want body entered and I can connect to game and I actually want to pass in an extra argument is

79
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,760
already going to pass embody.

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,030
That's fine but I want to identify which gollott is.

81
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,210
So I'm a puzzle an integer and the integer is going to be which goal is being scored.

82
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,170
Now I'm currently working with Goal 1 but I want to carry.

83
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,570
I want to figure out who score has gone up and if Goal 1 is being entered it's play a 2.

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,110
So the integer I'm adding is not 1 it's two.

85
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,990
And I'm just going to connect that and do the exact same thing on goal detection too.

86
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,250
So body entered connect and then add the integer and this one is 1.

87
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,300
Whoops.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,830
And I should probably connect that to the correct plexion.

89
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:28,460
So let's connect it to the game at an integer of value 1.

90
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,410
So let's just double check what's happening in the mouse over it.

91
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,650
So tell me on got what it entered byrns 1.

92
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,520
So that's coming in to goal to and a gold one I should have the exact same thing with a different bind

93
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,580
buy it too.

94
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,780
Great.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,550
So now what I'd like to do is challenge you to make sure this is working.

96
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,700
So here's the deal.

97
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,260
We have this brand new function right on gold a tank should entered body and were actually not just

98
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,000
bringing in body.

99
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,900
We're bringing in gold widely.

100
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,130
You can call it go Eddy.

101
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,730
Call it player idae whatever it is.

102
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:14,020
I'd like you to use print to show which player scored in the console.

103
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,670
When the ball at the goal area now try and not just print a number right which print one or two I'm

104
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,240
likely to print Player 2 has scored a goal or play on one scored or goal for Player 2 or whatever it

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,780
is right.

106
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,380
Try and get the information across.

107
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,970
So possibly the give that a shot and when you're ready come back and I'll show you my solution.

108
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,430
And welcome back.

109
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,270
OK.

110
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,300
Well in the beginning is quite easy.

111
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,520
We just need a print function and I'm going to concatenate stuff in.

112
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:52,590
So what I need to do is say player space and then add in and then only this goal I did.

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,180
But his goal eddys an integer is a string.

114
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,940
So when it cast it as a string

115
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,810
and then just do that.

116
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,250
And that should be everything I need.

117
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,630
Let's see if I've done this correctly.

118
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,630
So I'm not going to maximize anything to see the console move Player 2 at the way.

119
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,530
Player 1 has scored there was a fun little bug there.

120
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,680
Did you catch it.

121
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,350
The ball went in.

122
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,430
See if I can get the ball back and get killed over there.

123
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,610
Made a game I can't play no.

124
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,510
Come back.

125
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,160
Let's skip forward.

126
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,140
Pretend that I'm competent at my own game.

127
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Check it out.

128
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,880
Every time the ball goes in it's entering at least twice.

129
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,190
Right now I didn't put an extra space in there which is silly.

130
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,510
Some of the space in there but at some point we have to fix this bug.

131
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,280
But right now we have a working goal player one has scored.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,990
So we're off to a good start and that's a nice easy quick win in the next video we're going to figure

133
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,300
out how to stop the ball from bouncing out.

134
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,770
But so far so good.

135
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,000
So nice easy quick video.

136
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,890
And in this video all the done interviews aryana to track when a goal is scored It's very simple but

137
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,910
it's a good building block.

138
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,040
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
