00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.930
Hello again you delightful go to people in this video we're going to add furniture why we're doing this

2
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.680
with a couple of reasons first it's going to make the level more interesting to look at less blank space

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.920
more variety if you have the same pattern repeated again and again blank room blank room Blank Rome

4
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
it's very hard for the player to concentrate but there's also something else going on the level going

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.730
to feel more believable it's going to have more of an illusion and most importantly there's the gameplay

6
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
reason we want to give the play The Player places to hide we'll break NPC line of sight lots of little

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.920
things to hide behind potted plants desks whatever they might be.

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.270
Okay so with all that said let's get into it now.

9
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.610
Our first thing we could do we could go into this Tom up here and we could add some more tiles right.

10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.970
It's beautiful floors in the walls or here all looking lovely and we could just open the tile set itself

11
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.920
and let's make a brand new one so I can click here.

12
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.180
It's just click this button to make this full screen.

13
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720
Let's add in a new single tile.

14
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.080
And you know what I'm going to give it a region.

15
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.880
Let's just pick this entire thing that's a that's a brand new tile.

16
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.110
OK.

17
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.530
You are now.

18
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950
This sofa is now new tile.

19
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.090
Click this little button again to minimize it.

20
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.110
There it goes.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.370
And when I get into the tile set I've got this new chair.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.430
So you might be thinking well it's great you just place this chair and you can.

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.460
But look what happens to the floor.

24
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.120
Why is this happening.

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.340
Remember what a tile map is a time up is a single node that takes up a whole bunch of space and it splits

26
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.350
itself into grids.

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.930
And then each grid reference it changes what's visible.

28
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.320
If I put a chair here I am replacing the information that was underneath it.

29
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.330
So I'm not putting a chair on top of the floor I'm removing the floor and putting a chair there and

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.860
that's all we want.

31
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.870
The way around this is going to be to create a new tile map.

32
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.370
First let's get rid of this ugly little chair thing it's made suddenly go back into my old tiles dot

33
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.840
tiaras and let's make this full screen again like cleaning expand.

34
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:12.510
Bottom Panel and make sure I'm in the right region and just delete I don't want that and minimize that

35
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.290
little panel.

36
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.820
And now when we click on the tile map it should be gone.

37
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.120
OK.

38
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.320
Now every level is going to want furniture.

39
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.710
So let's go and change the template.

40
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.280
Look let's get back into template level and I will put the new Tom up right and navigation to.

41
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.100
I don't want to rename this if I rename this it will lose all the information I would have to draw it

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.180
all over again.

43
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.370
And that sounds lame.

44
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.850
So brand new node.

45
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.480
And this is a new tile map.

46
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.900
I don't call it Tom up to I want to call this furniture.

47
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.120
So far so good.

48
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.340
Now this bit is going to be a little bit time consuming a little fiddly but it is worth it once we've

49
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.680
got this in place.

50
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.780
It's going to make everything a lot easier.

51
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.810
So we've got this new task.

52
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.720
Let's make a new tile set and click on it.

53
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.190
I'm not going to load the tiles set because the tiles that wants to be different and what I need here

54
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.620
is the actual sprite we can be using.

55
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.830
So let's add that in so adding a texture and going to graphics and add a tile sheet and I'm going to

56
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.630
choose the tile sheet complete.

57
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.320
There goes.

58
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.710
OK.

59
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.820
So we now have a new top sheet and I want to just fill up the entire screen with us again.

60
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.030
The zoom out a little bit.

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.900
Now all the stuff I want is over here on the right.

62
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.990
But I don't necessarily need all of this and I would encourage you to use as much or as little as this

63
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.230
is possible.

64
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.610
What I do know I want is some office chairs.

65
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.660
I want some sofas.

66
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.190
I want some desks.

67
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.170
We could maybe put some kitchen stuff in.

68
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.620
FESSLER do is start with a nice simple one.

69
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.980
So let's get started.

70
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.290
I'm going to make a brand new single tile.

71
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.850
So instead of using altar telling me a single tile and what do we not these glass desks I'm going to

72
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.840
put my snap back on and zoom right in.

73
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.840
Here we go.

74
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.650
Great.

75
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.990
Now you'll notice this just doesn't go all the way to the edge like probably live with that.

76
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.340
Some called this one and I've got my snap options I could change a step here.

77
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.440
But right now 64 by 64 is good.

78
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.230
I think that's my very first desk.

79
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.600
Now I also want these three.

80
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.520
So what we do is we can use single tile and click that one new single tile click that one single talk

81
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.400
click that well so far so good just defined some regions.

82
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.370
However each one of these also has collision.

83
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:31.100
So I'm just going to use my polygon to and click all four corners and the beginning.

84
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.640
Now assuming that I'm comfortable with the entire thing being the collision that's nice and easy right.

85
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.030
So I can do this with this one.

86
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.240
And you know this one let's just create a new Rectangle we're from their new Rectangle their new Rectangle

87
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.250
there.

88
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.060
So I can click on each of these and I could see the collision zooms in play.

89
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.610
OK.

90
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.400
So far so good.

91
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.450
What happens if I want for example these chairs these chairs are not perfectly the right size.

92
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.210
So let's zoom in here and get a nice and close.

93
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.680
There we go.

94
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.040
So I'm going to zoom enemies in the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

95
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.260
And I'm holding the mouse button down to pan the camera.

96
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.820
OK.

97
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.340
First let's change these steps.

98
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.700
What is 16 by 16 look like not good enough.

99
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.920
How about eight by eight.

100
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.740
I'm trying to do is line up as much of the chair as possible.

101
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.020
Even that doesn't look right does it have four by four four by four does look pretty good.

102
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.940
But it's going to be a little bit fiddly but that's just what it is.

103
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.780
So fascinating to do defined the region.

104
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.070
So let's define this region

105
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.390
and to do that I'm assuming a back to 64 by 64 just to define the region.

106
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.010
So let's define this region.

107
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.760
That's my region.

108
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.050
OK.

109
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.120
So analysis and collision right now this whole thing is the collision.

110
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.910
Don't want that.

111
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.200
Delete the collision.

112
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.450
Let's change our step back to eight by eight.

113
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.260
That looks good and we'll just use the polygon to draw as close to the chair as we can.

114
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.640
Not going to be perfect but it'll be pretty solid.

115
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.000
So that's and then back to the beginning and there's our collision shape.

116
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.330
OK.

117
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.520
Now he decides does this need to change the actual occlusion to not change the light beams and there

118
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.700
they're two arguments for this.

119
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.260
Let's get back into the regions so I can see it.

120
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.630
The first is yes we want to change the occlusion.

121
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:25.530
We want the flashlights the torches to cast shadows because then the player can see what is blocking

122
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.630
line of sight.

123
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.730
The other argument is no we don't because we want the player to be able to see the chair clearly it's

124
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.040
going to look weird.

125
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.210
I'm inclined to go with yes we do.

126
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.500
We want to actually block the line of sight because that gives the player valuable information.

127
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.190
So what we'll do is I'm sure a trace as close to the chair as I can.

128
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.980
Now you might decide you don't want the entire chair.

129
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.910
Maybe it's just the back of the chair.

130
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.720
That's fine.

131
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.930
But remember the collision shape is what's actually going to find it.

132
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.170
So let's draw around here.

133
00:06:53.170 --> 00:07:03.770
Give the player as much information as they can about their I guess that's kind of fiddly and close

134
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.150
that there's a occlusion OK before any further.

135
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.420
Let's test that and well.

136
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.010
So we go back into our main level now let's just minimize this window back until May level and let's

137
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:22.090
click on furniture and we should now have a chair on a desk let's place the chair the desk to do know

138
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:32.390
here with a little waiting room and we have a desk and a middle desk and we should have an outer desk.

139
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.520
We have as you put the outer asking yet have we.

140
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.150
Well that's OK.

141
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.630
What we can do is we can rotate this one.

142
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.660
Two things we could do.

143
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.380
We could use these to flip buttons.

144
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.480
I could do horizontal flip and I look good.

145
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.960
But maybe you're using some left shell.

146
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.400
You don't want to flip on the horizontal.

147
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.430
You want to touch you rotate which case you could use these two rotation things.

148
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.400
I want to rotate this right twice and that works the same way.

149
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.130
So this way I don't have to create the left hand side of the table.

150
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.550
You notice this table has no inclusion to be consistent we should probably put that in.

151
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.680
So let's get back into our furniture and let's edit this whole map and very quickly click on this link.

152
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.350
Speaking in and I should change my step shouldn't I.

153
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.460
So let's go to the left.

154
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:21.120
Make sure I've got the right being changed and changed this to 64 by 64 and zoom right out.

155
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.360
And now I'm going to use these left arrows until I find the correct type thing.

156
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:36.700
That's a correct table thing occlusion and a full square for this and next one gets the full square

157
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:43.830
and this one gets the full square.

158
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.340
I think that's all done because I forgot to do this.

159
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.080
Everyone just double check.

160
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.180
Let's go back in to the level say that I was at work show.

161
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:53.400
Take a look.

162
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.530
And now it's blocking it.

163
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.770
Okay so let's see that game

164
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.060
and make that nice and big.

165
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:07.280
Just run around the edges of the camera and we now have this nice chat at the check up here.

166
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.630
The table is there and the light beams are being blocked so I can wait for God to come down here.

167
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.730
You got no you shouldn't hit the wall.

168
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.440
That's fine.

169
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.400
You can just about see it being blocked there.

170
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.210
Now what's interesting is he can see me through the wall.

171
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.990
He should never do that.

172
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:29.630
So there's clearly some bug in that code will fix that wall but that is a good start.

173
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.660
However just this table and chair won't work.

174
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.980
First off I want to move that shares in the wrong place.

175
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.050
Right click on you to get rid of you and left click to pitch up here.

176
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.190
That's looking a bit better.

177
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:44.260
And now I'm gonna go back into my furniture tile set and I want to see someone want to put it.

178
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.180
So at this stage this is my challenge for you.

179
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.520
I would like you to make your awesome level even better.

180
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.430
And don't be afraid to tweak the existing level you already have.

181
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.360
First thing I will do decide which bits of furniture to look at.

182
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.050
If the back onto the screen we've got lots and lots.

183
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.740
Don't pick everything there's no need to.

184
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.560
Maybe you don't need trees in your level.

185
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:11.280
Maybe you do maybe huge what some kitchen habits maybe you want some more what a carpet.

186
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.210
Some TV.

187
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.290
I would leave monitors and TV alone we will be using those for gameplay.

188
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.290
Maybe on some surface pick a handful.

189
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.740
See how you feel and then go from there.

190
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.100
So post the video give it a go.

191
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.250
And when you come back I'll show you what I've got.

192
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.480
And welcome back.

193
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.730
OK.

194
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.410
So what have I done.

195
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.410
I've added a few things.

196
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.360
First thing I did is this little fish tank here.

197
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.770
I noticed this fish tank.

198
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.410
Let's go over it is a double region.

199
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.940
And I've also just spotted that I haven't put the collision on this properly.

200
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.110
That collision is in complete the wrong place.

201
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.390
So let's get rid of this collision.

202
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.270
I'll show you what that was going to be in a moment.

203
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.150
And the inclusion be wrong too.

204
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.980
What was that was specially this plant here.

205
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.690
So let's take a look at this.

206
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.150
I quickly put a collision in.

207
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.580
This collision can be this zoom down to eight by eight.

208
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.290
Yeah that looks good.

209
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:12.510
And we're just going to undo that and draw in my polygon stoop doop doop doop one fish tank and inclusion

210
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.740
as well.

211
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:19.170
I'm going to draw that in one two three four close.

212
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.270
I was also put this plant in which has vanished.

213
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.470
So let's do that real quick.

214
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.850
Sixty four by 64.

215
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.080
New single tile.

216
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.550
There it is.

217
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:32.700
Let's make this nice and small so it's a four by four step and zoom in as much as we can.

218
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.240
And very quickly show you how to do this one.

219
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.210
So collision.

220
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:37.180
OK.

221
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.530
So this doesn't have to be pixel perfect but I was as close as I can.

222
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:46.730
So let's just run around here and get that as close as feasibly possible.

223
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.500
So it makes sense for the player.

224
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.570
That one's a little off.

225
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.220
So let's just go this way.

226
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:56.860
No player can get through there anyway.

227
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:57.450
Great.

228
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.280
And that's me the occlusion which will have to be a little bit more sensible.

229
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.800
You know what let's go even fine.

230
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:03.860
Let's get a two by two.

231
00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.490
That's annoying isn't it.

232
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:13.080
And we're going to make a little polygons I just trace around the outside and I could just do the leaves

233
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.960
if I wanted to.

234
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.130
But I've made the decision that furniture should look like this.

235
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.800
It's kind of hard to look at this.

236
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.730
Zoom in a bit.

237
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.250
There we go.

238
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.330
And just trace the outside.

239
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.370
That was Miss

240
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.550
and there's a occlusion.

241
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:53.090
OK so let's make this a little easier to look at and zoom out as you have got so we got that fish tank.

242
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.340
We've got that potted plant.

243
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.560
Select the regions.

244
00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.300
We've got the another selection of sofas and I think that's going to look good.

245
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:06.840
So let's get back into our level and start making it save everything we've got so far minimize that.

246
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.600
And Max the level.

247
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:08.930
OK.

248
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:12.350
So this chair needs to be placed I've got a potted plant.

249
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.700
Put a potted plant in the corner.

250
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.360
She has not put a potted plant put a potted plant here but I think a potted plant there is good maybe

251
00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:26.000
one here is nice and I'm going to make some nice waiting room stuff.

252
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.110
How about a waiting room here.

253
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:37.360
Let's rotate you nice long sofa can go right there and I'm going to flip this horizontally and put that

254
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.400
there.

255
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.170
And now we can put a coffee table.

256
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:47.180
So how about a nice little coffee table right here horizontal flip again.

257
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:47.830
OK.

258
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.640
So that was looking good.

259
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.230
So that gives some stuff to hide around now.

260
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.500
At the moment it's still looking very sparse.

261
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.990
So let's put some more stuff in here about a potted plant there in that corner.

262
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.770
Want to hear yes something that looks good.

263
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.780
Actually not that right here.

264
00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:04.810
And let's put it some more offices.

265
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.750
This looks like it wants to be an office isn't it.

266
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:07.760
Let's make you an office.

267
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:17.900
So you are now an office and yes I'll be a very annoying security camera behind you horizontal flip

268
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.360
little chair.

269
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:20.430
And there we go.

270
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.730
That chair looks like it didn't have good occlusion we can fix in a bit but you can quickly see we're

271
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.840
putting a little together.

272
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.040
Mind if I put something there.

273
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.520
No one can walk through so maybe I won't put a plant here but there might be interesting Betty right

274
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.110
here at the play hide on the door.

275
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.810
And what else we got with this nice fish tank that fish tank you go somewhere I think that fish tank

276
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.830
can go right.

277
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.090
He

278
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.210
has a really tight spot isn't it.

279
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.150
Yeah that looks good.

280
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.830
In fact you know what.

281
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.590
We can make this even easier.

282
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:58.060
Let's get rid of this bit of wool and then move that fish tank and put the fish tank right there.

283
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.180
Those are the wrong floors.

284
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:05.960
So let's put the correct floor how we got some good and that's a good start.

285
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.640
Now we can also put some stuff down here

286
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.770
so let's put it.

287
00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:17.930
You don't want to make multiple desks in here let's flip here.

288
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:21.750
Go.

289
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.450
And I'm going to put two sets of chairs.

290
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.130
How about one right here one right here.

291
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.760
You know a little bit of greenery make this office a little nicer.

292
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.770
One here one here one here and that's pretty solid.

293
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:40.640
Let's see how it plays.

294
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:43.770
All right.

295
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.280
So run round my fellowship I didn't do anything in this room.

296
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:51.250
We could do that a little bit but so far so good.

297
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.650
And I've got myself a little bit stuck.

298
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:01.390
I realize right now there's no penalty but I'm going to run around as quick as I can.

299
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.630
Is actually surprisingly difficult.

300
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.270
That's nice.

301
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.260
That's nice and easy.

302
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.740
Let's see how this chair works like fishy.

303
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:09.490
OK.

304
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.220
Right now this chair isn't blocking occlusion and that's no good at all.

305
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.020
So let's just fix that real quick.

306
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:22.830
So back into my tile set and let's click on the chair and zoom in.

307
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.210
You should write this.

308
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.370
It's a little easier myself.

309
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.190
There it is.

310
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:27.490
OK.

311
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.010
Tell me about your occlusion.

312
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.600
You don't have any.

313
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.820
How about collision you have collision and I have occlusion and that.

314
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.060
Let's put that in real quick.

315
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:42.440
So it's got eight by eight and big bop noticed before I fall isn't it.

316
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:43.270
Beep

317
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.950
here I think

318
00:16:53.750 --> 00:17:00.980
and see if was can follow the light gray around as best I can here.

319
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.080
I see leaning closer to the computer for some reason.

320
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.400
OK.

321
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.970
And now you have occlusion and you should have occlusion too and you should too.

322
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.720
It's all pretty consistent.

323
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.440
That looks good.

324
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.640
Now if I go back into the game

325
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.960
you suddenly have quite a tense at a level with these little bits of clutter and lots of hiding spaces.

326
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.170
But they also make it more difficult to navigate.

327
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.120
So I'm quite happy that that camera might be a bit mean.

328
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.400
But yeah that's looking pretty good.

329
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.490
So.

330
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.830
So in this video we've looked at how to make the level more believable.

331
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.540
We looked at setting up texture regions and we've looked at rotating and flipping tiles.

332
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.030
So excellent work.

333
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.190
And I'll see you in the next video.
