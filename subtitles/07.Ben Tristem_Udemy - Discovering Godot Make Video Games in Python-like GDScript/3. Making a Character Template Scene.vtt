00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.580
Hello again you wonderful go to people.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.860
Let's start actually coding this game.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.150
I've talked about what it's going to be a look at the assets long enough let's code something in this

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.440
video.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.030
We're going to start things off by making a template for our characters by characters I mean the play

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.800
a character NPC gods and any other NPC me we may want to see.

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.420
Now you may want to see we may want to see Ivan include you in this.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.390
We did do this by making an inheritable scene.

9
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.200
Inheritance is a key concept in God.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.890
And to a degree we've seen a little bit of an inheritance with how children inherent their parents properties.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.470
But this is a more advanced version of that.

12
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.410
But first why would we do that.

13
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.200
What's so important about making an inheritable scene.

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.720
Well the short answer is it's a really great way of avoiding repetition and we don't want to repeat

15
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.500
stuff you don't repeat the same lines in code within a script.

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.320
So why write the same script several times.

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.270
Let's say that in a game we've decided the maximum speed that any character player or non play character

18
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.790
can move that it makes sense to have it in one place.

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.090
If nothing else if we need to tweak that value later tweaking in one place is easy.

20
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.500
Remembering everywhere we've put it and keeping track of what we've tweaked to what we haven't is a

21
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.790
pain.

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.560
This is gonna allow us to improve our consistency.

23
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.030
Right.

24
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.270
The less things we have to tweak to make something change the better.

25
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.700
Otherwise we can stop winning all kinds of bugs and it's also going to make adding variations easy.

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.960
What if we have an NPC that's exactly like this but it does this extra thing or does this one thing

27
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.130
slightly differently inheritable scenes will do that for us.

28
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580
So with that said let's get him to go to his gut.

29
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.110
And I'm gonna make a brand new scene first and I'll make a folder for it.

30
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.890
This is going to be my character templates on a folder called characters which I'm going to try and

31
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.930
spell roughly correctly.

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.570
And I want to put a brand new 2D scene in here.

33
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.990
I'm actually not going to have the be no 2D.

34
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.900
I want to right click on a new change type.

35
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.150
I don't make a kin somatic typing in kinetic body 2D.

36
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.120
You might row we did this before with Bunny.

37
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.160
This site different things can be a top down and a climatic body 2D is going to need a collision shape

38
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.290
and a sprite.

39
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.920
I'm gonna put the sprite in first

40
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.250
and then I'll do the collision shape later.

41
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.020
Before I do that let's see how comfortable you are with this process.

42
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.080
Don't worry if you don't feel quite up to speed yet.

43
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.730
Well my challenge to you is to create a character template.

44
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.200
Find the sprite you think will work and a quick tip.

45
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.660
Use one you're not going to use anywhere else in the game.

46
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.830
That way if something goes wrong you can see it instantly and give it a collision shape.

47
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.220
So pulls a video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you how I do it.

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.510
Welcome back.

49
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.000
All right.

50
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.940
So first thing we do is find a sprite that under graphics and PMG and I've got these people here and

51
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.160
hit man Red is one of that I'm not going to be using.

52
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.410
So I'm going to find hitmen rates stand and it looks very different from the others for example I've

53
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.710
got this Agent 47 looking one of a soldier but I'm going to be using this one.

54
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.200
So I've got hit man red and he's got me my template.

55
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.830
In fact let's rename no 2d to template character just so it's very obvious what's happening.

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.140
I need a collision shape so I'm going to add a child to the climatic body node and it's going to be

57
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:31.500
a collision shape 2D element is a capsule for this and I'm seeing it move to the right place a select

58
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.370
move and just move it right there and then using select on a drive the extents.

59
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.890
So it just covering the body.

60
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.080
I want to cover the shoulders.

61
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.380
I don't really care about the face.

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.840
I'm also gonna be slightly off in places but that's fine to hide the clear shapes you don't need that

63
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.970
right now.

64
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.730
Well we'll see what to do.

65
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.470
I'm a select template character and I'm going to make sure that we can only select the parents we're

66
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.960
not going to like the children unless we need to.

67
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.600
So if I drag the template character I'm also dragging the shape in the collision otherwise his will

68
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.990
happen.

69
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.870
So let's make sure that I don't have you selected and I click on it.

70
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.580
Character is here right.

71
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.120
That's going to make a huge difference for our game.

72
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.310
So let's not do that.

73
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.720
Make sure everything's in the right place everything's locked in.

74
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.910
Great.

75
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.200
Okay.

76
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.600
So close with my graphics folder so I can see him doing and get back to my characters folder.

77
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.610
Let's save this character save in characters as template character dot TSC and saved.

78
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.620
Awesome.

79
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.940
Now let's put in a basic script song.

80
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.250
Add a brand new script to template character.

81
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.260
It can be called template character dot G.D..

82
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.330
Perfect.

83
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.750
She don't need anything to put is empty what would put here is any variables constants or code that

84
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.230
everything that is a character must have.

85
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.930
In this case they're going to be constants.

86
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.280
Let's start with a constant called speed.

87
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.020
Now when I write all my constants in capital letters so I'm going through my code.

88
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.350
I can see immediately.

89
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.460
That's a constant.

90
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.350
Don't set it to something else.

91
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.280
If I need to set things I should be setting a variable gotta will let me change the value of a constant

92
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.790
runtime.

93
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.700
But I really shouldn't be doing that.

94
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.500
That's another great way to put bugs in my game because I'm going to think this is a constant.

95
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.930
And then later on the code gets bigger and bigger and bigger it's going to change halfway through the

96
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.250
game.

97
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.010
I'm not going to catch that.

98
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.790
Let's give this speed of 10.

99
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.810
This feels like a slightly magic number right now but will you see a value for now.

100
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.030
We can tweak this later and it can be easier to tweak.

101
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.360
Let's also give it a max speed and one.

102
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.370
Sure what this is going to be is we're going to accelerate by speed unless we're at max speed.

103
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.650
OK.

104
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.670
Nice and easy.

105
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.860
Finally let's give it a consequent friction.

106
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.850
It's actually not a great name for this.

107
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.340
This is a time to stop moving.

108
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.890
Right.

109
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.580
Which I guess I could call it but for summaries of friction feels better if I put zero point one that's

110
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.930
gonna be zero point one seconds a tenth of a second to go from max speed to zero.

111
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.760
That might be too fast.

112
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.410
We could do for instance 10 seconds.

113
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.340
We're going to feel like we're on terrible terrible ice.

114
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.790
One second slightly terrible ice zero point two five whatever you want for now on zero point one just

115
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.530
enough to have a very subtle impact on the player the player won't notice it but it's going to feel

116
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.310
more real than just suddenly stopped moving and that's let's save that.

117
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.100
And that is a very basic script.

118
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.660
We can now inherit that.

119
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.120
Now if I want to inherit it which I'll do the next video.

120
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.440
All I'm going have to do is go new inherited scene and then select What I'm inheriting from.

121
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.970
But that is going to be the next video which as you might expect brings us the end video in this video.

122
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.630
We've looked at how to design inheritable templates.

123
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.810
We've looked at inheritable scenes and inherited scripts which is going to be really useful it's going

124
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.450
to save a lot of time and it's going to mean that adding variations of enemies means we don't have to

125
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.320
keep adding more and more stuff.

126
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.860
Right.

127
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.700
It's gonna be very easy for us to say this is how it works and you tweak a little bit.

128
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.680
So if we wanted to we could at ad attack dogs robots Roomba drones whatever it might be.

129
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.910
So great work and I will see you in the next video.
