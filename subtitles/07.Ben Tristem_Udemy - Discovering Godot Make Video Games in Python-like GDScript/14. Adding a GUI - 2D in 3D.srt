00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,850
Hello glorious God.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,370
It is because I feel like guys are any different.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,730
In this video we're going to add to in 3-d.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,540
We're going to add a goofy to our game at some point we need to show the score to The Players.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,370
Let's get started.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:24,450
So if we have a 3-d scene going on how would we add a 2D app.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,470
And the answer is in God.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,560
You just add it.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,200
It has a true 2D engine and a true 3D engine.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,000
This isn't true in every engine for instance.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,090
Unity can do 2D but it's actually rendering 3D and locking the position so it looks like today that's

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,330
fine.

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,170
That works great.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,810
But if we want to add to be one amadou's and then add a node that's in too deep and it'll overlay them.

15
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:52,080
So let's make a brand new scene with a root that's a canvas layer y canvas layer because it'll always

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,370
be in the same position on the screen.

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,310
So if for any reason we move the camera.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,180
If you decide that your camera has to follow the ball find the median point between the midpoint between

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,210
two players and follow that the gooey won't move it'll stay fixed on the camera or other.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,720
It will move the camera whatever it looks stuck to the camera which is what we want and I'm going call

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,490
this gooey.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,390
Now if I add any kind of control mode or any to decode.

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,640
So let's add in a I don't know let's add in a nine patch Rex that's a good start.

24
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,970
We switched to tuti anything I put in here will appear in 3D just to make sure that's true.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,570
Delete this and put in a Sprite

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,070
and a Sprite is going to be there.

27
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,830
Got it I can watch on my screen.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,830
For some reason as corrupted now looks weird and green and yellow with that's fine.

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,320
And I'm going to move this to here and save my go missing.

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,200
It's not going to look like this in-game.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,020
Don't worry.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,690
An instance in the Gooly.

33
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,690
Get rid of that preview now.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,950
I can't see it because I mean 3D view but if I switch to to see you I can see it when I press play.

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,920
There's my sprite.

36
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,600
OK so we know that we can have 2003 Alright.

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,340
Well we don't want the God I can hear although it's it's very lovely I come.

38
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,890
Maybe you do.

39
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,840
Maybe that's part of your.

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,620
That's fine if you look over in graphics you'll see a folder called interface.

41
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,430
I've given you a banner you can use and if you want a wood panelled you can use and if you go back up

42
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,240
to the root you'll see a font's directory and there's a font I've taken from Kenny.

43
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,110
You don't have to use these you can use any assets you like but I've provided these so you can use them.

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,030
Which brings me to the challenge.

45
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,490
I'd like you to make the gooey feel game send this challenge early so you can really personalize this.

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,690
Now at the very minimum you should show the score for each player.

47
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,850
How you do that's up to you.

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,590
I'm also going to put the words Q Did kick about in there.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,510
So pause the video set up the goofy.

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880
Don't worry about plugging in the score I don't need to be functional yet but have a system so you can

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,690
see how much player one has.

52
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,300
How many or how many points.

53
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,890
I guess what's what play 1 score is what played to scorers and any other information you are put in

54
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,220
there.

55
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,180
Go for it.

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,830
Suppose the video when you happy with the results come back and I'll show you my agree.

57
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,530
Welcome back.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,100
I said as an usher you may go.

59
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,250
I haven't built it yet and I meant it with you.

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,090
You know what it's fine.

61
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,620
Everything is fine so my root node is a canvas layer and within that I'm going to put a 9 patch rectangle.

62
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,690
So let's make a nine patch right.

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,750
And I'm thinking make the banner go across the top here and in the middle the right Q did kick about

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,120
and the play one score on the left.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,350
Play a two on the right.

66
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,880
I am not going to change colours for it just can keep them nice and simple.

67
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,840
So let's go into graphics and interface and as my name gets wrecked and I'm going to put the banner

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,650
on a college banner now.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,710
Obviously this isn't where it goes.

70
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,240
Someone go let out milingo top wide.

71
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,520
It's now gotten rid of the minimum size.

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,800
That's okay I could put that back in.

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,100
I think the minimum size for erect penis size on the y axis.

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,280
I think our hundred and twenty is pretty good.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,180
And now I can start playing around with the patch margins so I need to get up to here to make this not

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,270
look blurry so if I try five it's nowhere near enough.

77
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,950
If I try.

78
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,720
10.

79
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,580
Still not looking good.

80
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,550
Let's try 20 20 I can get.

81
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,590
This is a nice clean line so the straight 20 on awful margins.

82
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,130
And that's looking pretty good.

83
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,480
And Bana only has one capital in it because that's how English works now.

84
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,720
Currently this is set to be the top of the screen.

85
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,030
But I want to anchor it properly.

86
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm an anchor it to my top centre.

87
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,250
So why play the game.

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,090
It's currently taking up this full width maybe I don't want that I can fix at the minute but it's staying

89
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,940
in the centre.

90
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,160
I can play with how wide this is in a moment.

91
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,510
That's fine within the actual banner maybe on top of the banner.

92
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,390
I haven't decided yet.

93
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,980
I must say within it's going to keep things keep things a little simpler in terms of resizing.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,370
I would put the name of the games a cupid kick about and play a 1 and play 2.

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,150
I am splitting things horizontally so I want to put in each box container and I want to make this full

96
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,330
rectangle of its parent saying full rectangle.

97
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,490
I actually want some margin so it's put some much in 25 pixels maybe.

98
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:32,070
I'd say 25 because I think that's 20 because I save by 20 pixels I can actually go by 20 pixels and

99
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,190
see how that looks.

100
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,110
That's pretty good.

101
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:40,430
I'm happy with that 20 pixels from left to 20 from the top and probably minus 20 from the right.

102
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,900
Yes and minus 20 from the bottom right.

103
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,940
So anything I put in is going to fit within that margin.

104
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,700
And let's view our helpers just Saag make sure the anchor this correctly.

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,230
So if I recycled the banner or give that a tell it your only 400 wide or whatever it is it already signs

106
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,860
everything.

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,350
That's good.

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,470
I like that.

109
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Now within the box container I need to put some things I must start with the label and that's only the

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,650
name of my game which in this case is glued kickabout.

111
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:16,250
OK that font isn't working for me so I'm going go back up to my main banner and I'm going to add a themes

112
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,090
that's got a theme make a new thing.

113
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,710
Click on that and all I really care about right now is a default font so let's add a new dynamic font.

114
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,660
I go back up to the fonts folder and put Kenny bold in it because it's actually open that.

115
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,480
Put Kenny bold into the font and give it a size about 40 is 40 big 40 is very big but that's fine.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,000
I like that it's looking nice and bold and actually kind of sports.

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,490
And with the banner everything excellent.

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,310
I don't want it aligned the left.

119
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,440
However the text is taking the entire text box if I change this the centre.

120
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,920
Nothing's going to change.

121
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,380
Instead it's got the H box container and an alignment.

122
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,620
Go centre now.

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,860
All elements are going to align to the centre.

124
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,730
Well let's put in a couple of elements.

125
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,700
Let's put in another label and a right number zero.

126
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,500
And this is going to be player to play one score so Player 1 score in a live.

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,750
This to you right here.

128
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,850
This label because anything goes.

129
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,770
Remember the H box container is going to look at the order that the children are in and place them that

130
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,400
way.

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,070
So now that's fine and well duplicate that to be player to score not play or one score or to play a

132
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,620
two score and put that underneath the label.

133
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay I need a bit more space here.

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,380
Some of my other Abebooks margin and give it a custom constraint.

135
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:42,300
Let's see a separation of 40 pixels 50.

136
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,450
Great.

137
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,090
And that should work just fine.

138
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:54,400
So let's take a look at it in go now at the start of the game.

139
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,520
God is saying okay get the size of the screen and set the banner.

140
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,920
Why doesn't know it's about but set the patch rectangle to be the top centre of it.

141
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,770
When I make the screen bigger it's not updating that.

142
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,250
That's fine I'm happy with that.

143
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,960
Maybe though I don't want this to be a hot top centre.

144
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,510
Maybe I'm going to say to it just be this size so let's fix the size of the banner.

145
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:23,690
I say that to grow the size of the banner is not 1024 pixels it's pixels how that work is too small.

146
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,120
About 900 900 is pretty good.

147
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,000
And now I need to centre it somehow.

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:37,610
So instead of going top wide I want to go centre top and now when I press play the banjo should be fine

149
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,120
and resize it and the banners are the same size.

150
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,360
Maybe this margins are a bit big now because when he scores getting bigger that's going to be a problem.

151
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:52,580
So instead of 50 pixel suppression of say a 30 pixel separation that's pretty good.

152
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,380
I could even change the size of the fonts for the scores or for the labels so maybe the label isn't

153
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,310
going to be the same size or else but actually right now I'm pretty happy with that.

154
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,400
One more thing to do is I'm going to set up a pop up that's going to come up when the game is over.

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:14,600
When we were in yeah I'm going to set it so on my gooey I'm gonna make a new pop up and ima give that

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,360
it's 0 9 patch rectangle So let's give that of my patch RACT 9.

157
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,090
How to say it like Patch wrecked and let's make it visible.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,960
And there we go.

159
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,470
Now it can get wrecked.

160
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,420
I'm so sorry I'll never do that again.

161
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,050
OK.

162
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,160
And let's add our panel would as a Texas give me my background.

163
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:42,500
I want to give this a minimum size so I'm thinking 400 by 200 decent size so I'm to go to the pop up.

164
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,390
I'm going to say a line to send to you.

165
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,880
Yeah and.

166
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,090
When a line the actual ank etc. as well that should work nicely and I'm Petsch rectangle.

167
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,890
Okay you're in the wrong place.

168
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,500
OK has your full rect OK.

169
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,910
So the pop up size so give a pop up minimum size not size flag racks that were gone.

170
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,950
So when we say we said 400 by 200.

171
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,740
Great.

172
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,810
All I need to do now is put that back in the centre and that should work fine.

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,900
This is going to be the little part of the comes up.

174
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,710
Let's give the patch margins something to play with how this 20 picks will sound.

175
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,210
Oh pretty good about tennis tend to few.

176
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,570
Yes tennis too few.

177
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,170
So let's say 20 or 50 maybe.

178
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,200
You know I don't know you know I'm playing with this 20 worked on a stick with 20.

179
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,700
Okay looking nice and shiny with that and put a V box container.

180
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,260
Here we go.

181
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,930
The.

182
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,970
BOX.

183
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,290
Contain and full rectangle.

184
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,650
And give it some margins at say 10 pixels.

185
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,010
Nope.

186
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,680
Let's say 20 pixels.

187
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:05,140
Twenty bucks better 20 from the left 20 from the top minus 20 from the right minus 20 from the bottom.

188
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,750
So that's going to be the margin.

189
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,600
And I'm a little label.

190
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,690
Just can say game over.

191
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,170
Now this isn't keeping the style they made earlier.

192
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:25,170
Somebody go back into my banner when I go to thien and save my thien SAVE it right at the top here and

193
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,020
call it theme dot theme because that seems like a good name.

194
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:35,270
And let's love that it's about to pop up at a clean load thing dot thien.

195
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,550
Why do I have to do it that way.

196
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,270
Because pop is not a child of banner it's a child of gooey which is a canvas layer canvas layers don't

197
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,070
have thin.

198
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:51,280
So this label is looking good except it's one in the wrong place that's a line that to centre and two

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,160
it's the wrong colour.

200
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:52,900
So let's go.

201
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,170
Custom colours and just enable black.

202
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:03,310
I'm also going to put a button and so under the box container when I put a button and on the button

203
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm going to play again.

204
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,600
The theme is in there but we don't yet have a thing for the button.

205
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,560
I could put one in.

206
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,850
I've only got one button in the game.

207
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,770
I'm not planning on anything more so I could just go to custom styles and let's see.

208
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:24,480
Probably under normal I'm thinking I'm the saying new style box flat such as the basic flat colourant

209
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,190
border.

210
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,030
Click on that one on.

211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,530
I want a white button with a black border.

212
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,220
That sounds good and that black border is going to be um look at the preview here the see for pics only

213
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,110
44.

214
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:44,940
Crazy talk for pixels on each side and I don't want to blend the border blend from black and white.

215
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,600
Its look good.

216
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,890
If I want I can even get a corner radius for pixel corner radius.

217
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,140
Corner nice rounded button.

218
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,490
It's not showing here yet because that's actually not normal that's what we focussed I to save the style

219
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,300
box.

220
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,250
Under.

221
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,010
Probably interface.

222
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,360
It seems a good place to put it so graphics interface.

223
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I'll say button.

224
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:16,670
Lot of style looks good and let's go back up here find my buttons and I can load them into all of them

225
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,760
so graphics interface style box and keep loading.

226
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,230
Okay I've now got grey on white which is a terrible choice of custom colours.

227
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,690
Let's just enable black for all of these and what the masses are doing is looking like that now.

228
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,190
Right now the font is bleeding into the border.

229
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,930
Don't want that.

230
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,270
So let's go to our button and give it a rest.

231
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,470
Minimum size.

232
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:53,160
Currently it's 66 let's call it 70 let's give it four pixels seventy at 74 looking better and I can

233
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,910
read this properly.

234
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,940
That looks good.

235
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,330
So now we have a pop up that will say play again.

236
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,730
Right now it doesn't do anything but it will.

237
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,470
And there it is.

238
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,960
There's a good single look at that game.

239
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,550
I have a nice little balance can look great in its background and up at the background in an avid game

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,390
and I have everything working just fine.

241
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,460
And that brings us to the end of the video.

242
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:20,250
In this video we've looked at how to use 2D and 3D nodes at the same time and it turns out and got you

243
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,160
just tell it use them and use them fine which is great.

244
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,660
And we've made a lovely geula of lovingness which is even greater.

245
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,620
We're now ratel Why are the gooey together start showing the score to the players and letting them really

246
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,660
love the game and the rain.

247
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,060
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
