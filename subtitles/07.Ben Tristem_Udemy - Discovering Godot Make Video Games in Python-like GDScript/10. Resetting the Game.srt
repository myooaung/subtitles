1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello again, you tremendous golf to people, OK?

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,730
How game is coming along nicely.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,510
We've got a way of detecting goals and the rest of it, but we want to get the the pitch.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,260
The entire game state back into its original position.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,210
Every time I go to.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,020
That's what winning.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,760
We are resetting the game when a goal is scored.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,070
When you go to school to will do the following things.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,380
We want to stop the ball and the players.

10
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,190
We don't want that thing.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,970
We can keep scoring a scoring and scoring and resetting the timeout.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,000
We need to give the players time to celebrate and or fume.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,490
In other words, we're going freeze the game for about five seconds and let both players understand

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,900
what's happened and process what's happened.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,140
Then we need to move the ball and the players back to the start.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,260
Finally, we need to allow the ball and the players to move.

17
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,390
So we're got to freeze the game.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,580
Wait five seconds.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,400
We can move everything back to the start and I'm going to unfreeze the game.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,220
That tells me we need some way of tracking if things can move and we need a place for things to go.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,750
So let's start with a place for things to go as minimize all of these.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,730
I'm like a brand new organization load.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,310
Just give me a simple note.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,030
Come back.

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:10,440
Which go.

26
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,130
La, la, la, la, la.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,640
There it is.

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,650
And I'm gonna call it swarm stop positions.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,140
Easy to write.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,380
Start positions.

31
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,240
And what one would do is I'm going to use every entrepreneur.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,410
Right.

33
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,440
That I'm going to use some position.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,240
3D notes.

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,810
Okay.

36
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,480
So we've used position to D.

37
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,710
When we were playing a high spice's, we are making high surmises, visual, 3D, exact.

38
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,080
Same thing in 3D space.

39
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,460
That is it is a basic spatial node with a different UI.

40
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,810
That's all this is.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,260
Okay.

42
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,460
So it does.

43
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,960
If I take a look at the documentation.

44
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,080
It literally inherits from spatial, it's spatial with no other stuff.

45
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,440
It's just there so that we can work in the editor, see what's happening.

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,750
Let's come out of preview mode right now.

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,770
We have a position, 3-D.

48
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,780
I want to call this bowl stop a bowl spot because the bowl will actually small and that's just starting.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,600
And let's move that up to where the bowl is now.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,530
Be a little bit higher.

51
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,300
And that's where that lives.

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,500
I won't make too small.

53
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,520
I will make.

54
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,770
Position three.

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,180
I'd call it player one, stopped to duplicate that and call it player two stopped.

56
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm naming them the same so that we can use that trick of taking the string.

57
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,720
That's the name and bringing in the player I.D..

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:26,930
Right.

59
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,830
That's gonna be really useful.

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,930
It.

61
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,100
OK, so let's get the transform of Pleyel one.

62
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,980
Minus five one.

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,020
And let's move the plan would start to this transform.

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,630
Minus five.

65
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,880
And one, OK, so I went do the exact same thing was planned to start.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,520
And I'm going to guess this is five one.

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,250
We also know we're going to need a timer.

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,390
Let's bring out Timon and.

69
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,120
And let's set this up.

70
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,070
It's gonna be a one shot.

71
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,690
When you say zero, it's going to stop.

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,490
Give me a five second timer.

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,850
And then these signals that generate a signal for it on time out.

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,960
And this will go to the game script.

75
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,460
Brit.

76
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,940
So on time out, we're going to reset the pitch.

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:26,300
OK, for resettling the patients, make a function that others a function reset, which, as I say,

78
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,370
this is not just the patients being reset while it is reset pitches.

79
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,380
Fine move will stick with that.

80
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,030
OK, first, let's get the bullet's position.

81
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,380
So.

82
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay.

83
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,860
Now, I could move the plasma bowl in this function, but that's not a great idea.

84
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,750
The ball needs be responsible for the ball.

85
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,610
Is the player's need for response for the players.

86
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,720
So instead we're going to use a group code.

87
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,370
Okay, so let's get Tre.

88
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,190
Dalt Coal Group.

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,650
We haven't named this yet, so I'm Nikola's.

90
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,640
What are they, the actors that agents that things that move in the game?

91
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,380
Game pieces.

92
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,450
As opposed to scenery.

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,770
Right.

94
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,340
Game pieces.

95
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,400
And we're going to call reset.

96
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:18,030
OK, so now let's make a group called Let's add the both players and the ball to the group of game pieces.

97
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,740
Said play one to the game pieces and play two game pieces.

98
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,190
Three.

99
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,290
Now, the ball also needs to be in that group.

100
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,790
So let's add you to the game pieces.

101
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,320
And now they match the groups only go one group.

102
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,820
And if I just double check all play one.

103
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,910
Player two.

104
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,770
Fantastic.

105
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,890
So we now have three things in that group now because the ball doesn't yet have a script.

106
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,540
We have to add that I and double check.

107
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,210
We want a function called reset.

108
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,400
It's okay to go into the main bowl.

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,690
So the thing that everything else is instant's from and we're going to add in a bowl dot G.D. and let's

110
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,440
give it a function.

111
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,260
Function.

112
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,860
Reset.

113
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,230
Function reset, and it's also gonna need a variable.

114
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,840
It's going gonna have to track where its spawn is, gonna call it my spawn.

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,510
Now, this is going to have to come in when it's ready.

116
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,130
And if I just double check the level right now, the ball is coming in before the stop position.

117
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,910
That's nugatory some input stock positions right at the top above the pitch.

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,410
I want that to come in first.

119
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,460
Okay.

120
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,240
So in the bowl script, let's settle already function.

121
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,810
What do we want to happen right at the beginning?

122
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,330
Well, we need to find that node that set mice.

123
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,570
Let's set my spawn, my spawn.

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,860
And that's going to be wherever that node happens to be.

125
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,640
Well, let's find it.

126
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,800
Let's go to interlacing tree.

127
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,170
Right.

128
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,470
So we're getting centuries ago right into here and then getting roots go right to the top.

129
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,880
And within that, I want to find note.

130
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,150
And we want.

131
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,160
What do we call it?

132
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,520
List.

133
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,300
Spell check.

134
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,590
You're in stock positions, bull spawn.

135
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,610
And it has to be written exactly as it is that.

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
And I do want this to be recursive.

137
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,260
I go into every folder and just double check.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,330
We need one more argument, it's take a look at that is is this owned by me?

139
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,050
No, it's not.

140
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,530
That's fine.

141
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,210
So we can put false for that.

142
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:31,920
OK.

143
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,710
So when the game starts, it's going to set the variable my spawn to be that position node.

144
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,000
Right.

145
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,150
So not the translation.

146
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:39,990
The actual note.

147
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:40,500
OK.

148
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
So on reset, what's going to happen.

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,060
Well we want to set translation.

150
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,840
To be my spawn.

151
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,020
Dot translation.

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,780
OK, so if this is right, when this is so, what's gonna happen is we're going to call the reset function

153
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,230
and it's going to move to wherever that position is.

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,820
That means we can move this around, have multiple kinds of levels or from one tweak in minutes to Hymie,

155
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,510
that's too low.

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,410
Maybe I don't want it.

157
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,350
The center, wherever it happens to be, the game will adapt.

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,980
And I like that.

159
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,600
Let's go back to the bull script.

160
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,690
I want to stop the bull from moving.

161
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,180
So if I saw the ball moving, I can use the rigid body, which this is right.

162
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,880
This is a rigid body.

163
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,830
It has a thing called an access lock.

164
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,350
Now we've got angular X, Y and Z.

165
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,370
That's how much it rotates.

166
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,990
That's gonna make no difference to us.

167
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,260
It's a ball and it's not it's rotation doesn't really matter.

168
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,430
But the línea.

169
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,130
How much is it moving in each direction that matters.

170
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,780
So we need to make sure that when the game is reset, all three of these are unlocked.

171
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,090
To do that, let's go.

172
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,580
Axis lock.

173
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,530
Línea X equals false.

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
This is remember when we reset the pitch?

175
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,250
This is being unlocked.

176
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,150
We've already locked.

177
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,930
It wouldn't do that minute.

178
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,410
I want to get it three times with control, be x, y and set.

179
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,440
Awesome.

180
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:10,610
OK.

181
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,900
So that's the unlock.

182
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,390
However, I also need a freeze function.

183
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:14,540
Right.

184
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,440
I need to do the opposite.

185
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,410
So function freeze.

186
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,210
And I was going to take this.

187
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,920
Axis Lochlyn here, that equals false climate change to true.

188
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,540
And let's change it to X and duplicate two more times Y and Z.

189
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,540
Right.

190
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,620
So we also need to call this freeze function.

191
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,300
So when the goal is score, we need to call freeze.

192
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,540
To do that is going to level into the game script.

193
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,790
We've already got this goal detection thing happening.

194
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:44,990
Right.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,690
So let's go get tree one fact.

196
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,920
You know what?

197
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,930
We just duplicate this lifeless duplicate line fault.

198
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,630
Toby, move, move, move.

199
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,860
And it's sort of calling reset.

200
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,100
We're going to call freeze.

201
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,950
Awesome.

202
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,620
That is gonna be quite useful.

203
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,270
That's gonna lock all three pieces.

204
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,370
Now, it's not gonna start the timer.

205
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,420
So let's start the timer,

206
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,840
which is timer dot start.

207
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,000
And now we can use this time it's time out, right?

208
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,530
Well, that's just gonna be a reset pitch.

209
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,780
We've really got this function in here.

210
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,260
Okay.

211
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,220
Now, as I look at this, I realize that, OK, we have this lovely function.

212
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,160
That is exactly what it says.

213
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,300
But it's one line of code.

214
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,660
We have this function that does exactly what it says and it's the same line.

215
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Honestly, we probably don't need that function.

216
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm going to move this down to here.

217
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,470
Get rid of reset pitch entirely and get rid of that function.

218
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,870
OK.

219
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,700
Let's see if this works.

220
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,550
We have a lot at play.

221
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,110
But if we score goal posts, which is not how I love to score, go on.

222
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:44,930
Score goal.

223
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,180
If I show frightening incompetence, my own game.

224
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,490
Thank you.

225
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,620
There he is.

226
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,470
I get the ball.

227
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,280
It's frozen.

228
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,130
Five seconds later, the ball will come back.

229
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,030
Come back.

230
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,020
The ball will come back.

231
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,070
Okay.

232
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,700
That feels pretty good.

233
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,720
Now it's not the players.

234
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,880
So locking the players that will have to go into play script.

235
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,080
So let's open one of the players.

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,180
Does matter which go into the template.

237
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,040
These guys are not rigid bodies.

238
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,710
They don't have access locked.

239
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,590
I mean, you can kind of get in there, but it's actually a little bit difficult to get in there.

240
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,320
So instead, we could use a variable.

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,790
I'm gonna make a variable.

242
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,070
Court can move and it's going to start as true.

243
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:39,300
So now function freeze is going to be can move he calls false function reset.

244
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,070
It's going to allow us to move can move Eagles troop.

245
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,070
Now, we also need to move them back that spawn.

246
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,380
But right now, I've got to freeze it.

247
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,250
Don't do anything.

248
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,500
So let's fix that function.

249
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Move.

250
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,330
All right.

251
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,390
I need to make sure and move and slide.

252
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,300
Only happens if you can move.

253
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,140
If I can move.

254
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,000
Move and slide.

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,350
I don't have to define can move because it's a boolean is either true or false.

256
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,060
OK, so if true.

257
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,890
Move and slide it false.

258
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,670
Do nothing.

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,330
Let's find out.

260
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,700
We're not gonna play as yet.

261
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,350
Gonna move that kick and.

262
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,720
Okay.

263
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,110
Now we're still animating a facing, but I can fix that.

264
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,420
Let's go over to doo doo doo doo doo.

265
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,190
An animating emotional length is great this zero and can move, then animate.

266
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,630
Hope can be with the scope and I'll face forward.

267
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
I mean, we could have them rotating like that, but I suppose a second line if can move.

268
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,820
So same exact test.

269
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,870
Let.

270
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,960
In and it hit it.

271
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,240
Oh, OK.

272
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,140
If motion length is greater than zero and can move.

273
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:54,530
Right.

274
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,730
So it's that exact test.

275
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,560
I'm going to move blew out the way.

276
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,830
I'm going to run forwards and everything freezes.

277
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,450
Now, we will put in some some stuff in there to make it look at the game hasn't actually crashed.

278
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:06,650
But that looks fine.

279
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,900
And it's going back in.

280
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,480
OK.

281
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,830
So all that works.

282
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,800
Now we need to actually move the plans.

283
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,490
Now, any of this is gonna be very similar.

284
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,900
We'll make a brand new variable called my spawn.

285
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:18,620
OK.

286
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,240
And we need a ready function, right?

287
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,180
We need to define this right at the beginning.

288
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,040
So let's put this right at the top.

289
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,450
I mean, we don't have to right at the top.

290
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,080
I like getting ready from the top because I happen right to begin to function.

291
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,970
Ready to do.

292
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,140
OK.

293
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,220
So my spawn equals.

294
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,100
Well, we already have the basics of this, right.

295
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,920
So we can go get tree get roots.

296
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,540
So get the same tree.

297
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,710
Get to the root of the century.

298
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,290
And now I need you to find the node.

299
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,950
With a specific name.

300
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,080
Let's take a look what his name is.

301
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,560
If I go into the level and into the spawn's, which are coming in before the players, we have player

302
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,220
one start.

303
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,300
Player to start.

304
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:01,720
OK.

305
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,530
So for this to work, we need to get the script into the player, Judy.

306
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,530
And I want to play.

307
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,680
And then we go to concatenated in so percentage.

308
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,000
S stopped.

309
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,480
Could also call it spawn.

310
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,100
But I didn't.

311
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,810
Now, for that to work, we need to actually use that percentage.

312
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,650
So let's modulo player I.D..

313
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,410
And it is recursive and it is not owned by this particular node.

314
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,170
OK.

315
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:40,360
So that will now define my sport, which means now on reset we have can move equals true and translation.

316
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,680
He calls my spawn dot.

317
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,840
Translation.

318
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,280
Okay, I'm asking for that just before I can move, I'd like you to move before you unfreeze.

319
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:00,420
I realize that having the same frame, but it just logically feels good and a small wipe there because

320
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,860
I managed to create a little bit of bug on my side while I was fixing the animation bucketed earlier

321
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,640
that I told you about.

322
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,310
Hopefully you don't have to, but if I press play, we should see a real moves correctly and like a

323
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,710
score, a goal and animal stops moving four, five and eventually be coming back about now.

324
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,640
Boop!

325
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,190
Ha!

326
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,560
Now we're not facing the right direction yet, but that's OK.

327
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,690
I'm pretty happy with that and I'm pretty sure that the players will start moving instantly.

328
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,330
That feels like really good progress.

329
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,500
So excellent luck.

330
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,750
And I'll see you in the next video.
