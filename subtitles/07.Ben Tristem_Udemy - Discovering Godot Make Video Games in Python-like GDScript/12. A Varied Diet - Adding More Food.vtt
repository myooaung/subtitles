00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.530
Hello again.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.290
Delightful God.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.750
People in this video.

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.620
We're going to have a very diet and more food or to put that a little more sensibly.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.720
We can turn that basic project we've created in two random food items.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.610
So let's get started by running straight in here and morning the Scripps holder.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.060
And if we take a look under scenes and ammo and under models you'll find we've got a bunch of things

8
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.370
in here.

9
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.350
Some materials some textures they go into as materials and some meshes we really care about the mesh.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.140
So there's a burger a cookie or a biscuit depending on where you're on the world cup cake doughnut a

11
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.760
hotdog an ice cream a soda and a milkshake.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.210
And yes this milkshake can bring all the boys to the yard.

13
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.590
But I mean leave that up to you is entirely your decision.

14
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.190
How many boys if any are brought to the yard by your milkshake.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.200
So if we go back up to the ammo you'll see we got a projector here and a new folder.

16
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:08.270
McCall this ammo models and this is the folder where we're we're going to save a different projectile

17
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.360
for each type of food.

18
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.970
Right so we've got a burger with a cookie.

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.870
When a cupcake by the end of this video whenever you press Fire God is going to pick a random food item

20
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.410
and fire that some things you should know.

21
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.160
They're not all the same size and in some of them the origin is in the centre of the model.

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.110
And some of it's at the bottom so you might have to do some tweaking.

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.090
Why am I saying you might have some tweaking because we're going to start with a challenge.

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.500
We're doing a challenge earlier than we normally do.

25
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.330
I want you to make more food you don't have to do all of them.

26
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.260
I'm going to do all of them but you don't have to make at least two types of food to far as I mean action.

27
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.950
And remember we want them to be in this fold.

28
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.780
The AMA models are also going to save them in here to get you started.

29
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.580
What we're going to be doing is doing a new inherited scene and the new inherited scene is going to

30
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:08.540
herit from ammo projectile a day and it's going save in here some pause the video give it a shot.

31
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.860
When you feel you got the feel of it or you've feel got the feel of it that's some great English right

32
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.430
there.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.030
When you feel you're in the flow and you understand what you're doing you've solved a problem you might

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.790
have unpleasant video come back or if you really conflict do all of them come back.

35
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.300
But either way pause the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

36
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.240
And we'll come back.

37
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.050
I guess the first thing to do is open a baseline you inherit from projectile.

38
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.280
And as you might remember projectile is a simple mesh of a sphere with a coalition ship.

39
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.130
Now I've got different sized things to come in.

40
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.200
And if I resize the mesh instance or the collision shape it's going to resize for all of them because

41
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.630
this is inherited.

42
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.400
So instead I'm going to bring in a new leisz instance and I'm going to hide the original right.

43
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.240
I really use this as a reference size and this is going to be in models.

44
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.420
Let's start with Berger and we bring the bug.

45
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.970
And you see immediately the burger is not quite the right size but that's okay.

46
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.110
Now when I recite it so let's see one point twenty five How does that feel.

47
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.180
On point five point five.

48
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.920
Great.

49
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.260
It fills up a lot more if the collision shape and that's the size it's going to be.

50
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.140
Okay so I'm going to save this as burghardt says call that berga.

51
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.590
And save this in Ammer models.

52
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.700
Awesome.

53
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.330
Now going to repeat the same process so new inherited scene I'm inheriting from projectile.

54
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.870
And this one is going to have a new mash.

55
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.190
It's going to be the cookie biscuit thing.

56
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.230
Now that's much bigger.

57
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.550
Sumner transformed that down so let's say zero point fat

58
00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:01.560
and get rid of the original mash and that's too small so we're going to call that point seventy five.

59
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.790
Looking much better.

60
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.190
But look it's not quite centred it's off to the side there so the take off snap and just tweak it.

61
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.420
And you see where I'm going with this right so I'm going to speed up the video I'll do the rest.

62
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.330
Now I'm going to go crazy with a speed up but I'll try make it so it doesn't take too long and I will

63
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.470
work through all the rest of these objects up first before I do that first I at its core you keep safe

64
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.900
you and animals and a cookie for some reason and it's probably because I play Star Wars Galaxies for

65
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.480
I don't know nine years from my youth.

66
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.000
I always one spoke hooky with to ease as if it's related to a Wookie.

67
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.450
It's not.

68
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.630
It's confusing.

69
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.960
So speed up the video.

70
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.250
Well doing new inherited scene and stop the projector.

71
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.730
And welcome back.

72
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.520
Some of these I've had to recite to fit with this collision shape.

73
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.740
Some of them have had to move because their origin was a good example.

74
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.010
I think the cupcake example the origin actually the cupcake is good.

75
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:23.960
I mean the milkshake there is no shaikh's Origin is in its centre.

76
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.900
But what I wanted is answered all the projectiles to be the same size.

77
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.290
Right.

78
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.670
And that is why I'm sorry I'm giving a second meche to fit within this coalition shape.

79
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.070
Now when I fire it they will all be the right size.

80
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.790
I could have remove the collision shape from my original scene.

81
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.800
I can just remove the skeleton shape and given each one its glitter shape.

82
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.840
But I don't want tiny predict does enlarge projectiles apart from the else I want the player to have

83
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.850
an equal chance of knowing if something is going to hit them or the mpac or whatever they're firing

84
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.500
at or being fired from.

85
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.440
So this gives us a lot of consistency.

86
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.950
So now I have a folder with a whole bunch of ammunition.

87
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:04.610
Let's go into our scripts.

88
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.690
And if I go into character into the fire function right here I've got the projectile.

89
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.900
We're not going to be firing the projectile.

90
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.570
Instead let's make a brandnew variable and I call this family types

91
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.270
and I'm gonna make this a dictionary.

92
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.030
Now this could be an array but I prefer working with dictionaries because I find having a key and a

93
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.660
value really simple to use.

94
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.250
This is more from my personal debugging right so if I know that I've picked ammo 3 I can see what I'm

95
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.030
of three years now.

96
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.960
I could do this right now.

97
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:51.300
One is that copy that path or other m0 0 is a burger and I could do it's a new one with he one and a

98
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.650
cookie and a copy this and this will absolutely work right.

99
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.080
And just to demonstrate this will work.

100
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.030
Let's make this actually works a variable random not needle at random.

101
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:11.500
You taking some new exciting skill and discard bullet equals ammo types and what I want.

102
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.390
I want a random thing within.

103
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.660
So let's pick a random integer.

104
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:25.310
I do this second and I want to modulate by ammo types size or whatever the size of this is going to

105
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.240
modulate that.

106
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.450
Now for that to work I need to set a random seed rate if I want to call random.

107
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.350
I need to randomize the best place to do that is right at the beginning.

108
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.930
Let's do a function ready.

109
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.410
Actually I could do this on a tree.

110
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:44.500
The reason why I'm hesitating is ready will call when all the child nodes are done and maybe I don't

111
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.850
want that I could do this on Enter tree which would be like this would be the number script called Run

112
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.470
this immediately.

113
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.240
I'm actually go do a tree for now just to demonstrate that's all work.

114
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.850
But realistically in this case really would probably work OK.

115
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.200
So what I want to do ought to randomize randomise there is and I need to put brackets there.

116
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.480
There's a built in function.

117
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.300
Awesome.

118
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.670
So the moment we enter the tree going to randomize right now I'm sure the test with these two.

119
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.700
One more thing to do.

120
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.890
I'm not gonna load this scene.

121
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:21.120
I'm going to load random bullet so let's load random bullet as an instance.

122
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.970
Let's give that a quick test of space and I should have two types of thing.

123
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:32.940
I could fire dreich cookies and burgers and because I've got no protection of.

124
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.730
Because I've got no limit on how many I could fire at the same time.

125
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.380
We're kind of flooding the place with cookies and burgers and this will work fine.

126
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.370
Couple of things I don't like.

127
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.000
1.

128
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.770
If I keep adding all of these this is going to get huge and yes I could move this to a different node

129
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.450
and call it from there.

130
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.750
The other thing I don't like is what if I want to keep adding mashers or I want to remove one.

131
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.360
Let's say my teen decide they don't like this cupcake thing a little me for different cupcakes and remove

132
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.310
the ice cream completely.

133
00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.770
Maybe milkshakes aren't fanatic.

134
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.760
Why don't we make this easy for selves.

135
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.450
We make a brand new script.

136
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:12.170
So when you go into a file over here while I'm looking the scraps file new I will make a new script

137
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:18.160
it will going a place in scraps and I'm going to call this file underscore.

138
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.460
I mean with the mouse you could sort of call it file on a grabber.

139
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:28.820
Why am I making a file grabber because I'm picturing a script that can be loaded as a singleton.

140
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.000
They can be told here is your directory.

141
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.320
Go grab all the files and tell me what they are.

142
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.320
Okay.

143
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.760
Now we don't have to do it this way but let me tell you why this is awesome.

144
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.980
First we can easily add and remove food from the game.

145
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.780
Right.

146
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.970
If there is a file in this fall it's in the game and if it's not in the folder for whatever reason it's

147
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:57.360
not in and again Secondly this function we're going to be doing a few more times for example we're going

148
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.420
to do character customization and the way we're doing it specifically is applying a texture.

149
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.340
Well we could add as many taxes as we like and this will just go grab them.

150
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.170
We could do this with music we could do this a whole bunch of things.

151
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.680
Let's make this simple for us.

152
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.380
LS OK.

153
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.360
So I'm going to have file grabber before I even get started.

154
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.070
I mean I put this as a singleton.

155
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.440
I'm going to go to auto load and go find it in scripts.

156
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.400
Here's my file gabelich right now doesn't do anything with it enable it.

157
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.200
Vargrave it is going to have a single function.

158
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.190
We have get files and the whole point is I want to get files from a specific place.

159
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.070
Can I get an argument called falder all of this is going to be using file right so if I go look at the

160
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.640
file class we've got a whole bunch of stuff we can do here.

161
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.250
Some of this we've seen before.

162
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.780
Remember when we were loading and passing Jason's stuff some of us got very similar but I need a few

163
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.160
things the first thing I need to do is know what files a faults I'm only make something called him Dad

164
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.950
files.

165
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.910
And again I'm using a dictionary.

166
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.370
You could make this work with an array.

167
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:03.750
I prefer to work with dictionaries because that way I can use use the key I can pick a random number

168
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.620
within a certain size and work that way.

169
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.880
However you could absolutely use an array.

170
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.680
It's just a personal preference.

171
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.310
So we have our gathered files which is going to be a dictionary a dictionary requires a key.

172
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.490
Mike he is going to be the number of files I file count.

173
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.240
I'm going to start at zero.

174
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.010
Finally I need to know the directories and to make a new very local directory.

175
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.440
And that's going to be directory which is a class and directory can have new if I want to look up directory.

176
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.540
I can just open it.

177
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.350
And here's a bunch of things it can do including list directory beginning and all the other things that's

178
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.870
really caught.

179
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.510
We use a lot of fun things here.

180
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.360
Okay first thing to do is to open its list of directory open.

181
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.220
And are we opening.

182
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.300
We are opening the folder.

183
00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.280
Whatever argument I've got in open that as a director.

184
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.410
And remember you can look up here I will link to the documentation of a directory at a file.

185
00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.980
But for now this is pretty easy to read I think should be pretty self-explanatory.

186
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.360
Next I need to know is say okay start from the beginning of the directories So let's go directly dot

187
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.180
list.

188
00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:15.050
And the school directory begins a list from the beginning and that should be a list not a loser list

189
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.390
directory begin.

190
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.690
So what do we want to happen.

191
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.830
Well I want to loop through the directory.

192
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:20.280
Right.

193
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.870
While there is another file in the directory I want it to be checked.

194
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.180
Is this a valid file if it is put it in here.

195
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.140
And if it isn't Stop what you're doing now.

196
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:36.520
I'm not going to fall for this news old while loop and I'm going to use while true now.

197
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.010
Be careful with while true because in theory this could run for ever.

198
00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:47.750
So we need to put a stop condition and all this is saying is you will keep doing this while you can.

199
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:51.890
So we need some sort of break first thing let's do the file.

200
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:57.740
So what followed talking about the file is the next farm the rhetoric so directory DOT gets the next

201
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.350
day.

202
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.660
So file is the next thing.

203
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.990
We started from the beginning with grad the first one.

204
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.180
I'm going to keep going.

205
00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.960
Let's start by checking.

206
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.330
Is there actually an x file.

207
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.000
So if the file has no name which will happen if there is no farce.

208
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:18.520
If there is no file break another break us out of this loop if we don't have this.

209
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.590
We will go forever and ever and ever.

210
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.720
And don't forget this is double eagles.

211
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.040
Why.

212
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.660
Because I am checking a value not setting up value.

213
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.370
OK.

214
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.920
So we now have a way out of this loop.

215
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:35.390
The other thing that could happen is that the fact the folder is infinite the folder can't be infinite

216
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.820
because eventually we'll run out of disk space.

217
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.640
So I'm not too worried about that.

218
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.840
Okay.

219
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:46.210
One more thing that could happen is we could have something like an import file or a hidden file or

220
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.110
something like that.

221
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:55.570
So let's do an L if not file dot begins with.

222
00:13:56.110 --> 00:14:03.130
And if it begins with Dot What does this mean if the file name begins with the dot.

223
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.350
That's not going to happen on normal folders.

224
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.920
So as long as a normal file folder then add it to the get the files.

225
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.240
OK so let's gather files.

226
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.710
We need to add this to a dictionary so let's figure out what key to add it to what we have that that's

227
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.070
the file counts file count.

228
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.090
Equals.

229
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.220
And it's just going be the path and the file name.

230
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.210
Well that's easy which is default a plus file rate.

231
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.290
Finally to file underscore count plus equals 1.

232
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.900
And that will just grab everything in there.

233
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.350
One more thing we need to do another script.

234
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.270
Another function in another script is going to run this.

235
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.050
We need to pass the information back on to do it.

236
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.210
I'm going to go back to this indentation and return gathered files.

237
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.190
Be careful.

238
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.410
It has to be at this level of indentation if it isn't.

239
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:04.610
If it's say here look where it runs we're going to start this loop.

240
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:11.480
If there is a file and it is a valid file added to the dictionary immediately return it and that will

241
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.230
bring us out of this loop right.

242
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.400
So we all get exactly one file and that's useless to us.

243
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.660
If I put it here where does it run it's gonna run as part of an IF condition.

244
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.110
I don't want to try as an IF condition that's within this while true I want it to run when this has

245
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.680
stopped.

246
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.210
If it's here it'll run through this once no matter what happens.

247
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.000
It'll return gathered files we could get some really.

248
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.630
We get some really odd results here here.

249
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:43.910
It'll happen once this code block has finished the while loop will not let lines 18 and 19 run while

250
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.590
it's running.

251
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.710
So we will see.

252
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.600
We will run it when we can't run it anymore.

253
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.070
We all return gathered files to whoever call it and that's what I want.

254
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:52.630
OK.

255
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.110
So let's make sure this actually works.

256
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.300
So a random bullet is going to call from amoc types.

257
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.700
Let's make amateur types an empty dictionary.

258
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.810
And now let's set camma type so ammo types doing right here on a tree.

259
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.930
If I was doing it if I was using ready I'd use ready.

260
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.400
But I want to use a tree because I want it immediately.

261
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.180
Don't do anything else.

262
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.190
The moment you're ready.

263
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.770
Get this.

264
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:16.440
I want this amateur types filled first and what they're going to be.

265
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.350
Well I'm going to file grabber which is auto loaded so I know it's going to work and the function is

266
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.560
get files.

267
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.610
There it is now I just need the path as a string something at ammo.

268
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.670
I'm going to copy the path to the AMA models folder.

269
00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.440
Here's where it is and place it in.

270
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.860
And now if everything is good I press play.

271
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.420
Look at the facts.

272
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.150
OK so this is a little bit of work to be done.

273
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:47.910
I wanted a wooshing sound when we fire and I also want to limit how many times you could fire.

274
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.240
That's pretty easy I can do that with a timer and a future video.

275
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.820
But look we have so much colour and excitement going on.

276
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.230
This is awesome.

277
00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.970
I might need some brighter like as is too much blue going on in the shadow but I'm really happy with

278
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.370
that.

279
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.740
And that brings us to the end of the video in this video.

280
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.960
We've looked at how to scan a directory for files which is a really cool skill to have and it's going

281
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.790
to serve us quite well in future.

282
00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.220
We need to do this in a couple more scripts and with picked Rand more ammunition every time we fired.

283
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.490
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
