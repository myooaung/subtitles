00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,350
Hi folks welcome back.

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:10,760
Today we're going to look at how we could take that text that were printing out into the output where

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,700
only we're going to see it and show it to the player.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,880
To do that we can explore the rich text label by the end of this video.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,520
You can have this lovely background texture.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,310
And it's nice chalk style felt font and be able to display your story to the player.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,900
So what are we doing in this video to make that happen.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,670
Well to display the story in the game we need to learn how to import assets into godda.

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:37,550
If you look at the resources for this video you'll notice there's a zip file you can download X that's

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,540
for graphics.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,550
I included a basic blackboard or chalkboard graphic font and a button.

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,470
Today we're just going to be using the font on the blackboard and I show you how to create a background

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,350
texture.

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,620
This isn't a UI focussed video it's just to get you started and show you how to use it.

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,730
But later in the course I am going to show you all kinds of fun things you can do with you I think godda

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,710
we're going to look at how you can recycle the games displaying really create a rich text label and

17
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,880
going to update that rich text label in egd Script rich text label is the name of a node that allows

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,990
us to display text on the player.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,390
So let's get started.

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,120
Okay.

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,980
Here we are back in lonely lips.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,720
So far all we have is a node called lomie Lips.

23
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,030
Specifically this is a Node 2 D.

24
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,920
You can see that an inspector right here and it has a script.

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,650
When I run play dumb dumb dumb.

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,110
It's going to display everything we've done in the output.

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,810
However the players can't see the output what the players going to see is this and this is a boring

28
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,550
grey square kind of grey kind of beige.

29
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,600
Actually not sure what colour this is.

30
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,140
Let me know in the comments.

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,350
So what do we need to do to make this better.

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:55,130
Well the first thing we do is get a background texture so minimize gotta have already downloaded the

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,700
looney lips G affects dots up on ogan that and it's a folder that says defects which stands for graphics

34
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,250
select this right click on it and hit copy great back and it got out.

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,660
Let's get it on the output.

36
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,510
And over here in the file system I'm on the right click and do show in file manager.

37
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,820
This is going to open the folder that we created when we created this project.

38
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:24,060
Now I'm just going to paste and there is my g eFax folder inside you can find blackboard JP.

39
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,370
Two buttons and a font.

40
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,970
Great.

41
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,010
So I've put the folder in right place.

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,710
Now I gotta find a folder.

43
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,260
Well get back to God.

44
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,280
And it does it for me.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,300
I don't have to do anything.

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,110
There's our folder.

47
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,280
Fantastic.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,510
Anything that's in that folder.

49
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,410
If God can read it it will read unless you specifically tell it otherwise.

50
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,210
So let's open the defects folder.

51
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,030
So here I have a texture a blackboard texture chalkboard if you're from the U.S. maybe Canada not sure

52
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,770
blackboard if you're from the UK which I am.

53
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,430
So how do we get it here.

54
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,190
I need a new node.

55
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,500
So over here in the seed tree unhit plus and what no do we need.

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,930
Well I need a texture rectangle.

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,790
And there it is texture wrecked.

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,580
Look there's the description draws a sprightly texture inside a user interface can tile or not.

59
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,220
We don't need it to tile but we do need to be a thing.

60
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,760
So as a child of luny lips you can see the node texture rectangle.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,070
This child parent thing is important.

62
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,640
Every scene has a single parent.

63
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,630
Typically we call this the root node.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,300
Technically it's not the root.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,710
There is actually a secret root node just up here which we can access in code but we can't see.

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,580
So instead of talking about root Let's talk about the parent Luni lips is the parent and it has a child

67
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,160
of texture act and we could put a bunch more child and grandchild and so on.

68
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,750
I know that child's isn't the plural of child.

69
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,360
Going around with it is now child's great renamed texture rectangle to be a little less weird.

70
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,680
Let's call it black board.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,200
There it is.

72
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,020
Remember you can follow the convention that all nodes are going to have a capital first letter.

73
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,100
OK so we have our texture acting on Node called Blackboard.

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,610
I need it to have a texture first thing.

75
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,370
I can go over here to the inspector where it says no and load it in and that will work fine.

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:21,120
However it's kind of dull so it's clear that much easier way of doing that.

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,070
I can take my texture and just drag it over there.

78
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,790
Now there's this blue rectangle that is what the players going to see.

79
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,070
So we have all this texture not being used.

80
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,200
Let's make sure we have the right viewport size.

81
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:40,540
If I go to project settings and down here and display window I can change the width in the height.

82
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,480
I got mine at 10 8. 720 but we could do.

83
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,150
I don't know 10 days by 650 or whatever.

84
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,510
There's only one 720 but that's how you can change your default size.

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,320
I've also as resizable the player is all out to realize this window.

86
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,320
When I hit play.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,510
You'll notice that we only see part of the texture in this particular case that's not what we want.

88
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,080
I mean here expand which is going to allow the texture to be rescale.

89
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,790
And let's do scale.

90
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,110
Angela's shrink it down to about the size of the screen.

91
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,290
If you want to snap to view that's this thing you snap.

92
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,420
And we can even view our grid and I can bring this note right to the right place.

93
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,340
If you want to change the size of the grid that's got to be here under configure snap.

94
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,230
Right now it's 10 pixels by 10 pixels.

95
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,410
If you want that say l.a. 64 by 64 loops 64 that's 64.

96
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,390
I can maths that's how you do that disable the snapped a grid which is the grid with a little magnet

97
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,960
on it.

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,250
And let's hide the grid because we don't actually know right now.

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,080
Great.

100
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,260
We now have a background I now need one more note type.

101
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,830
I mean that a child of blackboards when blackboard.

102
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,970
I'm going to add one note and here I'm going to have a rich text label.

103
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,920
Rich Text allows me to do things like bold underline change colour.

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,850
And it's the best text label for what we have to do.

105
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,480
For now let's just make this nice and white.

106
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,300
In fact a re-enable the grid.

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,920
And set my grid to where did it go come back.

108
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,930
Let's go further 40 by 40 just like us.

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,010
And she going by 10 by 10.

110
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,530
Let's keep it as it was.

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,480
So I don't confuse myself which I'm quite good at doing and all that was quite close was there and found

112
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,170
out there.

113
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,100
OK.

114
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,170
We can now display text within this rectangle later in the course we'll look at things like how to set

115
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,010
margins how to get this to rescale itself all the rest.

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,200
For now this is great.

117
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,050
And let's get rid of these grids switch off snapping.

118
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,180
Fantastic.

119
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,190
Okay Rich Text label.

120
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,500
Well that would work.

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,350
But for now I'm going to call this story text so I now have a local story Tex.

122
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,930
And he only inspect under text.

123
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,470
I can write some place holder text.

124
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,760
Oh it's tiny in an ugly font.

125
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,100
So now let's get a fonteyn.

126
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,820
How can we get a font.

127
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,340
OK.

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,790
Inside the inspector I'm going to scroll down.

129
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,880
La la la la la.

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,690
Custom fonts under custom fonts.

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,260
I need a new normal font and it's going to be a dynamic font.

132
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,740
Then click on the word dynamic font and that'll bring you into this specific font.

133
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,140
You'll notice other settings sizes 0.

134
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,780
That's no good.

135
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,540
I was about to 35 that's pretty good.

136
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,480
And now I need a font again.

137
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,890
You can use this and loaded it.

138
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,030
Or you could just drag felt pen in.

139
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,040
There's felt pen the size of 35.

140
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,720
Does it work.

141
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,260
Let's find a

142
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,460
place old ATEX.

143
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,590
Look at that.

144
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,700
OK.

145
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,550
I need to set this text.

146
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,410
Something to go back in to my script and instead of print I need a way of actually setting the story.

147
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,900
So what can I use what I need to do is call the node story text from within the looney lips script and

148
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,070
tell it to change what's written under text.

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,880
Here's how to do that.

150
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,840
First I'm going to use get underscored no.

151
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,730
And it's going to give you a dropdown.

152
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,330
Actually I'm not going to do that because a lot of typing instead of get on the scale no.

153
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,250
I mean the dollar sign and here I can just type in that and there it is.

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,710
Dollar sign is a shortcut.

155
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,330
Forget underscore node brackets quotation.

156
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,690
You don't have to use dollar if you'd rather use get on a school node brackets quotation quotation brackets.

157
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,500
Go ahead.

158
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,930
I'm going to this.

159
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:10,190
So I have told it I'm doing something with this child that press dot and now that's having a bunch of

160
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,850
things I can do.

161
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,170
Well what do I need to do if I click on story Tex.

162
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,300
You'll see that mousing over this text file will say property.

163
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,430
Text the thing next to property or it says text.

164
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,620
That's what I'm going to type.

165
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,220
Because that's the thing I want to change.

166
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,130
So if I typed text equals.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:27,870
OK.

168
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:28,800
So what's it going to be.

169
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,270
Well we've already done that right storing percentage prompt.

170
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,850
So I press play now.

171
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,430
Once upon a time a yarn ate a pizza and felt very full.

172
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,310
It was a sad day for augered cabbages.

173
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,900
And look we've got it here in the output and here too.

174
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:49,670
I don't even need it here any uploading more let's just delete like six completely.

175
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,240
You'll notice that under here I'm using text and there's a different thing saying beeby code Beebee

176
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,140
code is what allows you to use things like bold underline or the rest of it.

177
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,490
Right now we're not doing that.

178
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,960
I can't put that in.

179
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,580
What if I wanted to use beeby code instead.

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,630
If I enable it how can I set it with BBB code.

181
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,820
Well that's my challenge for you.

182
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,450
I'd like you to use what we've just done instead of setting rich text label text.

183
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,390
See if you can figure out how to set the beeby code text in the script using the exact same story plus

184
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,580
percentage prompt.

185
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,830
So pause the video give that a go and then when you come back I'll show you my solution.

186
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,960
OK so the first thing I need to do is I need to figure out what beeby code is called.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,480
It's called beeby code underscore text.

188
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,720
So instead of text I want bbk code underscore text all lowercase that's important I get to make sure

189
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,470
that we're not cheating.

190
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,660
I'm going to comment this line out and then I'm going to do a dollar in it.

191
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
Give me a list of things I can use.

192
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,190
I'm gonna call this story text.

193
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:10,340
Note dot B E code underscore text equals story as a percentage prompt.

194
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,560
Simple as that.

195
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:18,880
See.

196
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,730
Nice and easy.

197
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,380
Which brings us to the end of this video.

198
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,290
We've covered some really good stuff in this video.

199
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,250
We've looked at how to create a background texture and indeed how to import assets into God which is

200
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,300
really useful.

201
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,410
We looked at how to resize our games display which are going to be using a lot in your future projects.

202
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,900
We've looked at how to use the rich text label note and how to change the properties of a child node

203
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,210
from within the script.

204
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,970
So a really good foundation we've now got something to show the players and in future videos we're going

205
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,980
to start adding the game logic where the player can type in stuff and change the story.

206
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,560
So great work and I'll see in the next video.
