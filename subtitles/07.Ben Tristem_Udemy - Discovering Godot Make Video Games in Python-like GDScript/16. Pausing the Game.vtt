00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.620
Welcome thank you wonderful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.110
We're going to pause the game to do this at this stage because as something that's happening which starts

3
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.370
off awesome but it's actually a little annoying.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.050
I'll show you what I mean.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.320
If I play the game right now I've got the mouse hidden right so I can look around and not be distracted

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.740
by the mouse but my screen is locked in tiny mode and I can't reach that button up there that one can't

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.110
reach it.

8
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.860
I want a big thing if I could pause the game.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.230
Maybe I could get the mouse back.

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.850
So let's do that before we start building this pause menu.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.440
Let's think about what we want.

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.710
So if this is our game screen here's a little menu with some buttons and you know it depends on what

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.550
operating system the buttons will be in a different place.

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.550
Here's what I want to happen.

15
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.210
I'm going to bring up.

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.830
Pause.

17
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.660
We're going to have some techs up here that says something like option menu or paused or something like

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.270
that.

19
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.270
Underneath I'm going to have a bunch of options.

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.850
I want some check boxes on the right and some options like table full screen.

21
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.160
What else you want to quit is a good one.

22
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.460
Customize and I could add more as I go now adding more as we go.

23
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.250
Is pretty easy.

24
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.450
I've how to do that goofy and to be honest I'm probably going to move quit and customize it around.

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.050
But this is my basic layout Now one more thing I want to happen is when I go into the pause menu I want

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.140
the mouse to reappear.

27
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.390
So here's a mouse.

28
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.020
And the mouse is back.

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.290
So when we pause there is a mouse and when we unpause there is no mouse.

30
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.830
Basically we like cats.

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.120
We like to have a mouse in our paws.

32
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.900
There will be no charge for that joke.

33
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.480
Its free and included with the course.

34
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.950
You're very welcome.

35
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.440
All right we have a basic lay out here.

36
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
So what I think I am looking at is a pop up right we've seen pop ups before we looked at them.

37
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.960
High slices.

38
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240
And this is a label that's nice and easy.

39
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.760
Maybe a rich text label and then we've got here.

40
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:09.520
Looks to me like a grid and the grid and the label are split vertically so what do I have.

41
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.050
Well I have a pop up.

42
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.980
I have a V box container within which is a label and a grid container.

43
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.710
And no I don't know why I'm switching from Upper to lowercase randomly either within the grid container.

44
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.990
We have a bunch of labels and check boxes or check buttons when they're called.

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
I will check what they called me in there and it just really a label check button label check button

46
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.440
and as many as we like and that is the design.

47
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.250
So let's get in so got to actually start making it.

48
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.100
First things first let's make a new scene.

49
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.860
No if my seeing is going to be a canvas why because I want this to present on screen.

50
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.240
No matter what else is happening at a certain location.

51
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.740
So ignore all position information ignore cameras just put it here on the viewport.

52
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.320
I recall it pause many and to capitalize em for menus.

53
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.510
Make it a little easier.

54
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.700
And underneath that and putting a pop up so the pause menu will be visible at all times but the pop

55
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.360
up menu below it won't remember pop up menus are hidden by default.

56
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.690
And if you want to work on them you have to unhide them just because it's unhidden now doesn't mean

57
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.010
they'll be visible in code.

58
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.590
If I put this pause menu in game now it will not shut.

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.110
You have to bring up pop pop up in code.

60
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.940
Okay so we have a pop up which I'm going to put with a full rectangle anchor and in the centre and I'm

61
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.910
going to have to tweak this later but this is just you know where I'm stuck with Within this I will

62
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.560
put a centre container and that's going to be the parent for everything else within the centre container.

63
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.990
Let's put a V box container and within that just put a label at this point we're probably going to have

64
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.500
to start playing with themes.

65
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.430
What we call this.

66
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.660
I think maybe option then splits as a good thing right.

67
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.950
We could call it pause men or something else and that's just not going to work.

68
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.060
Let's make a theme.

69
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.610
When I go back up to pop up and I'm just going to put the theme here.

70
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.290
If I put the theme here everything beneath it will follow that theme.

71
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.870
So a new thing.

72
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.450
Click on the thing and before I go any further I'm actually in a save this scene as default thing.

73
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.510
Why am I saving it now.

74
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.190
Well it makes it much easier to work with.

75
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.940
And now I can use this theme elsewhere.

76
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.450
Also if I've saved the theme rather than just let it run here I can now switch theme in script.

77
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.530
Right so we can have different Greece we can have different skins for our games all kinds of fun things

78
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.590
we could do.

79
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.820
Let's start with the default font.

80
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.780
So a new dynamic font that open that font and go to load under fonts.

81
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.560
Kenny bot.

82
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.200
There it is.

83
00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.170
We now have a font but there's no size to it so let's give a default size headers 20 pixels feel feels

84
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.890
pretty good to me we can always change.

85
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.710
Let's go back.

86
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.160
Next thing I need within the box container is a grid container

87
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.230
is my grid container and this is where our labels and buttons are going to be.

88
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:22.250
So are some of the label and this label is going to say Tomball full screen.

89
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.250
Now back up to the grid container.

90
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.580
A child of the grid contain a checkbox.

91
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.980
There it is.

92
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.580
Yeah.

93
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.880
Okay.

94
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.340
Problem we have is that everything is one column.

95
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.360
Why back up to great container.

96
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.400
I've said it to one column.

97
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.330
Let's set it to two.

98
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.240
Awesome.

99
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.020
Now I could just change the check box but I have a theme.

100
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.000
Go back to pop up.

101
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.510
Click on theme and if it were already in scenes so let's go into gooey and graphics and you'll see here

102
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.100
there's a handful of Kenny fonts that I've put in haven't put a bunch of them just a small handful that

103
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.650
are going to use so I am going to use X for checked and this empty square for unchecked.

104
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.750
I want to save that.

105
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.370
Go back out again.

106
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.430
That should look good.

107
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.210
Great select agree containments make a new label.

108
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.170
This one can say customize character which we don't yet having game but we will have a game and would

109
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.680
put a button for it now and let's put another check box in there.

110
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.800
And let's put quit in as well so label as a bell.

111
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.410
There we go and check box and this label is going to say quick game.

112
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.320
Few things you notice.

113
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.320
Well it's hard to tell.

114
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.630
This title menu option menu from everything else so have changed that minute to nothing is actually

115
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.450
centred and free.

116
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.300
We've got all white and no background.

117
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.040
Well let's fix the problems one at time.

118
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.800
First let's make this option bigger.

119
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.830
So let's scroll down to custom fonts.

120
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.920
Click on the label custom font and make a new dynamic font overwriting the field somewhere load the

121
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.040
same font in.

122
00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.770
We only have one font that's easy and then on settings it was 40.

123
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.990
Rates are much bigger.

124
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.690
Next thing I do is I a line.

125
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.940
This to the centre.

126
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:23.680
Now we can align these separately so if we wanted to take all three of these and apply them to the right

127
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:29.130
or to the centre or we could fill whatever you think looks good.

128
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.070
I think I want mine on the right.

129
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.270
Not actually sure.

130
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:35.560
I put mine on the right for now.

131
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.230
I think that's looks good now that's great too to sent a container and I want to anchor this to the

132
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:47.370
full rectangle and more importantly I need to centre it back and that's look much better.

133
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.960
However I knew the background.

134
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.750
So let's add in a colour rectangle as a background and I want this to be a direct child of the container

135
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.760
but above the V box container.

136
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:03.490
That's important because if I put it below here the colour is going to be on top of all the text and

137
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.070
buttons and this can be annoying.

138
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.640
Alright you need a collar let's say just off black is nice.

139
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.290
Great colour now.

140
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.490
Annoying things colour rectangles and are found is.

141
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.330
I can set this full rectangle leave and come back and it'll reset itself.

142
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.790
I think I need to give it a minimum size so let's do that.

143
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.390
What's your mission.

144
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:23.220
What's your size right now.

145
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.400
5 16 by two forty three OK.

146
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.010
So I'm thinking by the 440.

147
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:32.240
By 260 sounds good.

148
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:40.690
So for 40 to 60 you know there should be the minimum size minimum size of 440 by to.

149
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.860
And now Carla rectangle is going to have to have the same in size 440 by 260.

150
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:47.340
Great.

151
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.310
Let's put you back in the centre.

152
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.910
And that is starting to look pretty good.

153
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.490
Now we can mess around with it.

154
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.800
But for now that's a good start.

155
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:03.450
One thing I do want to do I like this option many semitransparent So let's just take the Alpha and drop

156
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.250
it to about a hundred forty six point fifty two.

157
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.630
That feels like a good round solid number the kind that any sane person would come up with.

158
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:13.080
OK.

159
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.430
I don't know why I came up with that.

160
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.580
We could keep tweaking this and playing with this but this is a good start.

161
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.120
I'm kind of happy with this for now.

162
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.300
However what I have right now.

163
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.380
Angela save it.

164
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.470
What I have right now is a pop up menu with no script.

165
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.950
There is nothing that's going to call this.

166
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.650
So let's make a new script.

167
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.500
And I'm going to put this in scraps.

168
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:41.070
As you probably know by now and just call it pause me and that's all good.

169
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.340
I want pause to be bound to escape.

170
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:50.320
So before I get any further I'm going to project settings input map and a miller put escape and then

171
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:58.670
add that as a key and the key is that you know what that's a terrible name let's call it pause pause

172
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.630
you add that.

173
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:05.240
And at the key escape.

174
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.640
All right.

175
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.050
So let's begin with input.

176
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.600
Amscot say if input dot is action pressed

177
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.230
pause.

178
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.200
Okay.

179
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.330
What I'm looking for here is the ability to pause the game for that.

180
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.260
I'm going to use get tree.

181
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:42.260
I will look at get tree in again a seen tree and I can scroll down we have down here where they go.

182
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.330
There we are paused.

183
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.050
OK.

184
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.360
Is paused or just paused and that's what I need.

185
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.630
Get tree.

186
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.840
Dot paused.

187
00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:02.030
He calls you going to fix this in a minute I'll get what this is going to do is stop all process and

188
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.360
physic processes.

189
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.150
Okay they will just stop until Pausa switch off.

190
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:15.970
Fun fact if I press this I will pause the game and be unable to unpause it because of a couple of things.

191
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:25.160
The first is if I look at any node down here you'll see paws inherit all child nodes are going to inherit

192
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.350
whatever I do here.

193
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.140
Okay so if I pause everything beneath it will pause.

194
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.470
So in level 1.

195
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.640
In fact in the default.

196
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.980
Also I'm going to click on this scene here and go into a little template.

197
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.890
I'm going to add a pause.

198
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.610
Many subs cannot.

199
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.530
In instance n pause many.

200
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:49.690
And what I want to do on pause menu is go to process.

201
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.680
This means pause menu will keep running even if nothing else does.

202
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.540
And that means that I can press the button.

203
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:03.480
However look right here I have nothing here to unpause.

204
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.010
There's a few ways we could change that but I'd like to pass this to you.

205
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.780
I'd like you to toggle pause.

206
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:16.210
In other words if the game is paused and I press Escape I'd like it unpause if it's unpause and I press

207
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:16.870
Escape.

208
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.720
I want your report so whatever is happening right now for press pause do the opposite.

209
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.260
So pause the video.

210
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.560
Come up with a solution you have it with and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

211
00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.580
And welcome back.

212
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.340
It's a few different ways we could do this right.

213
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.740
We could say if pause equals truth then do this or we could do this.

214
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.050
Check this out not get tree dot paused.

215
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.240
In other words whatever this is do the opposite.

216
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.990
One line of code.

217
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.370
Let me show you how that works.

218
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.550
I'm going to Pressplay.

219
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:02.230
Pause pause pause unpause pause unpause.

220
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.830
I'm so happy right now.

221
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.300
Look at that one line of code to do the whole thing.

222
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.840
If you have a booleans state truffaut's state one thing that can only be one of two options.

223
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:14.750
Just putting this exclamation point.

224
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.640
This not in front of it.

225
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.960
We'll just invert it.

226
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.150
It's such a lovely little trick.

227
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.240
Now I want to actually bring up the pop up menu.

228
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.870
Let's go back into this scene so we have the right script.

229
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:31.570
You know to close that one and I'm make a new function called toggle pause menu.

230
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.570
Pause menu.

231
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.380
COOK No.

232
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.870
I almost got it right.

233
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:51.210
Menu counselee an talil Pause me and here's me.

234
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:58.000
If you get tree dot paused.

235
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.800
Pop up got shut.

236
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.670
Else pop up.

237
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.800
DOT.

238
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.800
Right.

239
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.600
Now there's fewer few we could do this but this feels nice and clean.

240
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.250
I also need to bring the mouse back.

241
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.210
I'll show you why right.

242
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.150
Let's say I bring this up.

243
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.230
Pause again.

244
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.420
Here's my mouse menu.

245
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.130
Oh no there's no mouse when to make the mouse appear.

246
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.450
Right.

247
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.490
But that's looking pretty darn lovely.

248
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.070
OK.

249
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.250
So let's bring the mouse back.

250
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.080
Well we've already looked at how to bring in a mouse right because we do it right at the beginning of

251
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.830
the game.

252
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.740
So let's do the same thing here input.

253
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.650
Set in mouse mode.

254
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:47.000
And I need input dot mouse mode visible.

255
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.690
That's exactly.

256
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.840
And now where do you get that line and move it down here instead of mouse mode visible.

257
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.120
I want to mouse mode captured.

258
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.400
OK.

259
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.780
Let's see how that works.

260
00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.770
Pause the game here is my mouse.

261
00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.990
Boop.

262
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.760
Awesome.

263
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.720
These are different sizes.

264
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.730
That's a little annoying I can change that later.

265
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.470
And now I can make this bigger.

266
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.730
Now that's not in the middle.

267
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.290
That's okay I can fix that later too.

268
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:13.360
But we're getting on to a good start.

269
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:14.660
Okay.

270
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.600
Last thing I want to do before we start worrying about buttons and polished all the rest is rename these.

271
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:25.700
They're little more sensible so I'll say fullscreen.

272
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.300
Customize.

273
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:31.940
And quit.

274
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:39.030
And now I need to connect all three of these to the the actual scripture when we get a mode on pressed

275
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.800
can to pause menu.

276
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.490
So on fullscreen pressed what to do here is news.

277
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.740
Oh s stopped window.

278
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.370
Full screen.

279
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:53.560
Oh yes.

280
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.950
Means operating system window fullscreen and I could set this a true.

281
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.440
All I could go not o s dot.

282
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.460
Window full screen.

283
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.050
Let's see how that works.

284
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.770
We also have a customized button right now.

285
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:17.640
This does nothing.

286
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.070
Let's put in a quick one.

287
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.560
Was this going to do is going to do get tree dot quit.

288
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.030
Now.

289
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.090
A pause again.

290
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.800
Got to quit.

291
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.110
I quit the game.

292
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.200
Pause the game.

293
00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:39.440
I'm going to customize.

294
00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.330
It does nothing.

295
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.110
Emily All fullscreen a topless full screen and I can pause the game looks pretty good.

296
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.380
It looks kind of awesome in fact.

297
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.200
Which brings us to the end of this video.

298
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:56.990
In this video we looked at how to use get tree paused and a simple and nifty way to toggle a billion

299
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.590
in code just using an exclamation point or an exclamation mark depending on what part of the world you're

300
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.590
from.

301
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.130
It's looking really good so far.

302
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.790
Did you come up with a different solution.

303
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.590
Does your pause menu look better than mine which let's face it is entirely possible.

304
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.350
How is your game looking so far.

305
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.350
Share your progress.

306
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.860
I'm dying to see what you guys come up with an excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
