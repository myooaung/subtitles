00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.010
Welcome back you wonderful people.

2
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.990
Today we're going to introduce ourselves to God.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.100
We've installed our machines we've understood how the Course is going to work.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.200
Let's actually get into the engine.

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.610
Now there's a tradition when we start a new programming language or a new engine.

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.360
The first thing I'm going to do is make it say hello world.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.200
So that's what going to do.

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.140
We're going to introduce ourselves to God to do this.

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.830
We need to start a new project and we need to make it say hello world in the console.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.930
So how do we do that.

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.750
Well if we go over to the desktop This is my nice lovely new desktop.

12
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.590
I've put a shortcut to got up here in the corner I'm just going to open that because I'm not open it

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.700
through Steam.

14
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.530
I don't have a bunch of projects and assets in here because it's empty I have nothing actually attached

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.130
I've got it right now it's going to say do you want to open the asset library.

16
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.180
I don't the press cancel.

17
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.970
If you open it and Stephen this is going to be full of stuff.

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.720
Either way it doesn't matter because what we're doing is starting a new project.

19
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.640
So I'm going hit new project and see an error.

20
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:12.240
Why am I seeing an error because it got all projects have to start in an empty folder so I'm going to

21
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.400
go to browse and I'm going to find my repo's folder.

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.830
I like to put all of my scripts in a repo folder.

23
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.340
That way I can find them easily to all my God projects are going to be in here.

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.280
I was like this folder and I'm to give it a new name.

25
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.320
It's going to be called hello got no and am hit create folder read error has gone away the green tickets

26
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.730
here.

27
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.100
Create an edit.

28
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.260
And here it is go in all its glory.

29
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.290
If I hold down the right mouse button I can look around.

30
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.340
We now we're not going to be messing around with 3D too much yet.

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.070
This can come later in the course.

32
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.480
First let's take a quick look up the top here.

33
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.950
You see 2D 3D script an asset library.

34
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.540
So to me is the two dimensional view.

35
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
This blue rectangle Here is what the player will see.

36
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.230
You can alter that and settings will get to that 3D view as you can imagine is the three dimensional

37
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.750
view.

38
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.510
The script is where any script you've got loaded will show and the asit library is where you'll find

39
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.400
asset's there like the Unity store or anything like that at the moment.

40
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.650
It's still under development so we're going to go back to 2D.

41
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.100
Let's take a quick look at some other things.

42
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.910
On the left hand side here is the file system.

43
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.910
Now the empty folder we made is this route folder.

44
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.940
We can make new folders in here and call it each folder and it'll show up and anything that I put into

45
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.030
this folder in the drive is going to show up in God.

46
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.430
So any asset it can read any script anything like that I can put it's the following This is where I'll

47
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.080
find it.

48
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
It begins with just an empty icon and a default environment.

49
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.540
On the right hand side we have this scene navigator.

50
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.360
This is where the node tree will live.

51
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.340
God works with scenes and nodes.

52
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.710
And we are going to cover those in quite a lot of detail throughout the course today.

53
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.980
Let's just say that a node is a basic building block and a scene is an object or place underneath that

54
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.600
is the inspector.

55
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.170
The inspector is where we can tweak values without having to go into the script it can get ree's full.

56
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.920
If I want to move around in order to leave you I can use these nice scroll things or I can press the

57
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.590
middle mouse button and move the mouse around.

58
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.730
I can use control to zoom in and out.

59
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.120
The other thing we need to know is down here we will see output debugger audio animation.

60
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.230
This is contextual but output.

61
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.520
This is where our consoles going to be.

62
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.810
That's the bit that we're going to print.

63
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.780
Hallowell too.

64
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.170
Now if we want to print helo world we need a script.

65
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.530
We need the game engine to have some behaviour to follow.

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.660
But in God you can't just run a script by itself.

67
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.450
Scripts sit on top of nodes.

68
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.350
A node can have one script and a script that has no node isn't going to do anything.

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.450
So we need to create a node in the scene tree.

70
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.820
Were going to click this plus symbol that's going to create a new node and every single node that comes

71
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.710
with goes in here.

72
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.670
A quick tip.

73
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.360
Blue is 2D.

74
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.440
Red is 3-d at the moment.

75
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.950
Let's just make a node 2.

76
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.680
One of the simplest possible nodes we hit create and there's my note to deep.

77
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.260
I'm going to left click on it and I can read rename it let's call it Greta.

78
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.600
Rick we have a simple node we can now attach a script to attach a script.

79
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.630
I'm going to go over here to the top right with this little scroll with the green plus symbol the scrolls

80
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.420
the script the pluses a plus plus script click it.

81
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.290
And here we go.

82
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.280
G.d. script.

83
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.470
And I don't need to change a thing let's create it.

84
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.630
Here it is.

85
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.290
Here's our first script.

86
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.750
If you want to you can control the mouse we also make the font bigger or smaller.

87
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.170
Put it nice and big so you guys can read it easily and you can even use this expanded box symbol on

88
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.450
the top right for distraction free mode.

89
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.960
There's a shortcut for that by the way control shift and F 11 gets you in a now this mode.

90
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.270
I really like this mode.

91
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.350
OK.

92
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.600
So what have we got.

93
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.660
We have a script that there's mostly comments.

94
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.120
Anything with this hash or pound symbol at the start is a comment and he put one there.

95
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.120
God will think it's for the user not for the engine and will ignore it for now.

96
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.840
Let's delete all of these comments.

97
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.650
We don't really need them.

98
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.370
So what am I looking at.

99
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.470
Well Line one extends notes 2D.

100
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.970
That's just telling the script what kind of node it's behaving like what class it's sitting underneath

101
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.610
we have a function we'll talk about functions a lot throughout the course but this function is quite

102
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.000
common.

103
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.620
This is a built in function function ready function ready means the moment this node enters the scene

104
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.430
the moment you start do this.

105
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.100
And underneath we have pass pass means do nothing.

106
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.510
So here's what a script to say the moment you're ready do nothing at all.

107
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.290
Let's see if that works.

108
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.330
A hit play is going to say Oh you haven't saved the scene shot save the scene.

109
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.370
And his game.

110
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.070
And it does nothing.

111
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.370
Which is fantastic is exactly what we expected.

112
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:32.840
By the way there's a difference between a dynamic language like God which is based on Python and static

113
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150
languages like C++ and C sharp.

114
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.150
If you're used to those static languages you might be wondering Dude Where's My curly brackets right.

115
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.350
You want to see that.

116
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.780
Or depending on who you are you might want to see that curly brackets don't mean code block in golf.

117
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.780
In g.v. Script curly brackets have a different meaning and they're not useful here.

118
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.930
In order to highlight a code block that's a section of code that is going to sit within a function or

119
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.960
something else.

120
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.390
We're going to use tabs indentation is everything.

121
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:13.110
So if I make a bunch of passes in other words a script that does nothing for times.

122
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.880
What matters is this indentation here.

123
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.740
As we move along and add more things to our function we can start indenting within it.

124
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.200
And what this means is this pass here has these things within it.

125
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.110
Now clearly this doesn't make any sense.

126
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.110
I want to get rid of that but just bear in mind if you're used to the curly bracket convention of C++

127
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:41.010
or C sharp or language like that then the code block is defined by the indentation not the curly brackets.

128
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.510
So we need a script to say hello world.

129
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.620
For that I'm going to use the print method.

130
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.350
Print with some brackets.

131
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.180
What does print do print moves things down here into the console.

132
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.710
By the way if you're ever stuck with something does it hold control.

133
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.760
And click on it and it'll bring you to the documentation.

134
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.280
The documentation for God is in the engine which is wonderful.

135
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.130
It really makes looking things are easy.

136
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.730
So I'm going to close this.

137
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.790
And I'm back in my script.

138
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.940
You know notice by the way Brady the function ready is here.

139
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.170
If we have a whole bunch of functions that all show here and we can use this to jump between them like

140
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.180
bookmarks.

141
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.640
OK.

142
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.270
So what you want to print we want to print a string.

143
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:35.110
A string is a sequence of characters letters numbers spaces punctuation that means something to us as

144
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.730
humans.

145
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.240
But that God isn't going to worry about.

146
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.560
So inside this I right.

147
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.080
Hello world.

148
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.060
And that's our string a string is a sequence of characters letters numbers punctuation.

149
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.510
God doesn't care what they are it just tries to mimic them.

150
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.170
It's a bit like a funny Ben to say happy birthday in French.

151
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.570
I don't need to teach in French.

152
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.660
I just need to say say you are you and you that's it.

153
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.530
And then come repeat that sound.

154
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.280
And it's fine.

155
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.020
Everything works by the way.

156
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:07.030
Now that there's something in this function I need pass I don't need to say do nothing because it now

157
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.810
has something to do that won't complain.

158
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.190
Well let's hit play because this is the second time we've run it got I will say do you want a default

159
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.720
scene.

160
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:16.480
Yes.

161
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.400
We only have one scene.

162
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.780
You can make that default.

163
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.340
And there it is in the output in the console is hello world.

164
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.060
Exactly what we want.

165
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:34.960
So far so good.

166
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.280
How about we make this a little more interesting.

167
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.010
Let's talk about the concept of a variable for first what is a variable then once described a variable

168
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.090
to me as a box.

169
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.870
It doesn't really matter what's inside the box.

170
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.240
It just matters what the box is.

171
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.090
So I'm going to make a variable here and this is going to be a string variable and were going to call

172
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.420
it person.

173
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.920
And we can put stuff in the box and got I won't actually care what that is.

174
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.610
It just needs to lift it.

175
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.310
Okay so here's God.

176
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.910
And it knows that's the box I need.

177
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.180
Move it from one end of the warehouse to another.

178
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.970
Why God is working in a warehouse.

179
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.710
I don't know.

180
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.110
Variables are a key concept in programming of any kind now.

181
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.240
I've written here a string bracket person and the way we would normally write this is we would write

182
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.280
a variable string.

183
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.840
Or however the syntax language works that it got so we don't need to do that.

184
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.500
All I need to do is tell it there is a variable.

185
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.400
And here it is.

186
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.950
God will automatically figure out.

187
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.580
This is a string variable.

188
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.530
I don't need to do this.

189
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.530
I don't need to define it.

190
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:02.560
I just need to say this is a string variable which is lovely because God was a dynamic language.

191
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.990
It can change what type of box This is auto magically.

192
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.260
That's not a real word but it should be.

193
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.610
And just to complete this image I'm a little bit more colour on it because Ben feels that three colours

194
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.140
is much better than two colours his two colours and I'm going to give it some lovely eyebrows to make

195
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.470
Sam happy and everyone's happy.

196
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.380
Fantastic.

197
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.530
So how can we make a variable.

198
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.590
Well I only need this variable to exist in this function so I'm going to put it right here.

199
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.880
Variable elzie person equals you.

200
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.760
OK.

201
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.340
So how do I make this work.

202
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:47.800
Well I'm going to come catinat it put this little Plus symbol here.

203
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.050
Right person.

204
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.720
I close my brackets.

205
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.920
Now you notice I've left a space here between helo and person and always good to say hello.

206
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.270
And the box called person and that's just to put the box there and let us read it.

207
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.150
So here we go.

208
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.240
Hello you.

209
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.040
Awesome.

210
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.880
Now if I didn't put that space there I would get this.

211
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.330
You know just help you.

212
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.530
Now one word.

213
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:19.450
The reason being because God doesn't actually try to make sense of the strings it'll repeat exactly

214
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.300
what you said.

215
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.500
And no way here that I say put a space inside uneatable of space.

216
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.520
At least there.

217
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.210
So now we come to the challenge for this idea.

218
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.560
I'd like you to modify our scripts it says what are we waiting for godot in the console.

219
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.680
If you don't like to see something else go for it.

220
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.090
But try and use at least one variable.

221
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.460
So pause the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

222
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.260
Okay so this is pretty simple right.

223
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.260
So first thing I change my variable to God.

224
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.830
And down here I'm right.

225
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.270
What are we waiting for.

226
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.930
Don't forget the space.

227
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.960
And that does it.

228
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.200
What are we waiting for.

229
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.250
So nice and simple.

230
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:19.390
Before we finish off this video a quick demonstration of how set your preferences if you go down to

231
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.970
the editor of press editor settings you'll notice that there's all these little things you can do in

232
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.520
the interface including the theme.

233
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:31.510
I like the default theme but if you want let's see the alien thing you can just apply that all very

234
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:38.800
dark and grim in lots of green and I don't like it if you like arkless have some arc doesn't look like

235
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.950
arc to me but I like the default.

236
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.910
You can also tweak your own colours.

237
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:49.450
There's also a lovely connection of keyboard shortcuts and I recommend getting to know these because

238
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.820
some of these are really helpful.

239
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.440
I'll show you them as we go through the course but they really do make life a lot easier.

240
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.830
So in this video we've covered some really key foundational stuff.

241
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.410
We now know how to start our project and got our we can navigate the interface we know how to start

242
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.700
a script we know how to operate a console which is going to be really useful when we're trying to hunt

243
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.070
bugs down our code.

244
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.750
We understand basic variables silly string variables and how to create them.

245
00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.970
And we know how to set up our own preferences.

246
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.540
It's a really good start.

247
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.070
Okay so that wraps it up.

248
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.350
I'll see you in the next video.
