How yanga to be a end of section hang out with you so what have they learn in this tiny section.

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.120
Well it sounds like not much but really they've figured out how to get the best version of God and for

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.560
them what their requirements are what it picked up they're figured out how to start a new project and

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.750
where the consolers which is key.

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.260
So then when we go from here.

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.280
Well I suggest that you start the next section straight away even if you don't you think you've got

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.140
time even if you only watch half of the next video.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.450
There's a psychological trick here which is that writers often suffer from writer's block that is they

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.030
don't know how to get them back into the writing context.

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.050
If you leave a sentence unfinished you're more likely to be go and finish that sentence generate that

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.620
easy initial momentum and then pick it up so so that you keep momentum on the course one at the straight

12
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.070
to the next video now leave it as soon as you need to leave it and just come back to it.

13
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.430
You're more likely to succeed that way.

14
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.350
So good luck and we'll see you in the next section.
