00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.550
Hello you fantastic go to people in this video we're going to make our first NPC for heist Meister.

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.770
We're gonna make a security camera okay.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.280
So what is the security camera.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.970
Well it's gonna be a most basic NPC.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.060
What I mean by that.

6
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.290
It's gonna have no movement code.

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.040
Security cameras aren't going to wander around the level they gonna stay in one place and just rotate

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.610
left and right and we're just gonna use a simple animation node to make them drift this way.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.960
Wait drift that way.

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.370
Wait.

11
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.070
Predictable movement there also to detect the player.

12
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.220
However we're not going to put player detection into the script in this video.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.490
We're gonna leave that for the next video.

14
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.130
And probably the one after Ryan minutes.

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.580
But there's probably two sections so that I can cover enough depth so that you know what's going on

16
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.000
with the code.

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.740
OK let's get into it.

18
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.810
First we need to make a new scene.

19
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.150
I mean to use a 2D scene and I'm going to call this camera could call it security camera feel like I'm

20
00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.470
calling it camera and what I'm going to do is I'm going to give this a sprite.

21
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.330
And if we look under graphics if got open here under PMG and on the tiles I've got lots of the tiles

22
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.880
from the sprite sheet separated out so we can use them.

23
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.260
I would be using this little TV thing as a camera.

24
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.070
Let me show what it looks like.

25
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.180
See that looks a bit like a camera.

26
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.100
However cameras rotate on the end of an arm.

27
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.700
So I don't do is actually make this an arm.

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.490
Why am I doing this.

29
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.730
I'm doing this because we're going to rotate the camera and leave the arm where it is right.

30
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.070
So let's make a child node of the camera.

31
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.100
And this one is gonna be a kinetic body 2D.

32
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.820
Why is it a cinematic body 2D.

33
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.780
Because at some point we're going to make this inherit a script and the script is going to inherit from

34
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.870
is going to be our character script.

35
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.670
Now if it's inheriting from template characters or G.D. it has to extend kinesthetic body 2D.

36
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.830
If I make this a rigid body or or basic node it won't be able to inherit from this script.

37
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.210
So little bit of future proofing I'm I make a kind of antibody 2D.

38
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.510
I won't name this camera body

39
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.880
and only that a sprite to and this Sprite is going to be tile.

40
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.910
Where did you go 536.

41
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.370
It looks pretty good.

42
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.570
Go to movement mode press W to do that and put you at the end there.

43
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.650
You know what I should hold shift while I'm doing that.

44
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.020
And yeah that's me the center.

45
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.560
And you know let's rotate you by pressing E and good.

46
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.930
I should probably have done that with the grid on let's just rotate you by 90 degrees okay.

47
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.620
That looks pretty solid.

48
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.440
Now the reason I've done it this way is if I were to do it just on the route camera load and rotate

49
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.340
it look what would happen

50
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.690
so I need to be rotating it around a pivot.

51
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.700
It's also worth noting that the rotation that I'm going to be using is this one here.

52
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.410
This is relative to its parent.

53
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.390
So if I change this rotation here to 12 degrees and then go to the camera body this rotation is at zero

54
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690
because that's what it is immoral in relation to its parent.

55
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.510
If I put this at minus twelve that's what we get.

56
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.480
OK let's undo a couple times it's telling me I need the collision body.

57
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.300
Fine we'll give you a simple collision shape to.

58
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.960
I'm going to have to set that.

59
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:31.080
So you walk shape where a rectangle doesn't need you rectangle shape duty.

60
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.120
And I'm going to disable it.

61
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.330
We don't need it and let's hide it OK.

62
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.480
One more thing I do on add a torch.

63
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.940
So let's go back to our camera body and use instance a scene and just find our torch.

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.410
Great.

65
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.810
Can I just move that out pressing W. again.

66
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.830
Holly shift and the torch is live here.

67
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.060
Now what I'm not going to do is put any inclusion on the camera so it doesn't matter if the torch beam

68
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.350
is inside the camera.

69
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.030
I've also noticed little warning.

70
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.830
It seems that there's no texture on this torch.

71
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.520
Let's take a look and it looks like I did something very silly.

72
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.080
But if I go to the player scene and I look at this torch.

73
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.280
Yes what I've done is not set it on the route scene.

74
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.300
So let's put on a light map in here.

75
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.320
Light maps torch and offset on the X by 320 pixels.

76
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.690
Right.

77
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.480
Save that let's just leave that as it is.

78
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.000
Go back to our camera and it now has a torch.

79
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.260
A little hard to see but that's OK.

80
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.720
Can Save This under characters do you think we'll have another fold of NBC.

81
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.390
Let's get a hold of pieces and save it in there.

82
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.800
Awesome.

83
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.590
Now we need to do is bring it into the level to make sure that the light actually works.

84
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.780
Minimize the photos I'm not using and go to levels go to template level and let's just bring in a camera.

85
00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:04.550
So I'm going to instance in camera add his little torch and I can rotate it using E and that works fine.

86
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.010
He also knows the lights are overlapping.

87
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.580
That's kind of nice.

88
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.160
I've also noticed that the camera itself is above the wall.

89
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.430
If I place it here in the same tree it'll fit through the floor.

90
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.700
So I need to be a little bit careful where I place this what I might do is just tweak where camera body

91
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.970
lives.

92
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.050
I'm just going to move it whoops no one's going to move it or rotate it to about here.

93
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.270
Save that.

94
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.250
And back to our template level as looking a little bit better isn't it.

95
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.630
So let's put you right on the edge of the wall so you look good.

96
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.710
And I could probably scale that down a bit when you think let's scale it down not torched I need you

97
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.540
camera.

98
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:51.280
OK camera body I'm going to change the size of your sprite your sprite is going to have a transform

99
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.490
of zero point five zero point five.

100
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.880
That too small I might be okay.

101
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.700
Let's put you at two point seventy five save you take a look at the level nope too vague it's going

102
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:11.710
to be point five five point five and I'll clearly need to change the arm let's get a transform scale.

103
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.380
Point 5.5.

104
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.950
Nice.

105
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.310
OK.

106
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.290
Now I mean look at the level looking more like a camera you can play with a skip by the sizing and all

107
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.400
the rest of it.

108
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:27.700
So if you run this level we have a very basic camera that we can look at and we cast shadows.

109
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.560
And this person would cast shadows if you can move them over there.

110
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.930
Great looking good.

111
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.100
Well we don't have any kind of rotation.

112
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.080
Let's go back to our camera and under camera body you know what let's bring in the sprites we know it

113
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.990
is armor sprites camera arm.

114
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:50.830
Now arm sprite his good arm sprite it is on the camera buddy let's add a new animation player would

115
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.910
play a little bit of animation plays before they are kind of awesome make a new track and I'm going

116
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:06.200
to call this camera rotation now I feel like a 12 second track is good zoom out just how control and

117
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.760
use the mouse wheel there or you can use this little sliding scale I'm going to put you on auto play

118
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.090
on load and on repeat and when you a new track so add track and score to a property track what are we

119
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:23.310
moving we're moving the entire camera body and what do we want to actually change what we want to change

120
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.880
its rotation degrees admittedly I didn't have to do it that way I could've gone into camera body transform

121
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:35.520
and just hit the key right rotation good reason right here now right here we have this 12 second animation

122
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.310
so what I'd like to do is issue you a little challenge I would like you to get the camera rotating left

123
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:46.890
and right over a few seconds and I would encourage you to put a gap here and let it rotate left wait

124
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.750
a few seconds rotate right wait a few seconds it pulls a video when you're happy Come on back and I'll

125
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.530
show you my solution

126
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.030
and welcome back.

127
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.120
It doesn't do is set rotation so let's put a rotation in let's set you to minus 30 and it's at this

128
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.430
point I realize I've done something very silly so let's put it back to zero for now what's going on

129
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.640
here.

130
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.410
Well here is my Sprite.

131
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.060
Here is my camera body.

132
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.330
I move the sprite not the camera body like a sprite to position is there.

133
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.620
Wrong wrong wrong.

134
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.850
Go back to camera body.

135
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.510
I'm going to move all children boom.

136
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.280
Now the camera body will rotate from here.

137
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.450
The origin.

138
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.930
I could have edited that out.

139
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.290
You know what.

140
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.110
It's such a common thing to do such common mistake with keeping in great.

141
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.960
So now let's put you at minus 30 key.

142
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:49.170
Okay I will put my snap out one second and two second key I think so let's move you to the same place

143
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.950
put a key in there.

144
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.360
Awesome.

145
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.830
All right.

146
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:59.580
So I need it if it stays for two seconds and then it moves to the Center for two seconds and then it

147
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:06.400
moves to the right over another two seconds so let's put you as positive 30 OK.

148
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.900
So what's it gonna look like.

149
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.840
We wait for two seconds.

150
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.060
We start slowly rotating.

151
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.170
Great.

152
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:21.110
Now I could have put it here but then it's going from minus 30 to positive 30 over two seconds.

153
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.800
I don't want that.

154
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.400
I want it to go to zero in two seconds.

155
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.440
It's positive to 30.

156
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.760
Stay there for two seconds

157
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.910
and then one two three four.

158
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.340
So let's take a look.

159
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.130
But to do that I'm touching to speed the animation up a bit.

160
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.030
So we'd have to stay for him evidence double speed

161
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:45.850
very nice.

162
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.090
OK.

163
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.320
But the speed back to one.

164
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.850
This movie your original camera position.

165
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.230
Now when I look at it in level I can see that it doesn't look quite right.

166
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.370
So I'm actually going to just tweak this a little bit more because the center is in the right place.

167
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.570
But look at it.

168
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:07.030
But the camera isn't so smooth the camera body too right here say that.

169
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.360
Take a look at the level that looks more realistic.

170
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:15.220
Let's run the scene great so it looks better but now my torches in the wrong place.

171
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.570
Easy fix back to camera.

172
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.430
Where's my torch.

173
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:26.280
Torches there transform and I'm just going to move you back to twenty eighteen.

174
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.190
Not gonna drag it because this is at an angle and I'm going to type in the number eighteen looks good

175
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.790
sixteen Yeah.

176
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.450
Okay.

177
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:33.970
Run the thing

178
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.230
wrong scene.

179
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.470
Okay let's go back to the level and run that scene

180
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:49.660
and we have an actual camera and it looks like an actual camera and the actual sprite is still a little

181
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.730
bit big I could probably lower that a bit more but I'm quite happy with that.

182
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:59.810
One more tip I'd like to do inside template level I'm going to make a new simple note just a base note.

183
00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:06.260
I'm gonna call this camera's and I'm going to put this camera inside that.

184
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:13.820
And the reason to do this is now I can just add a bunch of new cameras and then look at them and I need

185
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.780
to tidy up the scenery when I've done so along here.

186
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:23.150
You know let's rotate you by this much because we're using this arm.

187
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.830
Remember we're calculating the rotation from its parent.

188
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:35.510
If we were rotating from the camera not from the camera body when I moved it all these cameras would

189
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.950
snap to that default position.

190
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.100
The moment the animation started.

191
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.240
So by not doing that we can now have our cameras facing us different ways.

192
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:53.030
Let's run the scene and we're starting to have an exciting little stealth game where we have any detection

193
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.050
in yet and we have this character who's not moving has a lot more light than I'd like but look oval

194
00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:03.320
overlapping light beings dynamic shadows lots of drama around torch which we probably won't use but

195
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.620
the gods certainly will I'm very happy with that.

196
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.300
Is this a blind spot.

197
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.190
Is this a blind spot.

198
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.290
I can't see me.

199
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.370
Yeah I think it's a great place to stop.

200
00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.750
So let's stop here in this video.

201
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.610
We've created a brand new NPC we've looked at rotating the camera and making sure that we're not using

202
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.030
the global rotation and we've paved the way for player detection.

203
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.800
And I think that's a really good place to stop.

204
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.900
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
