00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.250
Greetings glorious God.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.840
People in this video let's get the gooey really polished let's give the player some great feedback.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.100
To do that we need to do a few things first.

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.040
Let's actually connect the quaint counter.

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.950
We've got this lovely gooey let's make it so the player can easily see how many coins bunnies collected.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.520
Then let's allow Bunny to earn more lives every time Bunny collects X amount of coins.

7
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.830
And then let's make the life compulse where everybody is hurt or gets a new life and the coin I compulse

8
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.250
whenever bunny gets richer.

9
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.600
So let's get to it.

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.650
Here we are in level one.

11
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.730
And the first thing to do.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.430
Well I need to connect the coin counter right now is not doing anything.

13
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.360
So let's get into the gooey scene and it's a good script and the easiest way to do this is just to put

14
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.400
coins in as an argument.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.870
I'm doing them in the same order that they appear on the grid because it's just more sensible and only

16
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.770
to do is repeat what's underneath so what's underneath bachs there is quink at DOT.

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.940
Text equals scoring points.

18
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.480
I've also just noticed that the clear panel that was there before has vanished.

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.460
I'm not quite sure how I manage to do that.

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.670
I must have not saved correctly.

21
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.110
Anyway let's put it back in.

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.580
Actually let's do something slightly different.

23
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.550
Let's put in a child node.

24
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.160
That's a vertical separator and a Trace separator.

25
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.830
There it is and we will put it right there.

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.760
I'm going to give this a minimum size to Goodman and size.

27
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.180
How about 18.

28
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.110
Sounds good.

29
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.310
18 on the x axis maybe even 24.

30
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.900
Because I don't know why reasons.

31
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.240
And let's make it vanish under visibility and modulate it and put the alpha at zero.

32
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.260
Awesome.

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.980
So we know have these things in.

34
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.060
Let's actually go into game state and change update gooey so that it doesn't just past lives it passes

35
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.750
coins too.

36
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.010
Otherwise we can have a real problem.

37
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.560
Let's make sure that we're updating the gooey when coins are being picked up because currently we're

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.140
not.

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.760
And that's going to be very silly.

40
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.010
So update.

41
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.190
And that right there is the first thing off our checklist we have connected the coin counter.

42
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.700
Let's allow Bunny to unmoor lives how to do that.

43
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.580
Well the first thing I need to do is create a new variable and make a new export variable and I keep

44
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.880
these together and separate them with a line so export variables together variables together.

45
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.690
Was this going to be it's going to be quaint Tiger.

46
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.120
There we go.

47
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730
That's a good name for it and mcquain tiger is 20.

48
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.170
Actually now that I look at it coins target hawkwind target which is what I meant to say isn't a great

49
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.330
name because it's not immediately obvious what that means.

50
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.870
This person wrote him one of this.

51
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.090
How many coins for an extra life.

52
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.800
Okay so every 20 coins bunny gets an actual life.

53
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.080
Now how are we going to make that work.

54
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.670
Because we don't need the googie to subtract the quites we're not going to assay coins to zero every

55
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.960
time we get 20.

56
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.980
Instead we need a very fancy operator.

57
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.220
It's the remainder.

58
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.250
Let's see how it works down to coin up.

59
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.050
Let's.

60
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.600
After update Gary put a new variable and it's going to be a multiple of coin targets

61
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.380
and that's nice but multiple is.

62
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.050
There we go.

63
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.600
Always check the spelling of your variables multiple of quoit target.

64
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.990
Alright so what is multiple of target.

65
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.030
Well what I need to check is how many coins do you have and what's the quaint target.

66
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.500
And if the coins target into the coins divides perfectly then do a.

67
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.170
So points remainder coin target.

68
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.260
What does that mean.

69
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.900
It means hat what's left over.

70
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.180
If you put coin target into coins.

71
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.080
Okay so if you divide one by the other what's left over and only this to be zero.

72
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.270
So if there is no remainder if coin target perfectly goes into coins.

73
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.180
Right so if that's true.

74
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.350
What do we need to do.

75
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.640
We need to add a lifeless making new function called life up and let's define it.

76
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.420
Groups function life up.

77
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.450
What does this have to do.

78
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.580
Of this is really simple right lives plus equals one.

79
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.790
So whatever the value of lines is right now and want to add and then update the group.

80
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.760
Alright so now I want to press play the goose track.

81
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.120
Every time we pick up a coin that's double checked that works it does.

82
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.620
And if we get 20 coins which is what we set the lives at.

83
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.320
See if I can actually do it.

84
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.860
There we go that 18 19 20 lives should go up great.

85
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.780
So that's working.

86
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.780
So now we can check off both of these things and now would have the animations I make an animation for

87
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:19.310
a life I compulse when is hurt a life I compulse when Bonnie gets a new life and the quain polls when

88
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.240
money gets richer how do we do that.

89
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.530
Well as going to the gooey song we need a note probably an animation play because that makes sense and

90
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.420
let's add some animations to the first animation.

91
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.940
Start with quite pots.

92
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.220
And what do we need to do is to go to the coin icon.

93
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.780
Well first we set the length this mic was nice and short the zero point two is a good length that we

94
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.380
go.

95
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.990
Let's select the coin I.

96
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.520
That's what we got.

97
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.490
And I might add.

98
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.500
I think the scales on the rectangle scale smic a key one.

99
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.480
One is that is the size or the scale rather.

100
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.840
And we've made a key there.

101
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.210
Let's zoom in.

102
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.330
And would do the same key at the end.

103
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.080
So I start an end position and same right in the middle.

104
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360
Let's put the scale at one point five

105
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.260
and add that key.

106
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.400
So what is going to look like a POS.

107
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.320
Great.

108
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.410
That actually looks pretty good to me.

109
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.680
Let's add another dimension and let's call this life pots.

110
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.590
And now.

111
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.360
Same deal.

112
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.840
But I'm going do with the life I can say exactly the same thing.

113
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.650
Length of point two seconds.

114
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.850
Find a scale at a key at the beginning and key at the end because our start and end positions are the

115
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.100
same and then halfway through at point one seconds that shows the scale to one point five four point

116
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.000
four.

117
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.870
Perfect.

118
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.310
Make sure we add that key in.

119
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.520
Otherwise you won't do anything and his work life pulseless like great.

120
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.070
So if quain pulse and life pulse you know what then but it takes damage.

121
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.180
Let's not do a posses do something different.

122
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.970
Let's call this life down.

123
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:06.540
Life down is terrible it was it hurt were animating the same thing let's make the same length's appointment

124
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.890
and instead have scale.

125
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.280
I'm going to.

126
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.260
At a track for modulate.

127
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.070
So one of beginning the end modulated by white and then halfway mark.

128
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.210
Let's modulate it by a nice bright red.

129
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.360
So now it's going to flash red.

130
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.540
Outstanding.

131
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.160
We now have three animations.

132
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.600
So here's my challenge for you now that we have those animations.

133
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.670
See if you can wire them in.

134
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.910
Try and get the correct animations to place the gooey when the quain count all the life out changes.

135
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.950
This is quite a big challenge.

136
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.680
So pause the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

137
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.480
Welcome back.

138
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:58.930
Well versed in a do is to go in to the gooey script and make a new function called and mate.

139
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.620
What's it going to do.

140
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.440
Well it's going to take the animation plan and it's going to play an animation.

141
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.830
And I'm not past this in an argument.

142
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.110
So rougham give it the string reference for each animation and then have to put in logic to pick which

143
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.620
one is right.

144
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.930
So is this happening.

145
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.550
If so press that let's just go function animate and then pass the argument in.

146
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.730
So whatever argument you're playing has to be the string.

147
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.080
Now this means we need to be strength right.

148
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.160
So let's go back into game state.

149
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:41.730
Let's create a new function in a function we're going to create is called animate go.

150
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.070
I was put in capitals was wilful it ever since.

151
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.540
And what does need to do.

152
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.130
You know what I feel like repeatedly using global dot gooey in a script doesn't make sense because we're

153
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.620
now written a few times.

154
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.940
Instead let's make a new variable.

155
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.200
This is going to be an unready variable.

156
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.330
And that's global dot gooey.

157
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.180
What is on ready variable mean.

158
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:10.530
Well if you're using another node as a variable you need to bring that in before you run any functions.

159
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.810
The way that God allows things in or mean this gets loaded in the wrong order otherwise.

160
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:20.440
So if you're ever using a node as a variable make sure it's an on ready variable break.

161
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.400
So just double check that works.

162
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.210
Let's.

163
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.280
Remove the global from that just cause.

164
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.690
Go update.

165
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.210
And it's working okay.

166
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.980
So what is anime gyuri have to do.

167
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:45.250
Well it needs to go gooey dot and make it animation.

168
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.520
Animation isn't an existing variable so I have to pass it in whatever value we pass to the function

169
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.660
that's going to be what this means.

170
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.220
Alright so where is that going to happen.

171
00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.040
Well it's going to first happen on quain up so when you get a coin you wants you and I agree.

172
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.020
I'm going to call in get a call in.

173
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.360
The string was the string.

174
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.050
I'm going to double check it because you need to get this exactly right.

175
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.190
Quite POS.

176
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.360
Quick tip I got to rename which is the symbol.

177
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.010
And I could just copy it to my clipboard and paste it there.

178
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.720
Kapos Let's check that works when I pick up a coin.

179
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.340
I should see that happening.

180
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.400
And there it is next.

181
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.390
Let's do one all life up.

182
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.000
OK.

183
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.660
So on life up after you and on go we will do the same thing.

184
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:44.190
So animates Gary hopes but the string inside the bracket u.a. could be it.

185
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.920
And let's make sure we're Will or in the scene so let's get life pulse that's what we're calling it.

186
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.400
And just copy lent to clipboards So I don't have to write it out great and life down or hurt as it's

187
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.930
called here.

188
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.480
OK.

189
00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.700
So what happens here.

190
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.120
We need to an inmate.

191
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:09.290
And this one is called Heard with a capital H.

192
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.390
Okay now free press play.

193
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.200
We should be able see all three animations.

194
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.150
First let's check the coins working.

195
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.160
Yeah we're having a coin pulsates looking very fancy.

196
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.780
It's more coins get up to 20 and see if a life happens.

197
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.500
18.

198
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.420
Oh it didn't because I didn't stop the function name right.

199
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.160
Always check the name of your functions.

200
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.250
OK.

201
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.900
All right let's check that it's correct and hurt.

202
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:38.540
No it's not.

203
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:39.980
Look I got it wrong twice right.

204
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.680
Let's check this.

205
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.960
Let's get up to 20 high speed this up a bit.

206
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.430
Back to real time 19 and 20.

207
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.930
Great.

208
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.900
Everything worked.

209
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.770
Now now let's lose a life and the flesh for it.

210
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.530
Awesome.

211
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.100
We have really great feedback for the player.

212
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.300
It's going to be even better when we put sound effects in soon.

213
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.860
But for now in this video we've looked at it a way we can use the remainder operator to check if we

214
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:13.060
reached the point target and we've looked at firing multiple animations through a single function using

215
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:13.850
arguments.

216
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.290
So great work and I'll see you in the next video.
