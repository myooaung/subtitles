00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello wonderful gotto people in this video we're going to make Bunny jump a bunny that can jump as a

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,320
sad bunny.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,930
Let's have a happy bunny a bunny that can jump.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,240
OK so what do we need to make happen.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,050
First thing.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:21,700
Let's make a scene for Bunny to jump in and make a basic level it's going to be very temporary but it

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,200
can be basic level and we'll bring Bunny into the level rather than have a level as part of the bunny

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,350
when we start looking at the scene structures I'll explain why but it'll make sense.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,380
Let's have something to jump on some sort of platform.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,050
We need to define gravity.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,310
If we're jumping in there's no gravity what we're really doing is flying into the air and we need to

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,870
define a jump speed.

13
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,990
How high do we jump.

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,120
How high are we jumping.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:43,980
OK.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
So let's go into that first thing to do.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,180
I want to hide the collision shape and I need to see it.

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,740
Let's just save that.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,000
OK.

20
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,190
Before we start making you sing Let's talk about what a scene is.

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,370
Because here I've got a scene called player.

22
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,210
Normally when I talk about scenes I'm thinking of locations right and maybe that's my theater background

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,270
but I'm thinking like there's trees there's grass over here I mean there's a nice lake off into the

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,340
distance river more than the lake.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,250
Whatever the point is I'm thinking of a location right the woods scene in my head is intrinsically linked

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,390
to the idea of a space but that's not what a scene is here.

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,270
A scene can be a space.

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,680
So we're going to make a scene a movie called Level One but it's also the player the play a character

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,360
bunny.

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,360
It's also it could be a sound effect it could be anything any self-contained collection of assets including

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,070
scripts sprites whatever else we might need.

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,640
That can be brought together and scenes can contain scenes can contain scenes.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,660
So later we're going to have a camera scene that is part of play a scene and then the play scene is

34
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,790
going to be instance into a level.

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,450
So the camera be part of player.

36
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,770
It's all gonna to very inception.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,310
OK.

38
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,490
So let's make a brand new scene.

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,130
I'll show what I mean.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,320
So here's another scene I'm gonna use the standard no 2D or create 2D scene.

41
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,960
And now in the instance in the player.

42
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,970
So that's my play a character.

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,320
Now it's important to note that this is an instance scene.

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,060
I can see that from the Seattle Film clicker icon here.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,560
It's important because I might have several levels I say I don't know we're making all 120 levels for

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,280
our game.

47
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,880
They're all going to use the same player as an instance.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,760
What that means is I don't have to go through levels one through 120 and change the player in each that

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,350
say I need to change the graphic on its changed behavior.

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,620
Instead I can go into the player scene and let's say I've decided that the player shouldn't be the purple

51
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,360
pink bunny it should be the brown money.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:41,140
So let's change that and save it the bunny is different in this scene.

53
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,780
That's really important it means that I don't have to keep changing the assets.

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,450
It's just gonna bring in an instance from elsewhere.

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,220
I actually don't want that so I want to move the people money back.

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,740
But if you do you should ok let's also save the scenes and I'll save you in your own folder as create

57
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,710
a folder and I call this levels level 1 Doc TSM save

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,950
OK minimize that and we get to go within this.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm also gonna put some sort of floor I think Bunny should you know have something to land on so we

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,660
can see what's happening let's make a static body static body 2D there it is set equality is currently

61
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,400
up here let's add in a sprite just a temporary sprite we can use.

62
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,630
There it is.

63
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,370
And I'm gonna use the got gotto icons let's use this little icon here OK.

64
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,350
I want this to be a bit bigger.

65
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:42,070
Somebody had to transform on the scale let's make it ten times wider and ten times higher as pretty

66
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,830
big isn't it.

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,670
OK I still need the collision shape so let's add a collision collision shape 2D and let's make it a

68
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:59,530
rectangle quick note if I try and change the size the rectangle if I go to click on the rectangle and

69
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:10,690
do excellence if I do ten times bigger it's not the same why because this is a measurements in pixels

70
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,690
whereas what I did in sprite was a multiplication.

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,580
The original is 32 by 32 pixels I've scaled up by 10 10 times 32 is 320.

72
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:28,320
So let's change the excess of 320 in each direction and that fits perfectly let's also make sure that

73
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,090
we're moving all children.

74
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,010
So we're going to select the parent and remove the floor down to here and let's move Bunny up

75
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:41,680
very important by the way I didn't draw a lot of attention this last video.

76
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,500
So let's go back to placing the reason why we want to make sure that we're moving the parent not just

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,730
the children is let's say I've not got selected and I want to move money right someone move money over

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:59,500
here now where is Bunny Bunny is where the kid somatic body is but the kid somatic body doesn't have

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,180
much visual representation I'm going to look at this and think bunnies with a Sprite is and that's going

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,890
to cause all kinds of problems that say I reached the end of the level the sprite isn't at the right

81
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:17,260
place Gordo is calculated from here so I need the children to always be where the parent is I need to

82
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,120
know where bunny is OK some would say that his bunny.

83
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,390
I need to change what scene happens when we press run.

84
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,110
So let's go to project Project settings and I'm going to go to run OK.

85
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,350
Main scene.

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,910
Player player TSM.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,420
So it's like a folder you up upon and into levels and select level one tier ASEAN.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,780
And now when I press play new default saying Okay here's a bunny for a further.

89
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,690
Let's rename the floor and hide the collision shape because it's distracting me.

90
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,890
And yeah that pretty good.

91
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,250
Let's actually make Bunny fold so to do that and to go into the player script.

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:04,730
Now I'm not open the script here but it's opening the player dot G.D. script which is the one for the

93
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,490
player scene so clicking here you're going to open that script.

94
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:14,480
I'm not changing this individual instance of the player I'm changing the script for all instances of

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,360
money all instances of player use the same script.

96
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:18,670
All right.

97
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,260
So I said I'm going to gravity I'm going to make constant gravity.

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,880
Why am I making constant knock on changes at runtime.

99
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,140
There is one gravity in my game.

100
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,580
So what should this be it's probably a high number right because I mean multiply by Delta.

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,270
If it wasn't multiply by Delta for using moving collide rather move and slide.

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,030
If I typed five this mean five pixels per frame but five pixels multiplied by Delta per frame is quite

104
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,290
small so let's say 500 okay 500 well speaking of per frame let's actually make that happen.

105
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,640
So every frame we're gonna move down that's gonna be motion dot y right.

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,420
That's the Y position in this vector to motion dot y and we're going to what do we want.

107
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:05,660
We want add equals gravity add equals means take whatever it is right now and add the following to it.

108
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,260
Now some of you are thinking why we're late if you add to why aren't you going up.

109
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,920
And the answer is not here.

110
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,780
Let me show you why.

111
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,150
Here is a feature of gotto that has tripped me up more times than I care to admit.

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,580
Let's say I'm doing a standard piece of geometry right so his x.

113
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,290
Here's why this is zero.

114
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,990
This is bigger than zero whatever that is.

115
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,750
I can't be bothered to think of a number.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,650
The point is positive goes in this direction right.

117
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,010
However that's not how Gordo calculates gotto is actually calculating from the top left.

118
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,220
So our axes look like this.

119
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,680
And y goes this way.

120
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,240
So this is positive y.

121
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,430
This is negative y.

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,960
That means down adds to the y value.

123
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
The easy way to remember this on occasions y don't forget is that we're actually drawing from the top

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,730
left of the screen to the bottom right of the screen.

125
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:00,940
Right.

126
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,710
Like I would read a book admittedly if you don't read in the language that reads from top left to bottom

127
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:05,920
right.

128
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,120
That's not very helpful but if you do that can be helpful.

129
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,590
I say I've made this mistake several times.

130
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,750
I actually made it while doing the prototype for this video even after I explained how not to do it

131
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,470
in my rehearsal.

132
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,690
So you know it's really a mistake to make but the short answer is if you want a jump we'll go negative

133
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,770
y and if not to fall we'll get positive y.

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,950
I guess another way I can think of this is that my name starts with the Y and I'm very grounded but

135
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,260
that's a terrible pun.

136
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,960
So we're not gonna do that.

137
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,230
Okay so every frame we should fall by gravity.

138
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,670
Let's take a look at how that works.

139
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,330
There's Bunny bunnies on the floor.

140
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,140
Bunny has fallen really fast.

141
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,520
That was much faster than 500 times delta.

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,990
What's happening.

143
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:57,160
What's happening is that we're adding to this value every frame and there's no cap so the velocity we

144
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,360
are heading down which is what this motion is right is increasing with every frame.

145
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,980
So if I immediately upon learning the game go that way I fall at 1 speed but if I wait a while and then

146
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,810
go off for much faster.

147
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,510
So I need to apply this only if I'm not on the ground.

148
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,900
Fortunately moving slide has something we can use.

149
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,930
So if I'm going to hold control and click on move and slide move and slide which is a calling kinetic

150
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,400
body 2D The first argument takes is linear velocity right.

151
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,660
Which way a moving.

152
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,380
A vector too.

153
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,120
But the second one is an optional one.

154
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,050
It's a floor normal.

155
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,950
What is that.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,180
The up direction used to determine what is a wall and what is a floor or ceiling.

157
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,740
Why do we need to do that.

158
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,670
Well we need to do that because although we're doing a 2D game God doesn't know if we're looking from

159
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,820
the side in a standard platform game or top down Bunny Bunny isn't recognizable to God.

160
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
So we're gonna need some way of telling it.

161
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,130
I need you to know that this is up this is down so I'm going to define up in my script.

162
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,770
If this is another constant so let's put it near gravity constant up and I'm going to capitalize on

163
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,290
my constants of the nice and easy to spot my script.

164
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,310
And this is a vector too and I just need to define what up is right.

165
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,300
So it's 0 on the X and what is it.

166
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,860
Negative 1.

167
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,500
This is it's gonna be negative because negative y is up.

168
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,330
So now let's make a new function called called apply gravity

169
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,050
and I'm going to say if not is on the floor.

170
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,730
Now let's just move this motion dot way down.

171
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:42,730
So I'm going to hold out and use the down cursor and I need to indent that properly so if you want the

172
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,870
floor set motion dot y to be positive of gravity.

173
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,060
Else motion dot y equals zero.

174
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,310
When they do need to do is make sure they were actually calling this.

175
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:01,220
So let's say apply gravity so we apply gravity every frame so every frame is going to look at the gravity

176
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,050
because a.

177
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,490
Are we not on the floor if we're not on the floor apply gravity elsewhere.

178
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,340
This way we could by the way also just right is on floor motion dot y equals zero else.

179
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,800
Motion don't y plus equals gravity.

180
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,470
Okay this is functionally the same it doesn't really military do it.

181
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,950
I guess it is on floor is slightly easier to process and if not is on floor but that's personal preference.

182
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,180
Okay.

183
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,230
In all of this work we need to make sure it's actually using is on floor right now this will never trigger

184
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,790
because it doesn't know which way the floor is.

185
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,550
To do that we need to put up in here.

186
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,190
That's just this vector too in here.

187
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,920
So now I press play Bunny start in the ground.

188
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,170
But then when I move this way much better falling right.

189
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,270
And to make that really clear.

190
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,920
Let's change this.

191
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,320
5 as this nice slices slowly fall.

192
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,670
And now on a stay on the ground for a while.

193
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,100
And that shouldn't change in the middle of this way.

194
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,800
It'll fall at the same rate.

195
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,180
If that wasn't the case.

196
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,390
If I take this up out

197
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,780
full weight a little bit and then fall much faster.

198
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,220
Okay so we're gonna put that up in there.

199
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,610
Great.

200
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,000
Now we also need a jump speed because we to start jumping how high do we jump.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,930
This will be fighting gravity constant jump speed and we should find what that is.

202
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,620
Let's put gravity back.

203
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,050
It's got to be higher much faster than gravity isn't so let's say you think the same.

204
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,400
Yeah let's go with the same as the speed for now 1000.

205
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:44,180
Okay so let's go if it puts dot is action pressed now let's define a jump cycle project settings input

206
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,480
map and let's type and jump.

207
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,700
All right we need to decide what a jump key is going to be.

208
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,680
It could be w on a quiet keyboard.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,820
If it's an as a T keyboard it'll be something else.

210
00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:03,230
It could be space I'm asking but it's both an add a key for W and a key for space and now either has

211
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,920
pressed it'll counters jump.

212
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:11,570
So now if action pressed his jump motion Dot.

213
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,530
Why is this going to be minus equals jump speed.

214
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,720
I could also do plus equals and this is negative 1000 but that feels weird.

215
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,500
Let's see how that looks.

216
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,860
And let's make a bigger screen.

217
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,590
It works pretty well.

218
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,380
I tap space is great but look.

219
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,670
Please stop at different heights.

220
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,230
In fact if I hold space go for quite some time.

221
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:44,820
The reason is bunnies jumping even if bunnies in the air as long as I'm holding the button down Bunny

222
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,170
will jump.

223
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,400
Which brings me to the challenge.

224
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,910
I'd like you to make sure we only jump when we're on the floor.

225
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,990
So pulls the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution

226
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,480
and welcome back.

227
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,530
Okay.

228
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,520
Easiest thing we could do is use is on floor now.

229
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,790
What I'm going to do is if input is action press jump and is on floor

230
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,050
then jump speed.

231
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,490
So this will only happen if on the floor and a press jump and now it's very clear I need a smaller gravity

232
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,670
or higher jump speed right.

233
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,950
So let's do that let's change jump speed for 3000

234
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,540
now I'm bouncing a bit.

235
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:44,780
So what I might do is change is action pressed for is action just pressed.

236
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,330
So now holding it won't do it.

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:49,550
Right.

238
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:58,010
You have to tap it for each time and let's turn down gravity slightly that feels a little high that

239
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,130
feels pretty good doesn't it.

240
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,150
Okay.

241
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,050
Now this is stunt to get a little bit messy.

242
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,760
I've got to play gravity is our function.

243
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,730
I actually will jump as I would function.

244
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:18,580
So let's put jump here and make a new function for jump and just move this down so I can grab this

245
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,390
and call that jump.

246
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:31,420
And we could also do move and this time I'm going to cut this

247
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,500
and paste it right there to make sure my indentation is correct.

248
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,960
And now when I press play it shouldn't play any differently but our functions are a lot neater right.

249
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,950
Every frame applied to gravity jump move move and slide each function is doing a single thing and that's

250
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,150
really key.

251
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:12,350
And look at that we now have a jumping falling moving money which brings us the end video in this video

252
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,770
we've looked at instances scenes how to change your default scene so what scene plays when you press

253
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:23,480
play how x and y coordinates work and go and how to use the IS is on flow function in moving slide.

254
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,930
This is really great progress our game is starting to come together since a look like a real game.

255
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,980
Did you come up with a different solution to the only jump on the flow problem is your code something

256
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,860
different.

257
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,560
Share your progress.

258
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,180
I'm really curious to see how you guys are doing.

259
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,490
Meanwhile great stuff and I'll see you on the next video.
