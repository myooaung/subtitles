00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.910
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.370
Marvellous God people.

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.890
OK.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.830
We're going to deal with something a little bit more complicated today.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.110
Let's talk about Jason and the file command.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.760
Now that sounds like a great name for an 80s action movie or bad but it's not Jason is javascript object

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.930
notation to talk about.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.130
That means in a moment.

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500
First why do we want to do this.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
Well here's what our current plan looks like.

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.190
We need to get the code ready for the C sharp treatment.

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.680
Ben is about to take our script and rewrite it and C sharp but he's going to have a problem.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
All of our story information you know the things with all the props and everything else that that template

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.480
dictionary with made.

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.300
That's all in our script.

16
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.800
That means if he wants to use it he has to copy and paste it into his script.

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.810
Now let's imagine we're making a much bigger project a huge RPG and he's doing quests and I'm doing

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.460
dialogue and and Michael is doing someone else's dialogue and Recces doing some other Quest and Sam

19
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.040
is doing something else.

20
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.530
We can't have a situation where I need to go into everybody else's script and copy and paste stuff into

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.630
mine every time I wanna make a change.

22
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.810
We need a way to separate the script from the human readable content write descriptions stories dialogue.

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.780
This should all be in a different file.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.650
So today we're going to learn what Jason is.

25
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.590
We're going to move the story information out of the script.

26
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.810
I am going to move the other text out of the script to look let's really apply some best practices here.

27
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.940
Quick aside I pronounce this word Jason that's how I've always heard it pronounced.

28
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.180
Some people don't.

29
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.960
That's cool.

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.760
You can say J.

31
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.500
So enel whatever else if you like.

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.060
I like saying Jason if you want to know more about Jason I've linked this web page that adjacent or

33
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.820
web page and you can see very very quickly here.

34
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.410
It's a lightweight data interchange format.

35
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.520
That's easy for humans to read and write.

36
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.990
OK.

37
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.780
So what does that mean.

38
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.440
Well what Jason does is allow an easy to read format so it just uses that standard Unicode text format.

39
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.320
I think if you read by a wide variety of programs and humans so he's a human.

40
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.730
His machine and his job and all of them can read and write very easily.

41
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.860
To Jason File Jason Voss separate things into keys and values and this is a pair just like in a dictionary.

42
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.280
Right.

43
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.260
So we have key and value.

44
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.470
The key will be unique and the value can be any kind of variable it could be an integer a float a string

45
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.970
will give up.

46
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.510
We can have a raise in square brackets and we have dictionaries.

47
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.850
And I always have trouble with this symbol as curly brackets and we can have an array of dictionaries.

48
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.910
A Dictionary of arrays an array of arrays and so forth will separate the values with commas and each

49
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.460
time it'll be key one with value.

50
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.230
Ketu With value exactly as we've done it which means we can create a Jason file and copy and paste our

51
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.790
stories in.

52
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.220
So here I am an atom which is free.

53
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.950
I am going to link it so you can use that or your Jason files.

54
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.860
To be honest you can do this in any notepad notepad plus any ASCII text writer.

55
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.560
I will look at brandley file.

56
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.300
I am going to call it storis Sizemore stories Storey's dot J S Open.

57
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.680
Here is my entry jesson file.

58
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.440
What goes in it.

59
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.430
Well that's open got.

60
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.270
And as we've said this template here could be cut.

61
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.270
In fact we don't need this variableness to get rid of that variability back into assum and paste and

62
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.840
there is Jason.

63
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.380
All my stories Now in here.

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.740
I can even.

65
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.700
Because of the way Jason works formate this little better right it doesn't read whitespace so I can

66
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.090
do this.

67
00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.480
I'm going fast for a little and put all my props and their own line just to make it a little easier

68
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.300
to read.

69
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.800
And here we go.

70
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400
Everything is now in storage.

71
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.350
Jason can say that and back to God for any further.

72
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.710
Let's tidy up a bit in ready.

73
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.170
We're doing multiple things.

74
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.790
We are setting a random story and we're setting some techs.

75
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.690
I don't really like that so I want to make a granny function of got function set by random story because

76
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.630
that's what it does and that feels good.

77
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.860
Animate take these two using ought and down arrow on Windows that I now have set random story.

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.610
OK we have a Jason File.

79
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.550
We were going to use the file function to read from.

80
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.660
Let's take a quick look at Firefox and someone to go to classes and type in file and take a look at

81
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.030
it.

82
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.530
We have a file and we grant the description we can see here.

83
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.500
This load thing is very close to what we want.

84
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.560
In fact we can be writing something almost identical to this.

85
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.000
First thing to do is critical action so let's make a function.

86
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.560
We're going to call this get from Jason right.

87
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.320
Pass in there so we can talk without this error message which is confusing.

88
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.940
What does git get from Jason going to get.

89
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.630
Is going to get a file name.

90
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.460
I'm putting the farnam in here because I want to really use this not just with the stories Jason but

91
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.290
with a separate Jason we make later for the other string's things like the introduction things like

92
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.810
Can I have and things like.

93
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.090
Again that's all I mean the Jason File.

94
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.130
If I put this in here I can pass the name of the file I want to get into this function.

95
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.640
I don't have to hard code.

96
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.230
Each one is this function.

97
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.840
First going to do this with a certain variable lowercase file.

98
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.800
Because this is something when you use a couple times this function.

99
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.410
What is that.

100
00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.600
That is file with a capital.

101
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.320
So we know it's actually command not new.

102
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.420
Actually make a note here what this is.

103
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.080
Then would you want to take the variable dish made and open it.

104
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:17.250
So what are we opening where opening a file name and we're going to read it so that's file dot read.

105
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.310
Make sure you've got capitals here.

106
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.910
I made this mistake the second time of I've recorded this video the first time I recorded it.

107
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.130
I did capital R E A D E and I didn't notice the mistake.

108
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.240
You look at the dropdown it's the candles.

109
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.140
So what's going to happen.

110
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.620
We're going to grab the file.

111
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.720
We're going to open it and read it.

112
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.060
What we haven't done is put any error correction in.

113
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.490
There's nothing in here that says This fathers exist.

114
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.480
For now it's not an issue but if it's got bigger that might be something they can know here

115
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.140
that we're assuming that the file exists.

116
00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:00.310
Ok you've read the file but right now looney lips or God rather doesn't know what to do with it.

117
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.400
A file is this what am I reading exactly.

118
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.600
This hieroglyphs is as English as this.

119
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.280
Jason is a C sharp.

120
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.150
Is this a gif.

121
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.380
What kind of file is this.

122
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:10.600
Let's begin a new thing.

123
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.750
It's a new variable called text.

124
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.070
Because we want to get the file.

125
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.470
Get as text and that's a built in function.

126
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.000
And again you can look at that here and see all of these get as text in all the rest so we can see what

127
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.180
that means.

128
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.520
Now file.

129
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.230
Get as text.

130
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.180
Okay so we're going to get the text.

131
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.530
Were going to read it as a text file but we need to break it down.

132
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.580
It's not just a text file we need God to be able to bring information out of this need to know how to

133
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.330
find it.

134
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.900
So this making new variable called data and that's going to be.

135
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.100
Pass.

136
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.980
Pass means.

137
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.700
Translate or understand.

138
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.570
So I got to read this thing and now understand it as adjacent file.

139
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.910
So let's set that up pass underscored.

140
00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.280
Jason.

141
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.730
Text.

142
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.360
It's going to open the file read it.

143
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.930
Know that it's text and then read it as Jason.

144
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.830
So this variable here this data is what we're doing.

145
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.910
So what are we to do.

146
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.670
We need to return it to whatever function called this one.

147
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:25.070
So we can use return and what are we returning data return on its own.

148
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.910
We'll just close out the function but return data is going to push this variable back to wherever we

149
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.810
came from.

150
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.470
There's one more thing we need to do we need to close this file with opened it.

151
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.210
We need to close it.

152
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:41.550
Anything that we've got in memory we're not using we should close remember to do this before you return

153
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.890
it's a file dot close.

154
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.120
This is another mistake I made the first time I recorded the video.

155
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.420
I put the files up close after return data doesn't return an error.

156
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.820
It just never happens.

157
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.680
That's how memory leaks can happen right.

158
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.450
You've got things open in memory that you don't know there.

159
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.210
Alright so let's use this brain you get from Jason under set random story.

160
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:13.980
When a new line variable stories equals get from Jason stories dot j.

161
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.140
So N which is the file we just made.

162
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.430
Now you notice because the story's not Jason.

163
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.280
And this is stories not template.

164
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.360
Template doesn't exist anymore.

165
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.490
This will not work.

166
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.890
So current story calls stories

167
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.210
stories dog size important note.

168
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.540
If you completely remove a variable in God make sure that you've actually removed the instance so that

169
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.830
the current story works exactly as he did before but now it's going to pull this from the Jason variable

170
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.550
rates of VAT.

171
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.450
Now this story's thing and we're setting the current stories as whichever story with pet awesome.

172
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.210
While we're at it make sure you don't do my favourite mistake.

173
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.290
I do this small time.

174
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.730
I've written a brand new function.

175
00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.900
I've removed the functionality out of a previous function make call the function.

176
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:08.450
If I don't call set random story this will never happen which means that when we do can I have a in

177
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.410
all the rest of it when when the script just run.

178
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.850
We actually never get the story.

179
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.710
If I press play now this should work.

180
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:25.900
Can Have A person's name hand Bill the name of a place are the washing stand a poor often now own the

181
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.970
Nonas.

182
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.430
Can I have an adverb a word ending in Lee's sleep.

183
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.660
Sleazily we go.

184
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.240
Now I'm a hippo.

185
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.860
Dear panda bill.

186
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.240
Look.

187
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.830
It works perfectly and address this and we're randomizing.

188
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.290
We're almost there.

189
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:50.640
So now I'd like to challenge you to take what you've just done and create a new Jason File called other

190
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.510
strings dot Jason.

191
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:59.960
And in here create an entry for the introduction text then load that introduction into the ready function.

192
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.270
Now this is a little complicated.

193
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.500
We're adding some moving parts here so don't worry if this gets confusing the give it a shot pause the

194
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.450
video.

195
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.530
See what you can do and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

196
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.300
Welcome back.

197
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:24.070
Alright first thing I need to do is get into ASM and make a brand new file.

198
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.510
If you're not using atom clearly don't go into atom.

199
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.330
I want to be calling this.

200
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.000
I'm calling this other strings.

201
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.170
Jason and the created dictionary.

202
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.700
Put a random pound sign in there or no sign or hash sign or wherever you're from.

203
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.310
And I want to make a spare key intro text up

204
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:53.850
until any lips we're going to tell a story and have a wonderful line.

205
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.450
Great.

206
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.920
It's already done.

207
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.300
We can create some more thinks I'm actually going do a few more things.

208
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:07.980
For extra credit I'm going to put in a prompt.

209
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:19.690
And let's change the again but then to say again I'm not meant for the complex line just don't not put

210
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.410
the comma on the next line like that.

211
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.190
I'm going to call this again.

212
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.130
Again I mean I could dress this took you mask or try again or once more with feeling whatever I wanted.

213
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.670
Why am I doing this.

214
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.650
Well partly it's best practices but also the nice thing about Jason is that we can start localizing

215
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:49.500
our game I can have an English one a French one Japanese one whatever we want it so when I want to change

216
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.960
language you could say again in English or girl in French.

217
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.710
It dawned in Japanese you know whilst this is burgundy Japanese whatever we wanted.

218
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.570
Right so if you want to do localization Jason's a great way of doing it.

219
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:02.880
OK.

220
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.660
We've got this keycorp intro space Texas probably not smart as you in an underscore there save that

221
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.750
and back to God.

222
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.180
Now one quick new variable.

223
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:20.190
Some call it strings and just make a note of what kind of strings these are all the text that's displayed

224
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.030
to the plane.

225
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.750
There we go.

226
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.070
So strings is going to be my catch all things with the current story and strings.

227
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.880
There's my volleyball right there great.

228
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.710
Okay what's with the wrentham story.

229
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.550
Let's set the strings.

230
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:39.130
Strings equals get from Jason.

231
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:46.010
When are we getting what we call the zero that's double check always double check other unschool strings.

232
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.270
And we need that to be a string.

233
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.490
We can't just put it in like that.

234
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.090
There we go.

235
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.520
If you're not sure you can look at the documentation.

236
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:02.470
We're doing a file open so it's files got come back file to do.

237
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.790
Oh man open takes string part.

238
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.430
Right.

239
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.530
That means this path has to be a string.

240
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.910
You can't just write it as plain plaintext expect it to understand.

241
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.610
No I want the answer to close that.

242
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.790
So we're setting strings as other strings.

243
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.940
Jason awesome.

244
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:30.810
Now we can wipe all of this into a text and we can say strings intro text.

245
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.460
I've removed the first prompt from this string.

246
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:39.490
To be honest it shouldn't have been there in the first place so let's do prompt is prompt player and

247
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.300
let's jump down to the prompt play I think so they can you very well.

248
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.430
And I call this next project.

249
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.200
And this is going to be a current story.

250
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:56.070
Square brackets from that which should be in quotes and that will prompt an end player.

251
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.800
And then this thing play a word sight.

252
00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.270
I'm not gonna write that again I'm going to copy it.

253
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:01.740
Awesome.

254
00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.450
The reason I'm doing this is I don't have to have.

255
00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:06.240
Can I have employees built into my script right.

256
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.950
I want these to be separated out from the code.

257
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.690
So now let's reset story text.

258
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:20.190
Text what's this going to mean that this is going to be strings that variable just made prompt and American

259
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.250
Catholics in next prompt.

260
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:26.630
And close the bracket.

261
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:34.500
So we're now going to set the story text as prompt and that you know let's add it to the story so the

262
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.630
story text is now going to add in a prompt with the next prompt.

263
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:45.030
Can I have a whatever the next prompt is if I'm adding that in there and need to wipe this story at

264
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.490
some point.

265
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.820
So right here when you press the button.

266
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.050
Let's clear the screen

267
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.990
story text not text.

268
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.250
He calls that that.

269
00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:01.500
Well people have pointed out that I could just do not clear that I'll work too but I'm going do it this

270
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.280
way because I like it this way.

271
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.970
Okay is that everything.

272
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:15.190
No the button OK let's fix this button again best practices strings again.

273
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.660
Is that how we wrote it in the file.

274
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.070
We double check.

275
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.140
Yes it is.

276
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.670
Outstanding.

277
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.690
Now moment of truth let's find out what happens when we play this.

278
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.350
Welcome to Leumi lips.

279
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.330
We're going to tell a story and have a wonderful time.

280
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.580
Can I have a name please.

281
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.650
That's wrong.

282
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.400
Go into my arius.

283
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.570
OK.

284
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.540
I had too many A's prompt.

285
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.180
Can I have that please.

286
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.740
Because that's right.

287
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.410
So let's take a look at this now.

288
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.530
Pressplay.

289
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.990
Welcome to Luni let's we're going to tell a story.

290
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.690
Have a wonderful time.

291
00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.490
Can I have a noun please.

292
00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:02.320
Pick an adjective cuddly another noun to can.

293
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.520
Yet another noun a microphone.

294
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.170
I'm just looking around my desk at this point.

295
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.430
An adjective confusing one.

296
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.010
More now on web cam.

297
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.880
First up the Super Bowl.

298
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.500
Is it Tate the ultimate pizza recipe makes one packet of pig with grease being spoonfuls of flour spoonfuls.

299
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.830
Need the dough etc. etc. And there's the again now.

300
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.540
The best bit is if I close this.

301
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:36.810
And change again to Gore Pressplay.

302
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.720
Look at that.

303
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.690
We've now separated all these words from the tax on change they're back to again because Ben doesn't

304
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.640
speak French until confuse him.

305
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.490
And it looks like we're done quite a lot of stuff in this video.

306
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.810
But in this video we've looked at the awesome power of Jason and looks at how to load and pass text.

307
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.730
Now this might feel like a lot of work but you can use this for safe games you can use as for dialogue

308
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.690
trees you can use as for item description.

309
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.900
It's a really good habit you cold goes in the code.

310
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.800
Text goes in the text.

311
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.900
Excellent work.

312
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.030
So great stuff.

313
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.080
Well done for flying so far.

314
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.290
Share your Jason of stories if you want to.

315
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.420
Let's get these huge jasons so people could play others games and folks are seeing on the next video.
