00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,850
Hello again you wonderful people.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,810
Let's get the assets and get our game started.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,010
Really quick what assets are using using top down shooter space new sounds by Kenny.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,110
This is a filtered down packs.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,820
I've removed a bunch of assets were not using I've left you some options.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,170
You can still choose different things.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,230
But I don't want to like put a whole bunch of stuff you know that we weren't necessarily using.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,430
If you want to make a slightly different game we want to explore.

9
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,550
I found his stuff an open game art.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,750
I've left you the links for the packs I'm using in this letter three resources so feel free to explore

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,180
more so using a piece of music by someone called lisboa.

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,410
Also an open game.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,060
Open game art called stealth music because it really fits.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,510
And it's also on a Creative Commons you're a licence so we can use it without problems.

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,450
Okay let's get this project started.

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,990
First thing we do is you'll see I've already downloaded the assets that are right here and I'm an open

17
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,600
godda.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,770
He has.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,660
And only to make a new project and I'm going to call this heist Meister's And just for consistency.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:14,710
I'm going to put three underscore heiss mice's like that and that's the correct folded document repo

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,510
create folder creaton added.

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,030
So here we are.

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,410
We're in a nice empty project with nothing in it yet when 3D space and all I need to do is get the assets

24
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,370
in here.

25
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,320
My challenge to you is to get your assets into the projects and download them from the link and the

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,620
resources you're looking for the heiss masters assets step down of the assets unzipped the folder and

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,340
install them in your heiss my AS project portfolio.

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,600
Give that a shot and then when you come back I'll show you how to do it just in case you got stockel

29
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,380
confused.

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,010
You know just forgot how to do it.

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,600
And welcome back.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,710
So installing these assets is nice and easy.

33
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,490
I'm going right click here to show and farm manager and that's just going to bring up the reaper So

34
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,120
I don't have to go finding it again.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,580
Nice is simple.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,420
What do I need to do.

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,270
I need to get the assets into this false sense minimize.

38
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Got it for now.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
Could even close it to be honest.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,760
It's close.

41
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:18,090
Gotta just open the file and all I'm a do is drag or cut and paste have you do it.

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,760
Or 3 folders directly into the heiss my SAS folder.

43
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,050
And now when I open got go again where I got to.

44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,960
There you are one.

45
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,480
I close it.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,430
What was I thinking.

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,360
Now I open god again.

48
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,950
Everything gets imported for me.

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,950
Now we will be making some more folders and we dont have a scene's folder a script folder but just a

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,560
quick overview of what we have.

51
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,860
In effect we have a bunch of graphics things were going to be using Sprite sheets and tile sheets the

52
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,340
tushie is interesting.

53
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,750
All of the assets are top now shoot other people are in here.

54
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,630
Those are going to come in very useful when we look at auto tiling and videos underpin G.

55
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,170
You'll also notice that there's a few different people you can use and the individual tiles which were

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,820
also going to be using for props so are the hit man you'll see that the player character man red has

57
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,830
a few options in here.

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,570
There's a couple of other items he can look at while we're here.

59
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,630
But if you look at the sound effects here all the sound effects and background music finally under light

60
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,270
maps there's a torch map something I made very quickly in Photoshop so that the torch of the flashlight

61
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,200
for the guards and security cameras can actually show on screen and cast light.

62
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,090
It's very simple to make.

63
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:43,840
All I did was they make a little triangle in in GIMP and then I just did a gradient fill from white

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,300
to black white is where there's light black as there isn't very easy so you need to make your own.

65
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,410
That's how you do that.

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,910
And that's a set up.

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,930
So in this video we've created the project downloaded the assets installed them and had a quick peek

68
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,190
at them were now ready to start programming.

69
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,550
Great work and I'll see you in the next video.
