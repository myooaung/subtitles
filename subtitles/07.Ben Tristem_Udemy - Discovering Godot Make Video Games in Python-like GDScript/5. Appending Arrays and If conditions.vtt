00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.440
Hi folks welcome back.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.990
In this video we're going to start getting some actual gameplay in what we've created so far as a really

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.060
strong foundation.

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.130
But we're taking player inputs and repeating them.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.330
So what we've done is created a trained parrot simulator.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.330
Let's take those inputs and put them into our story.

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.110
This video is about a pending arrays and using If conditions.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.610
So what do we need to do to use these player inputs.

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.850
Well the first thing we need to do is to prompt for player I need to tell the player what kind of input

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.320
I'm looking for.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.760
So am I looking for a name.

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.990
Am I looking for a place.

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.450
Am I looking for a feeling that kind of thing.

14
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.650
Then I need to take those inputs and put them into play a wide array.

15
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.670
We need an array just for those player words then only to stop prompting the player when we have enough

16
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.290
stuff.

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.610
There's no point just continues the asking for things we need to know how many things it needs and when

18
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.440
to stop.

19
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.270
Then we need to take all these things and put them into our story.

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.560
So let's get to it.

21
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.180
He's a lovely lovely script.

22
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.770
OK so what's the first thing we need to do.

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.670
The first thing to do is create this play on words variable.

24
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.260
This is going to be an array.

25
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.320
I don't need to declare it like this but I'm going to just for readability when I come back to this

26
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.660
in a few months or someone else adds to my code.

27
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.400
They should be able to look at this immediately and understand what this does.

28
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.750
This is just halimi.

29
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.200
These are the words that the players are going to use and I could even put a little comment.

30
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.020
Like this.

31
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.760
Try to avoid using too many comments.

32
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.910
But if you have variables or functions that aren't immediately obvious but are important.

33
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.530
That's what we can do.

34
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.300
OK now we have an issue.

35
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.370
Remember a few videos back when I was saying that variables can exist in a function but they only exist

36
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.660
in that function.

37
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.470
That's what we have here.

38
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.750
We have three local variables play a words prompt and story.

39
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.790
We want these things to be accessed by multiple functions.

40
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.990
Now we could pass these things through to every function every time we call a function.

41
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.810
But that's going to get really messy.

42
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.690
So instead let's make these member variables and only select them and use Altern up arrow that's how

43
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.660
I'm doing this.

44
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.800
You'll see this unexpected indent error.

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.130
That's because we're not in a function.

46
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.460
We shouldn't be indented So let's just remove the indentation and put a little of space there.

47
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.280
So I want to put all my variables in one place.

48
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.970
Okay so we have this empty player words very well.

49
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.880
Now the scary bit let's get rid of this because I don't need the prompts to be Yand pizza full sized

50
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.500
cabbages.

51
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:58.070
I need it to be things like this and name a thing a feeling another feeling and some things.

52
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.270
Now if you prefer you can say proper noun now an adjective.

53
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.050
I'm going to keep this lyson loose so the next step is going to be to add things into this player words

54
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.570
array.

55
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.600
So let's go down to this text box text and add function whenever new text is coming in.

56
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.450
I'm only going to use this one because if they press the button.

57
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.980
We're just calling this function.

58
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.390
So either way we're coming here and I don't want to do this right.

59
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.620
I don't want to repeat whatever the player said.

60
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.800
Instead I want to take what they've said and add it to the list.

61
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.310
So what I want to do is when the call is new play or words thing and it's an array which means I have

62
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.120
special commands available to arrays.

63
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.400
And in this case I want to use append.

64
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.190
So what am I appending.

65
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.650
Well I'm a pending new underscore text whups new underscore there is text so whatever evented add it

66
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.000
to this list lets just check that works.

67
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.030
By printing player words and remembering to put that in brackets.

68
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.980
Let's try doughnuts.

69
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.700
We all onion biology is a history but biology.

70
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.820
Not even sure.

71
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.310
Great.

72
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.210
Every time we enter it's adding to the array and we can see that done here.

73
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.440
OK.

74
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.370
So that's not what we wanted to do.

75
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.270
So we can hear that print command and these empty lines what do we want it to do.

76
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.090
Well we want it to prompt the player we need it to say can you give me this point.

77
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.010
So let's really function down here.

78
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.290
We call this prompt underscore player I remember my brackets and I hold on and I'm going to write pass.

79
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.100
The convention is that function names are going to be lowercase.

80
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.580
The reason that these have upper case is that they're calling nodes and those nodes are upper case.

81
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.670
So what's going to happen on prompt player.

82
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.220
Well we're going to display some text and we know how to do that right when we use the dollar sign.

83
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:08.720
Blackboard and down here the story text what text do we need to display update text equals.

84
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.200
And let's put this in brackets because I'm going to take some strings that I'm going to give it and

85
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.660
I'm going it can katin make them.

86
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.740
Can I have a space katin in the value prompt.

87
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.440
Please.

88
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.240
And I like to put spaces after my punctuation because that's how I do.

89
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.440
Okay so what have we got here.

90
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.520
We've got a string.

91
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:43.900
Can I have a looking katin note in the variable prompt please except prompt isn't just a variable It's

92
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.670
an array.

93
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.070
Now an array is a type of variable.

94
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.480
But if we do this here's what it's going to say Can I have a name a thing a feeling another feeling

95
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.690
some things.

96
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.760
Well first thing I've noticed is I don't need this A because of Britain I'm up here so let's get rid

97
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.320
of a

98
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.020
I don't want all of these things to come in.

99
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.940
I want one to come in.

100
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.360
There's a few ways we could do this.

101
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.330
One thing we could do is we create a new variable costs then like word count.

102
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.270
And then every time they enter text we can say a word count and add to it.

103
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.630
And that'll work fine.

104
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.650
But it's not what I would call elegant the more elegant way of doing this is to use what God is already

105
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.370
doing.

106
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.140
So let's remind ourselves what that is.

107
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.730
What better way to do that than with a doodle.

108
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.290
First time our drug got oh here's my little god.

109
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.020
I realize it's not actually the Mascotte but I like drawing this figure someone to draw this one.

110
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.130
It's got little eyes and a smile and a nose He's so cute.

111
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.890
OK.

112
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.740
So on the way back to him way then great.

113
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.750
What needs to happen.

114
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.620
Well we've got our ray which I'm going to continue thinking about as a shelf for now because I find

115
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.250
that helpful.

116
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.890
And this is our prompt array.

117
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.180
And it has a number of boxes.

118
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.150
Now remember how God counts them.

119
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.580
Well it doesn't do is actually counted doesn't go.

120
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.780
This is number one this is number two this is number three now.

121
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.410
Godso isn't counting.

122
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.720
It's moving.

123
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.250
So we've given it some instructions which will be in this little blue card and it's going to look at

124
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.840
this blue card and think OK this little blue card has a number one on it.

125
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.220
How many spaces do I have to move.

126
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.410
And it'll count how many spaces to move.

127
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.530
This is moving zero.

128
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.590
This is moving one.

129
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.590
This is moving to.

130
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.570
This is moving three so it's going to take a look at this and move one space and grab this value.

131
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.840
This is really helpful because we've just created another shelf another array.

132
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.140
We've called this play of words.

133
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.140
Now what it's doing is it's adding boxes in.

134
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.350
But we can say okay tell me how many things are in here.

135
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.810
Actually count them.

136
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.040
How do I count them.

137
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.870
I'm going to use a specific method for arrays in this case.

138
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.940
I'm going to use size with brackets on it and this will count how many things are in here.

139
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:13.300
And then the instructions I'm going to give it are going to be count these and move that many spaces.

140
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.780
So how's that looking cold.

141
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.950
Well I need to tell it don't give me the array.

142
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.780
Give me a certain thing within the array.

143
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.170
So I'm going to give it the array brackets okay.

144
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:30.910
This tells it find a number within the array so this would be index zero which is thing zero right.

145
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.930
Move zero along.

146
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.150
That'll be a name.

147
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.630
I don't want to use a number here.

148
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:43.810
I want to tell it to count the things Mplayer words so I'm doing plougher underscore words dot signs.

149
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.060
Size is counting not moving right.

150
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.860
It's going to return an integer.

151
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.060
How many things are in play or words at the moment.

152
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:59.450
Well when we first run it it's 0 which is really useful for us because 0 is the first thing right now

153
00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:04.750
prompt player isn't happening anywhere so let's put it someplace let's put it at the end of text entered

154
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.570
a prompt under score play.

155
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.210
And I also want it at the beginning of the story prompt underscore player.

156
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.650
And while I'm here.

157
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.150
This won't work right in ready.

158
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.020
The first thing we're doing is telling the story.

159
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.510
The story won't be ready.

160
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.880
So let's get rid of that.

161
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:29.210
This is going to keep happening forever and there's going to be an issue because well I'll show you.

162
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.820
It's going to keep happening for ever.

163
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.940
One two three four five.

164
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.040
There's an issue.

165
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.270
What's the issue.

166
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.990
It's trying to count along this prompter rate and it's run out of things so at some point it needs to

167
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.090
stop.

168
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.440
We need to check how many things are in here.

169
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:56.450
I want to create a brand new function and I'm going to call it Czech player word length.

170
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.340
It's a little long and clunky but I can look at it and see exactly what it is.

171
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.400
And if I've picked a name that's not sure I can write ascription here.

172
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.290
I'm not going to because I want to keep the amount of comments down.

173
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.380
OK.

174
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.430
How are we going to check the player work length for this.

175
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.070
I'm going to use an if statement.

176
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.520
Right.

177
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.250
If thing.

178
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.200
Clearly that's not what it's going to say.

179
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.500
But there's a few things we should know about it's first thing when I'm in an IF statement.

180
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.210
It'll indent everything in its indentation is a new code block being wrong here.

181
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.750
There's three things I can do.

182
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.000
I can do another if statement here.

183
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.080
I can do an l.f. and I can do an else.

184
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.030
Alright what do these mean.

185
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:44.790
If.

186
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.520
Thing.

187
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.850
So if thing is true or if thing is greater than zero whatever we want right.

188
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.110
If this condition is met do all of this stuff.

189
00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:00.180
It'll do this and then pass onto the next one and the next one says if other thing do whatever's in

190
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.270
here now because these are both.

191
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:10.290
If what it'll do is it'll run 24 whether or not 24 works whether or not it's true.

192
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.770
It'll move onto 28 if I don't want that to happen.

193
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:14.270
I can use.

194
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.210
Else if.

195
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.550
Else if.

196
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.580
If nothing above me has happened check this.

197
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.380
If this is true do this code.

198
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.430
If it's not move along.

199
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.160
Else is a catch all.

200
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.300
If nothing else in this condition has worked do this OK.

201
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.290
Clearly thing other thing and stuff is not what a code needs to look like.

202
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.400
So what do I need to do.

203
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:42.230
I want to check the player word size against the prompt size so I'm just correct that.

204
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:48.520
A quick reminder if I use one equal I am setting a value which doesn't make sense.

205
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:55.290
If check player word's size set now set it to prompt size that makes no logical sense.

206
00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.290
One equal a set two equals is check.

207
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.500
So if a player what size is the same size as the prompt size.

208
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:10.110
In other words if we have 1 2 3 4 5 in this cases things in here stop asking for props instead create

209
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.430
a brand new function and this function is going to be.

210
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.610
Tell story I shall write it here for now sir remember it's there.

211
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.210
It's not going to do anything to put that in.

212
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.270
So if it's there tell the story what if it's not there.

213
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.020
Well if that's not true.

214
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.970
Else.

215
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.350
Prompts the player.

216
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:41.510
So what we've created is a really simple if this is true then do this.

217
00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.490
If it's not asked the player and this will keep going to its right.

218
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:44.780
OK.

219
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.690
So let's actually get it to tell the story.

220
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.590
So what do we need for that.

221
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.820
Well we need blackboard story tax because that's what we're doing.

222
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.690
Text equals what doesn't need to equal.

223
00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:01.580
It has to be story with Claire underscore words in there.

224
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.070
We're almost done.

225
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.870
The one thing we need to do is actually call this function.

226
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:12.160
I make this mistake so many times are write a function and then wonder why it's not working and then

227
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.970
realize I haven't actually told it to work now because I'm doing it else prompt player I don't actually

228
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.250
need this promptly here.

229
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.150
So I'm going to put it right here instead of complex sort of prompting the player check to see if you

230
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.060
need to check play a word length.

231
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.240
All right let's give this a test.

232
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.500
Can I have a name.

233
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.680
Rick.

234
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.660
Rick can I have a thing banana.

235
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.400
Can I have a feeling slightly uneasy.

236
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.120
Another feeling dis com Bobby lated.

237
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.100
That's a tough word to type at this time of day.

238
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.580
And some things Katz.

239
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.080
Once upon a time a rick a banana and felt slightly uneasy.

240
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.920
It was a discombobulated day for all good cats.

241
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:01.610
Look at that.

242
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.810
We have some real function out here.

243
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.990
Which brings me to the challenge.

244
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:13.850
What I'd like you to do is take the script we've got so far and add a brief introduction to the player

245
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.820
when they first start the game.

246
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:21.290
So rather than just openings what we have which is can I have a name start with something like welcome

247
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.630
to Luni lips or hi you.

248
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.930
Or how you gonna say it.

249
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.000
Tell them what the game is and then move on to the player.

250
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.290
So give it a go.

251
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.970
Pause the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

252
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.950
How can we do this.

253
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.310
Well the first thing I do is put an introduction right here.

254
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.440
I could create a variable the rest of it but I'm going to do this one time.

255
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.760
There's no point so blackboard story text or text equals what I'm going to say.

256
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.250
Welcome to lunar eclipse.

257
00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:04.200
We're going to tell a story and have a lovely time because why not tell them what we're going to do.

258
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:04.640
OK.

259
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.380
Now if I run this what is actually to do is play the introduction immediately remove the introduction

260
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.750
and then the player.

261
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.140
So let's copy this in.

262
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.540
Ha ha.

263
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.330
And I don't need that.

264
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.970
And I'm going to put all this in brackets so that it knows it's all one thing.

265
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.440
Welcome to Luni lips.

266
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.310
We're going to tell a story.

267
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.150
Have a lovely time.

268
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.610
Can I have something please.

269
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.870
Now before we go any further this is one big chunk of text.

270
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.640
I want to put some line breaks in.

271
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.990
But the sex up a bit.

272
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.900
However if I try and put one in here.

273
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.610
God is going to complain because they cannot put a line break in the middle of a string just by pressing

274
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.490
Enter.

275
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.710
So to do this I'm gonna use an escape character his backslash.

276
00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:02.190
N that's the escape character in a string for a line break and haunt here and I'm going to put one right

277
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.820
here.

278
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.200
And then finally I'm going to remove prompt player right.

279
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.500
I don't need prompter player because I've got it here.

280
00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.690
So let's try that.

281
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.060
Welcome to Luni lips.

282
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.100
We're going to tell a story and have a lovely time.

283
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.450
Can I have a name please.

284
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.890
And I'm going to get rid of this space to make it look a little bit better and maybe put in a second

285
00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.100
one under linae Lips get rid of all these spaces I don't need.

286
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.500
And I play that.

287
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.710
Perfect.

288
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.970
Exactly what we need.

289
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:32.160
Quick heads up by the way there is currently a bug in the game that you should be aware of.

290
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.380
We're going to fix this a little later.

291
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.550
But just so you know it's there.

292
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.240
If I start the game right now.

293
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:42.740
And tell a story Let's see some numbers one two three four five.

294
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.410
Great.

295
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:49.830
If I type anything here the game is going to crash right and this is going to come completely unresponsive.

296
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.750
You're going to have to go back into God and press stop.

297
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:59.200
The reason is we're providing extra inputs extra player words and it doesn't know where to put them.

298
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.330
There's no prompt to ask for the next one.

299
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.900
So just be aware there is currently a bug we are going to fix that.

300
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.660
Which brings us the end of this video.

301
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.750
Lot of concern here.

302
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.440
We've learned how to find a specific entry in an array by Finers index.

303
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.360
We've learned how to use the append and size methods of an array.

304
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.620
And we've started using an if else condition to check if we still need words from a player.

305
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.060
So the next video we're going to start creating multiple stories and put them into a template.

306
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.560
Our game is almost complete.

307
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.630
Great work so far and soon the next video.
