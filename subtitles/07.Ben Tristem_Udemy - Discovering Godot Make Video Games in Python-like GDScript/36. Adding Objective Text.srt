1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,710
Hello again, you.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,420
Fantastic, got two people in this video going to finish off a tutorial and we to do that by giving

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,500
text to the player.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,990
I wanna give a little bit of flavor text with some instructions on it.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,850
So what do we need to do with our tutorial text on design this before I start coding it?

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,130
First thing I'm going to give the tutorial it's own gooey nice nine patch rectangle in the bottom center

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:24,640
of the screen.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,030
Each stage of the tutorial has its own text.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,620
So it's not just one big wall of text.

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:31,120
It's like little bullet points.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:31,330
Right?

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,970
Here's the link piece of information you need right now.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,680
I don't want to just give like a page full of instructions.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,780
It's really great way to lose players by implication.

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,690
Moving onto the next stage will show the next piece of text.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:43,870
Right.

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,310
It should just happen automatically.

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,290
And we're also gonna look at multi-line strings and gotta I'll explain that when we get to it.

19
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm quite excited and kind of wanted to tease it.

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,240
Okay.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:01:01,960
In together we go to Okmulgee Dorio level, so into the to do tutorial here and I want the gluey here.

22
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,380
I'm going to create the base of it here.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,800
In this scene and then branch it out without using.

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,780
So what I want to do is making you canvas layer.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,720
Can thus lay low.

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,080
Now, why am I making a canvas lair for Glee?

27
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,210
Well, the reason for that is canvas.

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,740
Leather means stick this to the rendering, to the camera effectively.

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,150
Right.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,830
Not to the level, not to the world.

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,150
Stick it to my point of view.

32
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,430
If I'm making a gooey element, that's what I want.

33
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,350
And I'm this horrible gooey ants.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,910
Give that a capital T at the beginning.

35
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,120
Great.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,370
And now one, a safe brunches scene.

37
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,420
And I'm gonna put this in the interface.

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,530
There we go.

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,060
Because it's an interface item.

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,110
All right.

41
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,390
So now we're open that.

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,310
So here is actually Tauro Gooey.

43
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,050
And I'm going to make the base node followed just so it knows everything.

44
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,580
But beneath this is gooey.

45
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,000
I make that for Recht and I'm an anchor it to the bottom.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,340
Right.

47
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,500
We've done this lots of times.

48
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,680
Right.

49
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,880
OK.

50
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,870
Within that I will put a nine patch right tackle nine patch recht seen these before.

51
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,040
So the graphics I get to interface, I'm not a Panji and I won't want these less glass pieces.

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm going to use to do.

53
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,270
Would you go.

54
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,610
Glass panel.

55
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,210
Not glass panel.

56
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,690
Glass panel projection because it's got a really cool shape.

57
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,120
OK.

58
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,750
So how big do I want this.

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm gonna say 600 wide by 900.

60
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,800
Not nine hundred twenty one ninety high.

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,640
I can't read my notes.

62
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,480
One ninety.

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,800
Hi.

64
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:40,700
Great.

65
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,510
OK.

66
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,400
Now we need to put the patch margins in.

67
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,880
I'd say 12 when each side has been working the past.

68
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,860
That's pretty good.

69
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,240
Maybe a little higher.

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,750
The top.

71
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,140
Now.

72
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,020
Twelvetrees.

73
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,520
Now, that storm was expected to be that easy.

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,420
OK, so layout's.

75
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,870
Well, first, I need to anchor this to the bottom.

76
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,100
Right.

77
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:11,190
And I move with the layout in bottom center, which is doo doo doo doo Santa bottom.

78
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,860
And I went right up against the bottom here.

79
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,480
So I'm going to give a margin.

80
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:22,290
Let's go to margins and let's say negative 12 from the bottom just to get a little bit of space.

81
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:22,930
OK.

82
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,810
So that is on my patch right tackle.

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,730
Let's add the themes.

84
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,910
I'm going to back the control and load in the theme and interface theme.

85
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,640
And the reason I'm doing that is we're about to add a label at the label.

86
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,060
I know what they should be as a child with my patch right tackle.

87
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,320
So we keep it size.

88
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,120
So label and I want this to be full rectangle, but I want some margins on this as well.

89
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,010
So it's a 12 for the left.

90
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,550
Twelve flat top negative.

91
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,440
Twelve from the right negative.

92
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,280
Twelve from the bottom.

93
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,470
So out label.

94
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,550
And let's just test it.

95
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,190
This is working.

96
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:07,230
There once was a lovely cucumber sandwich called heaven.

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,840
You see, now it's important to type in some test, some texts, test text who want to type in some

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,960
test text when you're making these things, because I need to know that this is set up correctly.

99
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,600
And one of these I can see right away is auto wrap is non.

100
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,820
So let's just make sure it's back and put the size in.

101
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,110
So full rectangle loop margins.

102
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,350
Well, 12 and negative 12, negative twelve.

103
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,160
And that's looking pretty good.

104
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,030
OK, a save that and head back to the tutorial and make sure it's visible so as much you taurel going.

105
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,790
Let's bring you all a little bit dupatta bidu.

106
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,290
Yeah.

107
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,570
And to run this scene, make this like a big hit tutorial.

108
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,890
OK, so that's not why I anchored correctly, is it?

109
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,780
Had it's overlapping suspicions.

110
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,430
Let's go take a quick look at it.

111
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,780
So if you're getting that error like I was, just make sure that you've laid it properly.

112
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,590
That's my fault.

113
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,460
I anchored to the bottom.

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:14,670
Right.

115
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,000
I should have.

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,270
I get it's a full rectangle.

117
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,590
It's just double check that looks in 20.

118
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,180
Turrill make this nice and big and lasting much better.

119
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,550
Now, there's possibly a bit why.

120
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,570
And I can make that narrow.

121
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,540
So do that now.

122
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,790
That's a five hundred wide.

123
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:38,440
I'm just gonna have to quickly go sente bottom again and bottom and that should be a little bit better.

124
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,810
This screen size.

125
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:41,830
Okay.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,630
I can live on that.

127
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,310
I'd rather be playing full screen.

128
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,810
But anyway, I can live with that.

129
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,360
So with that done, let's now stop making these text things.

130
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,730
So I'm going to close Munchy Turrill.

131
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,670
And I want to bring in a bunch of text.

132
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,470
Now, we could do this as a Jason file.

133
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,530
We could do it as a bunch of variables over an array.

134
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,940
But I want to separate out the data from the code.

135
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,390
Right.

136
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,160
We want to keep this as separate as possible.

137
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,790
I want to make this easy to add more objective's the rest of it.

138
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,700
Done it here with our areas and our objective positions.

139
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,800
So I'll make a brand new organizing node.

140
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,140
And I'm in a call this objective messages.

141
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,440
I think it's about objective correctly.

142
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,400
Pretty short it.

143
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,460
And let's put you right there.

144
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:32,910
And you know what?

145
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,650
I don't know why I've got the gooey opened up.

146
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,250
Well, the door was.

147
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,150
Oh, that's OK.

148
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,970
That's looking much better.

149
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,120
So we want to bring in a bunch of messages.

150
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,500
And I want to have each node as a message, just like we did with Allouni lips.

151
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,330
So I'm going to add in a brand new basic node.

152
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,070
Alamdar, call this template, template, message, message, template.

153
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,370
Message.

154
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:55,870
Template.

155
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,580
Much better grammar.

156
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,500
Analysts save that branch as a scene.

157
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,840
And should that be an interface thing?

158
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,200
It isn't.

159
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,660
It facings.

160
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,700
Want to put it in the interface.

161
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,600
Let's open it now.

162
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,400
Every message template is going to have a very, very, very simple script.

163
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,450
Specifically.

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,790
That's got to have something called message, which to export out as a string.

165
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,770
Here's the thing.

166
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,850
When we were doing Looney LEPs, I was OK with that because most of what we're typing was just individual

167
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,310
problems.

168
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,610
Right.

169
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,000
But I can't type of big message in here.

170
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,550
Welcome to the game.

171
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,960
Like, that's really hard to do.

172
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,490
So we are going to start using a little bit of typed G.D. script.

173
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm going to tell it what type of variables is.

174
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,150
It's a string.

175
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,410
It can only be a string.

176
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:40,850
OK.

177
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,670
So that's exactly the same.

178
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:42,850
Right.

179
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,890
So I click on this is just a string.

180
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,530
But I can do comma and then all in caps, and this is important.

181
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,190
All in caps.

182
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,870
Multi line.

183
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,050
Save that.

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,630
And I have a giant tax box, and I'm very happy with that.

185
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,760
So we have this message template that we can just instance in a bunch of times.

186
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,350
So I'm gonna go back to my tutorial thing and I'm going to call this welcome message.

187
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,580
So we need to welcome message.

188
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,700
What else we need a second look what you Turrill script.

189
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,400
We've got the welcome message.

190
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,930
We need another one for the door.

191
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,150
Always want to duplicate you.

192
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,090
And I'm going to call you double message.

193
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,410
So what happens when you get to the door?

194
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,680
And what happens when you get to do to do the night vision Marcus and night vision message?

195
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,170
And then we need one for when he gets the loot for the want to get to the loot.

196
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,930
So there's going to be loot.

197
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,020
Message.

198
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,840
And one more one you need for the exit.

199
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,590
So exit message.

200
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,550
OK, so now.

201
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,680
So now I've got nice multi-line string text boxes that I can write in.

202
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,550
So let's try.

203
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,520
Welcome.

204
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,790
You know what?

205
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,920
I don't want the output.

206
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,190
Oh, welcome.

207
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,310
Iced my stuff to your first day of training.

208
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,870
Please proceed to the.

209
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,030
Objective marker.

210
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,360
Using the.

211
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:36,910
W.

212
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,360
A.

213
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,120
S.

214
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,030
DTD, Tindouf.

215
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,510
Now I'm using WMD because that's my keyboard layout.

216
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,500
If you're using a different one.

217
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,310
Use a different one.

218
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,830
If I was releasing this commercially and I was letting players pick their own key bindings or create

219
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,080
their own key bindings, I wouldn't do it this way.

220
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,220
Right.

221
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,160
I would make a more complicated script that would look up the correct key parts.

222
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,600
But as I'm not doing that, this will work great.

223
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,070
OK, so there's my first message that's put a door message, click over here.

224
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,630
And I've been excellent.

225
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:26,330
Now we'll practice interacting with objects, stand close to the door and click on it with the mouse

226
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,230
and left.

227
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,740
Click on it.

228
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,020
Great.

229
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:45,600
Now we tend to introduce night vision, so he'll be working in the dark a lot, so we've provided you

230
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,090
with a t o u c a an.

231
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,990
Night vision module.

232
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,670
Activate or deactivate it with the.

233
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,850
Base, he was T.O., U.S.A..

234
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,540
That's all.

235
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,270
I've no idea what a fumble for yourself, but I'm quite popular.

236
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,910
So that's that one.

237
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,810
Now, when you lose one before you can leave.

238
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,780
You'll have to grab that suitcase.

239
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,710
Great.

240
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,990
No, I'm not typing great, I say get to the chopper next line.

241
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,900
Sorry, got carried away with the loot acquired.

242
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,620
That's it.

243
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:45,220
To say now that you the exit is unlocked, head to it.

244
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,400
Awesome.

245
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,190
So we now have these objective markets.

246
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,310
So how do we get in working?

247
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,200
Well, we've kind of done this already.

248
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,260
Have we right here in Update 2.0 position?

249
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,930
Well, we would have the objective number, and it's the same as we have over here in these messages.

250
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,150
So let's just make a new variable for the message.

251
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,160
Terrible message.

252
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,460
Equals objective.

253
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,810
Messages.

254
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Get child.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,910
Objective number.

256
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,310
And when we play the sound, let's also get our tutorial gooey.

257
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:35,170
Nine patch label, dot text equals message, dot message.

258
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,040
Why message, dot message?

259
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,390
Because that's the name of the string we use.

260
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,580
Right.

261
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,210
If I just write message, I'm going to give it the note.

262
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,120
I don't want the node.

263
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,320
I want the variable within that script.

264
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,220
So let's give it a shot.

265
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,780
So nice big screen tutorial.

266
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,460
Oh, nice.

267
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:52,750
OK.

268
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,320
Now this Texas too small.

269
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,070
We can fix that in a minute.

270
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,440
Look, it's changing.

271
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,790
Double click on the like a little.

272
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,380
My door's not looking.

273
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,650
OK.

274
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,530
We'll fix that in a moment.

275
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,320
First, I will make that Texel smaller.

276
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,780
So that's what you Turrill gooey.

277
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,730
And let's take a look at Tutee.

278
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:15,370
OK.

279
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,060
So we are currently using the theme.

280
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,160
And that's good.

281
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,760
But I might make a custom style or custom font.

282
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,840
Let's make a brand new dynamic font.

283
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,850
Click on it's.

284
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,920
So dynamic fault.

285
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,320
Thank you.

286
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,090
Look at.

287
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,060
And click on a font, load the font.

288
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,400
And let's say you're going to be a graphics interface fonts.

289
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:46,020
I'm going to use the fin font and settings, that's a little too small.

290
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,570
32 is way too big.

291
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,120
20 is pretty good.

292
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,320
18.

293
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,210
Yeah, I can live with that.

294
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,190
That's how that looks

295
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,260
tutorial.

296
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,310
Okay, that's a lot.

297
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,590
Let's look over here now.

298
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:08,080
I think the reason why this isn't working and after a little bit of debugging, I found the problem.

299
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,450
I don't it's right here in the control node.

300
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,100
I've made this control node cover the entire screen as an invisible piece of gooey.

301
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,680
I would make sure that the mouse knows to ignore it.

302
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,260
Otherwise, I'll never actually click the door.

303
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,010
So one more time, let's quickly check our tutorial.

304
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,350
She Doyel.

305
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,440
Welcome, Heise Meister to your first day of training.

306
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,780
Please proceed to the objective market using the W.

307
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,470
A.

308
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,540
S and D keys to move.

309
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,960
To do keys to move up.

310
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,400
That's good.

311
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,450
Excellent.

312
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,590
Now a practice interacting with objects that close the door preset.

313
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,710
That goes the door.

314
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,410
Fantastic.

315
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,030
You two can transmit to Ken.

316
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,510
La la la la la la.

317
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,560
We can leave it to grab that suitcase.

318
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,150
Awesome.

319
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,430
And now get the exit.

320
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,620
Look at that.

321
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,150
Excellent.

322
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,300
Now the door is a little dark.

323
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,550
This tutorials will do one more thing on this light right here, which is I think this one.

324
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,210
Excellent.

325
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,690
I want to go to Chateau.

326
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,630
Item Como's.

327
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,700
And I'm going to let it right everything, including the inside the doll.

328
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,920
It's called no occlusion.

329
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,480
So let's take a quick look.

330
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
And that door is now lit.

331
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,540
I feel pretty good about that.

332
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,210
And that is a great place to stop.

333
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,800
Has a little bit of tweaking still to go.

334
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,970
And I want to animate that.

335
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,830
That gooey message on the bottom.

336
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,730
But that is a working tutorial, so.

337
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,590
Excellent work.

338
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,080
And I'll see you in the next video.
