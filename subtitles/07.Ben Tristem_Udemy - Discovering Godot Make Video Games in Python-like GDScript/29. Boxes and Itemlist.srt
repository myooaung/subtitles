00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,360
Hello again you fantastic go to people in this video.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,850
We're going to build on what we did with the disguised box in the sky you box is a great fun of stealth

3
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:19,240
games but we went in limited how many the player can have which means the player should know how many

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,590
you have left unless it's a really good gameplay reason to hide that information we should make it easy

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,320
so we're going to add it to our gooey and to do that we're going to use a node called item list and

6
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,960
item lists are awesome that typically used for inventory or hot bars but they can also be used for displays

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,890
so if you can display disguise what do we need to know.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,190
First we're going to have a gooey element that shows the disguise as an icon.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,810
We just got a little picture of a box with a heading this has disguises.

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,970
We're gonna update this element with the correct number of icons.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,790
We shouldn't know how many disguises the player has.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,570
So let's jump right into it and first thing to do is I'm gonna open my play a script.

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,750
Here's my plan script and I'm also going to poke my gooey script was not the interface and it's under

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:08,120
gooey OK so I've already got the suspicion meter so as a child of this control node we press control

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:15,060
a lot like an item list and let's quickly take a look at what the item list does when a right click

16
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,390
on it and go open documentation and we can take a look at all of this.

17
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:27,000
What I'm specifically interested in is to do add I can item now there's two things we can do.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,480
We can add an item which is something with text and an icon or just the icon is going to take that the

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,870
texture and the selectable and just to really drive that whole here's a little slight for you.

20
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:45,680
Item list can add items with the texture and or label and we're specifically using add icon item the

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,660
texture icon which could be a PSG file going to load in and selectable is false because you don't want

22
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,520
a player to touch it it's not gonna work like a button it can work like a button but that's not how

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,600
we're going to use it.

24
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,300
Okay.

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,120
So with all that done we should pretty make it look good.

26
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,800
First off I don't want stuff the nightmares.

27
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,040
Let's got to that and I'm gonna make a brand new nine patch rectangles.

28
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,750
Let's go control a line patch.

29
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,520
Don't worry we're coming back tonight and list.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,010
I just got too excited.

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,570
Let's rename this because this disguise container

32
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,970
and it's gonna be a nine patch rectangle using one of these.

33
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:27,980
Now if I look under graphics and under interface and under Pinkie I've got to do it to do to do to do

34
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,200
a bunch of these glass panels and I want the one with the bottom right corner I believe is gonna be

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,440
that one.

36
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,910
Let's take a look.

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,790
That's the bottom left corner.

38
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,750
You've got Mike on it.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,840
You are excellent.

40
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,160
And I want to about the same with the suspicion which is let's take a look how big this is.

41
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,720
This is to 47.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,090
I feel like it should be round number but I'm going to put it 250.

43
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,120
It's got a width of 250.

44
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,840
And what's the height on this comeback.

45
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,200
Could just press my patch right to go here.

46
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,730
Height is 85.

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,030
Probably a little bit higher to be honest not fire taller.

48
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,620
That's why let's say let's call it one hundred and let's go a little bit wider.

49
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,440
I'm just doing this my eye right now.

50
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,020
OK.

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,190
Now currently we're not using the corners.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,270
Let's do that.

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,690
I'm gonna go to axis now patch margin that we got patch margin and say 12 pixels on each side.

54
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,910
And that's already looking a lot cleaner isn't it.

55
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,230
You know I should know I'm not gonna rename that.

56
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,630
That's fine.

57
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:32,990
Okay.

58
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:43,420
Now let's add in a V box container and I'm going to go full rectangle that's going to cover all of that

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,240
and let's give it some margin so it doesn't go over the borders.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:54,800
So I'm gonna go to to do margin say 12 pixels on each side and it's twelve minus twelve from the bottom.

61
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,580
Great.

62
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,620
And while we're here let's move the disguise container.

63
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:05,240
So I'm was going to you know I'm going to go down to rect and go to a position which could drag over

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,050
the X say house where it's about 30 pixels.

65
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,810
Yeah about 30 pixels from the 30 pixels from the top.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,150
Too much it's a little bit too much on the top isn't.

67
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,860
So as you can see if Justin's by eyeball what feels right it's a 20 and that's looking pretty solid.

68
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,200
Okay.

69
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,030
Within that I need a labels as go like

70
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,180
label let me.

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,470
I would like to wear disguises.

72
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,510
Now it's using the theme that we've only got logged in because the theme is set to control.

73
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,690
So all of its children will use the same theme.

74
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,350
So that's pretty fun.

75
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:53,550
Now you put an item list do to do to do item list and one thing you'll notice you want to add in a test

76
00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:05,610
once so items at the top you go at and let's load in graphics PMG tiles and it's fine that box 129 and

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,050
you can already see that we can't see it's auto height.

78
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,300
Okay so one is too big and too it's not got anything except for the theme 3 it's got item 0.

79
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,840
Let's fix that last problem first the items that's going to rub out the text but secondly we do make

80
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,750
sure got items selected go down to icon.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,970
Let's say that's a zero point five.

82
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:33,900
Now if this doesn't update straightaway just change this icon mode top of left or change window.

83
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,730
It just got out.

84
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,820
Not yet updating I think has been fixed in later versions but look in check.

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,780
Finally let's fix the themes only go back to control with my theme is click on the thing I want to add

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,690
plus item press the three dots and press item list H I.

87
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,700
I know my alphabet.

88
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,010
OK.

89
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,780
So we should now have item list right here on the styles background.

90
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,780
I just want style box empty.

91
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,550
Boom.

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,670
Let's do that with all of them just to be absolutely clear.

93
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,950
And now all of our item lists will be completely transparent.

94
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,600
And that is pretty much set up.

95
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,810
I do want to call this disguise counter just so I know what it is when I look at the scenery and I want

96
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,540
to add it to the group.

97
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,160
So let's as the group disguise display.

98
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,060
All right so what's going to happen.

99
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,810
Going to make a group call that's going to tell disguise display.

100
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,860
This is how many disguises you have.

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,570
Please update yourself sets out a script to disguise counter interface disguise counter.

102
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,580
It looks good.

103
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,810
And this is a really easy script so it's going to.

104
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:49,590
And call it up date disguises and we're going to get an argument through from whoever up there.

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Yeah.

106
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,140
And watch the screen.

107
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,300
I will give you at the argument of how many disguises we have from the player or whoever calls it the

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,370
disguise count counter doesn't really care who calls it.

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
That's the beauty of using signals and group calls.

110
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,430
So you can get a number pass through.

111
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,870
First thing I do is I'm gonna clear what is clear to Mr. Glick hold control I'm gonna click on it removes

112
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,740
all item from the list so who's empty the list out completely.

113
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,360
So every time this function is called you'll just empty the list OK.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,730
So now we want a for loop.

115
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:28,100
So for disguises just a variable that we're naming right now in range.

116
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,380
There we go.

117
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,200
And it's in range of number.

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,320
So while the integer disguises is within whatever number is surface 3 it'll go 1 2 3.

119
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,910
What do we want to add icon item.

120
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,160
Great.

121
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,480
And it wants two things it wants this texture and we need to load that in and let's go find it.

122
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,810
It's the P and G it's on the tiles and it is tile one 2 Nine is one I'm using or whatever one you're

123
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,620
using.

124
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:07,290
So first we load them in and that's and say Is it selectable false and that is that script.

125
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,210
So now we can just close the gooey entirely I should left it open just in case do some typos but let's

126
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,350
make this nice and easy.

127
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,680
So we've already got the number of disguises right here.

128
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,450
So that's we're going to pass through.

129
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:31,550
So let's go get free and cool group and it's disguised display.

130
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,060
I think that we shouldn't close that window.

131
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,180
I might have done it now.

132
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,900
I see if I can do this.

133
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:36,850
OK.

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,190
The method which can be passed through is a string and this is update disguises and we're gonna pass

135
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:51,750
through an argument and it's going to be number of disguises.

136
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,860
OK so that's going to be doing well you can say call the group disguise display tell it to run this

137
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,750
function with this argument and at this point the play script doesn't care what happens is information

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,490
that's important.

139
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,700
If this is type out if this is type owed it won't work and it won't throw up an error.

140
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,460
Let's see if it works if it works.

141
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,480
What I'm expecting to see and I don't know.

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,710
I'm not editing ahead but I'm expecting to see three boxes in the disguises.

143
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,750
Let's take a look.

144
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,430
We do.

145
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,630
But they're going down.

146
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,220
That's easy.

147
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,940
We can fix that.

148
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,210
Let's go right back to a facts.

149
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,170
Yes interface.

150
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,580
There it is.

151
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,250
GARY Hello Gary.

152
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:41,550
OK so the thing I forgot to do is under columns I want to make sure that it's not just one column.

153
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,390
How do you think it fit.

154
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,050
I reckon seven I'm eyeballing that.

155
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,220
So now we press play it knows we have three disguises.

156
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:58,060
However we haven't yet told it to update when I use the disguises and that is my challenge for you.

157
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,820
I would like you to have the item list update when the player uses a disguise.

158
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,560
Every time the players disguised have the item list update we could later on also put something where

159
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,240
the player could find new disguises but we won't be doing that in this course.

160
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,910
But it's quite easy to do so pulls a video give it a shot.

161
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,980
And when you're ready come back and I'll show you my solution.

162
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,500
All right.

163
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,420
Let's take a look.

164
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:32,830
So all I need to do is go back to my play a script and let's make this Listen big under the skies.

165
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:38,800
I just need to call that group call after number of disguises negative equals one as long as it's after

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,450
that it'll work just fine.

167
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,650
So let's just grab this back up to I play a thing.

168
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:43,900
I'm sure.

169
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,540
Copy this line back to the bottom of the script.

170
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,200
I use control end to jump to the left and right off this line.

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,300
I'm going to write this in.

172
00:10:51,330 --> 00:11:01,140
I make sure that the right indentation let's see if it works three disguises two disguises one disguise

173
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:08,220
no disguises can't disguise look at that and we didn't need it because in the top left which is where

174
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,780
we expected to be so it'll work just fine whatever size screen it is.

175
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,140
And I am pretty happy with that in this video.

176
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,140
We've updated the icons using simple group calls.

177
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,790
You can also use signal calls and we've learned the item lists are awesome we can use them to very quickly

178
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,590
show numbers of lives coins and all the rest of it.

179
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,040
We don't want your show text so excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
