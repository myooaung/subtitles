00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.110
Hello again lovely God.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.220
People in this video we're going to add the food to food fight.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.810
We want food flowing and fire projectiles in three dimensions.

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.360
This is something that comes up a lot again.

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.740
If we want to project asked to be something other than a ray.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.240
Right so we could use a break cast in 3-d.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.020
And you say you start here and you immediately land that if we want to physically model a projectile

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.160
moving through space how do we do that.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.340
Well first let's talk about what we want our project to be because this game has lots of fun silly furniture

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.210
flying around the place and bystanders being hit by food.

11
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.610
I want a rigid body because we use lots of physics.

12
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.950
I guess I want collisions I want things flying off and I want these projectiles to be randomly selected.

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.470
It's not just going to be a single item of food you don't just throw hotdogs and it's not going to go

14
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.490
through them in order.

15
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.820
It's not hamburger hotdog cake hamburger hotdog cake.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.230
So we've got two major things we need to do.

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.160
So let's get into godda and the first thing it does is.

18
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.670
Oh no my level has vanished.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.570
That's because my basic level the default level is level template and I no longer want that to be the

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.980
case.

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.830
So we were to project settings and in config I'm going to change my default level.

22
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.350
I actually don't mean config I mean runs I mean hit run and I don't want level templates.

23
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.080
Let's go to the folder hit file and the scenes levels.

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.060
Level 1.

25
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.080
Great.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.270
Level 1 is now by default level.

27
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.490
So that's what's going to open each time.

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.300
Let's open that right now.

29
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.290
Level template up in the background in case I want to add a thing.

30
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.990
OK so here is our level and we want a way of adding to it.

31
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.440
First thing I want to do is know where the food is going to launch from.

32
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.380
I don't want the food to launch from inside the character of the feet or from the head.

33
00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.270
So I'm going to open the player that's close walls to play a scene and I can open it inside the character.

34
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.690
And the reason I'm doing this is NPR sees who will also be who also inherit the character scene are

35
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.110
going to have the same attribute on a fire project off from a place.

36
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.930
So let's add a position 3D not exactly like a position to me but this is a position 3D.

37
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.840
And let's say you launch frahm what looks good.

38
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.170
It's here to change that.

39
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.480
And I'm gonna call that forward.

40
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.020
Let's just do a quick sanity check.

41
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.910
Save that and go to the mail player.

42
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
Where is forward forward is off to the side and where the hell is okay.

43
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.570
Why are you off to the side.

44
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.690
Because that's not forward.

45
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.200
If I look at my plam I want blue it's forward not red.

46
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.830
Well that's fine.

47
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.670
I can fix that.

48
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.880
So I'm going to move forward to over here.

49
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.660
Now all this is doing is marking a position.

50
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.590
This is marking which direction is forward.

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.780
Should turn off snap and move that to a slightly better place.

52
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.240
Think about that.

53
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.180
There.

54
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.040
This is where the project is going to go say that and like there is forward.

55
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.270
Fantastic.

56
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.990
Next thing I need to do is create a scene for the projectile.

57
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.970
Let's do that now and go make a new scene and my base is going to be a rigid body.

58
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.250
That's my bass note and I'm going to call this projectile.

59
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.560
Now all the other types of projectile the hamburger the hot dog everything else are going to inherit

60
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.250
from this.

61
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.990
But I really mean I need a few things.

62
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.660
The first is the projector has a mesh sallus given it mesh instance and as a default I'm just going

63
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.960
to give it a cylinder not a cylinder.

64
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.650
I lied.

65
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.930
I mean a sphere.

66
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.870
Not sure why I thought the two things were interchangeable then.

67
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.620
And I want a collision.

68
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.960
So that's two nice colours and a collision shape ixo and that's also going to be a sphere.

69
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.960
Now each individual projectile might have a different shape collision.

70
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.960
This is a good starting point and I can tweak the original inheriting scene so that if we need all of

71
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.360
them to bigger audiences smaller That's easy enough to do.

72
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.880
But here is what our basic projects can look like.

73
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.770
Let's say that the scenes end in ammo.

74
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.500
I'm going to put it right in here.

75
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.600
And to save projectile TSC.

76
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.740
Okay let's talk about what happens when we fire.

77
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.030
I'm actually at this in character not in the player.

78
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.140
Now that's a slight problem because if we look at the script player dodgy disinherits of kit kinematic

79
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.950
body.

80
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.630
Now I'm saying I want to inherit from the character right the character is going to have something called

81
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.140
fire that both players and non player characters can do.

82
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.040
So I need to change what this extends well that's okay I can do that.

83
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.330
First let's go into character.

84
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.490
Make a new scene and I call it character Judy.

85
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.690
And as you might expect I'm going to put it in my scripts folder.

86
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.140
Character is not Judy.

87
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.040
And there it is.

88
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.140
Now I'm don't you go find it in Scripps.

89
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.490
I'm going to right click on character and do copy part back into play a lot.

90
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.820
And instead of it extends kinematic body I'm going to put some quotes in and just place that in.

91
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.130
So this script will now extend character.

92
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.100
Judge Judy let's make sure it's working.

93
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.830
I run the getting.

94
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.400
Everything works exactly as it did before.

95
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.970
So we now have a working script for the player there's extending from the carroty dodginess script.

96
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.170
Great.

97
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.190
So what do we want encouraged thought Judy.

98
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.340
Well the first thing I want is a function called fire.

99
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.500
And it's probably called Fire.

100
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.930
It's in my past for now.

101
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.730
Let's actually make fire do something.

102
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.170
I'm going to go in to my impact maps and I need to add a new action.

103
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.190
My action is going to be caught fire.

104
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.770
I'm going to map this to a mouse button.

105
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.050
It's going to be a left mouse button on device era.

106
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.050
It's theoretically possible to have multiple mice.

107
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.980
I've only got one and I want the left mouse spun.

108
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.240
There it is.

109
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.790
Let's just check that works some new function.

110
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.310
I'm going to put this as an input USCO all the way to the bottom and say function in.

111
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.340
If event Scott a distraction free mode there were no events if input.

112
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.560
What I mean is action pressed.

113
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.400
I mean just pressed because I'm not gonna hold it down and I want fire.

114
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.240
Let's just take it works right Soldo prints were missing.

115
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.910
They're on fire.

116
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.820
Get out of distraction free mode.

117
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.700
Pressplay and fire.

118
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.250
Great.

119
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.220
Every time I press the button we see fire.

120
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.940
Awesome.

121
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:44.570
Clear that.

122
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.020
And I probably don't need it.

123
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.000
I guess that's not going to happen if that then this went to run the fire thing let's just check that

124
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.800
works into my character script and do the exact same thing just to make sure that the chain works great.

125
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.650
So now when I press Fire.

126
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.470
Fire comes up in the output.

127
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.110
Awesome.

128
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.940
Well I don't want to print the what file I want to spawn a child I want to spawn a projectile a bullet

129
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.870
and that bullet is going to go forward.

130
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.480
We have built a little bit of what we're talking about with bases matrices.

131
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.080
So first thing I need to do is define what the bullets going to be.

132
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.720
So this week a new variable within this function I'm gonna call it a bullet.

133
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.250
And that's going to be well let's get the path right load.

134
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.770
I can find our bullet in the scenes scenes and there is a projectile.

135
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.210
So Copic path I'm going to load this in.

136
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.080
Well essentially to load this in.

137
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.180
But actually I don't want to just load the scene.

138
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.620
I want an instance of the seats I love use.

139
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.830
Instance.

140
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.500
Now I want to add that to the scene and child.

141
00:07:53.680 --> 00:08:00.940
Bullet bullet is this file with added this file as an instance of the sea and specifically it's going

142
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.990
to be a child of a character in our case here.

143
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.240
It's a child of the player.

144
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:05.780
OK.

145
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.960
But Help wanted to be a child of the play.

146
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.860
And the reason why is when I move the player the bullet will move relative to the play.

147
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.440
And that's terrible.

148
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.630
Not terrible but inconvenient on a set.

149
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:22.070
This as the top level is going to be a direct child of the of the root of this scene.

150
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.170
Okay how do I do that.

151
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.800
Well luckily spatial can do that for us.

152
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:34.090
If I open up the classes and type in special we see a bunch of different methods.

153
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:40.340
And one of them is this one here set as toplevel makes that note ignore its parents transformations.

154
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.830
Perfect exactly what we want.

155
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:48.610
So let's do that as do bullet Dot sat as top level.

156
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.220
And this takes an argument enable or disable.

157
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.810
Well I want this enabled so little but true.

158
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.090
Awesome.

159
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.810
All right so we've spawned a ball and we've told it you don't take the same transform as your as your

160
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.270
parent.

161
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.300
Right so ignore where your parents and space and where is moving and everything else.

162
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.910
And now we want the bullet to actually move.

163
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.590
Okay it's going to be fired.

164
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.380
Well we can do that.

165
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.130
Let's go.

166
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.740
Bullet.

167
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.290
Got global underscored transform.

168
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.000
And what they're going to be.

169
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.720
Well we already have forward for this very reason right something for a global currency.

170
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:33.960
So what you just told it is your position is now where the forward child of this node is so on the player.

171
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.540
FORD No they're on the NPC for dinner there.

172
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.050
Okay so we move the bullet.

173
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:44.620
Now we want to move in space of the need to project speed so sign for a new instance variable and call

174
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.240
this variable projectile speed.

175
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.610
And you know what this is probably a constant So let's make this a constant and call that projectile

176
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.320
speed because this is not going be changed at run time.

177
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.630
If I wanted a change at run time if I wanted a game with power ups it speed up or down.

178
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.120
Well that's that's how I'd do it.

179
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.640
But cosmical projectile speed and I'm going to set this to what's a good number I don't say 50.

180
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.960
I can always change it later.

181
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.270
Okay.

182
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.270
So how do you use that well first I need to know which way is the character facing and then I need to

183
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.640
say how fast you go.

184
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:25.110
So let's make new variable to figure out which way the characters faces character forward loops king

185
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.230
of typing.

186
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.880
And what's that's going to be get global transform.

187
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.190
And that's a function or a method rather.

188
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.570
And one of these is the basis right.

189
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.300
We've been working with basis is exactly the case we need it for.

190
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:48.480
And I'm looking specifically for which direction of facing an x y z.

191
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.230
That's the second one.

192
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.940
I can also type in Z here but I'm a Type in to just say could see the x y and z adjust positions within

193
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.960
the array.

194
00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.950
And I want this normalized.

195
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.310
So we've defined which way is forward so we know where the bullet starts and which way it should be

196
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.810
facing.

197
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:17.970
So let's make it do something bullet set linear velocity and that's going to be character forward times.

198
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.480
Project speed.

199
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.270
Okay.

200
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.180
Let's see if that works or Pressplay.

201
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.300
A giant thing comes in a look at that.

202
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.820
That is really fun.

203
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.570
This project are way too big but I can fix that a second.

204
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.070
One more thing I want to check just in case something goes wrong.

205
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.790
Let's make sure that the bullet can't hit the player.

206
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.960
Now I do want to add some collision masks.

207
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:53.640
But even before I do that let's go bullet dot and on a scale collision exception with.

208
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.740
Self.

209
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.720
Where am I getting that from.

210
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.520
Well that's a physics body function.

211
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.170
So this means when we start adding behaviour it for some reason forwards in the wrong place and this

212
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.790
spawns in inside the character that's firing it.

213
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:12.750
It doesn't matter because now I can fire a bunch of these now sometimes I'm firing multiples.

214
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:17.850
The reason is I've put no kind of time and I can just keep firing them and if I keep going eventually

215
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.540
this is going to go horrifically wrong.

216
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.210
You'll also notice that looking up doesn't change it.

217
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:32.280
And the reason is I've locked which way forward is if we wanted this to be a little different I wouldn't

218
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.280
actually put forward on the play I put on the camera but the player can't look up or down.

219
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:44.100
We've locked that in the player movement right in the camera script right here.

220
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:50.490
So what I've got is an ability to aim anywhere on the x and z axis and not on the Y.

221
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.380
Okay let's alter this projectile real quick.

222
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:59.740
Go to 3D Moto X I'm doing this is tube excel at Transformer you guys are at point five.

223
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.320
I will just go to the In Shape and move the radius to zero point five.

224
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.090
Awesome explain.

225
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.450
Great.

226
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:13.740
All right.

227
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.870
Right now this isn't food right.

228
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.640
This is Madden.

229
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.350
No ping pong balls.

230
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.260
A ball crawl of a ball crawl simulator.

231
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.150
I feel like I'm at Chucky Cheese in the States.

232
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.720
It's the best thing ever.

233
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.950
You also notice these things are very heavy.

234
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.350
I can't push them out the way I like a change.

235
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.780
That's what in a projectile.

236
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.070
And change the mass massive zero point five for example.

237
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.580
I can also change the speed that they're fine at that.

238
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.860
So now there's a mass there floating out the way I could kick some of them being wedged down the way

239
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.150
I'm not quite heavy enough but I can tweak all of these values.

240
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.790
So far so good but I don't want these to fill up the entire screen.

241
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.120
So I've got a challenge for you.

242
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.120
I'd like you to clean up the food.

243
00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.480
I realize right now it's not food.

244
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.770
It will be soon but I'd like you to clean up the food.

245
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.060
Have the food vanish after a set amount of time.

246
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.440
Pause the video have the food vanish after a few seconds.

247
00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:08.820
I don't know.

248
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.610
Three seconds a second.

249
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.530
Pick a number you like when you have a solution you like come back and I'll show you my solution.

250
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.620
And welcome back.

251
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.350
All right so to do this I want a projectile script right before I do anything else.

252
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.350
I'm going to need to interact with this project us.

253
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:33.380
I'm going to create a project script in my scripts folder so into scripts It's called Project projectile

254
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:33.990
Judy.

255
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.870
Good name.

256
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.770
Ellen's going to create a script.

257
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.330
Great.

258
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.890
Now I'm going to add a new node.

259
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.800
It's going to be a timer.

260
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.130
We used a few of these.

261
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.340
So there's a wait time for three seconds.

262
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.670
It's going to auto start and I'm going to connect it to it's perrottet on time out.

263
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.120
And all I do is say Q3.

264
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.620
And now I press play.

265
00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:01.810
One two three.

266
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.540
Boop.

267
00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:11.630
I have Fill this with food and it'll all vanish.

268
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.870
And that feels like a pretty goods start to our food firing system right.

269
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.470
There's a few things we still need to add.

270
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.570
I need to make sure that you can't keep firing food.

271
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:24.950
Eventually going to have an ammunition system in place to stop the feet from wobbling around.

272
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:33.220
But we're off to a pretty solid start for this game and the food isn't changing direction.

273
00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:40.050
If I change direction right we've solved that problem and the food even interacts with itself.

274
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.820
Some great physics going on here.

275
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.390
So that brings us to the end of this video.

276
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:50.190
In this video we've learned how to spawn a projectile and have it move in the direction the player is

277
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.910
facing without moving with the player which is key.

278
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.000
Any kind of third person action game shooter or anything like that.

279
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.240
This is a really good technique to have so excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
