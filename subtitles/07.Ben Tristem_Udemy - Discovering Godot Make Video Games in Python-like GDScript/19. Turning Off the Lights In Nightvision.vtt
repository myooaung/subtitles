00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.590
Welcome back you wonderful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.010
We're going extend the functionality of night vision.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.530
I would like to set it up so that all of the torches or flash lights are turned off when we're in night

4
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.100
vision mode and turned on we were in dark vision mode.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
The reason I'm doing this is I think night vision needs a penalty.

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.150
We've got this very dark and gloomy game and we've now given the player the ability to see wherever

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.590
they are very easily.

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.300
Now we do already have a penalty we've put a call down in.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
So the player can't spam the space and change vision modes very quickly.

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.960
However if the player can't see the NPC line of sight torches then that means that they're gonna have

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.370
to make some very tactical decisions.

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.410
What's more important to me right now understanding what's around me or understanding and how much danger

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.250
I meant by the way when we turn the torches off remember the line of sight will still work.

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060
The guards will still be able to see us.

15
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.170
That's because our torches have the same angle as our line of sight.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.920
But they are not out of sight.

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.860
They're two completely separate things.

18
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.510
OK so let's get to it first and is I'm going to get rid of this green overlay from that.

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.520
So let's go in to night vision wedgy vision mode and I'm just going to set the colour back to dark.

20
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.190
And the only reason I'm doing this is it makes it easier for me to visualize the level as the players

21
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.520
first going to see someone go in there and turn it back on.

22
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.840
Great.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.340
And also just now going to hide vision mode so I can see what I'm doing.

24
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.680
All right so let's talk about what's going to happen the players in the space Vision modes going to

25
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.810
change and all of the pieces are going to switch their torches off and then when we change back they

26
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.360
can all switch them on at the same time.

27
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.680
Now we've looked at how to do this with groups of the very first thing I'd like to do is add every single

28
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.360
camera and guard to a new group called NPC.

29
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.030
Now this is much only in the video than we normally do this but that's my challenge for you.

30
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.130
See if you can add all the pieces to a group.

31
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.800
Every camera and garden level should be part of a new group called mpac.

32
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.320
There's multiple ways you can do this.

33
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.120
My tip is try and future proof this.

34
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.060
Avoid having to remember to add new cameras and guards to this group.

35
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.570
If you add more later.

36
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.340
In other words if in a week's time you decide that we need a more camera.

37
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.090
Try and avoid the situation where you have to remember oh and this needs to be in this group so dont

38
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.710
worry if he get this a little bit wrong.

39
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.080
That's why we're practicing the pause the video.

40
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.310
Give this a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

41
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.920
Welcome back.

42
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.100
All right I mentioned there are multiple solutions.

43
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.220
So the first and probably simpler solution is to click on alp's not the fancher is to click on let's

44
00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.150
say a camera go into node go into groups and just add NPC and then do this for every single security

45
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.550
camera and every single guard and that will work.

46
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.150
But this is the future proofing I was talking about right.

47
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.230
This is now if I add a new camera I'm going to have to make sure that that camera is in this group some

48
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.730
remove this a second where we could do this is we could go into the security camera scene and add the

49
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.410
camera.

50
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.330
The base camera seen to that group.

51
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.150
Now we save that scene.

52
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.890
This camera will be in that group and that will work fine.

53
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.670
The third way is to do this in code.

54
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.890
Just make sure we're not in the group still good.

55
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.370
All cameras and pieces use the same script they all use play detection.

56
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.150
Now the guards are not running play the action.

57
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.450
They're running the god script with the gods script extends pled detection so if we change play detection

58
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.860
it'll change all them.

59
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.950
So I going to go and play the tangshan Detection and I'll make a ready function and this function is

60
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.110
going be function ready and it's going to go to group.

61
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.880
And P.S..

62
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.790
And that should be all I need.

63
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.850
I've also noticed that right here player although we did add it to the global script is not actually

64
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.610
being used that way so why don't we.

65
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.020
Do play calls global dot player.

66
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.530
And we've made this level neutral.

67
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.400
Great.

68
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.090
All guards and cameras.

69
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.310
The moment this script runs the moment ready starts running or at themselves and pieces so I don't have

70
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.170
to worry about who's in what group.

71
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.060
So let's save that going to use groups to call functions.

72
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.750
Let's put those functions in so we have two new functions going was give me function night vision mode

73
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.130
and I'm using the same typing that I use right here just to make it nice and Cliff myself and that's

74
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.620
going to do something.

75
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.650
And then right here they are a function.

76
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.250
Dark vision mode and we could add a whole bunch of revision modes.

77
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.230
As we've talked about before we're not going to but we could.

78
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.490
If you want to by the way go ahead that's great.

79
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.550
Extra work.

80
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:28.170
It's not parsing because I have too many times in here so let's get rid of these redundant tabs.

81
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.510
There we go.

82
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.500
Night vision mode.

83
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:40.570
So when when in night vision what's going to happen we're going to torch dot enabled equals false on

84
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.790
dark vision mode.

85
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.800
We're going to go torch dot enabled equals true.

86
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.250
And remember if you're not sure where to find that even go in to any script that use this.

87
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:59.230
A scene that uses rather look for a torch and under the inspector mouseover enabled and you can see

88
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.910
lower case enabled that the property will be changing so the script.

89
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.660
Save this.

90
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.600
Now we need to do is actually call this function.

91
00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.100
There's a couple of ways I could do this.

92
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:20.920
I could do this in player and just add it right here so I could add election line and go get tree core

93
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.340
group and p.c and do that.

94
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.560
Or I could do this in vision mode.

95
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.240
Now I could see an argument for this either way.

96
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.250
However as vision mode is the thing that's changing and the guards are etched into vision mode.

97
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.450
I'm tempted to put it here and one which doesn't make a single function Let's make this nice and easy.

98
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.370
I'm a call this inform guards now inform and pieces.

99
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.820
And this is going to be get tree dot call group.

100
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.840
Not great group flags which is core group with extra things you can add in.

101
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.150
We don't need that.

102
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.980
What do we call it in the NPC group and we need to call a string method.

103
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.860
I'm going to parse that string in here with vision mode and a call vision mode as I go in and vision

104
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.500
mode going to be either night vision or dark vision.

105
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:17.230
So right here I'm covert vision mode and naturally everything that this needs.

106
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.360
So now let's call in form pieces vision.

107
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.320
So let's do it right here in the top of night vision

108
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.530
and I need to make sure that they're going to call the correct function.

109
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.260
So let's go into play detection.

110
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.890
And call this night vision mode.

111
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.040
Let's put that as a strong reason doing this.

112
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.740
This has to be called a string.

113
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.720
If I don't call this a string it'll be called as a variable.

114
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.910
There is no variable called Night Vision mode beginning at terrible books.

115
00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.100
So we're going to pass a string called Night Vision mode to inform and pieces.

116
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.350
It doesn't actually matter what vision mode is.

117
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.100
I could call this banana.

118
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.960
I could call it King Bob or anything else from minions.

119
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.030
In fact it doesn't even have to be four minutes but I want to put vision mode just so I as the person

120
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.140
reading the code knows what's happening.

121
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.330
And now let's copy in form in pieces.

122
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.060
And a set of night vision mode we want dark vision.

123
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.450
And now let's see how that works out.

124
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:34.710
Let's see how this works.

125
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.600
Here I am wondering if the level I go into night vision mode I can't see any torches.

126
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.610
The guards are still there.

127
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.620
They can still see me although we haven't set up any way of the play and knowing that there's no penalty

128
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.090
right now there's no goalie but there will be.

129
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.160
But look at that.

130
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.050
Perfect.

131
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.720
We now have night vision working as night vision would be expected to work later on the game were going

132
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.220
to add labels to be part of the interface group and then when those labels receive that signal they're

133
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.270
going to put in everything that they need.

134
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.880
So we might say reception room office stuff like that.

135
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.730
And that brings us to the other video.

136
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.110
We've managed to do this very quickly because we spent so much time setting things up properly.

137
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.460
We've got our dependencies well set up our groups are calling nice and cleanly.

138
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.420
We've got a nice logical chain of events that leading to the torch is coming off.

139
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.670
We're in really good shape in this video.

140
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:34.240
We've had the pieces automatically add themselves to the NPC group and we have all the torches being

141
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:40.180
switched on and off as needed when vision mode changes excellent work and I'll see you in the next year.
