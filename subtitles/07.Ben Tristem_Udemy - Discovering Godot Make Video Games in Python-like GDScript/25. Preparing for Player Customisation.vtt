00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.560
Hello again Gloy has got people in this video going to start laying the groundwork for a customization

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.790
at the moment.

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.590
I have a single player character model by the end video.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.610
We're going to have to.

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.400
We're not yet going to switch between them but we're going to get ready to do so.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.630
So let's get into to got out and get started.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.190
As you might expect we're going to start in the play a scene.

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.420
So here's my play a song and just to remind ourselves what's happening.

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.850
The scene is called Play It.

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.870
I'm going to have a player if I'm a little distracted by this little jiggly dance I'm just going to

11
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.670
go into my animation tripler go to action.

12
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.090
One three note and put that close to the centre.

13
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.280
There we go a little better can close that now.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.930
All players are a form of cactus or inheriting from the character.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.370
We are inheriting everything great.

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.160
So this mesh in instance as our guideline the collision shape forward can fire and hurt effects that

17
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.150
that's common to all characters on top of that we are instancing in this omniture which is this Mash.

18
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.420
This animation tree player and this animation player or cat o players have a camera a riffle timer and

19
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.720
a hop sound effect.

20
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.350
OK.

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.040
What I want is a play a template scene and have play em inherit from that.

22
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.880
So I'm going to have to start overwriting things.

23
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.090
I also need to be a little bit careful if I open the armature scene.

24
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.880
You'll see this.

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.570
This animation player has less information in it than this one.

26
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.010
That's because I changed the animation triplet in scene.

27
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.090
Not an armchair to make this very easy for myself.

28
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.190
I'm just going to save this animation tree.

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.620
So in the play a scene under armature.

30
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.660
I'm going to right click and you save branch a scene and then put in scenes characters.

31
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.060
Players just call animation tripler going to save that.

32
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.780
It's going to armature and remove this animation terie player okay.

33
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.300
So now this character should still work.

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.080
Okay so that should all be nice and fancy.

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.470
Now there's another way I could do this.

36
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.090
I could delete it from here and go back to armature an instance said in here so I go to scenes.

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.190
Characters players animation tripler And really it doesn't matter too much which one you pick.

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.280
Right now the beauty of having this instance a scene is that when we put the other character in we're

39
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.910
going be quite close to making it work.

40
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.580
So I now have an updated animation tree player that's coming in with this armature.

41
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.750
What I want to do now is a little bit scary.

42
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.690
I'm going to remove this armature from the scene.

43
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.600
I'm going to save this scene as player template.

44
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.770
OK.

45
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.590
Now I need a new inherited scene from play a template and I need to in a sense in that omniture SO GET

46
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.520
armature on a chair.

47
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.760
And you know just the image was the wrong size.

48
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.690
Remember before we had to scale it down.

49
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.420
OK will scale it back down.

50
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.610
So click on armature get a scale zero point twenty five.

51
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.690
Great.

52
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.550
And let's just double check where you aren't going to get the mesh instance.

53
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.490
And that's slightly low isn't it.

54
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.890
So let's bring that up.

55
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.790
It's going to take off snap their ear and sketch to scooched and you are perfectly scootch.

56
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.170
That's pretty fine scootching and I can hide this meshes that's OK.

57
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.600
So now I've got this new player that's incensing in all of them inheriting from player templates so

58
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.150
let's save this scene as player.

59
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.750
And I'm going to overwrite that.

60
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.320
That's my new player and I can go into this on a chair and go to what children like and see everything

61
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.740
in there that's looking pretty solid which now brings me to the challenge.

62
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.340
I would like you to add the other player model.

63
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.950
So I've got player accreting player.

64
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.110
If you've got player you'll be creating play am I like to create a new player character from the template

65
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.100
I just made.

66
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.060
And don't forget you're going to have to size it so it's consistent.

67
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.240
So you could use that this little mesh instance guideline thing we have right here.

68
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.700
So pause the video give that a shot.

69
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.810
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

70
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.410
And welcome back.

71
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.000
So what I do is I'm going to instance an immature female and she is kind of giant isn't she she's actually

72
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.690
bigger than the armature.

73
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.090
This is a larger model than the other one.

74
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.300
The models were probably not quite at the same time and they certainly weren't using the same animations

75
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.660
and rake's have to tweak these bits so click on immature not player and skeleton this is already 1 percent

76
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.290
of the original so we need this even small.

77
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.720
So how about zero point zero five.

78
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.840
How's that looking.

79
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.360
That's actually still a bit big.

80
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.480
OK zero points zero for this in all three.

81
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.700
So start with why.

82
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.380
Yeah that's get zero point zero zero four.

83
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.770
There it is.

84
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.400
Excellent.

85
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.000
And let's just check against the meche instance.

86
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.340
Are you going through the floor.

87
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.930
Yes you are.

88
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.290
OK.

89
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.650
Let's bring you up a little bit to switch my snap off again.

90
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.730
Done.

91
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.680
And that is pretty good.

92
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.210
Okay.

93
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.970
From a save that and I saved this as a player f.

94
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.240
And you'll notice I kept the root node as player in all three.

95
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.840
And this is important because when I instance the players into this level if I've got any script that

96
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.770
is pointing to a node called player I want whatever player comes in to have that node name OK.

97
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.540
You'll notice by the way that this armature doesn't have an animation player great.

98
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.880
We already say that less instances in so many instance in my animation tripler AM when we look at that.

99
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.260
It's looking pretty good solus opening a missionary player and you'll notice that most of this is working

100
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.750
correctly.

101
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.600
However some of these animations have a slightly different name.

102
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.550
This is because again the assets were created about two three months apart and they don't have identical

103
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:28.980
animation names for example let's say I move to try this blend where I come on pick up Punch works fine

104
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.330
but pick up doesn't.

105
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.820
So let's scroll down here.

106
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.340
This working animation has a different name.

107
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.270
This is pick up.

108
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.130
Let's see how that works if I can find that there it is.

109
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.310
Much more like.

110
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.790
OK.

111
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.820
The other one we need to check is run.

112
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.350
Now all I'm doing is going through all the slides much sure they work and run doesn't work.

113
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.180
Let's look.

114
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.600
It's called running.

115
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.410
Great.

116
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.570
Now the script will still work because what we're calling the script is the node names of calling a

117
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.600
blend two called Move and blend three called action.

118
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.270
So all I've done is I've checked that these notes a point is the correct animations so that when it's

119
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.730
called the cat the cat will actually animate.

120
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:19.450
So now if I say that we now have two fully amateur players that are the same size that we can switch

121
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.290
between.

122
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.390
And that is all we need to do at this stage.

123
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.430
So that brings us to the end of this video.

124
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.660
In this video we've looked at how to build a template from an existing asset.

125
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.690
We've also made sure that I am a missionary player is pointing to the correct animation without having

126
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.330
to rebuild it from scratch.

127
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.960
So excellent work and I'll see in the next year.
