00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,030
Hello again you delight forgotten people in this video.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,240
We're going to add a button and I'm very excited about this because I like pressing buttons buttons

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,250
are fun so buttons.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,400
Why are we doing this.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,660
Because some people like to press a button when they're filling an online form.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,240
Some people like to press enter.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,300
I want to give the player an option of doing either so that if you're somebody that doesn't know you

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,620
can press and tone a form it won't confuse you.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,210
I want to make this as intuitive as possible to play.

10
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,660
Remember challenging game play should be a decision we make not a result of incomplete interface.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:35,900
All right.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,500
So if we want to add a button let's talk about what needs to happen.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,990
The first thing needs to happen is we're going to add a textured button.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,910
By this I mean a button with an image on it an image being a texture.

15
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,190
I want to add a label for the button something that tells the player what it does.

16
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,390
I want to make sure that the button and the new label align neatly right.

17
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,030
So when I resize the screen I want everything to look good.

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,410
And I want to make sure that the button works just like pressing enter in the player text in that line

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,580
edit Note we made.

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,740
So when I do it it'll do the exact same functionality.

21
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,970
So let's get it to go.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,320
And the first thing to do is take a look at the button notes.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,730
If I go in here and I type in a button you'll see we've got a few different options.

24
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,180
A standard button if I just create it really quickly.

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,930
Is this make you bigger a thing we can press is not textured.

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,840
There are things we can do to make it look textured and we'll look at those later in the course of themes

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,380
if it does it.

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,080
But it can take its own label

29
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,260
and by default it uses the standard gotto look and it's not quite what I'm looking for.

30
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:44,080
I want a texture button somewhere delete this node and openness and take a look at it texture.

31
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,400
What you got Come back texture button.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,180
They were a texture button is if I go over to the inspector and click on textures a button that takes

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,130
different that has a different look depending what's happening.

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,720
So you'll see over here in graphics are open.

35
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,170
I've got two different files one is the normal button and one is the button press.

36
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:09,080
So if I take button 11 blue button eleven and put it into normal there's a button.

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:16,600
And then when I move into pressed there it is I'm not going to hover disabled focus or click mask because

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,240
those aren't important for this game.

39
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,470
So if I press play we now have a button in the top corner that when I press it animates but doesn't

40
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,090
actually do anything.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,330
OK.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,530
So let's make it do something.

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,220
Well before that let's put it in the right place.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,110
I want it down here and I want it to organize neatly.

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,850
If I just put it into the V box container it's going to be vertically sorted and I can put it down here.

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,720
But that's not what I want.

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,980
Something to move it out of the V box container and within the V box container I'm going to add a new

48
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,830
type of container.

49
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,850
I'm going to add an H box container a horizontal box container.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,770
So let's do that.

51
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,800
And each box container and here it is.

52
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,230
Now I want my label in this I'm a drag the label into each box container and you'll see organizers from

53
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,290
the left and I'm gonna put my texture button in that and it's on the right.

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,780
But it's not quite neat is it.

55
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,370
Well let's take a look what we can do if I go to the player textures remember as a line at it node and

56
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,680
I scroll down to size flags which I've already got open because I was just prototyping this.

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,630
If I click on expand on the horizontal it's telling the node on the horizontal take up as much room

58
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,440
as you can.

59
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,990
If I switch that off it won't do that.

60
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,490
That's very useful.

61
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,390
However you'll see the button isn't the right size.

62
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,860
So let's take a look at the size of this text.

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,070
We'll see 73 pixels.

64
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,700
I could make this texture 73 by 73.

65
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:46,830
So let's get a texture button and scroll down to rect not hint rect.

66
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,330
There it is.

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,450
It's already 73 on the why I want it 73 on the x.

68
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,290
Okay.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,130
The node is the right size.

70
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,620
The image isn't to get the image the right size most grow all the way to the top of the inspector.

71
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,030
And right here it says expand.

72
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm so switch that on.

73
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,050
Oh no.

74
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,770
It vanished.

75
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,670
Why.

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,340
Because I told it that size I didn't tell it the minimum size.

77
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,360
Let's give it a M. size of 73 by 73.

78
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,670
This means you have to be at least this size and now in a press play note the line edit it won't work

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,600
because we've moved its position we have to fix that.

80
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,780
But the button works fine.

81
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,010
All right.

82
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,410
So now let's put a label in so back into each box container at a label

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,500
and it doesn't have the default font so I'm going to custom font and I want to give it a new dynamic

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,340
font.

85
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,060
Click on that and just like before drag in my felt pen and do you want 40.

86
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,900
We could do 40 settings 40 and what she writes in here that's right.

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,740
OK.

88
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,580
Let's take a look at that.

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,770
That's looking pretty solid.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,360
And when I resize it look at that the interface resize is perfectly.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,020
Final thing to do before we move into the functionality.

92
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,850
I want to add a little bit of space between the button the line edit and the label so let's go back

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,510
to our each box container and you'll see this thing saying custom constants click on that and if I tell

94
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,600
it's twelve it'll say each thing has to be 12 pixels apart.

95
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,440
I could say eight I a 24.

96
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,570
Doesn't any matter what size say 12 for now press play see what that looks like a game and that is a

97
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,180
nice little margin between the text edit the line edit sorry the texture button and the label that nicely

98
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,800
spaced out.

99
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,880
Okay cool.

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,120
Now we need to do is actually wired up so it works.

101
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,890
So let's go back into to the loony left script and you'll see right here the play a text is now in the

102
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,600
wrong place right.

103
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,540
It's not in the box container it's in V box container.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,830
Each box container.

105
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,950
So what I would do is make this nice and easy for myself to delete that leave a dollar sign and just

106
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,540
drag in player text into my script.

107
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:02,110
It vanished comeback script my script mode and drag that back right there and I don't really want the

108
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,170
quotes because I don't need them.

109
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:10,480
And now the line it it should work just fine.

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,810
Awesome.

111
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,620
But the button does nothing.

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,170
So here's my challenge for you.

113
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,520
I would like you to have a display text show whatever is in the player text when the button is pressed.

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,460
In other words make the button actually work.

115
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,010
And a quick hint if you're not sure to do it's going to be on the signals.

116
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,100
Suppose the video give it a shot.

117
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,710
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,570
Welcome back.

119
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,070
So first thing to do is wire this button.

120
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,200
Do I like the name texture button.

121
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm kind of okay with it.

122
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,820
There's going to node and I've got these signals here for up here that is specific to button.

123
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,660
They're not actually specific to text buttons.

124
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,380
They're specific to button and texture button inherits from button.

125
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,910
How do I know that a right click on it.

126
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,390
And I get to open documentation right at the top here inherits a base button control canvas item.

127
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,550
And when I showed you that button that doesn't take a texture.

128
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,520
That's the base button.

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,860
And I can even look in here and see what the signals do.

130
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:19,320
So button up button as our button down button up pressed and toggled button down is while it's being

131
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,230
held down button up is when it stops being held down pressed is just if it's clicked.

132
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,540
And that's the one I want.

133
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,370
I don't want it while the button is being held down.

134
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,630
But if I wanted a game where that happens let's say I don't know a car horn I could do it that way why

135
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,780
a car home would be control by the mouse on a button.

136
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,240
I don't know.

137
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
But if you're making that game that's how you do it.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,860
So I won't pressed and I mean to connect it and I've got my scenery up here and are connected to looney

139
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,050
lips because that's what my script is.

140
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,190
So let's connect it and I'm okay with this method name on texture button press that looks good.

141
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,480
All right.

142
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:56,340
So here's on text button press and I probably don't need my output right now so what I want it to do

143
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,760
well the first thing I need to do is get whatever the text is.

144
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,570
So I won't make a new variable in here called words this new variable is going to be whatever is in

145
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,500
the player texts.

146
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,910
So let's make a link to play a text dot text.

147
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,190
Okay.

148
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,410
So the text property of that note.

149
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,840
Remember I want that property.

150
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,330
If I just pull the node up as the variable gotta let me do that.

151
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,710
But when I say OK now the display text equals this.

152
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,460
It won't know what to do because I can't make a note be text.

153
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:30,770
All right.

154
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,700
So then what to do.

155
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,630
Well now I just need to pass these words through to optic display cause we've already put that in.

156
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:42,710
So I want to go update display text words and you know what just make it nice and neat and select all

157
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,110
three of these lines.

158
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:51,730
And I'm going to hold alt and down arrow and just move them below so that I've got both methods with

159
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,500
functions that updates the display text above the display text so what I'm reading.

160
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,600
I could see what they do and then they come here.

161
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,510
Let's see if that works.

162
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,940
Press play.

163
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,470
Does this work.

164
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,690
Yes it does.

165
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,100
Hooray.

166
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,210
Awesome.

167
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:10,690
Look at that.

168
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,230
We did it.

169
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,310
We now have a way of getting text from the player and a functional button and this label can be changed

170
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,610
in text so later when the story is finished it'll work.

171
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:27,160
You'll also notice that if I have nothing in here and I press it it'll give me an empty string.

172
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,790
There are things we can do to stop that from happening but we're not going to worry about it too much

173
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,170
right now.

174
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,280
We're going to look at if statements ifs else ifs and else later in the course.

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:43,180
But there is something we could do meanwhile in this video we've looked at button and text button notes

176
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,320
H box containers and how to use fill and expand.

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,930
We've also played a little bit more with how to pass arguments to functions and how to make sure we're

178
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,930
not duplicating code which is great stuff.

179
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,340
So excellent work.

180
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,510
And I will see you in the next video.
