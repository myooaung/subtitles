1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,070
Welcome back you glorious God nutters or God or people if you don't feel like being a god.

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,530
Not in this video.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,190
We're going to continue play detection.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,770
Let's make this really awesome by using a line of sight as well as field of view.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,120
Just to clarify the difference the field of view is the angle that the character can see.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,610
So the NPC has a field of view.

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,410
Now this line of sight can be blocked and then it is not related to field of view.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,590
We can use line of sight in any direction and just say both field of view and line of sight have to

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,480
be true.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,950
To set this up there's a few things we need to do.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,080
We are going to have to set up line of sight functionality.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,520
We're also going to have to say if something is in the way I can't see you.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,780
And let's put in some concept of maximum detection range.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,600
If you're too far away if you're outside the beam of light I still can't see.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,320
Then we need to check if a player is in the line of sight and return True or false.

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,250
The immediate way to do this is by using something called a Ray cast.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,560
We've seen Ray cast before in Hobby days right when we had this cloud Here's a cloud who for some reason

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,080
is green.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,940
He had an invisible rate hoodie and when the bunny crossed it lightning was small.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,380
Now we could do something similar here.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,820
A very grumpy Guard and the grumpy Guard is going is going to have a great deal.

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,710
The problem is that rated he faces in one direction now.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,710
Yes we could surround him with I don't know three hundred sixty of them.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,330
We could do one of each direction one that's really cumbersome too.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,500
That's a lot of bloat.

26
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,280
Sorry what happens.

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,270
The player is far away.

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,640
Managed to sneak out between these two lights.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,530
It's just a lot that can go wrong here.

30
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,370
So instead of that we are going to do this.

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,460
We're going to have a much happier Guard and what he's going to do.

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,410
Is generate a line to where ever the player is.

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,480
So that line is going to draw itself from the guard to the player and then go do is check is.

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,370
I can see.

35
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:12,720
True.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,090
Are you in line of sight.

37
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,210
If your line of sight.

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,890
That's true.

39
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,710
If something is blocking you.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,790
That's false.

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,540
So how do we do that.

42
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,510
To do that we are reliant on a brand new function.

43
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:32,610
Get well to day and it's got access to something called direct space state.

44
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,220
Get well too deep is kind of an abstract class.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,540
Everything that relates to the current two dimensional environment.

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:47,930
Sound physics everything and it has access to direct space which is specifically the physics we going

47
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,690
to be using this because this allows us to check collision without putting objects in first.

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,910
So it's kind of sneaky.

49
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,990
Let's show you how that works and can see why it's awesome.

50
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,150
Here we are back an engine and let's get in to uploaded to script on the go into the security camera

51
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,020
scene and open the script.

52
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,740
All right.

53
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,580
We're gonna have to make a new function so let's make ourselves a little bit more room down here.

54
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,940
Here we go and play a function.

55
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,080
Claire is in the line of sight.

56
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,380
So what do we need to do.

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,210
Well we need you very well.

58
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,760
Are variable's going to called space.

59
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,660
I got this very well name from kids can code his tutorial first put me on to this idea as a solution.

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,090
Really good series of tutorials on YouTube which if you want to go further into this I do recommend

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
variable space.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,230
What is space is can be get world to deep dot.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,090
Direct.

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,490
Spaced out.

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,340
Now let's make a variable for region of the good name for this at the best I can come up with right

66
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,100
now is line of sight obstacle.

67
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,520
The thing that's going block the view Obs dunckel area that looks wrong for some reason but that's right.

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,390
OK so what's this going to be.

69
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,530
Well going to use a new space variable.

70
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,670
And we're going to use intersect Ray.

71
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,140
What's an intersect right.

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,000
Well let's go into to the helpful direct space.

73
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,760
Some hoehler control and pressing it and you'll see well tuti has these members and one of them is physics

74
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,610
2D directional spaced it has quite a lot of stuff isn't it.

75
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,100
Let's click on that.

76
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,830
We have these public methods and one of them is an intercept Ray.

77
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:41,660
So it's just from a point to a point excluding stofan an array on this coalitional there.

78
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,890
So where's it going from global.

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Position.

80
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,220
It's going from itself.

81
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,120
Where's it going to.

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,000
It's going to the player's global position.

83
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,980
Nice and easy.

84
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,250
What's it going to exclude if we look at the camera.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:04,780
It's going to draw this Ray this line to the player from 0 0 and I don't want it interfering with um

86
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,810
collision box.

87
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,130
So best thing to do.

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,750
Exclude yourself just makes things much simpler.

89
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,240
What I mean exclude and exclude myself and this has to be an array.

90
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,170
And what collision moscona use.

91
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,190
He look at your camera and go down to the collision.

92
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,570
Mask over that collision mask.

93
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,660
So whatever this value is that's what you're using.

94
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,590
Here's a problem.

95
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,110
Look it's black.

96
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,630
It can't see the player.

97
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,990
Not only can it not see the player is not going to see wars.

98
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,980
Now we did this so that the player could walk through the cameras.

99
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,320
Let's do this a slightly different way.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,660
Let's go to the player and change all of its collisions stuff to just itself so it only interacts with

101
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,310
itself.

102
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,950
Now the onus to interact with players is on everyone else.

103
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,280
Now lets go back to the security camera.

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,780
It's a security camera.

105
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,160
No change there and it can interact with players and walls.

106
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,490
If it can't interact with walls walls won't block line of sight so we have to put that in there.

107
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,740
But now we're back to the same problem right.

108
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,280
If I run this scene.

109
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,880
The player can't walk through a security camera.

110
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,020
Well we can fix that.

111
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's go into the security camera scene and go to the collision shaped hoodie and disable it.

112
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,310
Now the collision layers and masks are still set.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,270
But check this out.

114
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,370
I can walk through the camera.

115
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:44,380
If l'eau s obstacle dot Collider Collider comes from kinematic what it eudi it's built in is the player

116
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,230
return true.

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,350
Else.

118
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,910
Return false.

119
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,850
And lead colon the end else.

120
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,760
And then let's plug that in.

121
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:08,480
So if play is an f v tolerance and a player is in line of sight and that should be everything let's

122
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,070
find out.

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,180
Okay.

124
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,330
I could be seen.

125
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,380
I can't be seen.

126
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,170
I mean I can't be seen I be seen I can't be seen hahaha.

127
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,640
This is exciting and I'm going to go over here.

128
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,730
I'm not actually checking anything.

129
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,930
I just feel good about this.

130
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,880
Look we have a working line of sight but what we also have is infinite range.

131
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,860
Right so we can be seen by the camera out of range.

132
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,540
So let's put in the concept of a maximum action range.

133
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,130
So here we go.

134
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,970
So new constant Max detection range.

135
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,710
And that's going to be.

136
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,300
Well the image is six forty I believe and we've scaled it down by two.

137
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,210
So 320 we can change that is not right.

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,560
Now we need to set this up.

139
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,390
So what we need to do is find out what's the distance to the play and that should really be here in

140
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,980
line of sight.

141
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,440
Let's make a brand new variable variable listens to player.

142
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,170
Was this going to be.

143
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,150
Well I'm a draw.

144
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,550
Um.

145
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,240
Figure out the distance from the player to the NPC so.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,110
Player.

147
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:25,610
Global Position not distance to very any function was it listen to me.

148
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,780
Global position.

149
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,940
And now let's go.

150
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,640
Variable

151
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,260
player in range.

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
What's that going to be.

153
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:44,090
It's going to be distance to player is smaller than than max detection range and that's gonna return

154
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,930
a True or false which I can use right here.

155
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:56,630
If one of the observable Collider So let us can say true or false and player in range which I have spelt

156
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,040
very weirdly.

157
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,480
Return true retard false.

158
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:08,980
One thing I've noticed a slight obstacle collider that's going to be true anyway so let's go eagles.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,410
Eagles player and the players in range.

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,420
That should work fine okay.

161
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,660
Anything else we need to do in here.

162
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,540
This is looking pretty good.

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,360
Let's test it.

164
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,290
Okay.

165
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,340
You can't see me.

166
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,590
You can see me and if I hide here you can't see me.

167
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,500
You can't see me.

168
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,780
I'm out of range.

169
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,560
Awesome in this video.

170
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,270
We've looked at how to use world to 2D and direct space data to check collisions and a time line of

171
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,860
sight.

172
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,180
We've also use collision masks and disabled the actual collision bit which is going to be really handy

173
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,550
later I'll give you a quick head.

174
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,360
If we change the place collision mask we can make them undetectable and that means we can disguise the

175
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,010
player.

176
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,310
So we put that functionality in later in the game.

177
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,380
Meanwhile great progress and excellent work.

178
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,680
I must see on the next video.
