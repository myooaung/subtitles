00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.140
Hello again you terrific.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.720
To people.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.320
I'm not even sure for the Easter I forget but we use it now because you're terrific in this video.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.790
We're going to add night vision mode.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.820
No this isn't just a cosmetic thing right.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.880
I want some actual gameplay elements here I want the players to make a difficult choice.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.040
This is all about risk and reward.

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.590
So Watson like vision to be in our game.

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.690
Well it's gonna allow players to see the dark.

10
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.040
Right now we have a slightly dark level going to make it much much darker and allow the players to engage

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.820
in night vision mode.

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.940
However we're going to make it so that some information is available in dark mode and other information

13
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.930
is in night vision mode.

14
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.690
For example later in this section probably the next video we can have all the torches only visible in

15
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.210
dark mode so you won't be able to see if you're in line of sight in night vision mode.

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.680
Other information will only be visible in night vision mode.

17
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.290
So we're going to make players have to pick and choose moment by moment what's going to happen.

18
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.150
We're also give us a cooldown.

19
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.450
I don't want to play to spam this quickly.

20
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.880
It's going to be an actual risk.

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.300
So let's get started.

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.430
We'll be using canvas modulator.

23
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.250
If you look at the Hague you have it's nice grey color and lets us open the template level what we're

24
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.820
gonna be doing is changing the color parameter in all the color property and canvas modulate between

25
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.380
a dark gray and a sort of cyber green.

26
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.160
That's the one to rename it.

27
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.500
So right click and I'm gonna call you vision mode.

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.480
Congratulations vision mode on your brand new name.

29
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.900
I'm just gonna take this out of this scene and make its own scenes when right click on it and go save

30
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.200
branch as scene and let's make a brand new folder and call this interface with not random capitals in

31
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.380
it and vision Modoc TSC and we'll live in interface and this is now its own scene that's been instance

32
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.450
in Temperley level so we can go into vision mode and change it here.

33
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.650
I'm separating this out because vision mode is something I want people to work on separately without

34
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.440
worrying about template levels thusly what I do is I'm going to give it its own script so let's give

35
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.310
it a script called Vision mode in the interface Holder done and let's go and grab the color we're using

36
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.470
so right now we've got this gray color so I'm going to left click here and just copy this parameter

37
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.290
I mean he's a constant called Dark.

38
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.660
Now when you're writing constants and remember constants of variables that would not change your runtime

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.980
it's really good practice to put them in capital letters that way when you're editing a script in a

40
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.870
few months or a couple of years and you see a variable name in capitals you know I shouldn't change

41
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.050
that.

42
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.500
That's a that's a constant I should only change that between runs not during runtime and woops was not

43
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.870
given that I need to set a value for this and this can be color with a capital C because color with

44
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.360
a small C is not the same.

45
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.410
And let's set this color.

46
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.370
Now we have to come back.

47
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.430
We have various options.

48
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.540
We could use all G.B. Alpha RG B integer from string from using string from so little string close the

49
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.130
string and there's our color dot is now set.

50
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.650
Let's pick a different color.

51
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.220
I'm going to pick a nice vibrant green.

52
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.010
I'm gonna change it later and let's call you night vision

53
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.520
and paste that in there.

54
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.070
Good looking nice and fancy.

55
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.500
Now let's give it a ready function and just make sure that whatever we've done in between runs and what

56
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.670
we're editing it with setting the right color.

57
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.890
So let's say color equals dark.

58
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.610
Whoops I'm ready.

59
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.170
When we when we start the game which can make sure the vision is in the right place.

60
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.030
OK so far so good.

61
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.660
However we now need to be able to switch vision modes and to do this.

62
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.520
I'm gonna go into the play scene and we've already got this input here.

63
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.700
Right now we're doing this toggle torch.

64
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.160
So if a press toggle torch which currently is spacebar my game then if the torch is on switch it off

65
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.620
and vice versa.

66
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.570
Bit of a problem here because if I go into my characters and I open my placing I'll remove the torch.

67
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.040
So if I try this you're in the Ames press play game crash because there is no torch.

68
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.850
I'm toggling something that doesn't exist but we can reuse this one or do.

69
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.280
Well first to change this.

70
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.610
This is no longer told torch.

71
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.850
So it's going to project settings input map.

72
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.860
Scroll down to topple torch.

73
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.310
I'm going to rename this to toggle vision mode.

74
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.990
And I can type in toggle vision mode there it goes.

75
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.610
And now what I want to do is I want to tell the vision mode seen do this function.

76
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.360
My arm will touch.

77
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.580
Do a function called Cycle vision modes and say OK now do this.

78
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.610
However if we look at the template level the player is here in the vision mode is here.

79
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.260
So how are we going to move it across.

80
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.290
Now we could say go back up to your parent then back down to a child vision mode and do it this way.

81
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.520
But that's really clunky.

82
00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.750
What happens if we rename it.

83
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.340
Like I've just renamed vision mode.

84
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.730
What happens if we decide later the vision mode needs to be in a different place or child of a different

85
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.230
thing or we move the player.

86
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.940
This isn't really scalable.

87
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.350
So instead I want to use a group and let's take a quick moment to remind us of the difference in groups

88
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.070
and signals.

89
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.190
OK.

90
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.560
So signals signals connect to a direct node.

91
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.120
All nodes have a certain amount of signals built.

92
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.420
So for example a timer has something called timeout.

93
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.080
You can connect the timeout signal to another node whenever the timeout signal happens when the timer

94
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.020
does a thing it knows is going to happen.

95
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.920
It'll send a signal and we can define our own signals right so in script we could say OK connect this

96
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.500
signal and when this part of the script happens emit the signal.

97
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.280
This is great for linking an event or function to a single node.

98
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.150
But what if you don't know where that node is or you have lots and lots and lots of nodes which we will

99
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.290
have.

100
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.850
Well in that case we might want to use groups groups or broadcasts or Rovner a single message from one

101
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.080
note to another which is going to shout out to the world.

102
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.920
Anything that's part of the group interface.

103
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.070
If you have a function called Cycle vision modes cycle vision modes this is fantastic.

104
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.050
We can use get tree core group to call the function and let each node figure out if it's relevant.

105
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.180
Now the downside of this is we'd be very careful when we're typing.

106
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.550
If I call a group could interface with a lowercase i and the actual group is interface with a capital

107
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:25.870
I got I won't give me an error that is a valid group call but nothing will listen to it the same thing's

108
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.990
going to happen with the functions just because I'm in a group doesn't mean I have that function.

109
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.640
If you call a group and a node is in that group it doesn't have that function it'll just ignore the

110
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.410
call.

111
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.600
This can be very useful.

112
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.030
Maybe some members of the group have a function because you want to do something and other members the

113
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.570
group don't have that specific function but they have other functions that will do later.

114
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.090
So we can use this beginning to be very careful how we use this.

115
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.340
Okay.

116
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.160
So how good is it.

117
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:57.770
Well let's get into a play a scene and open the play script and I'm going to use gets tree core group

118
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:09.730
and I'm going to call group interface and the group interface is going to have a cycle vision mode.

119
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.840
Great.

120
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.790
So now this one crashes press play

121
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.270
and the game runs fine.

122
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.400
I'm hammering space nothing's going wrong but you'll notice nothing has this function name so no error

123
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.890
is being called and there's nothing in this group.

124
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.680
Let's fix that second problem.

125
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.490
Nothing in the script.

126
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.850
There's two ways we could fix this.

127
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:40.850
We could go into the vision mode script and on ready we could say add to group interface making sure

128
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.740
that we put the capitalization right and that'll work fine.

129
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.780
However as I'm not really changing the group at runtime I'm not going to do that.

130
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:54.670
Instead I'm going to open my visual arts scene and go to node and instead of signals I want groups and

131
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.870
I'm gonna write interface.

132
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.570
Add that this way I can see the inspector that is a member of this group has got to make it much easier

133
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.920
for me when editing if I needed to change it at runtime I could absolutely do that okay.

134
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:16.570
So we now have this and let's give it a new function and to call this cycle vision mode and because

135
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.650
of my typing I'm just going to check that I've written that right.

136
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.330
That's going to player cycle vision mode.

137
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.320
You'll notice I didn't put brackets here because I'm calling it as a group.

138
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.130
I don't need the brackets that will be handled here automatically.

139
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.570
So let's just copy that and make sure that my typing is not as bad as I think it is.

140
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.960
That's looking good.

141
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:36.360
All right.

142
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.570
So what are we going to do.

143
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.750
Well I'm going to put a simple function here.

144
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:47.290
If color is equal to night vision.

145
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.560
Dark Cloud.

146
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.230
Then I'll make a branding function called Dark Cloud.

147
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.560
And you know what I would put dark in capitals so I know that this is referring to that that constant

148
00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.260
is complaining it doesn't have that yet.

149
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.920
So let's put that in function.

150
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.610
Dark mode.

151
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.250
There it is.

152
00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:15.200
And that's just going to be color equals dark so if we're not in night vision we're in dock mode.

153
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.660
We currently only have two vision modes however we could have lots.

154
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.850
We could have a predator vision we could have an infrared.

155
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.690
You could do whatever you wanted.

156
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.990
But right now I'm gonna have to say I'm putting.

157
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.410
Else and I'm saying night vision mode.

158
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.840
Night vision mode and it's gonna complain because I don't have that function so I can do the same thing

159
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.080
here.

160
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.170
So functional.

161
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.020
Whoops.

162
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.910
Just make sure you guys use your typing.

163
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:45.060
Night vision whoops night vision lots of opening today in fact there's a lot more boobs than you might

164
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.580
think.

165
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.400
This is my second time recording this video because I forgot that my mike was muted so I have a very

166
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.490
long unedited video with no sound.

167
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.200
So let's do it with sound night vision mode and that's just going to be go away please.

168
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.180
There we go.

169
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.030
Color equals night vision

170
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:05.860
all right.

171
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.830
So that should work right.

172
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.490
Have a good space.

173
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.920
I can now change vision modes and that's looking pretty fancy and I quite like that shade of green.

174
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.470
It's a little bit sickly but that's fine.

175
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.760
So far so good.

176
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.390
Let's add a little bit more to this.

177
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.380
I want to put an audio stream player because if we look at the sound effects as effects you'll see we

178
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.820
have night vision and my vision off.

179
00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.300
So can double click on this and I can preview it pretty and Spectre and pressing play and night vision

180
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.260
off looking pretty good.

181
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.490
So easiest way to do this.

182
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:42.450
Let's add in an audio stream plan and press control a press plus an audio stream play a 2D.

183
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.050
And we have this stream.

184
00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:48.730
I'm not gonna set it the inspector showed a mouse over it see what the property is and I'm gonna change

185
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:53.560
it in scripts so if we go into dark mode this is switching off night vision right.

186
00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:00.930
So let's say audio stream player dot stream equals and I want to load in this final.

187
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.170
Right.

188
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.830
This file needs to be treated as an object.

189
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:10.740
So for that I'm going to use load and now all I can do is just drag in night vision mode off.

190
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.340
OK.

191
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.070
So that's going to set the stream it's not a player.

192
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.630
So make sure we play the string audio stream player 2D dot play now.

193
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:25.210
Quick tip just make sure this isn't looping so click on your file go to import.

194
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.780
Just make sure Looper switched off if it's on switch it off and press re import.

195
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.240
If you don't press re import it won't stick and you really don't want this looping sound because that'll

196
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.470
mean the moment you press it.

197
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.170
It'll just keep playing.

198
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.370
OK.

199
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.620
So that's all looking good.

200
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:46.170
Now I'm do it on the copy that's if I'm not duplicating what control B and I go down a little.

201
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.990
So like both of these and then ult and down arrow and just drag them down.

202
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.340
Now we need to do is change the file we're loading scenes here of my vision off and I'm going to drag

203
00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:01.740
in night vision and this way I have to copy and paste and I have to type it out I'll just drag it and

204
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.310
that's looking pretty good.

205
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.300
Quick reminder this is a string reference.

206
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.520
If you move this file this will no longer work.

207
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.900
However it's a lot better than putting everything in a singleton.

208
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.680
So with that said let's see if we have a sound effect.

209
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.650
Does that make a huge difference.

210
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:28.810
Downside though if I have the space button I can make a little grave.

211
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.120
I don't want to do that.

212
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:36.180
I want at least a one second pause between changing vision modes so the player compress it.

213
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.780
But the vision mode just won't respond.

214
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.490
And that is my challenge for you.

215
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:46.380
I would like you to use a timer node to set a cooldown on mode changes to figure out where you gonna

216
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:52.440
put your time and figure out how to check for if you're in cooldown and put the timing right.

217
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.160
Pause the video give it a shot.

218
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.070
And when you come back I'll show you my solution

219
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.360
and look back.

220
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.300
OK I'm going to put my time on hold in vision mode.

221
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.930
I'm not going to put it in play mode because player currently is not checking what the vision mode is.

222
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.870
It's just receiving the input the player is all about moving and interacting is not about changing vision

223
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:17.490
modes.

224
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:23.140
If I put it in here I'm going to need some way of checking if we're in cooldown instead let's put it

225
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.870
here.

226
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:29.920
So add in a time of note let's take a look at the settings wait time of a second.

227
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.900
That sounds good to me.

228
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.350
I do want to be a one shot.

229
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.760
This will not just keep going right.

230
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.370
If it's true it'll stop at zero.

231
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.120
Don't keep going.

232
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.530
Stop at zero.

233
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.160
It is not going to alter start.

234
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.030
That will be annoying.

235
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.890
Now I need to connect this is a signals node and out of groups back to signal timeout.

236
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.690
Connect Activision mode.

237
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.330
We have this lovely function on time a timeout.

238
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.430
Great.

239
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.520
Now I'm going to add in a new variable.

240
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.610
I'm going to call this cooldown.

241
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.180
That's a smart cooldown.

242
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.920
I was that the false.

243
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.240
We are not currently in cooldown.

244
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.060
I could call in cooldown is cooling down on the cool cooldown for now picking good variable names is

245
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.920
hard.

246
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.660
Okay.

247
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.200
So when a start with cooldown equals false.

248
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:19.470
Now when we cycle the vision mode I just need to add in a another layer to this if condition.

249
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:26.140
So let's go if not cool down which is the same as saying If cooldown equals false or if cooldown is

250
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.130
not true.

251
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.960
And I so highlight these and press tab and that's gonna work fine.

252
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.430
However two more things I need to do.

253
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:41.860
One need a set cooldowns true otherwise none of this makes sense and I need to start the timer timer

254
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.250
dot start.

255
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.110
Finally on time a time out needs a change called out to force.

256
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.360
So cool down equals false.

257
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.160
Now there are various different ways you could do this is the one I would be picking.

258
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.150
Let's see how it looks.

259
00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:03.930
So first I haven't crashed the game and if I try and Spam button it'll allow it once every second.

260
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.700
Otherwise it's just gonna ignore the input.

261
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.350
It's not me any error messages no crashing just gonna ignore the input and that is looking pretty good.

262
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.750
One more thing I want to do.

263
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.640
Let's make the level actually darker.

264
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:23.410
So I'm going to come out of here and let's go to vision mode and set you to almost black.

265
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:32.020
How about 1 1 1 1 1 1 does that look like do you remember to change this in script.

266
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.160
If you don't it's just going to reset it to what have we typed in.

267
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.200
Let's see how that looks.

268
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.280
Now that's a lot more atmospheric isn't it.

269
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.430
You could just about see the torches are very visible.

270
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.320
Everything else is dark.

271
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.960
I go into night vision.

272
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.330
Everything's really clear.

273
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.820
However the torches are visible.

274
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.590
They'll be gone.

275
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:57.330
Downside to this is now when I get to edit the level and a 2D mode that's too dark to see.

276
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.840
So here's what to do on the vision mode see I'm going to make this invisible and get a high vision mode.

277
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.830
If we say that like the level is now my son bright again.

278
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.600
And just to make doubly sure.

279
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.050
Let's go into vision mode and make sure that it's not hidden.

280
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:18.230
So when I click on the vision mode the visibility and the properties code visible and let's just make

281
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.010
sure that already visible equals true.

282
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:30.130
So when we first play it's nice and dark with night vision and when we edit the level and got to see

283
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.150
mode it's nice and light and easy to play with.

284
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.950
And that is some really good progress.

285
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.550
Look at that.

286
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.790
So this is nice and editable.

287
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.400
We have a vision mode that actually make some sort of sense we've got this nice nice dark level.

288
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.650
I'm really happy with that.

289
00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.080
So in this video we've looked at how to use groups and how to use canvas modulate to switch between

290
00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:49.850
vision modes.

291
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.740
Remember you could add as many visuals as you like.

292
00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.250
I'm just a bit too in the game because it's what I've designed the game around but there's nothing stopping

293
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.370
you from putting in a bunch of different ones.

294
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.230
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
