1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,290
Hello again you fabulous go to people in this video.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,990
We want to fix a problem we've now created.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,640
You see we've got this lovely box disguise and the box means that they can't see us but we can still

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,270
move around.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,640
We can still interact with things there's no penalty.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,220
Why not just play as a box.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,510
We've effectively made the game too easy.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,600
This is because the box isn't really an interesting decision.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,580
And whenever you making a game you will make sure that any decision the player makes is actually interesting

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,230
meaningful.

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,800
This isn't meaningful being in a box is simply the right choice.

12
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,890
So we're going to add some things to it specifically we're not at risk of the reward players should

13
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,580
move slower when they're disguised.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,810
OK.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,450
So if you're sneaking on the box you should be going slowly.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,090
We'll also limit the amount of disguises you can have.

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,410
Now in this video we're not going to add a visual representation of how many disguises you have.

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,850
We're just going to know what the number is.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,270
But we gonna build the framework so we can show that in the future video.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,820
And then the disguises will have a maximum duration.

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,020
And we need to display that to the player.

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,570
So we want our disguises.

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,980
I would say five seconds my default would make that nice and easy to tweak.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,670
So that's our goal for this video.

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,090
So let's get back into gotto how I got it.

26
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,770
And as you might expect we've been looking to play a scene over the placing an open play a script and

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,220
let's zoom right back up to the Top funding I'll do is make an export variable and we'll call this disguised

28
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,470
slowdown.

29
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,640
And this is going to be how much slower you gonna be moving out with zero point to five.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,670
We're gonna be moving at a quarter speed and to make this work I'm going to put one more variable in

31
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,400
here and that's gonna be the velocity multiplier.

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,460
That's going to start off as one.

33
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,460
And during gameplay we will change it between 1 and 0 point to 5 to make this work as will move in slide

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,560
motion times velocity multiplier by default.

35
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,920
That can be motion times one anything times one is itself right.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,530
One of anything is itself.

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,570
As you might guess we're gonna change this value to whatever is in disguise slow down because this is

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,620
an export variable if I save it and click on player we can actually change it here.

39
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,580
So if you wanna tweak it nice easy way of tweaking it.

40
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,200
Okay.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,170
So we have a disco slowdown.

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,490
Let's put it in so reveal I'm going to put these textures and include is a little bit separately and

43
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,020
let's say velocity multiplier is equal to 1.

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,460
And down here let's do the same thing except velocity multiplier multiplier multiplier is equal to disguise

45
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,300
slowdown.

46
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,640
Okay let's quickly test.

47
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,880
So back into the game and I can move around nice and easily disguised I move around at a quarter speed

48
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,260
very nice.

49
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,380
So check that wonderfully.

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,290
Second I want to make for that disguises only last a certain at a time which means I'm using time I

51
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,260
should to put in a timer control a timer.

52
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:03,060
That's my time on make sure I'm set to 1 shot when this timer is done I want you to do something what

53
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,990
I want you to do I want you to to reveal the plants remove the disguise.

54
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,290
Nice and easy.

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,850
I to click on timeout and first connect and I'm connected to the player.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,730
I'm not creating a new method.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm going to use reveal which is an existing method and there it is.

58
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,950
It's jump right to here.

59
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,880
So when this time it goes off boom we're going right here.

60
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,820
Okay so how long should this time ago feel.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,050
Well I feel like maybe be five second five second five seconds.

62
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,850
However we might wanna change that.

63
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:41,330
Let's say export variable disguise duration is equal to five.

64
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,950
Let's actually spell that right.

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,810
Disguise duration.

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,140
Oh my typing is getting lost isn't it.

67
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,770
Okay.

68
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,400
So we're not stuck in this disguise duration except at the moment.

69
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,860
At no point are we actually using this value.

70
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,440
So let's use this value and to do that we need a ready function.

71
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,980
Okay we're in ready.

72
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,050
While we here we should probably set reveal just be very very clear.

73
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,890
So whatever we've done in the edits I make sure that the player can be seen it'll be the game as a player

74
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,860
we should be sorting the box and let's set the timer.

75
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,810
And this has a property called wait time and remember if you're not sure it is.

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,250
I've said this before just mouse over it and there it goes.

77
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,500
Great wait time.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,310
He calls this disguise duration.

79
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,850
Fantastic.

80
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,950
We're still not actually triggering the timer.

81
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,380
So in disguise which can put timer dot stopped

82
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,300
OK let's take a quick look.

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,920
So I'm going to jump in game.

84
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,660
Let's go into disguise not touch anything after five seconds we should if everything's working right.

85
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,850
Pop right back.

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,400
Great.

87
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,100
So that's looking pretty good.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,160
But there's one more thing I want to do I want to give the player a chance to know when that's going

89
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,420
to happen.

90
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:07,100
To do that we need to add another new node now so I add a boop label Halo label and we should give you

91
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:14,090
a name should we realistically disguise label disguise timer or something with a not timer as a talent

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:23,770
disguise and I started by putting zero point zero zero and let's just make sure we'll come back because

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,520
of exec press return and then remove the return by clicking the extent it came back.

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,770
Now we could use a theme for this.

95
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,660
Load off theme load and when we put this interface theme there it is nice and big.

96
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,290
I like that.

97
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,380
Okay.

98
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,510
Now this doesn't wanna be here want to move it a little make sure that when you move it this isn't happening.

99
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,570
Why is this happening.

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,800
Let's click on Sky's label.

101
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,110
It's happening again.

102
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,520
It's because of this icon right here.

103
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,400
Right now we're not selecting child knows we're always selecting parents.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,940
Usually that's what you want but in this case it isn't so disliked it remove the label to be here unless

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,280
I can get now currently.

106
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,680
That's just a 0 0 0.

107
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,920
There will always be there.

108
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,430
So it's they're not very useful and it's kind of hidden.

109
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,280
So let's make it actually work.

110
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,460
First off in reveal let's hide it.

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:24,470
So we're changing little textures and in the same section same disguise label dot visible equals false

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,180
equals false.

113
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,100
That's one way we could do it.

114
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,480
We could also just use the hide function which does the exact same thing right.

115
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,900
So hide it.

116
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:42,320
And here I could say this guy's level it show which does the opposite.

117
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,720
So now when we get back into the game let's change vision mode.

118
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,580
You can't see it you can't see it you can't see it.

119
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,940
Let's make the label actually work.

120
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,280
Now this is going to happen every frame.

121
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,560
Which means we have to put it in either process or physics process.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,180
We're already using physics process.

123
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,500
Let's put it in here.

124
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,440
Let's say if you're disguised

125
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,350
because this should only be happening with your disguise right.

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,380
I want the time to go down anyway.

127
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,830
Then the disguise label lets you get dollar disguise label.

128
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,380
Thank you Dot.

129
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:22,210
Text is equal to the time a dot time left.

130
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,930
Now be careful this is not a string right.

131
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,190
The timer is using floats.

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,800
Text needs a string.

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,020
So we're going to have to cast that so string time left.

134
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,620
This can be a little bit messy though because if I press play now and let's change mission mode hide

135
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:38,820
it.

136
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,710
Look at that that that's a disaster present.

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,840
So to do this there's something we can use in string we can use a function put pad decimals and I really

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,290
love this.

139
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,110
So let's take a look at pad decimals and control and click on it formats a number.

140
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,620
This is within the string mulloway.

141
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,300
So let's take a look.

142
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,110
This is within.

143
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,490
This is a function built into string formats a number to the exact number of digits.

144
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,630
Let's take a look and change vision mode and hide.

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,110
Look at that and my disguise runs out.

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,300
Now back again

147
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,050
I love it.

148
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:25,630
However you'll notice that when I rotate the plane it's going to rotate the label's going to come with

149
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,420
it and that is my challenge you.

150
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,030
I would like you to see if you could figure out a way to make sure that the label for the disguise timer

151
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,210
is always the right way up.

152
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,530
Take a couple minutes see you can find solution and then either way.

153
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,640
Come on back and I'll show you my solutions.

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,070
I pulled the video give it a shot and then come back

155
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,150
and welcome back.

156
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,430
OK.

157
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:58,320
So right now we have this label and the label if we look on the record as a rotation.

158
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,730
If I mouse over it wrecked rotation.

159
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,720
This is the rotation around a pivot in degrees of some.

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:15,520
So we can do is in physics process in the same thing about is that if it's the sky is we can say disguised

161
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:24,550
label dot rect rotation and then how do we set this what's going to equal to whatever our rotation and

162
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,630
degrees isn't

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,020
so we're taking our rotation degrees and we're just inverting it.

164
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,270
Right.

165
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,740
So if we are 90 degrees then subtract 90 degrees.

166
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,190
Let's take a look at how that works

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,780
and there it is.

168
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,470
It's working just fine.

169
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,200
All right one more thing I want to do.

170
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,010
We need to limit the amount of lives we have.

171
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,410
So first thing let's go back up.

172
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,250
Here is what's make a little bit of space here.

173
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,400
Export variable number of disguises disguises.

174
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,040
Yes number of fish guises.

175
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,840
Oh my goodness.

176
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,150
Number of disguises is three some of the three disguises.

177
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,010
We can tweak that nice and easily because it's an export variable so look here's our fancy export variables.

178
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,990
Nice and easy to play with.

179
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,970
OK.

180
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,060
Let's go to toggle disguise.

181
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,880
Now at the moment if you're disguise reveal otherwise disguise.

182
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:26,880
Let's change that and say Elif number of disguises is greater than zero.

183
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,460
You have more than zero moles or disguises go to disguises which means when you disguise.

184
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,080
We're going to have to change that.

185
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,330
So let's change right here.

186
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,510
Number of disguises negative equals 1.

187
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,290
Subtract one from the number of disguises.

188
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
Let's just try that works.

189
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,890
So one disguise to disguise three disguise.

190
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,090
No more disguise it's awesome.

191
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:51,600
Look at that.

192
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,800
We've added a whole bunch of risk and UI elements to our disguises.

193
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,290
Which means they now serve a gameplay purpose.

194
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,300
It's now risky for them to do it which means that the players will have to decide how many times I can

195
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,490
use them as yet there's no onscreen indication to how many guys you have going to work on the next video.

196
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,630
Meanwhile in this video we've displayed a set amount of digits in a string using pad decimals which

197
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,610
is awesome.

198
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,600
We're making a risk match reward.

199
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,260
I've capitalized them because they're serious concepts in the gameplay.

200
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,110
And we've added a cost to using a disguise.

201
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,500
You can move much slower.

202
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,230
Awesome stuff.

203
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,320
And I'll see you in the next video.
