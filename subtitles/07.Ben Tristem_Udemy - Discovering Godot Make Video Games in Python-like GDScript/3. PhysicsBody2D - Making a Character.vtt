00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.910
Welcome back wonderful God people.

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.360
OK.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.930
Well planned the game we've got the assets ready.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.820
Let's actually do something in this video.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.310
We're going to start moving the character by the end of this video.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.230
Good to be able to move a simple non animated character left and right.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
And as time goes on we'll add things like jumping and animation and all the rest of it.

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.410
But let's start from the beginning.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.770
So here we are in godda an empty area and an empty seat.

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.200
So first thing we do is create a new type of node.

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.670
So what node on is.

12
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.460
Well I want to do some sort of physics node right.

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.350
I want the game to actually calculate physics things like gravity and other asset.

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.320
Which one do I use.

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
Because if I type in physics Well two things I notice anything in this weird terracotta red that's not

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.910
weird it's quite beautiful actually but this terracotta red is 3D.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.240
Anything in this light blue is 2D and we want this light pastel blue thing physics.

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.050
2d has some children very quickly what are they.

19
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.290
Well we have a physics body study that's the base class within it we have static body truly rigid body

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.470
Tiddy and kinematic body today.

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.660
Not to spend too much time about it.

22
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.780
I'm not spent too much time talking about these.

23
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
You can pause the video and look at these or look at the slides but very quickly static body doesn't

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.410
move.

25
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.330
It's a war you can move it.

26
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.030
Don't do that too much rigid body is directly controlled by the physics engine it has built in things

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.440
like gravity and friction.

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.650
It doesn't actually move it is moved by something else so you will apply an external force to it right.

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.730
Not great for player control if you try and move it every frame through using player inputs.

30
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.340
That's going to be a mess.

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
Kinematic body chiddy doesn't have built in physics things right.

32
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.130
You have to write in your own gravity you know friction but you can directly control it and it has built

33
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.940
in behaviours for colliding which is exactly what we want so let's make a kinematic body to be okay.

34
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.260
It's going to want us to create a what is a saying collision shape to your collision polygon 2D.

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.540
Not a problem.

36
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.870
Well slight problem.

37
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.330
What shape is it.

38
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.890
OK.

39
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.990
Let's make a bracket.

40
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.310
Later we'll make an animated Sprite but for now we will make a sprite.

41
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.140
And that's right.

42
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.610
Will be a play a sprite.

43
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.120
You can use whichever one you like but I'm going to use the money to stand.

44
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.090
I want to be the pink bunny.

45
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.400
If you'd rather be the Brown Bunny be the Brown Bunny.

46
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.400
It would be something else be something else.

47
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.310
I'm not the boss of you.

48
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.160
You do you cook.

49
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.690
OK.

50
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.870
We now know the shape.

51
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:33.600
Collision should be.

52
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.160
So let's pick a collision.

53
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.540
Illusion of the like blues hoodie terracotta red is 3-d.

54
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.180
Green is container hard stuff like that gown.

55
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.570
Those the little light on the section get gleision polygon.

56
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.160
No I don't find my own polygon.

57
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.810
I want to make a prebuilt one much easier and I'm going to make a new shape and I'm gonna pick a capsule

58
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.600
shape because that's pretty much what I need.

59
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.300
I don't need it to be pixel perfect because the skin looks a lot smaller player but what I do need is

60
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.310
to get this right now.

61
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.720
Quick tip don't try and scale your collision shape.

62
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.890
It's going to go wrong is going to bug out again the moment the game runs it's going to try and reset

63
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.410
the collision shape you get all kinds of expected behaviour.

64
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.680
Instead click on a capsule shape and change things like the radius and the height.

65
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.280
Or if you prefer.

66
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.700
Use these extensions in right in here is it.

67
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.660
This is the accent.

68
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.790
This is the scale not scaling.

69
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.490
Yes.

70
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.580
So about here.

71
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.900
Looks good and I'm actually going to pick that to 60.

72
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.400
Looks pretty good.

73
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.290
And heights.

74
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.330
Clearly not 10.

75
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.080
Stick to 20 for now and make sure it's in the centre here and let's just move on.

76
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.310
And when I get down to the feet and up to the head.

77
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.980
I guess I need the bottom line to get the ball to where the feet are going to and the top can be about

78
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.730
there.

79
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.630
I'm now going into position actually zero and y will be when t looks pretty good.

80
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.390
It looks nice.

81
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.080
I get so it's going a little bit above the head.

82
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.570
We can tweak that a bit.

83
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.160
Key thing I want the coalition to go to the feet not the body because I'm gonna need the player to know

84
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.410
where the ground is that's going to be really important.

85
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.730
I don't want this to be the ground I want the feet to the ground.

86
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.030
You'll notice there's a lot of space here where there aren't any pixels in a game like this.

87
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.940
That's not that important.

88
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.980
The reason being we're not tracking things like individual bullets if any enemy gets this close were

89
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.440
hit.

90
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.220
Right.

91
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.590
You know I am going to tweak this a little bit more.

92
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.430
Let's just get the top of the head there.

93
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.520
That was really close.

94
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.900
So what value so I have I have a height of thirty one.

95
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.530
As a student I'm at a height of 30.

96
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.550
It's deadly too.

97
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.170
That's the number I want.

98
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.350
One of the feet at the top of a head.

99
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.330
All right.

100
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.460
Excellent.

101
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.290
So there's a collision.

102
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.030
Before you go any further let's talk a little bit about this button right here.

103
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.110
Make sure the objects children are not selectable.

104
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.250
Here's why that matters.

105
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.340
If I want to move the plate affectless renamed kemet it wanted a team player because that's what's going

106
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.520
to be called to move the player and I drag it it'll drag the lowest thing in the tree right.

107
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.030
That the youngest child the bottom chart whatever it is with a collision shaped hoodie that's really

108
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.930
easy to spot.

109
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.410
But what happens if I do this.

110
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:42.700
Look I've moved the Sprite not the player that's going to lead to all kinds of bugs right if I'm trying

111
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.230
to calculate.

112
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.670
Have you hit the is the parents position.

113
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.270
Are you standing on something.

114
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.940
I'm looking here.

115
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.470
God I was looking here.

116
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.140
So make sure you have the selected.

117
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.380
And that way when you move it you move all of the things in that tree.

118
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.920
Right.

119
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.300
So we're going to move the player which is going to move all of its children the sprite and the collision

120
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.370
shaped Judy.

121
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.200
OK.

122
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.630
So far so good.

123
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.190
Let's make a script.

124
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.720
Make a new script.

125
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.660
And I'm not going to put it in the root directory rez.

126
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.070
I'm going to put it in these scripts directly and I want to call a play lot Judy because that's a good

127
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.310
name for it.

128
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.600
And you know um you know comments are right.

129
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.340
So before we go any further we have to define some things.

130
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:37.280
We need a variable that's going to be called motion and motion is of a type that type is vector to.

131
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.500
What does that mean.

132
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.280
It means it's going to store two values x and y right x and y it knows that it has x and y.

133
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.870
This is great for movement right in the 2D game we're playing with x and y values.

134
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.800
When the player presses a button the motion value is going to change and the script is going to know

135
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.680
how far to move us.

136
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.910
So for now let's do that.

137
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.500
And that's all when you finish.

138
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.090
OK.

139
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.510
So what needs to happen or we need a new function.

140
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:09.010
And this is going to be a physics function in physics and that's the built in physics process Delta.

141
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.940
OK.

142
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.630
Sit tight pass since I could talk about this without error messages.

143
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.460
Physics process.

144
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.940
Every time the physics engine ticks to a new stage to a new frame to a new moment in the physics process

145
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.650
do something and this thing Delta Delta just means we think it is time really it's the time between

146
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:35.140
takes the time between frames that matters a lot and we can play with that later but for now let's talk

147
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.130
about what's going to happen.

148
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.110
Every frame.

149
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:45.550
Let's do an if if input which is a built in command so if the input is action it's action.

150
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.160
So if the player does something what's going going do.

151
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.860
Are they going to just pressed.

152
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.520
In other words I've pressed the button don't measure if I'm still holding it down just measure it's

153
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:59.290
pressed am I going to do it I pressed the button is being held down or just released.

154
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.240
The play has stopped pressing it when there's casing that depressed right.

155
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.360
Them the longer I hold down right.

156
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.710
The more you should do something.

157
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:06.610
I don't want to do.

158
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.570
Have you pressed it.

159
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.580
Don't worry I'm still pressing it because that's going to mean I can move one pixel at a time.

160
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.360
So is action pressed.

161
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.940
Okay let's put in a pass here so I can talk about what actually we want.

162
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.040
Well is action pressed on press control and click on it is actually press.

163
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.090
Takes a strong action.

164
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.570
It's going to put it as a string.

165
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.320
And then do the action.

166
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.490
What action to do what.

167
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.540
Well that here's some built in ones.

168
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.720
Let's do Y right and let's look at where we would define what that is.

169
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:44.660
So getting a project settings and look at the map and he can see all the prebuilt UI options so we can

170
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.630
make a new one to call it anything we like donkey for example.

171
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.280
Not going do that.

172
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.460
If we wanted to we could make you a donkey.

173
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.110
I'm not going to I'm going to get rid of that.

174
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.430
Once we care about right now are left right and up right.

175
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.030
The only controls we can have in our game are move left move right and jump.

176
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:06.920
We could rename this jump if we wanted to but let's leave it for now.

177
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.010
Left right and up are on the cursor right and left our right arrow and up arrow.

178
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.780
I don't like that.

179
00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.520
I don't use that.

180
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.150
I used the b c d so good to add ism options.

181
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.650
Start with the left or add a key and that key is going to be a.

182
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.190
The same for right.

183
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.680
That's got to be D and jump.

184
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.920
Actually I put two options here.

185
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.850
Some people would like to use w.

186
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.270
Some people like to use space.

187
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.830
So let's give them that option.

188
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.320
And are we using space anywhere else we are using it for vassilis.

189
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.130
Delete that.

190
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.340
Not that it really matters too much.

191
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.150
So now whenever the player presses anything that's you I write whether it's the right cursor arrow in

192
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.290
the right direction on the deep end of the controller.

193
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.020
Do something.

194
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:48.710
What do we have to do.

195
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.660
We're going to change the motion value so let's change the motion dot X..

196
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.560
Because speed I get a couple of things.

197
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.750
First let's make a new constant.

198
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.370
I've put in capitals because constants should be in capitals so you can see what they are.

199
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.440
Let's give it a good speed.

200
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.200
What's a good speed.

201
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.400
No 7 of 50 there cells.

202
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.930
Speed all these measurements by the way errant pixels so every time we take a move that many pixels

203
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.220
so a motion dot X. What does that mean.

204
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.230
Well motion has two values.

205
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.350
Right has an x and y motion dot X means.

206
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.630
Just do this first.

207
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.800
Value which is what we want.

208
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.340
So motion X equals speed.

209
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.790
Why.

210
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.340
Because speed is a positive value and positive x is right.

211
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:36.930
So now let's do the opposite.

212
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.660
If input is action press.

213
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.920
Whoops that again didn't I.

214
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.770
And that's clearly why I left.

215
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.170
Due did this motion.

216
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.130
What X equals minus speed.

217
00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.030
You'll notice I'm setting a motion to be just go speed.

218
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.950
I'm not accelerating and I haven't found a max speed.

219
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.700
You can either be not moving or moving.

220
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.950
Now there are ways we can change that but I quite like this for this game.

221
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.750
What if you're not pressing anything right because it now we're saying if you move right move right

222
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.340
move left set left.

223
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.270
But we're not doing.

224
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.070
If you're not move exist who else.

225
00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.330
Motion dot X equals zero.

226
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.500
Don't move.

227
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.830
This is an F I should properly put this as an elf.

228
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.680
Else if.

229
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.500
Right so if this is happening do that.

230
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.360
If it's not do that.

231
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.850
Otherwise do this.

232
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.100
So we've set a variable called motion but nothing's going to happen.

233
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:41.370
In fact let's save the player into seems was my scenes folder.

234
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.780
Sure I had one oh it's vanished.

235
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.610
I got a new folder since.

236
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:55.540
If we run this yes it be the default for now we'll change that later.

237
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.460
We will have a player in this corner and nothing will happen.

238
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.980
Now these inputs are being recognized but nothing's happening.

239
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.390
And that's because it doesn't know what to do with the motion.

240
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.920
So every frame no matter what I'm pressing I need to calculate the motion.

241
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:17.890
I mean to use move and we have two things we could do move and collide and slide.

242
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.980
Now we want to pick the right one by the way these are built into kinematic body today.

243
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.590
What do we want to pick.

244
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.460
OK so moving collide moving collide is when you hit something when you collide.

245
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.790
Just stop.

246
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.290
Right.

247
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.550
This can be very useful because it has a built in way of collecting information on what it is has collided

248
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.790
with.

249
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.700
So if you do a game where you hit something you need to know that thing is you would use this.

250
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.670
It doesn't automatically use Delta.

251
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:50.350
Right so we would want to take our motion value and multiply it by Delta move and slide on the other

252
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.900
hand is when you hit something.

253
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.710
Try and slide along it.

254
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:59.770
If you can move it slide also has built in functionality that can help us with floors walls and ceiling

255
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.010
right.

256
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.530
You can say if you're on the floor if you're on the wall.

257
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.750
If the ceiling which for us is really helpful.

258
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.990
Another key thing to realize is move and slide automatically uses Delta.

259
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:18.220
In other words when we set our motion move and slide will multiply that by the Delta move and collide

260
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.910
with it.

261
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.290
So if you try and switch between them you're going to have different speeds.

262
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.520
That's why I recommend bookmarking this or write it down somewhere or come back to the slides because

263
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.350
it's very easy to forget those.

264
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.740
So we are going to move and slide partially because if I hit a platform I don't want to suddenly stop

265
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.180
moving.

266
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:43.630
I keep moving the direction going again moving slide can take some values lots and lots of values what

267
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.540
we care about is this first one linear velocity What's a linear velocity.

268
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.860
All any of our city is motion.

269
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.340
Nice and easy.

270
00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.960
Look at our left and right you'll notice.

271
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.530
By the way that the player starts off in a corner not in the centre.

272
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:09.640
Well the reason is the players the only thing in the scene is spawned at 0 0.

273
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.080
I can now move it down here.

274
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.690
The leaves you see and we can move.

275
00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.140
We do have one tiny problem.

276
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.970
The tiny problem is this.

277
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:27.710
If I press right and then press left right still happens I press left the press right right still happens.

278
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.330
In other words Wright has priority.

279
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.780
Reason for this is an art.

280
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.060
If structure if you're pressing right go right.

281
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.260
That's the first thing to do.

282
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.280
And if it's doing that it won't do anything else.

283
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.020
It's not even a check for left if right is being pressed.

284
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.220
But that's not the functionality you want.

285
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:49.340
If we press left and right the player should stop.

286
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.820
I've played plenty of games so I've certainly press left and right when I mean to just go in the other

287
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.340
direction or stop.

288
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.070
That brings me to the challenge.

289
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.910
I'd like you tour a move that priority.

290
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:05.130
I'd like to change it so the functionality should be pressing left and right should not move the character.

291
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.740
Pause the video when you come back.

292
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.030
I'll show you one possible solution for this.

293
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.740
And welcome back.

294
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.020
OK there's a few different ways we could do this.

295
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:24.060
The easiest one the one I'm like is say if I'm pressing right and not left how to do that.

296
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.860
Well I could use and if you prefer you could use this was a double ampersand.

297
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.690
It means the same thing.

298
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.520
But I like using and because I can read that much easier and not.

299
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.130
And then I'm just going to copy this like so.

300
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:48.790
And now it's changed it so if input action press are pressing right and you're not pressing left do

301
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:49.530
that.

302
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:55.710
And now I'm just going to do the same thing here and not and let's copy this one.

303
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.870
By the way if you copy and pasting.

304
00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.990
Be very sure what it is your copy and pasting right not a great habit to get into.

305
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:08.770
But if you're doing it that's just be aware why you're doing so now.

306
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.500
If I press right and left I'll stop.

307
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.120
And if I let go of right I'll go left and stop and let nothing.

308
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.060
Great.

309
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.120
So now I can run to the edge of something I go a little simplistic but we've actually covered a lot

310
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.780
of cool stuff here in this video.

311
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.900
We've looked at the different kinds of physics body to day.

312
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:34.240
We've created a simple kinematic body 2D character we've examined move and slide and move and collide

313
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.340
and talk about when you might want to use them.

314
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.400
And we've looked at how to move the character left and right and how to remove input priority.

315
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.640
This is the foundation for our game right from here on in.

316
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.580
We can cite things like jumping platforms and everything else but this is a really great start.

317
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.220
So great job so far.

318
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:55.400
If you use different sprite's a staff where you came up with a different solution we'd love to see it

319
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.520
share on the forums on discord and either way.

320
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.780
See on the next video.
