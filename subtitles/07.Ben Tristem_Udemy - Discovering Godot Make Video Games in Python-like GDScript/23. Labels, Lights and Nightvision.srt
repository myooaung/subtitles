1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,690
Hello again you stupendous got people in this video we got to play with labels lights and night vision.

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,590
I really wanted to make this a 3L alliteration but I couldn't.

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,780
So I didn't know what we're gonna be doing is adding a gameplay reason to come out of night vision mode

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:20,530
right now.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,420
Night vision is simply better.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,720
Right.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,160
So if I'm playing the game and I mean night vision mode I can see the entire level clearly I see all

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,060
the guys all the information is there.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,770
I want to add some risks to that specifically I'm going to have it.

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,260
So that night vision is going to give him map information.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,830
What computer and locked doors are linked together and the layout.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,570
You can see everything much more clearly.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,910
However you can only see the NPC torches if you're not in night vision.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,560
So it's much harder to see if you're actually in trouble.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,030
This is easier than it sounds.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,040
And we can do this without creating new scripts to do that when he got out which is a good start and

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,160
fussing and do is use some group calls.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,810
Now there's three things to play with.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,350
I won't play with these torches and want to play with these labels on doors and labels or computers.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,350
The torches are gonna be a bit of a hassle because they're all Gods and all cameras except they're not.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,460
If I open either a god or camera's open a camera scene you'll see a torch is its own scene.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,680
If I change this scene all other torches will change like that.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,100
I've ordered my group window open but just to show how to do that.

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,380
Go to node and if you're on signals press groups good.

25
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,520
So torches are part of the group lights.

26
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,100
I'm going to call it the group lights because I want to make sure that if I add any other kinds of lights

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,190
later my game I can just use them as well.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,140
Now if we look at the camera of the torch it's in the right group.

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,690
Fantastic.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,020
I can close those too I don't need them at all.

31
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,390
And now we do the same thing with computers and locked doors but they're not lights either.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,990
They can be a different group.

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,530
So let's open that and the editor and gets the label for the computer.

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,110
And that's going to be in the group labels.

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,110
I'm going to add that and save it.

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,280
There's a locked door under the exact same thing with this label and it's in the group labels.

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,540
Now I do want wanna make sure one that I've added it and to that they're in identical groups always

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,430
going to be very silly.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,460
OK.

40
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,510
Everything we need to do is going to be in the vision mode script vision mode handles what we can see.

41
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,800
So let's just extend that scripts and I'll open that script and within vision mode we have all we have

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,820
cycle vision mode and don't such that what happens in dark mode what happens in night vision mode.

43
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,960
Let's start with night vision mode and night vision mode.

44
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,380
I want to not see lights.

45
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,380
So to do that I'm gonna use a get tree dot Coal Group which is something we've done a few times.

46
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,690
And at this point I'd like to give you a note called A for deferred.

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,590
That's entirely different.

48
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,320
Not letting hold of that today would you learn a core group.

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,820
Good.

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,500
Let's just pretend that didn't happen because I'm coming to a challenge.

51
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,150
I will look professional.

52
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,070
The challenge here is to see how well you how comfortable you are with core group.

53
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,560
I'd like you to use get tree core group to have the labels only show when you're in night vision mode.

54
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,940
Going to put a line of code in night vision and the line of code in dark you don't need to add any more

55
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,990
scripts.

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,310
Suppose the video give that a shot once you've either succeeded or you're a little frustrated with it

57
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,810
coming back and I'll show you my solution

58
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm.

59
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,650
OK.

60
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,490
How to do this without adding more scripts right now are torches and the labels don't have a script.

61
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,240
So first thing I do is call the group the group is called Lights.

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,450
I believe I should actually double check that shit like that.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,170
Be very silly.

64
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,440
Not.

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,470
Let's go over here.

66
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,070
Make sure I've called it correctly.

67
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,830
Lights.

68
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,790
Yep.

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,250
I say that because when I just did my rehearsal run I put light into the lights and it was very silly

70
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,030
back into script view and I mean vision mode.

71
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,900
OK.

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
So how to call a function that isn't in a script.

73
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,170
Here's the thing lights.

74
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,140
Well let's go back into that view.

75
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,550
Lights on.

76
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,690
La la la la la.

77
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,020
Here we go.

78
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,590
A light note.

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,270
If I open the documentation by right clicking pressing open documentation you can see that they inherit

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,560
from no to D from canvas item from node from object.

81
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,500
So it has everything object can do everything node can do everything canvas item can do anything no

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,720
city can do.

83
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,630
It's an extension of the nodes above it.

84
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,360
If you look at any script you'll see the very first line extends canvas modulate what this is telling

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,780
gateau is this vision mode is a type of canvas modulate with extended functions and all of this all

86
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,510
these variables and functions everything else we're doing are the extended functionality so I can use

87
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,390
built in functionality on Node without writing a script the script is just be alight.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,700
Plus I don't need you to be a light plus I just need to be a light specifically lights.

89
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,600
If I look at inspector have access to visibility so I could write a script and say visible on visible

90
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:01,550
off or I could use hide and show so in night vision mode lights are going to be hidden so use hide and

91
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:06,650
it's nice and easy for myself under control B to duplicate Hold alt and press up arrow to move the line

92
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,550
up and just change hide to show.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,340
So in darkness we'll see the lights in night vision we want as press plays see how that works.

94
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,450
So here are some flashlights.

95
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,470
I press space.

96
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,900
They go away.

97
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,760
Look at that.

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,860
Now I see the same thing with labels but in reverse.

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,650
So a certificate that is that lights on labels and you want to hide.

100
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,420
And one more time in night vision mode.

101
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,710
I want labels and I want you to show you will notice by the way that we do see the labels at first.

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,520
So let's take a look.

103
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,940
I could see the numbers very darkly for space they appear for space they vanish might not be clear on

104
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,190
your monitor but I can see on mine.

105
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,100
So what I need to do is go into those scenes.

106
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,360
So let's go back to Level 1 the one last time going to open computer and on the label it's gonna start

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,600
hidden and do the same thing with locked also into that scene.

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:07,310
The label will start hidden now when I press play with these built in functionality in all nodes to

109
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,730
call things with group code calls which I'm quite happy about that we've now added that nice little

110
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,540
piece of risky gameplay I'm really happy with that.

111
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,550
So in this video we've learned how to use groups to trigger built in functions not a big long complicated

112
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,900
thing but surprisingly useful.

113
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,010
So excellent work and I'll see the next video.
