00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,460
Hello again you glorious God to people in this video.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,890
We're going to link our computers with them nicely random generated code to the correct lock doors.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:18,830
What I'm looking for is a system whereby there can be multiple lock doors with the same combination.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,480
To do that let's get into God.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,560
And the first thing I want to do is I want to find a way of connecting a computer to a locked door.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,190
Well we really know how to do that we can use a signal if I got to my computer and look at the nose

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,730
there's no signal here I really want to do so.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,130
Open the computer script and make a new one.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,860
Let's call it signal a combination.

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,850
What's going to happen is we generate the combination which is going to find the combination generator

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,070
grab a combination of a specific length and then pull it back and then I'm just going to pass it on

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,090
to the door.

13
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,890
Some of the emit signal.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,820
OK.

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,900
So emits signal just takes a string and the string is going to be combination.

16
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,820
However we can also pass through any argument we want.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,920
I put a comma I can put an argument like combination.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,520
Great.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,030
Right now it doesn't that you have anywhere to send it so just send an empty signal.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,480
That's not going to crash godso is just going to not let anything happen.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,490
So let's connect it right now we only have one locked door so let's connect it by signal.

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,030
So click on my computer node again.

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,940
There's my combination signal connects find a locked door.

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,670
And it's gone away on computer combination exactly what I want.

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,150
Let's connect.

26
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,990
All right.

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,560
On computer combination is where we get this combination.

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,380
So let's erase the value of the combination very well right at the top here.

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:57,410
So we're not going to it to 4 1 5 instead combination is going to be set here and it's going to be set

30
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,340
by whatever value we pass through.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,570
Now we're passing a function with an argument if there is no argument here gotto is going to crash.

32
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,050
So let's put in the argument.

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm not going to call it combination here.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm going to call it numbers now.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,980
Just because we've called it common combination when we have admitted it doesn't mean that the node

36
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,160
that receives it needs it to be called the same thing.

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,070
I think God cares about is what's the value of this variable not what's it called.

38
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,470
So I can say combination equals numbers.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,270
Well let's check that works.

40
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,910
So originally we set this door as 4 1 5.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,690
See if that does anything for.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,340
Oh I crashed.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,970
And the reason is look right here.

44
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,040
Function ready.

45
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,460
Canvassed Lare combination pad combination equals combination.

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,280
I am passing this value through but I'm not setting the value on before this is being set.

47
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,310
So what's being sent here is combination is an empty variable.

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,390
You can have empty variables but that doesn't work.

49
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,830
Instead this needs to be sent after the value is set.

50
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,350
So let's move it on a hold old and down our own windows and just put it down here.

51
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,160
And we don't need a ready function at all.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
So is going to raise my ready function.

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,670
Let's see how that works.

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,220
Nice big screen.

55
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,290
Let's go check what the actual combination is 8 1 7 5.

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,580
Awesome.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,200
So first will check for 1 5 4 1 5.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Does nothing.

59
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,010
Oh you should have cleared 8 1 7 5.

60
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,250
Awesome.

61
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,710
I now know I have to clear that.

62
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:42,230
When we close the pop up that's fine but that's now working.

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,760
Let's very quickly make sure we are clearing the number pad.

64
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,230
If you exert not only do you hide you also resets.

65
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,090
No.

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,900
Is right here.

67
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,710
Let's do a reset lock.

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:54,910
Check.

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,260
That's what I've called it.

70
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,680
Yes Alice.

71
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,220
Awesome save that.

72
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,360
OK.

73
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,680
So this computer is now linctus locked.

74
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,410
Can we have this computer linked to multiple locked doors.

75
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,680
And the short answer is yes that will already work.

76
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:15,510
Let's find whatever door this is this door to you cannot erase you my daughter don't need you.

77
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,050
And let's not duplicate an instance in a brand new locked door.

78
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,220
I'm doing this just like I say we haven't copy through the values I'm just going to instance in a scene

79
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,390
of a locked door which is right here.

80
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,600
Let's move it down there.

81
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,540
Key move down there and I want to rotate this by 90 degrees but I mean make sure not rotating all lock

82
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,830
doors just this one.

83
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,450
So let's find transform 90 degrees.

84
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,060
And that looks pretty good.

85
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,990
Okay.

86
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:55,710
So if I want to connect this computer to that locked door what I need to do is just go back to my signal

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,150
colour combination connect and just find that new locked door locked door to connect.

88
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,490
And that should work fine.

89
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,600
Let's find out if it does.

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
9 1 2 7.

91
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,250
And this time I'm going up this way.

92
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,160
Nine one to seven.

93
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,190
Outstanding.

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,290
Excuse me out.

95
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,110
So now I'd like to challenge you to add more lock doors add at least one more collection of computer

96
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,830
and locked doors.

97
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,370
Cheer level.

98
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,340
In other words Locked doors are have a different combination.

99
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,980
Don't be afraid to rearrange your level.

100
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,070
We have all these auto tiles for a reason.

101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,890
If you want to add more rooms or add a door where there wasn't one go for it you might need to tweak

102
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,200
the navigation polygon instance to stop guards from getting stuck or to make use of new roads.

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,990
So was the video add another group of lock doors and when you come back I show you my solution.

104
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,670
Welcome back.

105
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,440
So this isn't that tricky but there is one area where you might get a little tripped up.

106
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,070
The first thing to do is figure out where to put the locked door.

107
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,650
I want to put the lock door right here.

108
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,100
I think that's a good place for lock dock and I want to put the computer here.

109
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,860
I must start with the computer so underneath computers I mean instance in a brand new computer.

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:31,020
Move it to the right place and let's rotate it so let's rotate you transform by 90 degrees.

111
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,960
Just put you roughly in right place.

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,180
Now let's put in some more lock doors or one more locked on.

113
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,920
Instance in a locked door.

114
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:49,420
Let's rotate you by 90 degrees opes Let's rotate the lock door by 90 degrees not the node.

115
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,730
Keep doing that.

116
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,900
Awesome.

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,070
And it's blocking the light.

118
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,490
It's all looking good.

119
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,480
All I need to do now is connect this computer as a signal.

120
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,310
To that new locked door and this is the bit where you might trip up a little bit so find a locked door.

121
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,610
If I press connect now.

122
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:15,180
We've just done it on computer two combination because computer is not the same as computer too.

123
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,720
So let's erase that and I'm going to unlink this thing.

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,810
Instead let's connect it and rename on computer to combination and get rid of the two.

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,120
And let's actually connect it so we'll find locked or three and connect that great.

126
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,910
Now it's using the same function we don't need to pull a new function.

127
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,820
And let's actually make this a little more interesting.

128
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,650
I'm going take computer one out of the change the combinational.

129
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,550
So this is a 3D accommodation and computer too will be a five page compilation.

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,450
Let's see how that works.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,410
So just quickly sprint to the computer 474 helo Fallsville break and let's open this door.

132
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
Thoughts.

133
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,270
Full time.

134
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,200
That's right.

135
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,790
Sleep behind this guard ups family.

136
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,940
And this is 1 6 1 0 8 5 digit combination.

137
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,810
Let's check that opens up 1 6 1 0 8.

138
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,710
Awesome.

139
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,220
Now one more thing I would like to do right now I have this locked door and if I want to leave I have

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,360
to know the combination if I forgotten it.

141
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,540
I'm stuck.

142
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,130
So what we do is we go to the locked door scene.

143
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm going to add a new area to do when I add it on this side.

144
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,470
So let's add a new area Trudy.

145
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,450
And I'm on call this exit detection.

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
And we'll put a college in shape.

147
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
Collision shape to.

148
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,230
And that's going to be a rectangle collision shape.

149
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,440
So new rectangle shipped to me and going to move it down here.

150
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm holding shift pack my snapper still on.

151
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,830
That's nice.

152
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,590
And we're going to make this.

153
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,760
Let's see.

154
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,350
I don't want to move this don't scale any to use the xanth Somewhere.

155
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:24,520
Use the sense make it nice and big and let's say like that.

156
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:24,910
OK.

157
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:31,070
What I want is when the player comes here I want this door to automatically open.

158
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,060
First thing they do is make sure the collisions.

159
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,770
Good because I only want this to work on the player.

160
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:44,770
Second thing I want to do is connect it as a signal to get a node on body entered and connect it to

161
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,820
lock door.

162
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:55,210
I'm going to connect it as on exit detection body and now I could just connect it to the open function.

163
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,170
But the reason I don't want to do that is this signal automatically passes through an argument body.

164
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,890
This means if I put in an open I will have to do open brackets body and then every time I want to use

165
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,940
open if I don't have an argument there it's going to crash godda because it's going to be expecting

166
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,830
arguments so instead I'm going to pull open here.

167
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:27,640
If you did do it the other way if you just linked it directly to open body and you wanted to then pass

168
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,770
on to variable you could just do novel and pass no through.

169
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,920
This is like okay this argument is not an argument but I have forgotten it.

170
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,100
But I think it is nice and simple.

171
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,050
Let's make sure that on my 2D script that the open locked door things are on the right side and then

172
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,340
not I've put them all on the wrong side so let's make this nice easy for myself and just move the collision

173
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,990
shape up to here save that.

174
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,210
So now.

175
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:04,820
When I walk up to one of these doors la la la Scuse me Luke 7 8 5.

176
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,720
7 8 5 will open up the doors lubing.

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,050
Sorry I need to make sure off if it's not already played the animation will open.

178
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,960
It just won't do that.

179
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,020
It's going to open the door script and check out open function.

180
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,710
Open is animation play open.

181
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,060
So what I need to do is if it's not already playing so if animation.

182
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,370
Player is playing.

183
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,420
I was going to do is false.

184
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,990
Bless you I mean if it's not playing play it now.

185
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,910
I now have this redundant information here right so I can actually remove and not animation playing

186
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,540
from on CD or body and add and that brings the end of the video.

187
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,150
In this video we've linked a signal to multiple nodes so from one script to multiple scripts and how

188
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,430
he might need to rename a function if you've renamed the know that it's coming from and we've connected

189
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:13,700
individual computers to multiple locked doors with even snuck in automatic exit detection so the player

190
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,190
can't accidentally lock themselves on our level.

191
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,910
Fantastic work and I'll see you in the next video.
