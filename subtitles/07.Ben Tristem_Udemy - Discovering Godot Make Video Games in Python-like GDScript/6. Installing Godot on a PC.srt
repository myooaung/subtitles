00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,050
Welcome back you wonderful people.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,310
And we're going to get started.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,450
Let's get godso on our computer now for this video.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,210
I'm going to assume you using a P.S. If you're using a Mac.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,300
Ben has a video for that.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,230
Now if you're using Linux I'm going to assume that you're a little more comfortable with file structures

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,060
and how to do this.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,910
But honestly you could probably just follow the Peacey version and go from there.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,090
So what do we need to do to that.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,210
Well first we have to figure out where we're going to get godda and the next thing needs to do is figure

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,510
out which version to get.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,140
Now there are two places that you could get godso.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,910
Actually there's a few more but two big places.

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,820
There's steam and then there's the godso engine dot org website.

15
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,430
So let's look at them and figure out what the advantages and disadvantages of each are.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,910
So here we are over in steam and let's make this nice and big Where's my mouse.

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,170
There it is nice and big.

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,370
Fantastic.

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,930
Here we are in steam and we need to find God.

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,260
Somebody go to this search bar thing and I'm a Type in God and I'm just going to press there.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:14,010
Click this button on my screen says you now on yours it might say install completely free press it and

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,120
it's going to get going.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Simple as that.

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,400
If it asks you what follows.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,850
Put it in.

26
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,290
Put it in your default steam folder it's fine.

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,470
Now why would I want to use the steam version.

28
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,700
Well if I don't really care too much about using C sharp as the main reason I just want a nice quick

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,980
install with no worrying about it with all of the templates and export templates it's just done.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,050
Don't worry about it just give me the whole thing.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,280
That's how I'll do it.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,260
This is actually the larger file six hundred fifteen point one megabyte for this version.

33
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,650
But what if I want a little bit more control over this or I don't have a steam account.

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,620
Well for that I'm going to open my web browser of choice.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,760
In my case crying is my lovely browser bars and I'm going to get a good scholar engine.

36
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,350
Oh RG And I'll put the link for you in the resources.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,710
So here we are and have got a website.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,800
Lots of fun things we can do.

39
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,950
Great community here.

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,040
But what I care about is download.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:17,930
We have three separate tabs separate linux thing it's sports Lennox Alpha box and the Windows version.

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,580
Main thing I need to worry about here is do I want to be able to use C sharp.

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,310
Now you can always install this version later in reimport your game.

44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,750
Personally I'm not going to be using AC sharp.

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,090
I'm going to be using g.d. script then will be using it.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,040
If you want the mono version the version with C sharp.

47
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,730
This is where you're going to be 64 bit or 32 bit that's to do the operating system.

48
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm using Windows 10 64 bit so I would get the 64 bit version.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,400
If you don't have a 64 bit machine get the 32 bit a quick couple of tips.

50
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,420
The latest version as a recording is got three point zero point to any version.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,720
After that should work fine.

52
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,060
However if for some reason you want to go back to previous version you will find the previous versions.

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:09,560
Right here it says you can find previous releases here and here if you have schoop you could also do

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,010
that.

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,830
I don't I'm not going to worry about that.

56
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,380
If I wanted to use the C sharp version I need the correct version of mono.

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:22,040
Now this is being patched at the moment but at the time of recording you need to be very careful here

58
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,250
for the mono version you need a mono stk five point four x.

59
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,710
Later versions will not work.

60
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,860
Now this is in the pipeline.

61
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,360
It is getting fixed but if you're having trouble loading it up downgrade your monitor to five point

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,550
four.

63
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:45,270
However I want the 64 bit version so I'm going to download it and here it goes and 30 seconds and downloading.

64
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,370
Let's take a quick look at the steam version so I will reopen my steam.

65
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,770
And George got no engine and it's done.

66
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,020
That's the entire install here is gone.

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh ready to go because I've got the steam version.

68
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,300
It downloaded all of these demo projects so I could for instance go and look at an example of the gooey

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,150
in 3D or circle pops and a whole bunch of other things.

70
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,130
You can also look at these templates a whole bunch of templates in here.

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,470
Great stuff to look at.

72
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,570
We're not going to be using too many of these but that's what you'll think will look like.

73
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,940
Now back over to our download I've opened the zip file here.

74
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,150
I'm going to open it up.

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,140
And here we have got a version 3.0 to stable with 64.

76
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,810
So I need to put this someplace.

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,560
So I'm just going to cut this and I need to put it in my programs folder in my case that's on my drive

78
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,250
and it's under programs and you can make a new folder.

79
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,160
And call it God.

80
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,290
So all of Don's have taken the XY file from inside the zip put a new folder and I'm just going to pace

81
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,350
that in there.

82
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,630
OK so here is my tiny tiny tiny Nixie.

83
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,760
How do I install this.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,590
You don't.

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,220
That's the entire engine if I open this here is gonna.

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,240
Now you won't have all of these projects here.

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,470
These are all my demo projects.

88
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,750
You'll have an empty thing here.

89
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,050
If it ask you do you want templates.

90
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,740
Not especially so assuming yours is empty and you're ready to go.

91
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,260
Let's go the challenge slide my challenge for you is to download and install godso.

92
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,140
Grab a copy of God three point zero to all later and install it.

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,430
You hear it from steam.

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,740
You could get it from the god of engine if you've sat all the way through and your a Mac user I commend

95
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,500
your patience.

96
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,030
Ben's coming up with how to install for a Mac.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,210
Meanwhile we'll see you in the next video.
