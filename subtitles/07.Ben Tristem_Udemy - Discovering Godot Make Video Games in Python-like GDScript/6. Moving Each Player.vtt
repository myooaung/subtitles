00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.630
Hello again, you fantabulous got to people in this video, we're going to move each player now.

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.320
We've looked at moving players before, right with you.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.300
Some basic if key is pressed or if Key is just pressed to move a single character around.

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.410
But we're making a local multi play a game.

5
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.160
We want one script that can handle either player.

6
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.010
So we could do some slightly sneaky things.

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.240
Let's jump right into it.

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.880
I'm in put all our scripts on the default on the template plan, on the default by the template plan.

9
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.310
So my open player one, for example, like the template.

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.510
This is where my script is going.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.700
So I'm going to put the script in here and I'm going to call it Player Dot G.D. I don't wanna call it

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.840
player template DOGTV created there.

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.800
And by doing that and saving it, it's now in player one and in player two, they both have that script.

14
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.950
So the the goal is to make a single script that will automatically figure out which category moving.

15
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.900
To do that, let's set up some inputs.

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.120
So when in a project settings and I'm going to get input map and I'm gonna put in some movements.

17
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.970
OK.

18
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.640
I want to move in four direction.

19
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.240
So let's say up and I want to say this is up for player one.

20
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.430
And now let's make an up for player to.

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.070
And I would do this the other three directions.

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.020
Right.

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.060
She tied it in the right one.

24
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.100
Right to that one.

25
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.880
Down to.

26
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.010
There is a reason, by the way, why I'm using one and two and this will become clear later in this

27
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.740
video as part of my sneakiness sometime.

28
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.370
Up, down, up, right, down.

29
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.680
Let's go.

30
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.730
Left one.

31
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.930
Left two.

32
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.610
OK.

33
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.230
Now we actually have to bind these keys.

34
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.870
So I stopped by some keys and I got up one and that's got me on my WSC d because those are my keys.

35
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.890
W.

36
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.050
Right.

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:18.990
One is a key of the down, one making sure that the right character s and left one is a key of A and

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.630
then can go through and do the Cossa arrows for plan to set up a key up arrow.

39
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.750
Paretsky of Rights Oura.

40
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.750
Down is a key down arrow.

41
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.820
And you'll never guess what left is.

42
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.480
That's right.

43
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.060
Left out.

44
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.310
Now, I also want to make this work for a controller.

45
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.480
There's going to be two slightly different movements.

46
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.350
Thing this time.

47
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.210
So on up one, I'm going to click on what a joy axis.

48
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.950
And it's going to be device zero.

49
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.580
Left, stick left.

50
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.000
What does that.

51
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.750
I don't know.

52
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.660
I left stick up.

53
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.340
That's what I want.

54
00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.630
OK.

55
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.490
So up is Divisadero left stick up and on player to do the same thing for device one.

56
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.960
OK, so if we have two controllers plugged in the machine, I only own one controller.

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.310
But if I owned two, I could have both players using a controller.

58
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.510
And that's left stick up fight.

59
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.350
We're only using directional controls.

60
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.880
We don't have a fire button for any reason.

61
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.200
So nice and easy.

62
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.450
I'm going to quickly go through these.

63
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.700
So.

64
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.240
Right.

65
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.550
It's a joint joint access.

66
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.150
Come back.

67
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.290
Troy, access to ICE Zero.

68
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.730
And I want to go right.

69
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.670
Awesome.

70
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.540
And I do the same thing here.

71
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.610
Device one.

72
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.490
Right now, before we go any further, take a look what this is actually saying, access zero plus OK,

73
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.600
on the up here, we have access one negative.

74
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.580
That's interesting.

75
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.250
That means that there's got to be some way we can return the value to Gotto as a positive or negative

76
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.260
on a single axis.

77
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.310
And that's what we're going to be doing.

78
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.250
And it's gonna make our movement script much cleaner.

79
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.520
So let's go down.

80
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.660
That's down for player one.

81
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.380
I've just changed my dead zone.

82
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.830
Danford player one Jax is zero.

83
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.710
Let's tick down.

84
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.370
You do is a little bit time consuming the first time you do it, but, you know, it's got to be worth

85
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.730
it.

86
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.340
So do doo doo doo.

87
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.790
Yeah.

88
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.000
And left.

89
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.390
Stop.

90
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.800
That's only an axis left.

91
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.290
Stick left.

92
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.830
Perfect.

93
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.110
And joy axis and device one is left.

94
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.830
Stick left.

95
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.410
Okay, so let's just do a quick sanity check.

96
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.020
Player one is always in device zero.

97
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.880
So play a one one play at one plat one.

98
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.330
Right.

99
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.610
Play who's always in device one that I can get.

100
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.300
Everything's fine.

101
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.150
OK, so now let's start making movements, right.

102
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.350
Well, we can be using a kinematic body.

103
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.160
We use compatibly tde to full.

104
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.920
We know you're going to need some sort of motion.

105
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.780
And that's gonna be effective.

106
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.150
Three.

107
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.510
Great.

108
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.310
We also know that we have two players named one and two.

109
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.280
So what to do, not make an export variable?

110
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.830
Could play a idee.

111
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.070
And that's going to equal one.

112
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.060
That's my default.

113
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.980
So when I say that I'm a player and if you look at play one, there's no script here.

114
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.430
OK.

115
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.370
So because I imposed these before the descript that it exists of the delete those two and re-import

116
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.290
them another should exist.

117
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.150
Player one TCN has the script and the player idea of one great import player to.

118
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.540
And I would chase this player ready to do so just using a an export variable to change what your player

119
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.540
number is something to move.

120
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.440
Player two over here.

121
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.990
And player one over here again.

122
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.110
Ambro, take them.

123
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.450
Ninety degrees in the right direction.

124
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.040
Doo doo doo doo doo.

125
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.130
Great.

126
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.610
And play to you can rotate this way.

127
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.490
I should I you should look at the screen, see what's roughly 90 degrees.

128
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.430
But I'm looking at a number.

129
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.890
Awesome.

130
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.320
And you are not censored.

131
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.290
Just move.

132
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.120
Play one little bit.

133
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.470
Play one.

134
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.180
Could you just shift was your error.

135
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.810
I see the arrogance this is not probably helpful, I used move.

136
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.140
Here we go.

137
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.100
He's ended.

138
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.750
Yes, I think so.

139
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.750
We'll going to know it, not said it.

140
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.230
So you are better off flat.

141
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.860
Great.

142
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.230
OK.

143
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.010
So I will leave.

144
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.260
There's the NFA now.

145
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.960
Stop playing that.

146
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.470
We now have two players and they are identified by player I.D..

147
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.650
So what I want to do here, make sure I'm in play template just so keep it nice and simple.

148
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:51.340
I'm going to create a script that can read the play a variable and check which input it wants versus

149
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.290
give us a speed export variable speed equals 10.

150
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.770
You know what?

151
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.200
There should be competition at constant speed equals 10.

152
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.610
I could change that later.

153
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.180
And we will make sure that every frame we're going to be moving so function.

154
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.100
I can do this on the physics process lab.

155
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.110
I wouldn't make a script function, couldn't move.

156
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.460
So let's just make that real quick function move.

157
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.880
And he is well, inputs are going to come in.

158
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.620
OK.

159
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:34.260
Clever thing, No one, if input dot is action.

160
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.840
Pressed.

161
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:36.600
OK.

162
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.660
That's the climate that I've done.

163
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.940
These are all strings.

164
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.440
Well, that's OK.

165
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.600
We know something we can do with strings.

166
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.440
Let's start with.

167
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.400
Up.

168
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.830
Up as strength.

169
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.440
Underscore.

170
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.480
The Looney Lips.

171
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.350
Well, we did this.

172
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.480
Modulo player I.D..

173
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:02.850
Remember that?

174
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.170
Let's take a look.

175
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.680
Just on.

176
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:16.560
If the action press is this string with this subsection here being the player I.D., in other words,

177
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.090
if whatever this player I.D. is, is being pressed.

178
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.420
So if up my player I.D. is pressed, then move up.

179
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.390
OK.

180
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.350
So that's gonna be up is on the Z axis isn't it.

181
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.970
Motion.

182
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.870
Thoughts, That depends which where the camera is, boatmen say Z4 now.

183
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.540
Let's change it.

184
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.810
Motion dot Z plus equals one.

185
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:45.980
OK.

186
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.190
So far, so good.

187
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.240
But you know what?

188
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.440
We can be a lot cleverer.

189
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.910
First, I can remove that past line so we don't actually ignore the entire function.

190
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.920
How can we be cleverer?

191
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.280
Well, what if we're using a controller?

192
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.420
Is he right now?

193
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.430
Is action pressed?

194
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.410
Is going to only work for digital values.

195
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.700
Zero or one.

196
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.760
Binary values.

197
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.510
But I won't be able to use analog values.

198
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.220
Now, if I'm using analog values, I want to use a different function.

199
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.830
I don't use is action pressed.

200
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.720
I want to use get action strength.

201
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:22.740
Let's take a quick look at what that does.

202
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.280
Just take a look I'm here.

203
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:30.490
Returns a value between zero and one representing the intensity of a given action in a joy pad.

204
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.800
For example, the farther away the axis is now.

205
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:43.200
Do you remember when I pointed out that our input map over here, we've actually got the negative and

206
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.800
positive.

207
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.280
Right.

208
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.000
And it makes sense if you going down, you're moving in one direction on the axis.

209
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:55.980
And if you going up, which is I mean, it heads up up is negative and down as positive.

210
00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.720
Well, that's interesting.

211
00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:58.710
Can we do that?

212
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.020
Well, let's.

213
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:09.090
Instead of free this way, go make a variable called X and make a variable called Z.

214
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.250
So let's start with our Zegas.

215
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.030
I think that's what we want.

216
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.460
And here I want input dot get action strength.

217
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:23.480
And then I went up modulo by a player I.D..

218
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.540
OK, minus, here's the fun bit.

219
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.250
Ready?

220
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.360
Down.

221
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.980
OK, so he's got this a little bit to read it.

222
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.510
But let's take a look what's happening here.

223
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.610
I have to find a vertical Z as being up minus down.

224
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:53.360
Now, if I press both keys up and down, the same time is going to return zero, which means we're not

225
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.810
moving.

226
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.090
So instead of doing if I press up but not down and if I press down but not up.

227
00:10:59.230 --> 00:10:59.420
Right.

228
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.550
I could put all of that in a single line of code.

229
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.940
Let's do the same thing on X Saphir one do left and right.

230
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.840
Left.

231
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.010
Right now, we might need to tweak this little bit.

232
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.480
But right now, we have these two variables.

233
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.560
So I'm going to use them.

234
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.690
Well, when I say motion equals was a vector three.

235
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:33.710
And I want X zero, Z, Y, X, or is it because we're not moving on the wax.

236
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.910
We're never moving up?

237
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:35.240
Right.

238
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.240
So every frame will take the values of X and Z.

239
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.010
And now we can do move and slide.

240
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.170
Motion.

241
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.480
Times speed.

242
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.600
Now, remember, move and slide can take extra variables, remember, when we're using happy days,

243
00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.360
we're moving slide.

244
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.300
And we had to define what UPF was.

245
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.230
Well, we got to do the same thing here.

246
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.680
And because we're 3D, we really need to do that.

247
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:10.190
So I'm gonna write a vector three of zero one zero.

248
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.410
That's just defining what OP is.

249
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.320
So up is the normal that is pushing away from the floor.

250
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.390
So we now know which way the floor is.

251
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.890
Putting it like that is a little bit in that magic number, so I'm actually gonna make a new constant.

252
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.180
I find it Lexar.

253
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:39.520
One thing we do need to do is real emotion dot normalized because otherwise we gonna be faster on the

254
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.120
diagonal.

255
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.110
OK, let's see if that works well split.

256
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.290
Let's see, I can go left, right, forward, backwards.

257
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.590
OK.

258
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.030
So what I've done is all of these are reversed.

259
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:53.840
That's OK.

260
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.500
I can fix that.

261
00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:00.620
In fact, I kind of saw that coming because if you look right, it's actually positive.

262
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.580
On the left stick.

263
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.230
And left is negative.

264
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.060
Which means if I take the negative and then subtract the positives, it's all going backwards.

265
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.770
That's fine.

266
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.860
I can fix that real quick.

267
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.440
Right.

268
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.460
Left.

269
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:16.810
Down.

270
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:19.820
Now.

271
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.160
If I press play him now, I'm meeting diversity.

272
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.450
You do now meet is fine and keep dude.

273
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.350
No, he's fine.

274
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.480
We want to play a game.

275
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.540
And if I take my controller, I can.

276
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:35.940
Move the controller.

277
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.060
I'm pretty happy with that.

278
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.400
Now, currently is not facing directionals to go.

279
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.060
But look at that.

280
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.910
We have now made a movement script.

281
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:53.140
That one works for both players because of the way we've named our moving movement conventions.

282
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.980
Because the way we've named a key press conventions and use our export variable and.

283
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.760
The entire thing is 18 lines of code.

284
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.290
It's actually last night because one, two, three, four, five, six of those aren't even codes.

285
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.150
So 12 lines of code.

286
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.660
That is pretty fun.

287
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.570
I'm quite happy with that.

288
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.550
And that feel like a good place to finish the video.

289
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.140
So excellent luck.

290
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.480
And I'll see you in the next one.
