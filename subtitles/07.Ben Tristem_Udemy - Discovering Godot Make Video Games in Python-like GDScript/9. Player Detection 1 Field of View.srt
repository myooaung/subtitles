1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,670
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,190
You are amazing although people in this video going to start work on play detection.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,680
Now you might have noticed the slide says Play detection one field of view that implies it's going to

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,780
be a play detection too.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,690
You're quite right.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,560
In this video we're going to figure out are you within the view angle in the next video.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,880
We're going to figure out if there's anything blocking that line of sight.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,470
So let's talk a little bit about what's going to have to happen if I wanted to play detection.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,250
I need to set up that field of view.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,270
We need a way of telling God oh this is what the the NPC can see anything outside of that you can.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,580
Now we're going to use the light being to indicate the player where the field of view is.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,120
Do bear in mind.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,380
That's pretty arbitrary.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,560
I'm just doing it because it's a good gameplay mechanic that the player can see where they can be seen.

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,260
And I need that field of view to rotate with the NPC.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,780
Otherwise it's completely pointless.

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,870
I also need to check if the players in that field of view and give the player some sort of feedback.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,220
I'm going to change the color of the torch.

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,830
Okay.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,970
So what are the NPC needs to know what direction and my facing.

21
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,590
That's pretty key right.

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,230
What direction is the player in.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:16,980
So if I'm facing east and my field of view is a certain degree is the player within that degree.

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,250
Are those two things within tolerance.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,670
All right.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,560
So at this point I would normally jump straight into gotto but we do need to figure out a couple more

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,060
theory things first so let's take a look.

28
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,970
Now I'm not gonna read this out to you.

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,280
I'm just gonna paraphrase it.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,060
All of our sprites face to the right.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,630
So forward is a vector two of one comma zero one on the x zero on the Y and then we can use the function

32
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,900
rotated and we can tell it what that's going to rotate by then we can use global rotation so whatever

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,590
your global rotation is changed that as your default directions your forward direction.

34
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,900
Now let's figure out the direction between me and the player.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,470
The player is right here and the guard is right here and arbitrarily that's when the player is at 2

36
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,100
come a 1 globally.

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,280
And the guard is at 1 comet 2.

38
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,210
What I care about is this direction.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,290
And it turns out this direction is a vector of one common one.

40
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,150
That's one on the Y and one on the X..

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,080
And we can figure this out mathematically.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,470
The direction to the player is.

43
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,510
Player Position minus my position.

44
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,310
So it's a quite easy formula and all we need to do is remember if I want the direction to something

45
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:37,740
that's it minus me we are going to have to normalize that and that means we care about the direction

46
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,910
of the vector but not the magnitude of the vector a little bit of background a vector measures both

47
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,410
magnitude and direction we only care about the direction.

48
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,110
Okay.

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,380
Finally we have field of view.

50
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,890
It's gonna be roughly 40 degrees I believe.

51
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,330
But what we need to know is that there's a facing direction and a positive and a negative as we add

52
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,860
angles to it go this way.

53
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,620
So we need to do is cut this in half and tell it check both of these directions.

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,750
So our field of view tolerance is only 20.

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,010
That was a lot of theory.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,650
Don't worry if you did memorize all that it should hopefully become clear before we actually get started.

57
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,290
Let's make the template level our default scene.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
So when I run the game it'll run from here.

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,860
So project settings.

60
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,120
Run.

61
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,250
And our main scene.

62
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,160
I'm gonna click on here and go up 1 and let's go to levels and for now will you template level.

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,620
Great.

64
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,590
So now in a press play we should be on the right level.

65
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,150
Yes we are awesome.

66
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,120
OK let's now start editing these pieces.

67
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm going to start with camera so let's open the camera scene and I would put my Sprite here on camera

68
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,090
body.

69
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,840
Now our script is going to be the same for all n pieces and they're going to inherit from.

70
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,780
This is the simplest NPC type.

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,080
OK.

72
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,340
So when we start having gods that can over on the level they're going to inherit this and our play detection

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,650
script is going to inherit from the character template.

74
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,930
So it has to be a cinematic body.

75
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,240
OK.

76
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,740
So let's add that and first thing to do is name it.

77
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,710
They can live in peace.

78
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,370
That's a good name but good location not a name.

79
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,880
We're gonna call it player detection dot G.D..

80
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,950
And I put dot.

81
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,460
It doesn't know what kind of thing it is inherits.

82
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,860
Click on the little folder go back up and it's going to inherit template character.

83
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:28,580
So now any any NPC will be able to make use of this script and let's start by defining some constants.

84
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,130
I need an F ova tolerance tolerance or great typing.

85
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:34,800
There we go.

86
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm gonna call that 24 now 20 degrees F of tolerance the beam of light is roughly 40 degrees half of

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:49,640
that is 20 and let's define some colors as well so color red equals and we use the color keyword with

88
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,760
the American spelling and in here I can use a few different formats but I want this one red.

89
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:00,350
Let's say one comma zero point two five comma zero point two five red green blue.

90
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm having a little bit of green a little bit of blue and I want a bright vivid red but that's what

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,940
I want.

92
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,440
Let's have a white which I'm going to use as color.

93
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,670
1 1 1.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,700
All right one more thing I need I need a variable called Claire which we're going to define I'm going

95
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,390
to find it in the ready functions so function ready to do.

96
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,310
Nope never found you.

97
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,030
Okay let's slow down a bit player equals.

98
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,910
Now I don't want to use an absolute path of the player.

99
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,400
Right so my camera isn't here.

100
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,740
I don't want to say go up one go up one go down to the note player.

101
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,380
What happens if I start shuffling things around.

102
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,410
What happens if I have subdivisions within subdivisions instead.

103
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,500
We only have one node with the name player.

104
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,920
Let's find it to do that.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,420
I need to go to the root of the scene root is a hidden node at the top of your scene.

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,310
So let's go slash root.

107
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,250
OK.

108
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,240
So that will get the root node and from here it's gonna go to white screen mode.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,020
We can go find node find nodes.

110
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,150
Let's take a look at the documentation finds a descendant to this node whose name matches the string.

111
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,150
It's case sensitive yada yada yada yada.

112
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,120
If it's owned only find nodes whose owner is this note that's important.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,850
So how do we use that.

114
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,430
Well we only have one node with this name.

115
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,620
This is recursive looking all child nodes.

116
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,650
And it is not owned by this node and that's going to set the player to be the only node with the name

117
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,310
player.

118
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,550
Now this only works because we have a single node called player.

119
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,720
If we had another node call play this would start getting really complicated and we have to figure out

120
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,390
a different solution.

121
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,610
For now I'm kind of happy with that.

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,590
Okay.

123
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,920
So we've defined that in a way came out of that mode.

124
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,440
Now let's do something in process function a process

125
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,010
and put a little bit of room there.

126
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,310
Right.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
So what do we need to do.

128
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,450
Well I need to check if the player is in the field of view.

129
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,520
If the player in F Ovi I think that's good.

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,260
Let's make a function

131
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,680
so function player in F Ovi.

132
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,210
Okay.

133
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,560
So if this so at the end of this we're gonna return true or false so every frame is gonna check.

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,790
Are you true or false.

135
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,950
Now let's define that.

136
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,850
First we need to do is define NPC facing direction.

137
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,850
Well we've talked about that but I was going a little bit far so let's do this nice and slow.

138
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,460
This is going to be a direction it's a vector too and it's to the right and not up on down.

139
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,640
So it's one of the x zero on the Y and we need that rotated by global rotation.

140
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:53,190
So now the script knows that the NPC US is facing to the right by rotated by whichever direction is

141
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,360
actually facing so it knows which way forward is correct.

142
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,500
Now we need to get that direction to the player so direction to the player.

143
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,310
You'll notice I've put a capital P in play here.

144
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,930
That's because I'm referring to a specific node so I'm going to use the node capitalization so when

145
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,460
I read the script I can see that's a capital P player that's a specific object as a node in the same

146
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,190
tree.

147
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,420
Okay.

148
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,940
So remember by watching at the direction to the player it minus me.

149
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:30,030
So player DOT's position minus global underscore position

150
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,130
now I've put this in brackets because I also need to normalize this.

151
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,880
What does that mean.

152
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,470
It means change the numerical values to be 1 0 0 0 minus 1 minus 0.

153
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,970
Because I don't care how far the player is I need which direction it is.

154
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,230
That's the key information.

155
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:59,070
Okay so now we need an if condition if I need to get if the player is in the actual field of view but

156
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,360
if I go back to this slide and make it nice and big you'll notice here's the direction I'm facing and

157
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,550
I got a negative and a positive value.

158
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:16,350
If for example the player is 13 degrees positive from the facing and I say if the player is less than

159
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,380
what is at 20 what it's going to do is say Here's 20.

160
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,940
And all of this is less than.

161
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,370
So if the player is over here is only saying that's no good for me what I need is a way of saying that

162
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,670
20 and negative 20 of the same thing.

163
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,760
In other words remove the positive and negative information.

164
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,150
To do that I'm going to use absolute return the absolute number.

165
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,580
I don't care if it's positive 13 or negative 13 just tell me 13 and what am I returning direction to

166
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,860
player and I need the angle.

167
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,650
Right so let's do angle 2 which is a great function.

168
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,970
Don't have to mess around with dot products nobody else NPC facing direction.

169
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,550
Okay so if this absolute is less than f the tolerance.

170
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:11,280
Be careful if we run this right now almost everything will work because angle too works in radians and

171
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,850
we are working in degrees so I need to translate that let's translate that degree to radians.

172
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,900
Okay so going to change f of tolerance to radians.

173
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:30,460
So if that's happen return True else return false.

174
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,520
Now we just need something to happen.

175
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,820
If the player is in the field view.

176
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,900
So if plays the field of you do that.

177
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,170
Else do that.

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,420
And here's my challenge for you.

179
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,810
And before we get started I'm gonna give you a few hints.

180
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,560
First thing I want to do is I want to change the color of the torch.

181
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,000
The torch will always have to be a direct child of the end of the node that is running the script.

182
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:02,320
OK so torch and in here there's going to be a property we can use.

183
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:08,870
So I want you to figure out the property we can use how to access that code and how to change it with

184
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,950
the constants we have.

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,700
So have the NPC torch change color if the players in the field of view and do remember to change it

186
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,170
back afterwards so pause the video give it a shot when you're ready come on back and I'll show you my

187
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:21,650
solution.

188
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,100
And welcome back.

189
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,540
OK.

190
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,070
So what I need to do is find out how to access this color information in code.

191
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,250
Great as mouse over it.

192
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,820
And it's gonna tell me color all lowercase i guess a torch dot color and I need to change its color

193
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,030
right.

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,480
So if Enfield who will have defined it up here.

195
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,430
Red.

196
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,400
Else torched off color equals white.

197
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,780
Now before this happens I just did a quick test and I've done a typo.

198
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,570
I typed in normalize I meant normalized so do check that on the variable direction the player.

199
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,240
That's player dot position minus global underscore position dot normalized not normalized.

200
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,440
OK.

201
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:11,450
Let's see if that works and I will switch off the player torch.

202
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,890
Check this out now currently we have nothing blocking line of sight which we'll do in the next video

203
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,670
are we actually we're a little bit outside the thing but not by much.

204
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,110
And we have no maximum range.

205
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,040
If I'm over here you can still see me.

206
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,110
But that's a really strong start.

207
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,280
And you'll notice the player torch doesn't work like that.

208
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,280
I'm actually gonna remove the player torsion but I'm really happy with that.

209
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,090
I think it's a great start.

210
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,030
So excellent work in this video.

211
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,120
We've looked at how to use angle 2 to determine if something is in the field of view.

212
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,130
And we've also let them play a note if they've been spotted.

213
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,450
I think that's a really good start.

214
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,730
So excellent work and I will see you in the next video.
