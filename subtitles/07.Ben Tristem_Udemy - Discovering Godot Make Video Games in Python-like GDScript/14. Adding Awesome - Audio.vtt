00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.910
Hello again, you in front of all the people in this video going to add more awesome.

2
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.830
I want to add some audio specifically.

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.740
I want some music and some feedback for the player.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.200
Let's improve our player experience by really rewarding the plan for some actions in our case, scoring

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.500
a goal.

6
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.490
So two things don't happen.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.860
One, when the ball is is kicked.

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.350
We want a wooden block noise.

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.720
And two, when a goal is scored, I want an air hole.

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.810
So let's jump together.

11
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.750
And the first thing we do is sort out the music.

12
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.020
Now, this level is restarting.

13
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.050
If I restart the level, I will restart the music.

14
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.970
So instead of doing that, I won't make a Brenna's sing with a custom note.

15
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.410
And that's going to be an audio stream player.

16
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.920
Doesn't need to deal 3D because it has no position information.

17
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.100
And I want to look inside my my SFX.

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.200
We have a home.

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.890
We have Domino's Pizza, something cat.

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.050
And we have Frog Moco three.

21
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.810
This piece of music is we'll be putting in original play that.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.500
So I quite enjoy that.

23
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.510
I wanna make sure that this is Lupin's.

24
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.110
We got to import its martyrs' looping if has not on loop is yours.

25
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.980
Take that.

26
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.760
And then remember Musk plus re-import.

27
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.720
If he don't press re-import, the changes in this window won't change.

28
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.420
OK.

29
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.150
I will take that off playing and put it on auto play and I'm going to save this as background music

30
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.600
player or BGM.

31
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.600
And let's save you.

32
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
So save and let's put it in your folder.

33
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.690
Music.

34
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.830
Our music player who normally nominated Project Settings and I want to also load this, will we to auto

35
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.190
load.

36
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.450
I want to press to find.

37
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.500
Go to the foliage made for music background music player.

38
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.840
And it it's enabled.

39
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.530
It's ready to go.

40
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.520
So when I start the game.

41
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.930
Should have some music, huh?

42
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.560
Let's just look what happens.

43
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.430
We score one.

44
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.500
To be to get rid of this toothless prince and three.

45
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.570
And then we play him.

46
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.040
And it resets without.

47
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.220
Without switching the music, so it's nice, seamless experience.

48
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.860
That's the music.

49
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.920
OK, let's play the air home.

50
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.060
When a goal is scored.

51
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.210
So to do that as a child of game, I want to add another audio stream player and no positional information.

52
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.020
We don't need it.

53
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.870
The position information will be relative to the current camera.

54
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.930
And frankly, this is throughout the game.

55
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.020
So here I want the air horn.

56
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.550
Let's just listen to that.

57
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.930
Now, this one is looping, and I don't want it to be stuck at the import tunnel loop and re-import

58
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.230
and now and play it.

59
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.810
It just plays once, we do not want this Stalter play.

60
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.680
I might change the volume a little bit.

61
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.440
We'll see how it goes, but I'm pretty happy with that.

62
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.930
OK, so save that.

63
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.100
And now rename audio stream player to.

64
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.310
Our home is called to our home.

65
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.500
And let's just get to the script.

66
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.930
This is nice and easy when we score a goal, which is on gold sector, on gold detector body entered.

67
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.720
We don't need line like the print plan that's going away.

68
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.960
Public school.

69
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.130
And we're going to.

70
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.090
Play the air home, so our home dalts play great.

71
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.390
Let's see how that works.

72
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680
I mean, not bad.

73
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.910
Right.

74
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.110
I'm a turn that time around.

75
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.670
I think that's a little bit too long.

76
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.370
Where did you go, timer?

77
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.210
You can't.

78
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.850
Five seconds to be three seconds.

79
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.510
OK, one final thing we'll do is the bowl.

80
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.500
So let's jump into the bowl, fold it and open the scene.

81
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.150
And that's going to need an audio stream player.

82
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.120
Now, if you want, you can give this 3-D positioning thing.

83
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.910
It'll be, as I say, relative the camera.

84
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.260
You can also use audio stream player, which will just sound like background music.

85
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.270
I'm going to put it on audio stream player because I don't really need the positional information.

86
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.030
With that done, we need to now put the sound in.

87
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.670
So let's go to SFX and we have frog.

88
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.820
OK, three.

89
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.230
Just play that.

90
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.640
In my version, it's not looping because I have been playing with these just double check the import.

91
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.790
Make sure that loop is off and re-import if you need to.

92
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.550
OK.

93
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.420
So how are we going to play this when it needs to happen?

94
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.570
So do is use our own body entered Noga and bring it in.

95
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.370
Okay, so we are bringing in the body.

96
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.810
Right.

97
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.200
So what we can do is ask if body is kinematic body.

98
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.270
And it's not a boy.

99
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.840
It's a body.

100
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.520
OK.

101
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.450
What does this mean if the thing that has just entered our collision shape is a kinematic body?

102
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.590
This keyword is.

103
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.650
Means the next thing is a node type.

104
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.490
So if it's a type of of a certain node, then audio stream player dot play.

105
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.960
And let's just double check that your setup correctly and see how that works.

106
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.040
Now, you might notice this doesn't work straight away because I can't hit the ball.

107
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.110
Why not?

108
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.960
Because if you're gonna be detecting signals like that in your kinematic body, I did just say to do

109
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.150
this.

110
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.040
So I'm not doing my mistake, which is to make sure we're actually monitoring it.

111
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.330
Right.

112
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.040
If we're not monitoring it, it won't look out for signals.

113
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.640
So we need that.

114
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.020
And how many are you going to report?

115
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.850
Just one.

116
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.880
Just one of the latest one.

117
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.620
And as I do this, I need to be very careful because I've said contact most one.

118
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690
It's constantly been touching the floor, almost constant.

119
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.420
So whenever you hear it.

120
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.050
So let's just up this about three.

121
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.220
I'm also put continuous detection.

122
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.240
So it's always to be checking.

123
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:07.890
So it is moving very fast.

124
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.910
It will still catch it.

125
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.960
So let's see how it sounds.

126
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.630
Sounds pretty good.

127
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.570
Now, we do have this right.

128
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.130
The sounds can have a very close together.

129
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.490
So what we could do is stop them from overlapping and to do that.

130
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.630
I could just add something here.

131
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:33.070
So if what is kinematic body and not audio stream player DOT is playing?

132
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.460
Then Plitt, so let's just make sure that we don't get it done.

133
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.570
Some stuff doesn't repeat itself, but that it's the audio in our game, including feedback when you

134
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.280
score goals, quite possibly by yourself.

135
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.430
She hands through two different things.

136
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.660
But look at that.

137
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.430
We now have a game with some very cool sounds, some very fun music.

138
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.070
I do like that tune and I'm really happy with that song.

139
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.950
Almost no.

140
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.510
The section just a little bit more to do.

141
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.560
And we'll do that in the next video.

142
00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.220
So excellent.

143
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.300
Look, and I'll see you then.
