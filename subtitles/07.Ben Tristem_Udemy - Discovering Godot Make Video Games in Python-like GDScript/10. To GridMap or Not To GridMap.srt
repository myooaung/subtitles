00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:10,010
Hello again you wonderful God people in this video we're going to start building our level playing with

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,660
walls windows doorways doors all that good stuff.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,390
And I want to talk to you a little bit of our feature called grid map.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,300
This is a node we haven't seen yet and I'm at about why it's awesome but why are we not going to use

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,840
it for this game to grid map or not to grid map.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,400
Well let's begin with what's a grid map.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,370
And I think the easiest thing to do is to show you.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,500
So what it would do is a make a new scene.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,340
I'm going to my models into architecture.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,930
Let's turn snapping on to make this easier it's going to bring in a wall.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:44,110
So here is a I need a parent that that's like a spatial node not gonna save the scene because not keeping

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,250
it here is a wall that's rename it wall.

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,640
And let's make it awesome by giving it a convex static body mass.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,000
So it is now a static body with a parent of a mesh.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,160
So it's a solid wall.

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:07,070
And let's make this more interesting by making a doorway to some drag a doorway and call it doorway.

17
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,510
Do do do.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,640
And I mean give this one a tremendous try convex.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,220
No it actually blocks the door which is not what I want to undo that and try mesh.

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,990
Awesome.

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:18,910
OK.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:24,010
Now you remember to deal and we made tile maps and how amazing tarmac's were.

23
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,810
Well God has something called a grid map so I can convert this to a meshel library.

24
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:34,950
Just saving the roof fall for now because I don't think keeping this big test meshel up and when I go

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,380
back into my scene I can create a new node.

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,070
And this note is called a grid map grid map is a 3D tile map.

27
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,180
So if I bring in this mesh library I've just made I now have some 3D tiles.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,940
Now this is a little different from 2D because we have to worry about axes and positioning all the rest.

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:01,170
But if I press Q and E I can move this grid up and down so I can change where this exists.

30
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,960
I can also rotate on various axes so if I want to rotate on the y axis looking straight down this green

31
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,610
on the gizmo I can press yes some eye wall can rotate.

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,270
And this is a really great way to build a level I mean look at this.

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,580
We can just you know looks good here and here and you know spot a doorway and you can live right here.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,960
And so far this is truly awesome.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
However we need the right tool for the right job this get out of the grid for now.

36
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,020
So yes while at the moment this is awesome I can go into the game and realize that everything is twice

37
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,340
the size I need it to be and I can fix that.

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,400
I mean I can get through the door.

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,130
I can't hit a wall.

40
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,240
Look we've got this weird thing happening here.

41
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,870
That's not the only problem we have.

42
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,740
We also have an issue if I want to do a corner on the other way and show why.

43
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,820
And I got here anx keep placing grits.

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,550
Boop.

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,940
If I continue the wall over this way this wall is going to vanish.

46
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,460
Why is this wall vanishing.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,440
Well we need to understand how tile maps and Grid Maps work and what's happening is we have a single

48
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:17,000
node a single map and God is saying at this position x is 5 y is minus two whatever it might be.

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:25,170
We're placing tile no this time but one zero one time or one with this rotation.

50
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,050
If I look at the pieces look at the origin the origin is in the corner right.

51
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,010
This is true of most of Kennie's assets currently.

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,450
So it have to go into a blender and convert the origin to be in the centre which is doable.

53
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,730
We can absolutely do that.

54
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,290
And there's tools like.

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,030
And it's called batch AFB x something like that f the X exporter which allows us to convert these things

56
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,120
as a single batch and then we can export them into godda not as x f x files but that's a different story.

57
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,340
However even if we do that we have another problem and that's why michail if I duplicate the doorway

58
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,970
and you press controlled me and I rotate it right.

59
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,940
These are not squares of a place this manually.

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,570
They'll be fine.

61
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:16,560
But if I was placing them on the corner on the origin rather it would place here.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,970
And that's going to cause some serious issues.

63
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,900
Right now the origin is here so it's kind of lining up but not really a line up that way.

64
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,760
But it won't line up this way.

65
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,240
It is trying to do that.

66
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,580
And the reason is Grid Maps really need squares right.

67
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,740
The x and z should really be the same size.

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,300
It doesn't work great for rectangles.

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,610
It works better for squares.

70
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,000
Obviously I'm working in 3D.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,490
I don't mean rectangles and squares I mean cubes and cuboid.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,340
But hopefully you understand I'm saying let's put this as a slide.

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,140
If we're making architecture 3-d we can absolutely use Grid Maps.

74
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,270
And if you're working on a tile based level where you've got at least two of your three axes the same

75
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,070
size.

76
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,320
These are awesome.

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
But we do still have the option of placing things manually.

78
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:11,190
It's not quite as simple and versatile as a grid map but it can give us much cleaner results.

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,800
In our case we will not be using Grid Maps.

80
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:21,270
They're not great for walls that aren't so blocks we have thin walls.

81
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,780
If we did want to grid map we need the origin to be centred at least on the x and z axis it doesn't

82
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,670
matter too much of is not centred on the Y on the up or down.

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,190
Access but we do want it on the left you right back we forward one.

84
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,260
And yes I realize I've done I'll be dalley left you right back you forward.

85
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,910
But only so grown up I can be in in one sitting.

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,340
And also ideally our message should be square right so great for floor tiles or if you're doing a city

87
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,990
block something like that they're fantastic or if you're doing something like a bunch of furniture or

88
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,570
it doesn't really matter that the corners are going to be great.

89
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,600
You want a sort of eclectic thing.

90
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,570
So I'm not keeping this seat.

91
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,970
So don't say that and I'm going to delete my grid map and if I try and delete this file now it's going

92
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,430
to complain oh no it's being used by template.

93
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,060
It's not.

94
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,810
But I haven't saved my template so let's save template and delete it.

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:12,890
OK.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,700
Now this desk is the wrong size and reassured scale this down to what he thinks zero point seventy five.

97
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,820
Maybe let's see what that looks like.

98
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,070
Zero point seventy five and press play.

99
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,620
Nope.

100
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,220
I've also scaled the collision option should never do that.

101
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,270
That's probably a point five.

102
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,370
I just want to idea of how to scale the fetcher compare to the person because the assets were made by

103
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,400
different people.

104
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,490
I'm expecting the scales to be little different as your point.

105
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,690
I was a little small but we can play that later.

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,690
For now I'm going to leave the desk because I want to make level one and this is the template Not every

107
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,000
level is going to have a desk in it.

108
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,030
Maybe I don't know.

109
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,200
So let's make a new scene new inherited scene and going inherit from level template and right now.

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,810
If I save up a template that desk all vanish or some rename install level 1.

111
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,790
Alright.

112
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,690
Save a little libs a sailor one.

113
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,180
There we go.

114
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,460
See you back to level template.

115
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,490
And I want a new container and just a new node.

116
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,160
I've got furniture and every level I also have a empty node which I put up here called walls.

117
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,210
What's in that is going to be different for every level.

118
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,960
But for now here's a wall slip now.

119
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,800
I quite like the idea of every element having its own scene.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
Some have a wall scene and all the rest.

121
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,740
Let's go to models and you see what mean models architecture.

122
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,670
Door scene.

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,870
Dunno why it's called doorway panelling Wall Wall doorway and all the rest of it.

124
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:51,080
Let's start with a window and slag on there and it looks like I have to scale these by zero point five.

125
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,560
Do this before anything else happened so let's skip out right now zero point five zero point five point

126
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,770
five.

127
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,280
Are you the right heights.

128
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:08,130
Maybe you know what I need a little above zero as a result don't I.

129
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,980
Let's see.

130
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah that's a good size.

131
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,340
OK.

132
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,970
So let's get the wall to where we think it lives it lives.

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,540
Their zero point one.

134
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,740
That kind of makes sense right.

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,820
Zero point to.

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,820
And I'm gonna call this a windowsill because we have two windows were a window and a window so let's

137
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:35,560
give that a simple collision and mash create convex static body.

138
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,150
You now have a static body great.

139
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,940
You are a fixed wall.

140
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,690
If I run this scene just the scene and I have a wall that I can run into.

141
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,250
I can't see through because I haven't see the thing transparent.

142
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,330
That's fine.

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,970
I feel like my mouse sensitivity could be a little better but great.

144
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,130
One would do is right click on it and do save branch as seen.

145
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,220
I'm going to go into my scenes create a new following here right click on here.

146
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:10,160
Do you follow what I call this architecture architectural fantastic window sill done.

147
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,940
And now this is a scene right so this is going to be usable in all future seems.

148
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,330
Back to my walls.

149
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,710
Let's bring it all up and look.

150
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,850
Now my wall is way too big.

151
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,690
That's fine.

152
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,630
Because I can go into here really at all and do the same thing.

153
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,640
So transform zero point five like five point five and translation on the y axis.

154
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,430
You're actually in the right place that's fantastic.

155
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,660
And if I put my snapping back on I should be able to make these line up perfectly.

156
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,140
I can't because the snapping is taking place where I placed it so that's fine let's figure out the zit

157
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,180
you are going to live on is 0 0 just for now.

158
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,610
I move you to zeroes as well.

159
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,400
And now I can move along the grid.

160
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,330
That turns out my grid is the wrong size for the asset.

161
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,630
I can fix that in a second but there's my wall.

162
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,950
Let's see the same thing for door and you know I might just speed this up.

163
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,880
Okay they're all in and they're all safe so I want to do and select all of them holding shift and clicking

164
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,940
on all of them.

165
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,730
You move into the exact same place.

166
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,530
Translation 0 0 0.

167
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,780
Fantastic.

168
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,230
Now let's translate them on wine by zero point two.

169
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,180
So up to the floor.

170
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,880
Great.

171
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,460
And I'm wishing I separate them because I'm snapping.

172
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,980
It's a little bit easier now.

173
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,880
The grade is not actually an ideal size for this so I will be turning the grid off in a bit but for

174
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,090
now let's just look at our assets.

175
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,580
That's awesome.

176
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,610
So I run this scene just seeing like a live one.

177
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,570
We now have the beginning of a level.

178
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,100
Can I fit through this doorway.

179
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,860
I can.

180
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,510
That's perfect just the right size.

181
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,980
I've got this nice wood panelling in front and actually decal and I can decide which side I want the

182
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,960
inside of the house to peel the inside of the building or whatever of love's going to be so let's make

183
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,380
a simple level because these are all scenes I feel pretty good about duplicating them.

184
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,640
And you'll notice this floor is absolutely colossal.

185
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,910
We don't have to use the full thing the way I want the levels to work is I want the player to be on

186
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,320
one side the non player characters on the other end in the middle and have bystanders who are going

187
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
to get in the way.

188
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,790
Are going to block shots so I'm actually going to cut this off and take my wall.

189
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,970
LH move it over here.

190
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,550
I'm going to just rotate this by 90 degrees I'm snapping so it's going to work quite well.

191
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,470
Do you get that.

192
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,440
We're not actually snapping correctly.

193
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,110
Why.

194
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,290
Well that's going to transform.

195
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,710
Got to configure snap.

196
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,720
We are currently snapping by units of one meter.

197
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,660
These walls are not one meter across there one point something that's changed to zero point five and

198
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,590
see if that's better.

199
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,150
And yes it is OK.

200
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,160
And just double check I take this double wide door.

201
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,960
Want a rotated by 90 degrees.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
A United degrees.

203
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:36,060
Yes you are moving over here and look at the fact that it's looking pretty awesome.

204
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,860
So now I'm just going to start duplicating these a bit more so let's put you here and I feel like a

205
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,030
couple more so duplicate.

206
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,120
Duplicate and I've got the snap on and I'm just using these arrows and looking very cool.

207
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:55,280
I think when you think a little bit more apsey A little bit more depth.

208
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,600
So now with a whole shift from wall to wall five we duplicate that.

209
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,560
And it's starting to come together as an okay.

210
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,370
I do want some windows.

211
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,690
So let's put a few winners in fact that might be a little too much depth.

212
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,530
Yes a little bit too much at some of the elite.

213
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,370
You don't need you.

214
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,360
And now let's take a window window sill.

215
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,950
Window sill wedge the boop boop do windowsill directly you know your eye here.

216
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,610
It's at the top.

217
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,590
Good.

218
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,820
Don't mind me just having a moment delete you by delete you know rotate you.

219
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,790
Goodness me any more coffee this morning.

220
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,410
By 180 degrees.

221
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,010
For some reason my brain is simply not working right now but that's fine.

222
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,870
Movie to here.

223
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,720
Great.

224
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,170
So here's my challenge for you.

225
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,050
I'd like you to continue what we've been doing and just make it simple level.

226
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,870
And don't worry about decorating it just define the boundary.

227
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,610
Figure out which side of the wall you want.

228
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,600
How many windows you want.

229
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,770
What's going to look like an attempt to put doorways for Bison's come through pause the video you'll

230
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,450
do you'll ever.

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,270
And when you come back I'll show you what I've made.

232
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,070
And welcome back.

233
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,060
Okay so here's my level and you're not sure show it you running as.

234
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,340
Get in here.

235
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,580
It's nice and long.

236
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,050
It kind of reminds me of a tennis court.

237
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,490
To be honest which is really the fee I'm going for.

238
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,330
Now we do have an issue right now where the camera will go through the wall but that's okay.

239
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,880
I don't mind that I can work around that later.

240
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,110
Just nice and simple.

241
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,950
I've got a door here for the buy sell to come through and I will be putting in a collision wall so that

242
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,840
the player won't be able to cross this line and.

243
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,380
I will also be in the back of the plane never goes far enough back to clip through this wall so kind

244
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,810
of claustrophobic kind of tight.

245
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,070
What I'm looking for.

246
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,800
I have the option of making this wider and because of the way we've set this up.

247
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,400
Level 2 doesn't have to look anything like this.

248
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,160
Which brings us to the end of this video in this video.

249
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,480
We've looked at a couple of major things.

250
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,540
The first is what's a grid map.

251
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,850
Is it the right choice for this game.

252
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,890
The second is how do we make a simple level.

253
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,990
So don't forget to share the levels you've made.

254
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,910
I'm dying to see how your game is progressing and excellent work.

255
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,230
I'll see you in the next video.
