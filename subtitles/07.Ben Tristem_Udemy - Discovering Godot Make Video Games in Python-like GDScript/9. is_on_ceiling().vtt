00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.770
Helo you wonderful got people very short video this time.

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.130
I want to talk about how you use is on ceiling if we won our game.

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.410
We see that bunny can move jump and fall really well with one exception.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.080
Look what happens.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.080
Whoops try that again.

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.550
Look what happens when Bunny is under a platform and jumps up.

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.220
Now this this sort of floating along the underside of a platform that doesn't feel good to me.

8
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.500
Luckily we are using move and slide.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.110
If I look at move and slide let's make some big and I will look at the documentation which on Windows

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.330
means hog control and click on it.

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.610
We can see that not only can we use is on floor.

12
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.160
We can use it on ceiling and is on the wall.

13
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.590
So what we do is use is on sealing to stop the body from floating up in the air.

14
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.670
So we've already got function is on floor.

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.980
And what we do is we use or.

16
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.640
Is on the ceiling.

17
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.650
OK.

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.720
So if are on the floor or if or on the ceiling.

19
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.420
And we've defined floor and ceiling here with this up concept which is this direction here so move and

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.030
slide.

21
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.920
That's your.

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.340
That's the direction.

23
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.000
Which means if you're on the ceiling or reset motion so you were jumping you're now not jumping.

24
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.920
And that.

25
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.510
Is really all there is to it.

26
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:36.330
Now when Bunny hits the top of a platform the upward motion the negative y is going to be reset.

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.570
Strive for a really good example of that.

28
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.260
Great.

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.550
So that's the behaviour I want to see.

30
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.180
And that was it.

31
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.670
So in this video we've just very quickly looked the IS ON ceiling to stop money floating along the underside

32
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.640
of platforms.

33
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.740
Mission accomplished.

34
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.900
I'll see you in the next video.
