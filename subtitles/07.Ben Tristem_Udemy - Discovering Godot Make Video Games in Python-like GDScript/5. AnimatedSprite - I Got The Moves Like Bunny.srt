1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,860
Hello you fantastic gotto people in this video.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,870
We're going to make sure that the sprite is animated not just the character.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,400
In other words we're gonna make Bunny look more alive.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,060
We're gonna look at the animated sprite note.

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,680
Okay so let's get straight into gotto and I'm going to open the player since my default scene here.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,640
I'm going to click on the little film like I can to open the play a scene itself so it just brings me

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,870
straight in here.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,570
And you know what.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,500
Let's delete the sprite note.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,810
We don't need it to hit delete.

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,590
And there it goes.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,780
There is no sprite.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,480
Very scary.

14
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,330
Well let's add a new note.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,780
There it is.

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,200
And let's type an animated sprite slice and blue we know it's two dimensional.

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,730
It's a child of no 2D a sprite note that can use multiple textures for animation.

18
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,240
Perfect little warning just comes up.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,010
Okay let's hover over the warning.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,290
It needs a sprite frames resource.

21
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:52,790
Was that mean.

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,390
Well look over here in the inspector animated sprite has a single frames is empty.

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,090
Not a problem.

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,270
New sprite frames.

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,900
That's what we want.

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,060
Now when I click on it to bring this down and see under resource open Ed.

27
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,420
This is the bit we want in here.

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,040
We can have multiple animations all right.

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,080
I've got one called default.

30
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,710
Rename it.

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,370
I'll just double click on it.

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,950
That's an idle I have a new animation called Idle except I don't yet.

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,980
Let's bring some stuff into it so let's open the graphics folder and players and I'm just sticking my

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,550
purple Bunny.

35
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,300
But you could do the the brown one and I think stand and ready until he wants.

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,770
We're going to slide both of those and drag them in.

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,100
There we go.

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,400
Okay.

39
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,930
Now you might be think at this point.

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,590
Yeah and you told me this is animated.

41
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,560
That's not animated.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,210
Well let's switch back to animated sprite playing.

43
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,270
And there we go.

44
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,860
Bunny is now animated.

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,240
I could speed this up or slow this down.

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,500
I've got my speed here.

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,050
It's going to do five frames every second.

48
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,490
So if I wanted to do one frame per second.

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,790
Very slow Bunny painfully slow.

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,720
I could do 10 frames a second hyperactive bunny but I keep it five for now.

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
I can always change it later.

52
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,740
All right let's stop playing Let's Make a new animation.

53
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,530
This little document with a plus on it.

54
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:12,160
I want another animation called Let's Have jump and for this one I'm going to drag the single Bunny

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,220
to jump.

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,320
And what else we want.

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,190
We won't walk.

58
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,670
OK.

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,460
A new animation walk and the drag those two.

60
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,150
Now if I want to play these other animations they don't show up here to get the show up.

61
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,180
I need to refresh the note.

62
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,860
I'm going to click on a different note comeback and they're all in there.

63
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,240
So let's take a walk and bodies walking one Bunny walking faster but he's walking faster.

64
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,210
Ten frames a second seems pretty good.

65
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,800
But again I can tweak it and jump is just a single animation so let's take a look at that.

66
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,840
To do that I need to stop playing walk and play jump.

67
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,330
It's just one frame.

68
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay.

69
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,310
Now this is great.

70
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,260
But how I use it.

71
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,340
Well what you do is you call this in script so let's go into script and we're gonna make a new function

72
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,060
called animate and we'll put it right on the move.

73
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,520
So every frame can apply gravity with a jump.

74
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,320
We're gonna move gonna animate.

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,090
Let's go down to the bottom of the script and distraction free mode.

76
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,840
There we go.

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,380
And I give myself a little bit more space so you can see I'm doing a function animate.

78
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,940
I mean use the shortcut forget node and call animated sprite.

79
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,680
So the whole control and click on animated sprite here it's properties and here its methods is playing

80
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,640
which is a boolean.

81
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,270
Yes it is.

82
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,780
No it doesn't play an animation by string or stop.

83
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,920
Awesome.

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,560
That is everything we need.

85
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,520
So if I just start with animated sprites dot play and then I type in the strange we called Idle.

86
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Now if I press play but he's going to play this animation but as I play this animation no matter what.

87
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,780
So we probably want some sort of condition in here.

88
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,190
What I'm gonna do you see here we've put vote motion right to the top of script.

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,220
This is now available in every function in the script.

90
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:08,060
So I'm going to use that if motion dot X which we start with that's not the jump motion that Y is okay.

91
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,190
If you're going up up is less than zero

92
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,860
then I'm going to play the animation jump.

93
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,940
Let's see if I got that right.

94
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes.

95
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,570
Okay.

96
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:31,980
Else if motion dot X is not equal to zero

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,420
animated sprite don't play.

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,940
Okay so motion or X is gonna be zero.

99
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,670
If we're not moving left and right so let's play and that's going to be walk.

100
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,650
That's what we call that.

101
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,800
So let's see how that works.

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,480
Great.

103
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,420
And it's working right.

104
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay.

105
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,210
But we're not stopping the animation.

106
00:04:50,210 --> 00:05:00,320
Let's clear it with an idle animation so we can put else animated sprites dot play idle.

107
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,900
I'm sure a double check that's what I called it.

108
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,610
I called it idle.

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,400
Jump and walk.

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:05,700
Okay.

111
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,560
Let's take a look how it works.

112
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,340
Okay.

113
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,780
Jump jump works great walk works great.

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
Look when I walk left but still face the same way.

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,610
Okay.

116
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,120
Quick challenge for you.

117
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,580
Now before I go to the challenge we've got all these properties we can look at.

118
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,330
I'd like to see if you can figure out how to get us to work.

119
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,470
I'd like you to make sure that bunny always faces the way that bunny is walking.

120
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,920
So switch the way bunny is facing depending the direction.

121
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,530
A quick hint you might want to look at the flip each property in the inspector pulls a video give that

122
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,870
a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution

123
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,580
and welcome back.

124
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,110
OK.

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,850
So flip h this mouse over it.

126
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,800
If true the texture is flipped horizontally.

127
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,470
So let's take a look at the walking animation and I flip it.

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,130
Ah.

129
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,920
Now there is a continuity error right.

130
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,770
This flower is going to magically flip over but I'm okay with that for now.

131
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,380
Okay so how going to use that let's open the script back into the French into diffraction free.

132
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes don't refract anything distraction free.

133
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,550
I want extra conditions here.

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,270
I don't want this to be not equal to zero.

135
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,530
I need is greater than zero.

136
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:26,330
So if you're going right then play the walk and animated sprite dot H flip H is what they called me

137
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:26,960
sprite dot flip.

138
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,430
H equals false right.

139
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,590
This is a boolean is it.

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,560
Is it true or false.

141
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,630
If it's ticked it's true there's not ticked it's false.

142
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,460
The next line is the exact the same Elif motion dot X is less than zero.

143
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,580
So if you're heading left to play the same animation

144
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,990
shouldn't it be a capital area.

145
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,410
And I want to flip the animation

146
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,190
because true okay.

147
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,840
And you know what.

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,270
Just to make this a little bit easier.

149
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,210
Before I run this go back to level 1.

150
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,240
Let's get out of structural free mode and let's add a camera.

151
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm going to add a camera now.

152
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,090
So camera camera 2D.

153
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,430
Perfect.

154
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,380
And my camera needs to be placed about here I think OK.

155
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,070
In order for God to know that I'm using this camera I need to set this as current.

156
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,610
And right now it's the same zoom.

157
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,920
OK so let's zoom out a bit.

158
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,210
Let's say twice as big.

159
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,050
So two X two y press play nice.

160
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,600
OK now I'm going to have a floor in the duplicated the press control.

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,180
These brand new floor.

162
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,610
I'm going to move that down here and then control D another one.

163
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,540
Let's try that

164
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,550
OK.

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
Now I've got one slight issue I'm hitting space as a jumping is part of the time and that's because

166
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,830
I'm using is just pressed.

167
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,010
So if I'm on the floor and nothing else is happening it's great but if anything else is happening it's

168
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,850
going to be consistent.

169
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,050
So I'm actually going to put this back to is action pressed.

170
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:13,490
Now when I press play ha a bouncy quite fast Bunny I might up the movement left and right speed.

171
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,320
Yeah let's move the left and right speed.

172
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,220
Speed is not give me a thousand thousands maybe fifteen hundred.

173
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,120
Let's see bunny.

174
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,810
Let's put them full screen.

175
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,190
Bunny can move it.

176
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,370
Look at this bunny go.

177
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,120
That's starts to feel good.

178
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,000
You know what with this zoom out I feel like the jumper should be higher.

179
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,480
OK.

180
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,960
Jump speed maybe jump speeds go I like gravity where it is let's put jump speed at 5000 it's go crazy

181
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,320
oh go Bunny.

182
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,960
All right.

183
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,590
That is feeling awesome that's quite a lot character there isn't that.

184
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,320
And with that I think we should stop the video here actually before we do one more thing I should make

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,400
really clear.

186
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,740
We looked at Flip H.

187
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,510
We got to leave you didn't look a flip V if we needed it flip v just tons on the vertical.

188
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,730
And that is a good place to stop the video.

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,250
And this time I mean it in this video we've looked at how to set up an animated sprite node.

190
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,460
We've looked at how to call animated sprite animations and script and how these flip H and flip V.

191
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,390
Excellent work.

192
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,030
I think we start to get a really fun little game going.

193
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,290
How's yours looking did you.

194
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,970
Do you have complete different settings.

195
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,800
Can your bunny jump very high but gravity is very low.

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,010
He's running much slower by much faster.

197
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,510
Are you not using bunnies at all.

198
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,320
Show your progress.

199
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,970
I'm really curious to see what's going on.

200
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,590
Meanwhile great work.

201
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,790
And I'll see you on the next video.
