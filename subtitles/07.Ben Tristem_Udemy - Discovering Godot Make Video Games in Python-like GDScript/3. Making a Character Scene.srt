00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,010
Hello again delightful God people.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,650
Let's actually start making this game in this video we're going to make the character see.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,260
Now the character scene isn't going to be one they're going to see in the game.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,710
This is like a template.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,850
The character is going to be a bass scene from which the player and all SPCS will derive.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,470
So why would we do it that way.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,600
Why wouldn't we just make an NPC scene or a guard scene or a camera scene replacing.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,500
There's a few reasons.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,380
First we want to avoid repeating stuff.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,220
Okay so if we have a single value for max speed that is shared amongst multiple characters it makes

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,550
sense to put that in one place.

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,340
That way we need to change the value.

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,240
We only change it in one place.

14
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,970
It's the same with code.

15
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,580
If for example we have multiple characters that move the same way we should use the same code to move

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,910
them.

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,280
This can help him for consistency right.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,450
And it also helps us make variations.

19
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,310
If I want to make a brand new type of NPC and I already have a base NPC scene I could just tell God

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,990
what the difference is and not worry about everything that starts to date.

21
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,350
Okay so let's actually make the scene.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,810
First you want to make a new folder and I won't call it scenes.

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm going to go in there and in there.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,700
I'm gonna make another new folder called characters going to make it easier to find all my characters

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:29,260
and I'm gonna rename that so that was the correct amount of letters in the word characters wearing characters.

26
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,260
Let's get to work.

27
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,140
I'm gonna start with a kinematic body to dig all of my characters are going to be kinematic body 2D

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,620
kinematic body to D.

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,100
As you might remember is going to need a coalition shape but the force of the collision shape in I want

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,300
the graphics I'm put in a sprite.

31
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,910
Going to graphics into PRNG and I only use man red.

32
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,830
I'm going to use man red because I don't intend to use them anywhere else so if I see this on my level

33
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,380
I know something's gone wrong.

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,820
It's important if you have a template character they don't want to see.

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,110
Make sure it doesn't look like they're the player or something you see everywhere to make it very difficult

36
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,780
to find it.

37
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,150
OK let's give the coalition ships are close and ship a collision shape to eat there it is.

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,520
And I was going make a capsule because that looks pretty good.

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm going to move it till it's centred and as I've said several times over the expanse not the scale

40
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,690
so looks pretty good.

41
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,470
This is hand drawn so it's not quite symmetrical.

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,300
Yeah I looked solid and let's make sure that whenever I try and move this can mattick body and remove

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,110
all its children.

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,280
I'm gonna call this character for going further.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,420
Let's say them go to scenes characters and he'll be called character.

46
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,390
So now my challenge to you.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,840
I'd like you to set up your character template.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,850
You don't have to use the same graphic.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,750
You could use a different shape in all the rest of it but just make sure that you've got this character

50
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,690
class done.

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,670
Pause the video set up yours and when you come back and add some code to it.

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,960
Welcome back.

53
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:19,630
Okay so the first thing to do is make a script and my script is going to be called character but I'm

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,530
not going to put it here.

55
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,700
I need a new folder.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,680
So let's go back into our room folder.

57
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,880
Rose and mega Scripps follow

58
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,730
scripts.

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,320
Oh bad timing to that.

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,220
OK.

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
So new script.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
Move it to the script folder.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,030
And it's going to be called character dodginess is are basing what I'm going to put in here.

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,360
Constance I put in values that I don't expect to change and I want to be the same everywhere.

65
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,700
So this is the concern.

66
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,270
The first thing you put in is a speed not a gun right.

67
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,490
All of my constants in capitals so that when they appear in the code I can see this is a constant.

68
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,020
Don't change it.

69
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,030
God will let me change it but I put it in capitals to remind myself not to if I want to change things

70
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,380
I should be using a variable not a concept.

71
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,050
Again need an actual value to this Summerset my speed to 10.

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,150
We can tweak this later but through trial and error.

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,770
That's what I found worked well with what the game will be.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,950
So that's only 10 pixels movement.

75
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,260
Every time we do the thing for nelse a bit magic.

76
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,000
But remember we can tweak these.

77
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:26,370
I also need a max speed max speed is going to be 200.

78
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,160
Finally I want a function.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,850
I will set this zero point one.

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,950
Friction is actually going to be how long it takes to stop.

81
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,550
If I set this to 1 or 5 or 10 everything can be made of ice Zero Point 1 means zero point one seconds

82
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,500
I stop the player won't really notice it but then notice it just enough for it to feel real and that

83
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,370
sets up a base character.

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,950
So let's say this and we're good to go.

85
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,640
In this video I've looked at how to design from the idea of a template.

86
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,980
We're going inherit all these properties so this allows us to start from a very basic what do all characters

87
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,410
have in common and go from there.

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,000
It is going to come really handy.

89
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,000
Next few videos.

90
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,170
So great work and I'll see in the next video.
