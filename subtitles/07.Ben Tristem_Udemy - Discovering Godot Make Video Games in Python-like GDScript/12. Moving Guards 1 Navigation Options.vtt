00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.470
Hello again you glorious go to people in this video.

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.070
We're going to start work on making the gods move.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.040
We're gonna look at our options for navigation as a couple of different ways we can solve this but we're

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.390
going to be using the navigation to denote you'll notice once again this is a two parter because this

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.560
is quite a big topic.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.170
So in this video we're gonna set everything up in the next one.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.490
We'll start scripting it.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.720
OK.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.260
So if we're gonna be moving these guys let's define what kind of behavior we want.

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.210
When I'm think of God movement I'm thinking that's a random list of destinations.

11
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.510
I don't really want to type them as a list so I'm going to place them with little visual markers that

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.650
we can see an engine that the play is not going to see and the God is just going to pick one of these

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.600
randomly and move to them.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.750
I also think while we have defined a normal speed I want human gods to move about half the speed the

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.700
plow want you to feel like you're sprinting.

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.850
This would give us the option later to do things like add faster gods or attack dogs or whatever when

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.980
they arrive at this point.

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.380
They're gonna wait for three seconds and then they're going to start the whole thing over again to pick

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.500
a new destination and move the now.

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.230
If the guard gets stopped canopies of scenery or Ley told me at furniture they shouldn't worry about

21
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.310
it they should just detect I'm touching something I'm going to go somewhere else.

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.740
OK so that's what we're looking at.

23
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.690
And we have two basic techniques we can use we can use a navigation instance polygon or a tile map and

24
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.880
I'll talk about these things on and I'll show you both but we're going to end up using Tom map out to

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.840
use either of these.

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.150
They have to be a direct child or a grandchild of a navigation to denote which is going to cause me

27
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.880
problems in a little bit and we'll show you how to fix that too.

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.790
Now don't worry if you don't memorize all these things.

29
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.780
I just wanted to give you that little bit of heads up now so that when we start doing it you'll think

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.060
oh right that's what he meant.

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.370
Okay.

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.490
So what's the navigation polygon instance.

33
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.140
No navigation instance polygon I'm not even reading my own slide am I.

34
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.720
What is it.

35
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.200
Well you're going to draw a shape on the map right.

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.290
Just like we did with collision shapes collision polygon.

37
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.500
It has to be one single shape.

38
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.730
Right.

39
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.510
I can't have a blob on the left hand side of the screen in the blob on the right hand side screen and

40
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.410
not having connecting and expect the NPC has to move from one to the other.

41
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
And we can edit this pretty easily an engine we can grab all these points and drag it around just like

42
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.830
we did with collision polygons.

43
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.200
If we do this entire map what we're gonna do is we're gonna go into the auto tile and we're going to

44
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.750
specify just like we do with occlusion what parts can have a navigation on them.

45
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.850
Now these navigation shapes have to align perfectly at the edge of each tile.

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.510
They can't go over the edge and they can't miss it.

47
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.570
It has to be pixel perfect.

48
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.950
If there is a 1 pixel gap or overlap the navigation just won't work.

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.600
Now one advantage of using a tile map that we're not going to be exploring this game is you could in

50
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.210
theory have your time map edited at runtime.

51
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.710
You could have a level editor that the player can use in game.

52
00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.370
You could have dynamic events like an earthquake or give the player a drill that gets rid of walls and

53
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.750
it can instantly put in the navigation there.

54
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.600
So that's a nice little trick.

55
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.270
Okay.

56
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.830
Little bit more theory and I'll get into it.

57
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.200
Let's say that this is a level.

58
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.270
This is actually the layout I had in the previous version when we did this in 3.0.

59
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.750
And let's say we're gonna move this garden left in the circle to the diamond on the right.

60
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.930
Okay.

61
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.810
So you just pick that point.

62
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.310
Now what's going to happen is gotto is going to say okay what's the shortest way of getting there.

63
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.390
So I know I can't hit walls I can only go with these floors.

64
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.470
Let's draw a series of line and is going to take the position of each line and number them zero one

65
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.210
two three.

66
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.140
Why zero.

67
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.530
Because we always count from zero.

68
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.150
And these are gonna be added as vector twos in an array.

69
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.550
So quick recap navigation to denote is going to use a navigation polygon instance or a tile map.

70
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.690
And it has to have the navigation installed of using a tile map.

71
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.070
It's going to create a path using a function called get simple path.

72
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.400
We'll look at the next video and that path is gonna be an array of vector 2s.

73
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.810
Okay.

74
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.940
So it's just a simple coordinate system.

75
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.810
And what we're going to tell the script to do is start moving towards point zero when you're close enough

76
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.320
just get to the next point the list when you've run out of points.

77
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.350
Start the process again.

78
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.370
Okay that's a lot of talking.

79
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.680
Let's actually get into it.

80
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.610
First thing I need to do is make a navigation to denote.

81
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.040
So let's just go navigation Judy.

82
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.940
There it is.

83
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.410
Okay.

84
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.910
Our navigation must be a child of this.

85
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.960
Now let's say we gonna start with navigation polygon navigation polygon instance and it's going to tell

86
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.700
us little error right here.

87
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.550
You don't have one.

88
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.650
Okay let's make one we make a brand new nav poly new navigation polygon and we're ready to go and add

89
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.290
some points and I can tell snapping on if I want a quick and dirty now.

90
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.000
Collision is on so I can have my navigation go through the wall if the Guard is trying to get right

91
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.740
here with my mouses it won't work right.

92
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.850
So I can very quickly just make a little outline.

93
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.040
This would be a lot easier if I was

94
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.870
using SNAP but quick and dirty method I'm not gonna do the whole map was gonna give you a quick demonstration

95
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.820
Lulu.

96
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.200
Lulu correct.

97
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.180
And I've closed it and it's nice and green.

98
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.710
It's valid.

99
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.250
I can now go to edits this blue one and I can drag the ones that don't like and you can see they're

100
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.920
all numbered.

101
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.490
I can even do this in a script if I wanted.

102
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.070
Now they're awesome walls here.

103
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.970
We don't want the NPC to get stuck on the walls so let's add them right.

104
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.970
Go click like so.

105
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.350
And just add these walls.

106
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.250
Nice and easy.

107
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.810
And now that's part of the map too right.

108
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.390
And do the same thing again.

109
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.770
Be careful you know drag it like I just did.

110
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.290
Okay I should've done this with SNAP but you get the idea right.

111
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.570
Here is something nice and easy.

112
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.870
Now what happens if I decide you know what.

113
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.370
I'm just gonna go into my Tom up and get rid of that section of wall.

114
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.470
Now there's a gap and that becomes really annoying.

115
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.680
Right.

116
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.780
This is a lot less versatile so now I have to start tweaking things manually making sure I haven't missed

117
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.530
them.

118
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.450
So I don't really want to use a navigation polygons.

119
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.560
Only get rid of that.

120
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.560
Instead we're going to use a tile map so I can drag this up to here so I can have my time map at the

121
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.440
beginning and in fact I'm not going to do that because I should be doing this in templates.

122
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.220
Let's just delete you and go into template which is levels template level.

123
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.210
Great.

124
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.740
I'm going to add in our navigation to Dee.

125
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.560
There it is.

126
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.700
Put it right on top.

127
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.730
Don't do anything yet.

128
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.950
What I want to do.

129
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.840
And please don't do this yet because there is a bug.

130
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.520
Well I want to do is take tile map and put it as a child of navigation to.

131
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.440
Because otherwise no navigation information will go from time app to navigation 2D.

132
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.320
But if I do this things will go wrong.

133
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.120
And to demonstrate will go wrong I've actually got another version of gotto right here and I'm gonna

134
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.210
make a navigation to denote.

135
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.500
There it is and put at the top.

136
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.760
And just to show that it's exactly the same right here's the level you can see that it's not the same

137
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.970
one.

138
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.670
He's the one they're erased.

139
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.620
He's the one that's new or old.

140
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.320
He's the backup.

141
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.840
You know what I mean.

142
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:19.750
He's a backup if I drag this to here and save it.

143
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.970
We lose all of the tile map changes which is really annoying.

144
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.350
Now it might not be the end of the world.

145
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.190
We haven't done much yet.

146
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.160
And if you're happy with that that's fine go from that.

147
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.280
But if you want to keep your level information we need a workaround.

148
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.340
So let's get back into the current version of gutter.

149
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.160
That's the right one.

150
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.680
Good and one would do then to go into my template what I'm to do is I'm a duplicate the existing top

151
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.740
map conical Tom up to doing that means I don't have to recreate the time map we have.

152
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.860
And we'll take Tom up to and drag it to navigation to be cool.

153
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:58.890
Let's rename that because I want to be called Tom up to and save it.

154
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.250
Now when I look at the level I still got it because the original tile map is still here.

155
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.120
So now what I need to do is go to this tile map.

156
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.900
Let's just.

157
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.840
There we go trace over the original.

158
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.900
It's a little bit fiddly it doesn't really matter if we don't get it perfect but I can just hide the

159
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.980
original and see when I've drawn and some have traced the walls first I might miss a few.

160
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.480
La la la la la la la.

161
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.840
Might keep some of these details actually kind of nice.

162
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:42.700
Right click to get rid of these bits and zoom zoom zoom.

163
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.810
I should be fast forwarding this but I kind of want you guys to see the process.

164
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.730
It's not as bad as it sounds but we haven't done too much of a level yet.

165
00:08:52.610 --> 00:09:00.490
OK so now if I hide the original tile map I can see what's missing it looks like I have all the walls.

166
00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:00.790
Great.

167
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.040
Let's go to pink fill and just put the floors in.

168
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.620
You know what this height here is.

169
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.680
And I mean painful bucket fill.

170
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.230
There we go.

171
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:15.100
Boop boop awesome back to painful just in case I do think silly and that's looking good now.

172
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.360
Save that.

173
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.320
Go back to my template level and delete the original tile map.

174
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.530
That is not part of navigation today.

175
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.670
This whole thing is a work workaround because of a bug as far as I'm aware the time up information should

176
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.620
have been kept.

177
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.820
But we're doing something a little unusual so it's a nice workaround.

178
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.580
Great.

179
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.830
With that old in place let's actually ask some navigation so to do that I'm going to edit the tile set

180
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.910
so it's all set.

181
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.870
Let's go back to giant full screen click on that.

182
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.910
And the only ones we really care about of these floor tiles.

183
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.130
Right.

184
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.730
So let's click on the floor tiles and we're going to add in navigation.

185
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.080
And if I do the full square just like we do with collision I just need to do these.

186
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.680
So it's really not that bad

187
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:07.240
select click square select select click square select and now the navigation setup wherever there is

188
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.870
a floor.

189
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.550
This will happen now at some point we're going to be adding furniture and you'll see as a bunch of furniture

190
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.580
here.

191
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.770
If we put furniture in as a top map will lose the floor and said look bad.

192
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:23.050
So we'll have a little work around later on which basically involve having a second time up just a furniture

193
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.220
over it.

194
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.080
But that's pretty good.

195
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:30.320
Now we have navigation navigation 2D not complaining Tom it is good to go.

196
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.410
We can save it.

197
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:31.660
All right.

198
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.310
One more thing want to do.

199
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.880
I want to add some destinations.

200
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.820
So to do this I won't make it a child navigation to the again.

201
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.730
So back into my template and let's add a new node control a or just press the plus button and just a

202
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.850
basic node and uncle this destinations or rename not repair it.

203
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.270
So rename destinations boop.

204
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.930
And in this I'm going to use a node could put position 2D.

205
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:04.970
So I'm going to go to my navigation node add in a position to denote generic 2D position hint for editing.

206
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.540
This is something that only exists in the editor.

207
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:13.180
I mean it's in the game but no one can see it and it's just this thing here and I can move it around

208
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.740
so like move that's just a little crosshair I zoom out it's still there.

209
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.660
So it's just there for us as level editors as game editors to see if you can use these things for all

210
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.620
kinds of fun stuff pivot points or the rest of it but this is any destination.

211
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.920
So let's rename this to destination destination.

212
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.680
Zero.

213
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.020
Great.

214
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.860
And I would duplicate it.

215
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.740
There is one.

216
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.250
So I'm going to add a few randomly.

217
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.640
And now we're set up.

218
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.720
We can make this as big as we want as small as we want.

219
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.540
We have lots and lots of little places.

220
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.930
I don't want to put the God in the would you call it style room.

221
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.740
Let's put one here and another there and that's looking pretty solid.

222
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.050
And that's really all there is to it.

223
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.220
Now quick challenge.

224
00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.390
It's not really a challenge.

225
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.930
It's just do what I just did but make your own level create your navigation 2D.

226
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:07.190
Don't be afraid to tweak the level make it is also more as simple as you like and adding a bunch of

227
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.790
destinations.

228
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.320
How many entirely up to you.

229
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.480
But there should be more destinations on your level than there are gods or you can get some weird behavior.

230
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.140
So pause the video do that.

231
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.600
And when you come back we can wrap up the video

232
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.050
walk back in this video we've looked at how to set up a navigation to any node and we've looked at both

233
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:29.530
navigation instance polygons or using the timeout features.

234
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.380
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
