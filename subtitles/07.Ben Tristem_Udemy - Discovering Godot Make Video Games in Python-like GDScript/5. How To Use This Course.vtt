00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.590
Hi folks.

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.410
And welcome.

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.230
In this video I'm going to show you how to use the Course specifically what resources we have to help

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.830
you.

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.710
You're going to get stuff from time to time or just have ideas you want to run past people or just want

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.950
to test your understanding.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.470
So how can you do that.

8
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.010
Where can you go for help and when should you look for help.

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.730
Let's talk about the second one first.

10
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.770
We encourage you to use these resources and to get help.

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.070
But we'd also like to encourage you to try and fix these problems first.

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.370
It could be a great way of learning.

13
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.330
So if you're doing something that's not quite working try for about 20 minutes to fix it yourself.

14
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.220
If after that you're just stuck and you don't know where to go.

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.920
Then go look for help.

16
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.390
Try and get in the habit of understanding the engine well enough to get there first.

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.810
But if you can't that's fine.

18
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.210
I get stuck all the time.

19
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.760
There's nothing wrong with asking for help.

20
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.950
So where would we look for help.

21
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.860
Well the first place to go is udemy itself right.

22
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.190
The site that you're watching this video on this is great for really short questions.

23
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.560
What's the name of this function.

24
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.250
Is there a way that I could get collision in kinematic to these body that kind of thing.

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.350
You can just post in the Q and A and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

26
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.690
But what if you have more involve question or you want to run ideas past people or you're just not quite

27
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.570
sure and you'd like more that's conversation.

28
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.890
Well then we have two options.

29
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.140
The first thing you can do is you can go to the game dev TV community site so you open your web browser

30
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.690
and just enter those forms are show that nasacort.

31
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.360
The other thing you can do is join our disco channel discord as a free chat thing it has voice and text.

32
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.890
We primarily use written text but if you want to use voice go for it.

33
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.670
It's a really friendly community and frankly there all the time so I drop by.

34
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.570
Let's show you what these things look like.

35
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.530
So first off here we are in discord It's a lovely friendly place.

36
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.910
And we've got people saying hi to you already.

37
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.470
And we've got channels for God.

38
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.260
Oh and our other courses are his that blender course very popular one his the bogeying course and all

39
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.910
kinds of other fun stuff in here.

40
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.660
Right place to show your work really friendly communic community.

41
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.610
And the invite for this is in the resources of this video.

42
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.140
So just click on the dischord link and you'll get taken here.

43
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.970
We also have this game live TV community site so that's also your resources community.

44
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.770
Game day of TV and a very friendly place to share information on all the courses.

45
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.400
Every time we create a lecture or a section it will automatically get populated here in this forum.

46
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.100
So here's the good one with this cheerful little god.

47
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
A robot icon so you can just jump in and chat with people ask questions.

48
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.140
Share your thoughts share your projects get help with all kinds of problems.

49
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.560
Really fun place.

50
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.300
So now here's our first challenge.

51
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.470
Whenever you see this slide with the big green border and this little pause like on here this is a challenge

52
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.590
that I'm going to give you.

53
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.810
The idea is to tell you what the challenges your pause the video and then you'll come back.

54
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.120
So very simple.

55
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.820
Just drop by and say hi in one of the social spaces.

56
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.080
You could do this either in the you know me.

57
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.830
Q And a.

58
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.060
If you do this please do us a favour.

59
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.300
Mark you post as answered.

60
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.390
We do want to talk to you.

61
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.000
May I say hi.

62
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.480
But we're going to prioritize problems people have.

63
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.200
And so if your thing is Mark's answered it's going to not go to the very top of the queue so someone

64
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.240
has a critical problem we can deal with that first or go to the kind of community forum into the got

65
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.020
section one area.

66
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.560
This section you're in and just say hi and tell us what you're doing or go to the game discord server.

67
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.710
You know I have to give any personal information you can just say hi.

68
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.610
Tell me what you're interested in learning anything like that and once you've done that you're ready

69
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.690
to move on to the next video.
