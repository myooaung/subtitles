00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.480
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.200
You aromatic go to people.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.090
I am desperately running out of adjectives but I liked aromatic it made me smile.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
In this video we're going to learn about texture progress notes.

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.970
We're going to start work on a suspicion meter a fail safe for our game and in this video we are going

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.040
to sell the gooey for the next we're going to wire it together a longer you'll seen by any kind of NBC.

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.950
The more suspicious they get and if it reaches the full amount the game will be over.

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.320
And if you stay out of sight it'll slowly decrease so let's get right into got.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.690
Okay so if we're making you scene I want to gooey and gooey is going to travel around with the camera.

10
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.310
Okay so give me the center of a press play you will see us.

11
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.830
I'm in the center right here.

12
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.970
And as I move around I want the gooey to be right here.

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.360
I want it suspicion me to down here.

14
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.140
And then later on we can add other stuff to the corners.

15
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.930
I also wanna make sure that the gooey doesn't change color with our canvas modulation and that that

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.500
guard stops playing with the sofa.

17
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.600
That's irrelevant.

18
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.560
And that we can move.

19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.620
And that when we move it'll move with us.

20
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.680
I don't want it being stuck on the level in that corner.

21
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.330
I want to move with the camera.

22
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.150
Both these tell me that I can't just use a control node as my route.

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.570
I want a canvas layer.

24
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.440
So what I'm to do is make a brand new scene and get a custom node I would type in canvas layer and named

25
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.270
as gooey capitals capitals for graphic user interface.

26
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.240
I'm going to save this and put it in interface and call it gooey and before I go any further.

27
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.300
So I don't forget to do this.

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.620
I'm gonna go into my levels go into my template level I'm going to add it in as a child here.

29
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.800
So was going to instance in our gooey which is right here and it's now there.

30
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.240
Great.

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.510
I can close the template.

32
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.700
I don't need it.

33
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.070
Okay.

34
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.960
So right now we have an empty canvas modulation.

35
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.710
So let's put a control node as a child of that and I want the controller to cover whole screens can

36
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.800
be full rectangle.

37
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.720
And I wanted to to measure itself to anchor from all four corners if any of these corners is moved it

38
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.960
will take that into account as measurements.

39
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.980
Okay.

40
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.430
I want my suspicion meter down here.

41
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.920
So I'm an add a child lose control node and it's going to be a 9 patch rectangle and I'm going to take

42
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.270
a quick look in my graphics under interface underpin G I've got these lovely ladies one of them these

43
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.150
lovely graph glass panels because I have something in the corner here here and here I think that's pretty

44
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.670
good.

45
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.930
We've got these lovely little corner ones so this corner there we've got another corner I can't see

46
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.660
them from here.

47
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.920
Let's double click on the link.

48
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.400
Take a look.

49
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.870
Is all four corners.

50
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.570
This is the bottom left corner is cut is the bottom right corner is cut.

51
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.780
I want this one right here.

52
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.470
So that's going to be my main patch right.

53
00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.710
So it's a drag that's.

54
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.560
OK this is the wrong size.

55
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.980
So I'm going to resize this resize as under rect let's give it a good size.

56
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.090
How about 200 by 80.

57
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.170
That feels good.

58
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.500
And it's all blurry so let's put a patch margin I want to make sure I cover all of it so we can go.

59
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.590
Nice to be with 10.

60
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.890
I can go a little less but if I go at let's say six you'll notice something weird is happening that's

61
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.160
so 10 allows me to catch this entire corner for 10 pixels in awful directions and that's looking pretty

62
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.370
good.

63
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.560
Now I don't want it in this corner.

64
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.880
So I'm going to use my layout and I make sure it's anchored to all four rectangles again just to be

65
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.190
on the safe side I don't hit bottom right and let's give the margins on the margin and say we'll be

66
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.820
negative 24 picks us from the right and negative 24 from the bottom.

67
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.090
It's shrunk our mind petrol but that's still looking pretty good all right now everything from here

68
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.550
is going to be inheriting from its parent.

69
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.080
So I'm up with the theme on the control mode.

70
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.520
Let's just bring that in now so on the theme load in and what do we put it we put it on the interface

71
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.490
and a theme nice sensible place for it.

72
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.120
So the theme is now loaded him.

73
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.310
So now I can put a label in.

74
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.050
However let's think what we want in the center of this frame.

75
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.290
I want two things horizontal to label and some sort of progress meter.

76
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.950
So that tells me I need a center container put in a center container and that center container should

77
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.440
cover the entire rectangle.

78
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.100
However I don't want to go past these borders for any reason so since given a margin of we think six

79
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.080
almost perfect isn't it five let's say six six from all sides.

80
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.010
Negative six from there negative six from there.

81
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.540
And once I've got the center container I want to split things horizontally and I want to scale dramatically

82
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.380
so let's go within each box container

83
00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.100
so all the children of each box container will be organized horizontally in the order I put them in.

84
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.150
So let's start with the label.

85
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.780
And I'm going to write suspicion suspicion.

86
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.750
It's a little big isn't it.

87
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.290
I might have to.

88
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.040
I don't really want to change the font here so I might just make the nine page rating bigger.

89
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.710
Let's make it bigger.

90
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:27.400
Let's say you're on now to 40 by one hundred and let's reposition you so bottom right.

91
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.130
And then we'll lose some of that size I put my margins back in.

92
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.810
So that's a minus.

93
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.200
What do we say.

94
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.220
Twenty four minus 24.

95
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.310
Looking a little better I can live with that.

96
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.180
I might make this a little bit wider.

97
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.860
In fact I could just drag it and do that.

98
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.020
But I wanted to type them in so it would drag it make it look good because it's an eye patch it should

99
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.290
keep everything although it's distorting a little there.

100
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.370
So let's just give it a 20 pixel on all four sides.

101
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.380
It's nice and clear Mason crisp white.

102
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.440
So we have our suspicion label now.

103
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.750
I want my texture progress.

104
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.670
This is a new note as a child of each box container.

105
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.150
Let's make our texture progress.

106
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:19.310
This is a texture based progress bar so we can have a horizontal or we can have clockwise going vertical.

107
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.950
Any bar where you're measuring something.

108
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.390
OK.

109
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.100
So I've got it in here.

110
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.210
Now inside interface you've got a whole bunch of stuff you can do.

111
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.000
So you've got these horizontal bars you've got these circles get these little curses explore this and

112
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.540
use it.

113
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.700
What you do is you put an under a progress under is what does it look like not filled.

114
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.550
Progress is what it looks like filled.

115
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.510
You can use different fill modes left to right clockwise top to bottom whatever you want.

116
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.740
And if you play with it change the value here.

117
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.410
So your max value is 100 human value is zero.

118
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.350
You can change the value that.

119
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.670
So that's my challenge for you.

120
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.300
I'd like you to create your version of suspicion me to see what you're comfortable with play with a

121
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.910
little poser video.

122
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.710
Give it a shot.

123
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.710
And when you come back I'll show you my suspicion meter

124
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.300
and welcome back.

125
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.110
OK.

126
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.770
So I I'm going to use the dots and I don't want to use green and red.

127
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.940
That's really bad for critical information because so many people suffer from a form of color blindness

128
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.180
to confuse these two.

129
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:30.350
So I mean these dot shadow as my under enemy dot red as my progress and to check what it looks like.

130
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.110
Let's type in a value of twenty five.

131
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.200
And right now that's filling from left to right.

132
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:36.360
OK.

133
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.370
So if I drag that across you can see it fine but know what I want.

134
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.580
Let's go clockwise.

135
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.510
That to me feels a lot better.

136
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.020
Look at that

137
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.900
I'm really liking it.

138
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.360
So at this stage I think we're ready to take a look at what this looks like.

139
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.380
So I'm going to run the game now as I load this is going to be an issue first.

140
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.360
It looks fine right.

141
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.270
When I move around let's just not have full screen on for a minute I move around it should move with

142
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.170
me there it goes.

143
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.240
When I change colors it doesn't change color.

144
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.470
However let's go to the computer and use a computer.

145
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.920
I can't.

146
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.460
Why.

147
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.540
Well this control node covers the entire screen and I control node thinks it's ugly.

148
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.670
So when I'm pressing it it's trying to catch the mouse.

149
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.440
So it's got backups control mode.

150
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.830
And on the mouse I'm she'll say ignore the mouse.

151
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.320
You just don't do anything with it at all.

152
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.940
OK now I'll try that again I can look up the computer.

153
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.680
I can press it.

154
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.660
Eight 8 three double nine.

155
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.520
Over here.

156
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.140
Eight three double Nine has a flip we got over there walk through this door.

157
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.670
Dude can you just navigate.

158
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.710
Here's your door.

159
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.450
Come now.

160
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.230
And the suspicion meter is going to walk with me.

161
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:54.590
So boop and that's looking pretty good isn't it.

162
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.940
Now right now it's not working.

163
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.230
So let's take a look at how we can get that working.

164
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.270
If I go over here to remote.

165
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.010
This is what's happening alive.

166
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:04.450
OK.

167
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:11.420
So I can take a look at my gooey open the control over the line patch rectangle open the center container

168
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.510
and all the way down until I find a texture progress.

169
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.320
And let's change the value here to 50.

170
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.110
And back in the game and here it is 50.

171
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.620
OK.

172
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.570
So what I mean local that's just what the scene would normally look like remote is what is actually

173
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.480
running in-game now.

174
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.450
And any changes I make here will change in the game.

175
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.330
Useful little debugging thing you can do.

176
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.870
And that brings us to the end of this video in this video.

177
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.620
We've looked at how to use the texture progress note how to have the mouse ignore gooey elements if

178
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.450
we need to just go through the mouse and how to change these Specter values and see those changes in

179
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.330
game so that's really good progress.

180
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.080
Excellent work.

181
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:52.340
And I'll see you in the next video.
