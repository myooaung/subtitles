00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.130
Hello delightful God people on Welcome back.

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.150
In this video we're going to start adding polish to the game what some people call putting juice into

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.570
the game.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.560
I'm going to call.

5
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.630
Awesome.

6
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.750
Our game is pretty much functional It's feature complete.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.540
Everything we need is in there.

8
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.010
Now let's make it awesome.

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.380
We're going to put in some set dressing a bunch of background details to mimic the level really pop.

10
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.100
So let's take a look at some of the assets.

11
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.960
And I've just realized that the armature control modes are showing someone to get rid of those.

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.270
If you ever get this his aid that go into view and skeleton gizmo visibility I don't want to see any

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.060
skeleton bits.

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.300
That's good.

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.510
So I want to add some extra things in and we've got some assets you can use.

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.640
You don't have to use these assets you can make your own assets look under models you'll see a bunch

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.900
of things who haven't got.

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.350
First off we've got this advert Let's take a look at it.

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.140
There's adverts designed to be the kind of ad you might see at a soccer or football match.

20
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.670
So if I change this material See I want to give it a different colour that looks good.

21
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.430
I can't actually see anything here.

22
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:19.210
And let's give that texture so the graphics got advert albedo and it's there.

23
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.110
Can't see it.

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.010
So let's go to flags and make unshaded to see what's going on.

25
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.450
It's just one of these little do hickeys there's no ambient light in this scene.

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.570
I'm not quite sure why not.

27
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.130
But that's what that looks like.

28
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.500
If you ever need to look at something without the lighting just temporarily change it's mature like

29
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.010
that.

30
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.400
So I've got one of those and I quite like that.

31
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.700
I must save this material.

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.090
We can use the floppy disk and that's looking at what else we got on the model so the advert.

33
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.250
We've got a bunch of toys.

34
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.020
We've got a bear made in the blender course and donated to us by our very own Mark.

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.690
The Irresistible jelly so thank you Mark.

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.720
And as you look at the Bear I've got to put some materials on them already.

37
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.150
But feel free to change them.

38
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.910
I keep using the wrong.

39
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.100
I've been in blender for a little bit changed Sony's models so I'm using the wrong mouse shortcuts and

40
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.990
keys which is why I'm looking all over the place.

41
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.520
But here we have a little bear.

42
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.740
Just some very simple materials I've put together.

43
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.890
Feel free to change them if you want to use this.

44
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.130
What else we've got.

45
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.180
We've got some blocks silicon you inherited seen.

46
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.380
This is just a cube.

47
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.920
Actually I found a texture remapped for the cube called it blocks study and then use a Kenny texture

48
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.140
to change the material so just put some letters on it so we got some building blocks.

49
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.190
Not in blocks letter blocks where they're called.

50
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.120
And finally this little wagon.

51
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.230
Look at the Agam which currently does not have any materials and it looks like it's the wrong scale

52
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.690
so to do is because to import and under root scale that's change that to 5 in 5 times bigger cycle.

53
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.890
Yes much like change the scenery to wagon and you'll notice there's a bunch of different material.

54
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.730
So let's figure out what's this.

55
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.300
This is the actual wagh ANY some would give that a simple new special material not shader spatial.

56
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.490
There it is and I make that red because it red wagon.

57
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.320
Yes that's not so.

58
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.310
I don't know and I'm on a save that as a red wagon material so save us and I'll put it in the same fold

59
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.280
as you so it's easy to see what's fault what goes with what some toys and a wagon and I call this red

60
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.280
dot material I could call it a t s.

61
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.840
But cleaned up the Makes it easier to see what it's supposed to be and the rest of these I'm thinking

62
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240
so simple tint colour.

63
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.790
Let's make this a very simple simple thing that simple.

64
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.740
So brand new special material.

65
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:57.180
Click on the material and this is going to be white but I'm going to give it full metallicity and zura

66
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.520
roughness So that'll be good.

67
00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.250
And you know what.

68
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.130
Let's also give the red some to trading in a minute.

69
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.490
Not going to shade them I sure to mention the metal can I.

70
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.270
We can see what looks like to unshaded when we get to the main scene.

71
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.960
But first let's finish texturing this and then we can say that I'm a save the material and what I call

72
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.390
this tin.

73
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.150
OK.

74
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.350
And now women do is I'm sure to load this material into the rest of these objects they're all going

75
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.110
to be 10 so delicious.

76
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.410
So.

77
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.660
All of these open material and drag them in.

78
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.070
I must say this as a scene so in scenes and going to called wagon.

79
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.000
Let's see what it looks like in games so let's have a new node for Holder.

80
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.820
I a call this decal to get name.

81
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.920
I'm just going to incense in the bag and see how it looks in this lighting so let's see scenes where

82
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.670
you got a wagon.

83
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.840
Yeah 10 materials you're really not doing it.

84
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.160
So let's change that.

85
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.290
Let's see tin material.

86
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.840
Do be do shake you to zero point five outlets a little bit better.

87
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.010
And you know it would make you sort of grey.

88
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.120
Zero point seven five.

89
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.850
Maybe a little bit of blue in there.

90
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.370
And while we're at it and so save that for now looks a bit more like 10.

91
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.780
So it looks like a toy.

92
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.380
Save that murgon read material.

93
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.630
Unless two shits are parameters to enchaining and save that now one to run it real quick.

94
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.720
See if that sticks in your notice.

95
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.340
Things are going through because there's no collision here but yeah that's looking good.

96
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.410
So I've made a toy.

97
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.000
Any other toys we can look at before we carry on.

98
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.400
There's the three toys I've given you.

99
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.770
Okay so we've got some basic toys we can use before that happens.

100
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.500
This puts more Decadron specifically this black background is killing limboed right so I've got some

101
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.870
more things to show you.

102
00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.930
Second the graphics which is on the graphics and I've found this little background and there's all the

103
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.910
links I give you the beginning and this flawed texture.

104
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.560
So let's start indic or making a new meshes.

105
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.580
This and this is going to be a plane.

106
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.000
Would you go.

107
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.460
Plane.

108
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.790
There you are going to have this immaterial so new material.

109
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.400
New spatial material.

110
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.410
Click on that and bilas can be white.

111
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.950
And this is going to be as you will this the floor.

112
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.760
But the floor texture.

113
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.970
Now I can't see it because it's underneath.

114
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.320
But look there it is awesome and clearly this is going to have to be much bigger than the pitch.

115
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.890
So let's go the save this save.

116
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:47.890
As I recall this floor material and like go into the mash.

117
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.010
Let's see what's a good size for this.

118
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.680
The pitch is 20 something as now.

119
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.050
So let's say 30 by 30.

120
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.610
And obviously way too high so let's lower.

121
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.170
Now I don't need to put any kind of collision on this.

122
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.840
I'm not going to bother mikkel this floor.

123
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.810
And let's see how it looks from the camera's point of view.

124
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.200
OK so we're going to need to make this bigger floor.

125
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.230
We need you on the x axis to be closer to 40.

126
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.530
K at 50 is looking pretty good okay.

127
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:34.170
In any actual game because only to see what this looks like in engine it was still cutting to the side

128
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.710
OK.

129
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.860
So let's make you giant as make it 100 by 100 particular size.

130
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.990
But that should do it.

131
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.780
That's a Glock.

132
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.390
There's our floor 100 by 100.

133
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.610
I'm going to put a back wall here.

134
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.790
I'm not too worried about that.

135
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.130
In fact let's put the back all in so out of camera of you because you can't really replace stuff.

136
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.780
And we going to put another plane right here.

137
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.580
So.

138
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.570
New mesh instance listening this one is going to be back wall.

139
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.750
Let's see what's happening with it.

140
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.150
It's a plane and it needs a new material so new special material.

141
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.180
Under bideau.

142
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.480
And I'm a drag in the hipster background nine has a good name hipster background nine.

143
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:21.750
OK.

144
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.790
Cool save hipster background Nine's material.

145
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.860
I would call this back wall dot material

146
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:39.870
and let's rotate this so back into the mash and transform you are 90 degrees.

147
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.350
Come back

148
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.120
and let's see I want you back roughly here I guess where is that.

149
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.780
That's negative 12.

150
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.660
Looks good.

151
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:58.940
And not worry about the height just yet but I am worried about the size of the mash is unchanged in

152
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.340
them the size not the scale.

153
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.140
Let's call you 50 by 50.

154
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.500
How does that look from the camera.

155
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.580
Camera camera camera.

156
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.610
Needs to be there.

157
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.520
Because look at these big gaps here.

158
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.880
So back wall.

159
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.130
Mesh.

160
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.060
And let's do another hundred by 100.

161
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:21.960
Much more like it.

162
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.400
I get Pressplay.

163
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.190
We could probably close to the pitch you couldn't play with the angle but we're starting to get here.

164
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:36.960
Now what I've got here is a little floor was like a kitchen floor and a slightly dusty back wall.

165
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.690
The texture is actually looking a little bit too close isn't it.

166
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.040
So can I make that smaller.

167
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.780
Can I get away with that.

168
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.660
About 75.

169
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.840
It's a high def texture but you know there's only so much you can do.

170
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.460
In fact I don't need it that high do I.

171
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.650
It's looking a little better.

172
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.840
Now one of the do them put another mesh here a box that's going to be a ledge.

173
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.060
What do you call them a runner.

174
00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.930
I've got what I call a skirting board.

175
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:09.790
That's the bunny.

176
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.160
I think it's called a skirting board not called a bunny.

177
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.780
Another meche instance whatever it's called.

178
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.690
And this was going to be a box.

179
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.340
So cube.

180
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.230
Yeah.

181
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.660
And out of camp a pretty remote so I can see what I'm doing.

182
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.740
I was going to move you to here and movie up a little bit.

183
00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.610
There we go.

184
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.740
All right.

185
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:34.540
Now this one I don't mind scaling because the material on it give it is going to be just a simple albedo

186
00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:41.500
colour so let's go into the material and give this a nice sort of Terra Cotta Guy.

187
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.460
And you know what let's to shade this nice.

188
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.430
Okay save this skirting board material

189
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.980
and put a capital there and let's see.

190
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.530
Easiest thing to do is colour scale it's a press article a scale mode.

191
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.630
And there we go.

192
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.830
Perfect.

193
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.640
How you look.

194
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:15.310
Such to shading was the wrong call so let's not to show it because we weren't able to see the shadows

195
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.430
of the angle the lights that's not cutting any shadows but that's looking a little better.

196
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.640
I could go right up to the edge there what that look like.

197
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.700
Less realistic.

198
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.330
Pretty decent.

199
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.720
Okay.

200
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.440
So this is starting to look like an actual environment.

201
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.150
Right.

202
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.910
We've got a lot of tension going on and that's cool.

203
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.710
All the floor look like tin shaded.

204
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.740
Let's take a look.

205
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.990
Floor material turns shading.

206
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.700
A little too bright.

207
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.910
I'm not going to initiate that.

208
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.150
Let's make it a although only two shading the actual pieces we are using.

209
00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.710
OK so here we have our little scene and when I move my wagon over to the left here so let's take the

210
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.150
wagon where the wagon come back that I'm not caught.

211
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.130
Oh let's name things skirting board.

212
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.150
And wagon going to just move you here for now.

213
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.490
See you over to the side is the last little detail and you know what let's scale it up even more.

214
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.570
So scale he says five.

215
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.020
You look like 10.

216
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.960
And let's get back into that material.

217
00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.450
So where is that as under toys wagon tin material.

218
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.610
Now I want this to be more reflective and to do that I should probably change that default environment

219
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.660
going to environment.

220
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.150
And when I play with a few more options here let's switch on SS reflections we've got a little bit of

221
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.410
reflectivity that's looking a lot more like metal.

222
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.070
So I like that.

223
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.000
I don't wanna play with auto exposure because it's already bright enough.

224
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.190
I could play with tone map but again it's plenty bright.

225
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.940
I don't want any glow.

226
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.030
I actually don't.

227
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.820
But if you want glow that's we'd find it all the different things you can find.

228
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.050
So I've put in some reflection I can raise the reflection a bit if I like another that material doesn't

229
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.100
need to be quite so blue.

230
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:11.870
So let's make it a little closer to white about that they're nice and it'll actually reflect so if I

231
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:17.150
move the wagons over here you could see it reflected the pitch.

232
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.660
There's the player so we can put this in a good angle and actually get some details in.

233
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.850
That looks pretty dramatic when the ball comes in there a little reflection rotating.

234
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.050
And let's just move you off pitch slightly.

235
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:29.960
How do you look.

236
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.270
Coming along OK.

237
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.140
So now here's my challenge.

238
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.900
I'd like you to decorate your game set dressing add the background details you want play with the toys

239
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.060
have given mess of the materials put in tune shading change the reflection whatever you want but give

240
00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.750
an awesome background or lots of little details.

241
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.830
For Cupid kickabout.

242
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.310
If you've got some extra models lying around if you've been playing blender or you've found something

243
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.410
cool that you're allowed to use that you want to use.

244
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.290
Put it in the game.

245
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.390
Let's see what you can make.

246
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.940
So pause the video go crazy with the decoration scales and when you back when you're ready come back

247
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.300
and I'll show you my level.

248
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.260
Right Welcome back.

249
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.580
I was about to show you my finished thing but I realize that there's been a bit of an export problem.

250
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.110
Look we have lamps in with this cube which is a bit annoying.

251
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.760
So one of the do is I'm going to take the actual mesh of the cube and on the export VAT to sort of do

252
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.390
is just go save branch a scene and call vaccine.

253
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.260
BLOCK coop.

254
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:31.930
Now this look what I've built.

255
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.920
And welcome back.

256
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.870
And here's what I've made.

257
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.550
So I've had to do a few tweaks.

258
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.650
First off I start with the arm wygant the whack a little bit smaller because it was taking up the entire

259
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.100
left hand side of the screen.

260
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.760
So I got here and holding box I spell out the word love because that's all you need.

261
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.130
Here's my advert.

262
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.040
I brought the advert in.

263
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.110
I made the advert a little bit bigger and I had to turn off the reflectivity of it because it was just

264
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.330
it was reflecting too much.

265
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.050
I couldn't read it.

266
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:05.870
So let's take a look what I did fail as go in to advert so all I did was I.

267
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:13.420
Scroll down to a metallic and undid that so it was at one now at zero and you know what.

268
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.940
If you aren't using a lot of 2mb shading make sure you're the roughnesses at one that is really flat

269
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.270
low.

270
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.570
Looks really good.

271
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.380
The bear didn't change the materials at all.

272
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.550
The block didn't change the material at all and that actually really happy with Couple things I will

273
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.820
do.

274
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.890
I to make the materials for the back wall and the floor flat as well.

275
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.100
I didn't check those that I.

276
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.050
So let's go into those roughness.

277
00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:45.070
Yeah I see one just gives it a much more well cartoony artificial self made it feel it's not actually

278
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.160
sleeping in the floor.

279
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:52.230
But with these little drawn in textures it seems to fit for me so I like it and that's looking.

280
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.380
Oh I forgot a thing.

281
00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:59.120
Oh I made a new texel Within didn't talk about it probably seen already but let's go back to graphics.

282
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:04.450
I made this very professional looking painting thing here which if you want to make one like that you

283
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.290
can make your own wood if you want to use this high quality artwork I've made.

284
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.170
By all means do so.

285
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:21.240
A mash instance Europe plane and movie ups I can see the texture or new new material you special.

286
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.290
The Albino is going to have this lovely texture on it.

287
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.210
There it is.

288
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.950
Look at that and save that as painting materials.

289
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:35.820
I can go under graphics I guess because it doesn't actually exist anywhere else.

290
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.160
Picture dot material there it is.

291
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.000
And let's just move that around a bit sir.

292
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.730
Like so collings on so you can't see the back of it.

293
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.920
But that's better.

294
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:58.990
OK now get onto a transforms you are minus 90 on the x most much on why most out on the set that's easy

295
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.330
and let's make it bigger.

296
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:11.590
So let's see I want 6 on the X and 9 on the why I think that's roughly the right proportion.

297
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:22.950
Almost 7 on the X even 8 7 6 7 7 9 very Star Trek Voyager.

298
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.490
OK.

299
00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:24.540
Let me wager.

300
00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.160
I think I do.

301
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.210
I get my Star Trek's confused.

302
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.870
You don't get your Star Trek confused.

303
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.400
Why don't you take them in the comments.

304
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.910
I mean can I.

305
00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.590
I've got gritz napping on why.

306
00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.740
There we go.

307
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.330
This one I want to get as close to there as possible without going through because I don't want the

308
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.370
shadow in.

309
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.710
And that may be there.

310
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.460
Is to be a little bit lower doesn't it.

311
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.410
That's put on this side.

312
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.280
Get away from the bear.

313
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.030
Which is good advice when you play in any kind of sport.

314
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:02.300
Fantastic.

315
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.930
So that can be achcha.

316
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.590
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video with enhanced player experience with background

317
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.070
details.

318
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:20.910
Or if you prefer adding the awesome bringing the juice making the game ganey not game either means tough

319
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:21.790
to eat anyway.

320
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.880
How did you do it how.

321
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.960
How's your level that kind of details you bring in.

322
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.880
Did you make extra stuff or find extra stuff.

323
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.560
What kind of materials use.

324
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.430
Share with us.

325
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.510
I'm dying to find out and be really cool to see all the different games of Cube do kick about that can

326
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.430
come about.

327
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.570
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
