00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,530
Hello again you lovely go to people in this video we're going to continue our work on the suspicion

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,110
meter.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,380
We're going to make some suspicious and pieces so what we need to do.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,940
Well first thing let's decide how suspicion works when the player is seen the suspicion meter will go

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,970
up if we're out a line of sight.

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,220
The suspicion meter will lower and it will lower a slower rate.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,980
I want to be risky right way to hide and if the suspicion meter is completely full we will lose the

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,590
game.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,450
So let's get to it.

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,530
First thing I do is I make sure that our suspicion meter has a script.

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:43,010
So let's go into our galley which is easiest way to do that is to just click here and I'm going to rename

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,090
texture progress to suspicion meter so I can see what I'm working with suspicion meter.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,540
And let's give a script now before we start playing with this let's take a look what we already have

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,200
to play with.

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,170
If we look in the range here you'll notice that there are some properties.

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,470
We have a minimum value a maximum value.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,910
And we've really looked at us at value right.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,570
So if I just draw this up I just hit a 25 because he's 25 out of 100 it's called awful.

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,700
And I can drag that value up and down.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,560
Now what's interesting here is we can change things like step.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,440
How much do you got myself I got by 10 and I start dragging the value up so let's put you at 20 you'll

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,920
notice that it now goes in increments of 10.

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,900
We can use these for our advantage.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,610
We're gonna use max value step and value rather than make our own variables is no reason to make variables

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,140
here.

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,910
The one variable I do want to use is gonna be an export variable.

27
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:53,400
I will call suspicion multiplier and this become clear in a moment of analysis as to very fast I'll

28
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:00,120
do as well set the ready function Ludmilla and just make sure that value is set at zero.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,360
So if you've been playing with it an inspector it'll go back down to zero.

30
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:12,880
Every single frame I want the suspicion meter to drop so let's go function process.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,870
No reason to do this in the physics lab and I'm going to set the value property which is built in to

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,120
be minus equal the step which is built in right We've already looked at these.

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,220
What this means is every single frame the value meter whatever this number is will go down by whatever

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,360
this number is.

35
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,220
Now we don't need to clamp this because by default we're gonna be clamped between minimum value and

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,190
maximum value.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,670
We could enable these to enable greater enable ESA to bypass that but I don't want to do that.

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,270
I want this kept in range.

39
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,560
I now don't need to worry about clamping this at all I don't need to make sure don't go below this value

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,140
and don't go above that one God is going to handle it for me.

41
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,680
So when the player is seen let's make a function for that we want this value to go up so function play

42
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,090
a scene and I want the value to go up

43
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:13,780
however this is where the multiplier comes in because for the code on him if we're dropping down by

44
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,260
the same level we're going up we're not actually going to go up.

45
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:24,190
So this has to be a little bit faster so suspicion multiply by two Halloween you glory has got to people

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,680
future Yan here and I have just noticed a weird bug here I'm editing the video getting ready to put

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,260
up on the site and I have realized what I've done I have got step multiplied by step multiplier multiplied

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,770
by two I've just squared the step multiplier I should not have done that I should have step multiplied

49
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,650
by step multiplier and then stop.

50
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,120
So when it starts going crazy in a while that's why I will fix that next video but just to give you

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,740
a quick heads up Don't copy what I've just done.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:04:02,200
OK back to present Yan now the moment I'm keeping this very simple all right I'm using integers you

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,330
don't have to but if you're not going to I would ask you to do to go to rounded that'll allow you to

54
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,970
use partial values let's say I'm going to be half as fast and it'll still display won't throw the Evaluate

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,360
otherwise it'll just throw the value away All right so we're going to go up twice as fast as we drop

56
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,670
now we can say if the value is equal to the max value which is a property within this then and the game

57
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:40,450
and in our case ending the game at this stage it's just going to quit right out we're not gonna have

58
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:47,510
to make a screen later of and game screen with a restart in the else but for now let's just drop the

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,010
game so get tree and I get a call quit there's a couple of more things that do need to do first I look

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,800
put suspicion meter on a group let's go over to Node 2 groups and add it to suspicion meter I'm gonna

61
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,180
copy that into my clipboard press ad and I can now save it.

62
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:16,310
Now let's head over to characters and we have under NPC these player detection which is the base for

63
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,930
all of our amputees our camera and our guards are using power detection and this is possibly detection

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,640
specifically under if player in F Ovi and player in elo s we'll switch the torch codes are red and we're

65
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:40,510
going to get Tre dot Cole group and the string into the group is suspicion meter and the method is play

66
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,890
a scene.

67
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,750
I don't need brackets for that but I do need to double check.

68
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,050
That's what I actually called it a take look I've got it planned on school scene play on the school

69
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,660
scene.

70
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,550
Awesome.

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,750
Never say that if I've done this right.

72
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:06,870
I press play and let's see we're on 1 0 7 nines is going to 1 0 7 9 Whoops I'll try that again 1 0.

73
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,630
Come on in 1 0 7 9.

74
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,230
I nodded eat buttons okay so what I know is I can go down here and especially it goes right up.

75
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,450
I also know that there is a camera on my level that's too far in the wall.

76
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,310
This one doesn't work.

77
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,020
Can I move this one first.

78
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,140
Select it.

79
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,810
Which camera i.e. your camera going to pull you out to here.

80
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,100
So you actually work because the root of the node was inside the wall it wasn't detecting anything.

81
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,310
Okay so I know that that is far too fast.

82
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,710
What I want.

83
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,100
Let's go back to the suspicion meter and change it.

84
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,660
So what I need to do is I need to tweak my max value and my step and that isn't me my challenge for

85
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,560
you.

86
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,420
Not a particularly difficult challenge but a really important one as a game designer.

87
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,850
You want to get the feel right now you'll be changing this a lot but this is easy.

88
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,780
The changes go to the suspicion meter and alter the values.

89
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,580
So how suspicious are they.

90
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,210
I want you to tweak your step.

91
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,610
You'll multiply variable and your max value properties to make the game feel just right for you.

92
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,210
So pulls the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

93
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,780
And welcome back.

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

95
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,530
So in my case we're going so fast that I don't really have time to react so I'm gonna change my max

96
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,770
value to 200 and I'm going to change my step two point two five.

97
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,490
This is going to do two things.

98
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,870
First it can take longer to get his max value how much longer.

99
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,440
I don't know.

100
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,560
I can't do that my head but I won't say eight times longer.

101
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,720
It's not going to massively slow down the time before I'm safe.

102
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:54,780
So now in a press play and I go 7 4 8 3 7 4 8 3 I now have time to run for safety right.

103
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,170
It's dangerous.

104
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm stressing out and try to speak but it's not so dangerous that I can't do it.

105
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:08,280
So I could run through this door here and it's all very safe and then if I try and get into this office

106
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,010
up here which I believe there is a camera up there let's say I have a computer there I want to use it's

107
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,490
now a lot riskier right.

108
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,460
So I can run here run back and then try make his level my needs more cameras.

109
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,800
But we can make that rescue already.

110
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,010
This feels a lot more like a game right.

111
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:32,110
This is now a failed state and if I wait for this to drop but it drops this might be a little too safe

112
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,210
for me so I might change this to 150 but that is a really good place to end.

113
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,430
So in this video we've looked at using the texture progress notes properties as variables we don't have

114
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:50,550
to add functionality that got it already has and we've used get tree quit game to end the game.

115
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,550
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
