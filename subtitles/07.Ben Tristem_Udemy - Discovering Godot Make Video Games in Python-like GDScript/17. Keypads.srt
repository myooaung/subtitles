00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,330
Hello again you stupendous go to people in this video we're going to make keypads now the keypads are

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,890
gonna be used for locked doors we're gonna have some unlocked doors but the player can get a combination

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:20,140
from a computer for locked all got a locked or pressed and a little no pads gonna come up a keypad is

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,700
gonna come up that's what we're gonna make in order to make that easier I'm going to talk about the

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,080
awesome power of things before we get started some basic groundwork with themes things are used by any

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,440
control mode control mode is anything that does UI so it could be a button a text label and so on it's

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,350
basically a way of saying Okay whenever I say a font This is what I mean themes can be inherited by

8
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,450
children so you don't need to apply the theme to every single element in your UI apply it to the top

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,190
level and everything below will use it obviously you could have different themes and different elements

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,540
but if there's nothing else in there it will use as parents thing.

11
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,680
Which brings us to the third point themes can be overwritten if I tell you that the button has to look

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,610
like this but this specific button has its own settings then you use those specific settings for that

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,620
button because there's nothing overriding the thing.

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,190
Okay so let's take a look at how that works when you get into got it and I'm gonna make a brand new

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,100
song.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,550
Now we could call this a user interface node and have it as a child but I only use custom node and use

17
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:31,930
it pop up now pop ups are specific type of UI a little window that will suddenly appear.

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,220
What's interesting about them is when they first arrive they hidden.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,240
So you can't see them by default.

20
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,910
That's what this warning is.

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,550
We can show it but when it arrives in game it will be hidden.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,130
Let's call this number pad or number that number has a good name.

23
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,630
And we need to add some stuff.

24
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,430
First we want to add is a background.

25
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:59,320
Now we have various different ways you can use here but I'm going to use a 9 patch rect and 9 patch

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,830
rectangle is a way of splitting up a single texture into little quadrants and then stretching most of

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,640
them but not the corners.

28
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,070
Let me show you one way to do that.

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,340
I've got my 9 patch rectangle but texture in here.

30
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,010
So let's go to graphics and interface and into PSG and here we've got a whole bunch of different ones.

31
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm going to pick one of these and say I'm a pick metal panel PMG that put metal panel PSG in here and

32
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,180
let's give you a minimum size.

33
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:35,230
So under rectangle what's a good room size I say 300 pixels wide by 400 high zoom in can see it's stretching

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,770
right this pixels Asian the corners quite ugly.

35
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,420
But if I go to patch margin which is part of the nine patch rectangle and give us a setting of let's

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:50,090
say five pixels on the left it's now not stretching the first five pixels.

37
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:57,210
So I can unify fix on the top and it's looking a lot cleaner now this little Was that a bolt screwed

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,300
as little circle here isn't quite there so let's make the margin a little wider.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,200
Ten by ten should be right.

40
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,000
And I can do that on the right and at the bottom.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,440
And now this will look clean no matter what size because the first 10 pixels from the top left right

42
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:21,700
and bottom are not being stretched and everything else is this is a really nice way of scaling PND without

43
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,430
it being obvious that that's what you're doing.

44
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,890
We're not getting that weird distortion.

45
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,240
Now with that done and we could really just close users will close the text region with that done what

46
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,990
we need to do we need to decide what it's going to look like.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm sure a sketch very quickly on here using the Windows sketching things.

48
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,500
What's it called is a snip and sketch.

49
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:39,930
Go.

50
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:48,190
We're gonna put some gloss here that's going to have what color you black text or numbers whatever it's

51
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,980
going to be.

52
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,260
And underneath we'll have a bunch of buttons which for numbers and drawn red.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,970
One two three four five six seven eight nine zero and.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,890
Okay.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,260
And to make this a little simpler I'm going to put a little light in the corner here that will change

56
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,660
color if you get the code right.

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:17,780
So let's just see what that looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.

58
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,180
OK so that's your standard configuration for a phone or most number parts right.

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,330
Security things.

60
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,050
Now why am I sketching out like this.

61
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,010
I'm doing this.

62
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,950
I could see on my use.

63
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,710
You guys can look like basically I've got two different areas.

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,870
I've got the display at the top and the input at the bottom.

65
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,820
And that tells me I'm going to need a v box container a virtual box container.

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,890
In other words I'm going to have little subdivisions that can be automatically sorted vertically and

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,140
if I put something in there it'll just resize it and reorder it depending on the order it is in the

68
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,570
century.

69
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,230
This here looks like a grid container to me.

70
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,930
We'll look at those in Italy later.

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,740
So we'll start with a V box container and then if all the church the all the child elements shop there.

72
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,280
So let's get out of snip and sketch which is a terrible thing.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,970
Although in fairness I think because I find it hard to say and let's start without the box container.

74
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,740
So be a child of no part.

75
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,600
This is a background not investment.

76
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,070
And V box container.

77
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,560
Now there is also the split container.

78
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,170
I'm sure that one real quick the split container which looks the same but what it is actually gonna

79
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,670
do is put a little line here between elements that we can drag in this case I don't want that.

80
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:38,090
So let's get rid of the V split container and put a v box container add which is control a v box container.

81
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,750
There it is.

82
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,020
This really won't be the same size as the nine patch doesn't it.

83
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,670
Let's get a rectangle and give you a minimum size would be say 300 by 400.

84
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,670
And that's your size now.

85
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,500
OK.

86
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,160
So now there's nine patch rectangle can now have stretch.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,980
So let's say a full rectangle anchors full rectangle.

88
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,820
There we go.

89
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,830
And now there's the box container can have the same thing.

90
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,860
So let's give you the anchors.

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,390
No for directions and a full rectangle that's looking much better.

92
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:04,580
OK.

93
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,050
So everything underneath the box container is going to be split vertically and we can change things

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,310
by having things like a separation between them.

95
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,450
Now first thing we want is the display and I want it sent up here.

96
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,300
I want it centered in this area.

97
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:25,480
So the child I want to use is a center container and I'm going to rename this display container in case

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,890
I'm going a little bit fast which I realize I might be all I'm doing to add things pressing here.

99
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,460
Control and typing in the first few letters.

100
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,740
So Santa's containers are a type of control a type of container and it does exactly what you might think.

101
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,280
It takes whatever you put underneath it and centers it in the window it has.

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,540
Now you notice here that this layer button is is great out.

103
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,180
That's because it's taking its information from up high which is what we want.

104
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,710
And as a child with a box container I'm going to put another nine patch rectangle so let's pick nine

105
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,390
patch rectangle there it is nine patch rect and the I will use this glass panel right here.

106
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,990
So let's bring in glass panel I'm sure.

107
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,400
Drag it in.

108
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:04,800
All right.

109
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,410
You'll notice glass panel is not showing because it's tiny.

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,360
So we need to give them a minimum size.

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,300
So back to rect minimum size I'm going to say 250 by 100.

112
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,120
There we go.

113
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Now it's right up the top is not what I want.

114
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,260
I want a little bit of a margin here where you put the margin.

115
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,090
How about probably in the display container.

116
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:32,310
So let's go here and get a margin and I think 10 pixels on the top looking pretty good.

117
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,170
We got a little bit low in that about 15 OK.

118
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,610
So that is going to be where that glass panel is.

119
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,640
Now that glass panel is going to need some patch margins what looks good about four pixels not 41 full

120
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,270
pixels in all directions looks pretty cleans.

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,760
And we zoom out it's looking pretty good now with in that we're going to have a label.

122
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,260
So let's add the label as a child of display container control eight type and label.

123
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,750
That's my label.

124
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,920
Now you'll notice white or light blue.

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Bit of a pain is what I should do.

126
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,030
Go down to the fonts here and start chasing the custom colors right.

127
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,070
However I'm not going to do that here.

128
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,350
I'm going to do that in the theme.

129
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,190
That's the whole point.

130
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,100
So let's go back up to the parent and on the theme.

131
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,160
I'm going to create a new theme enough I click on theme you'll get this little theme Ed. And we can

132
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,290
scale this up if we want but you'll notice this is the default gotta look first it will do is make it

133
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,370
a default font so it's got to font and want a new dynamic font click on it and we have all this stuff

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:42,150
so press the font itself and we can loads of font data if we go to load we're going to graphics go to

135
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:48,210
interface and go into fonts you'll see two fonts I think a default one is going to be this can vex a

136
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:54,870
future so there it is and are settings that say a default size of twenty four and it's going to want

137
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,460
the default color to be white.

138
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,670
They can just about see it that's not very useful I could give it an outline in black if I wanted to

139
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,860
but I don't think that looks great if you want to go for it I don't but that's gonna be our default

140
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,230
font.

141
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,370
I've also noticed that the margin has reset itself which is not I want you know the V box container

142
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,860
is what should have the margins so let's give that the margin of ten from the top and if you properly

143
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,030
have a margin of 10 from the bottom which I think B minus 10.

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,660
Yes.

145
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,210
OK.

146
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,730
So that's looking a lot better.

147
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,810
However this font right here in these you place all we do is going to custom colors and change the font

148
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,580
default colors to black.

149
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,540
So it's inheriting everything from the theme except for that one thing I have now updated which is going

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,510
to be really useful as things go on specifically with the buttons.

151
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:45,790
All right.

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,970
So that's a good solid start before I go any further let's say Fisk's I just realized I haven't saved

153
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,150
it.

154
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,410
So save on the interface element call this number.

155
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,110
Dot TSM done and you know what.

156
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,590
I feel like we're ready to start adding some buttons so I'm gonna add another center container.

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,500
Give me a child of the box container and call it center container and there it is.

158
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,350
And you know what this can be.

159
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,570
Let's record this as quick as Button container.

160
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,900
And I feel like that should have the same margins on the left and right.

161
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,260
I'm just getting it into the V box containers a 10 on the left minus 10 from the right.

162
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,640
Just I can see what's happening.

163
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,880
You'll notice a puff on the fact that I've put a lower case b which I shouldn't have done.

164
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,420
Now we got naming convention matters.

165
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,010
You'll notice that it's automatically changed the layout.

166
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,020
And if I drag the button container to be above display container it'll reorder it that way.

167
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,520
Right.

168
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,630
So whatever order things are in in the same tree is how the containers are going to organize things

169
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,580
that can come in really hand if you're doing something like split screen for example you have an H box

170
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,650
container and then player one will be on the left and if you add a new player it'll just scooch things

171
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:54,950
over.

172
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,380
So pretty great way of doing that but that's a little about what we're doing so let's add in a button.

173
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:05,150
So as a child of button container I'm going to add in a simple button not only a text button just a

174
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,060
simple button that is not high spec container.

175
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,580
Come on Yan container.

176
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,570
There we go.

177
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,730
Simple button and add in the text.

178
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
So on the button now the text 1.

179
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,790
OK that button isn't what I want.

180
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,250
So under my theme which is back in the top here I'm going to add something to the theme.

181
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,850
So here's what the button looks like.

182
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,930
Normally let's go to edit thing and add a class item.

183
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,400
Now to press these dots here I've got all the different classes.

184
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:42,410
Oh press button and when I add it you'll notice in the theme button just turned up so I can now press

185
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:42,940
on button.

186
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,460
And here are the default settings for buttons specifically if I go to styles you'll notice here we've

187
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,600
got buttons for pressed normal hover focus and disabled.

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,340
I specifically care about normal which is what the button looks like when nothing's touching it hover

189
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,770
and pressed.

190
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,930
And you'll also notice we have all of these little metal panels.

191
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:15,140
I'm going to pick for example metal red as normal metal blue as hover metal Green is pressed.

192
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,510
I don't normally like using red and blue together so maybe I'll do yellow instead of green.

193
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,160
We'll see now.

194
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,430
I can't just drag in a texture because this is not looking for texture.

195
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,510
This is looking for style box of some kind.

196
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,870
Normal and I want to add a new style box texture right.

197
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,860
I know what a flat color.

198
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,040
I don't want to be empty.

199
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,120
It's not a line little protection.

200
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,000
And that's an annoying bug in this version.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,320
Got it.

202
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,240
If I go to back to the theme and go back to my style box if I try and press this it will go back and

203
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,230
close the theme down.

204
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,730
So how do I fix that or what am I doing to save this.

205
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,680
So I'm going to click on a little arrow next Starbucks texture and go save and under interface I'm going

206
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,000
to call this button normal style dot here.

207
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,510
Yes.

208
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,780
Just don't know what it is.

209
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,830
Now I can open that in the file tree.

210
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,470
So let's go to the file system rather let's go to interface double click on it.

211
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,080
And here it is.

212
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,120
So little irritating but I can do it that way.

213
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,800
So let's here's my texture.

214
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,460
And what do we say.

215
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,640
Not being touched is red.

216
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,780
As you know blue is blue I like that.

217
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,310
So there's my blue look.

218
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,520
There it is.

219
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:32,860
So now I can go back here and the Starbucks you can get the color the font isn't good so let's overwrite

220
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,440
that font color is black and I might need to hide that and bring it back for to show.

221
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,260
That's looking pretty solid.

222
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,890
I'm going to rename this to button one

223
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,140
button 1.

224
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,600
There we go.

225
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Not Tony button one.

226
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,150
Awesome.

227
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,020
I also want to give this a minimum size.

228
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,750
I think 40 by 40 should be good.

229
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,990
Pretty solid.

230
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,500
It's not in the right place because currently it's centered but we will fix fix that in a little while.

231
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,230
A couple of things I will change from here.

232
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,280
If I go back to my style sheet the button looks like that when we hover or press it it goes back to

233
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,250
the default so we need to add some more.

234
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,220
Same exact thing.

235
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,930
So let's say on hover I need to add a new Starbucks texture sheet.

236
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,330
If I try and click on it it will do the same.

237
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,540
Bugs to open it and save.

238
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:31,940
That's as save as is this this is hover so button hover

239
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,120
style dotted areas and do the same thing with press.

240
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,620
So new style chic new style box texture save.

241
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:50,350
And I'm going to call this just click here pressed great.

242
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,840
So now I can go down to my file systems and just do all three of his hover and that's going to have

243
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,910
a texture of my hover color so blue is normal.

244
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,430
Let's say red is hover like that.

245
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,230
See what that looks like.

246
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,530
And we need to change the color for that.

247
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,530
So the color of horribly black the color on be pressed to be black.

248
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,090
There we go.

249
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,090
That's looking better but press still doesn't work.

250
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,990
We don't want that little flicker effect.

251
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,650
So let's go back down and depressed.

252
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,950
We do the same exact thing with a different color yellow maybe or green.

253
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,400
I'm feeling yellow right now.

254
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,880
I don't know why.

255
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,750
Just great.

256
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:39,130
So now you should have a minimum size not a size a 40 by 40 and the alignment should be in the center

257
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,080
and that's looking pretty solid.

258
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,140
So let's take a look at the texture and that's what our Button's going to look like.

259
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,840
Now clearly we can't press on it until we get in game and we haven't why this ends so even if we bring

260
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,010
this into our scene that's was going to look like when I'm able to press anything.

261
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,970
So instead what I'd like to do is get you guys to add the buttons.

262
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:06,050
So before we do that I'm going to add in a new node called a grid container and I'd like you to explore

263
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,760
a little bit and see how it feels to do this next part the challenge.

264
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:17,240
I would like you to add the buttons to through zero and okay to your number pad using the grid container

265
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,130
to make this a little easier.

266
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,480
Now we haven't talked about it so don't worry if it's a little bit outside your comfort zone.

267
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,550
Give it a shot.

268
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:32,830
And when you're ready come back and I'll show you my solution.

269
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,570
And welcome back.

270
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,360
So first thing we do is I'm gonna make button 1 a child of grid container.

271
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,410
Now we could just duplicate button one.

272
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,590
But look it's gone underneath what we need to do is here on the columns.

273
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Let's set this of three columns.

274
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,150
So now we add Button 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0.

275
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,300
OK.

276
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,540
Clearly I need to actually change the tax on each of those which won't take long.

277
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:17,360
So there's two there's three four five six 7 8 9 0 and.

278
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,220
Okay.

279
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,840
I'm actually going to add another thing in a moment.

280
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,290
I just split this up a bit more so let's say a button container.

281
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,220
You need a module from that from the next one here.

282
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,670
So how can we do that we're going to v box container go to custom constant constants not constants and

283
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,780
let's say you need a 16 pixel gap more than that.

284
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:46,000
How about a 40 pixel gap maybe even a 60 pixel gap note too much like crazy.

285
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,300
50 looks good.

286
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm going to add in this dot read this will be my little light is gonna change color and I'm gonna add

287
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,940
it as a texture and so texture rect and that's just a control element that's a texture I don't want

288
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,920
to be a sprite sprites can move around.

289
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,900
It needs to have its element here.

290
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:14,410
Let's rename you to status light to get name calling and let's give you a texture.

291
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,030
It's in the wrong place.

292
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,200
How do I change the place.

293
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,570
Put it in the right area the scenery.

294
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,370
You'll also notice that's not looking good.

295
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,950
Let's expand.

296
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,270
So that he's looking pretty solid now.

297
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,470
One thing I have noticed is that this font is a little bit big for the buttons.

298
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:37,930
So I'm going to go back to my theme and under my buttons I'm going to give them a different font so

299
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,620
let's go to New dynamic font click on it.

300
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,980
And the moment I change the font here all this information will change to do that.

301
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:53,850
I'm going to click on font data and load in on the graphics and interface and the fonts.

302
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:05,050
This thin one that's much smaller the settings 16 looks good had a 24 bit big 18 20 find a font size

303
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,450
you like.

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,180
I want them in black but that's not reset here.

305
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,100
I don't want to give an outline that is looking pretty good I quite like that.

306
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,870
Let's also make sure that the font color is in the buttons font color is in the style for the buttons.

307
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,680
So every button that we create that has the style will now look like this.

308
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,540
However I don't really want the okay button to look like that I'm going to overwrite it.

309
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm going to rename button eleven to button.

310
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,990
Okay now you'll notice we've also got these nice corner ones.

311
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,910
I'm going to use those for the okay button just rounded out make it look a little bit more designed.

312
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,970
Don't need to but I quite like the change so on the button.

313
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,440
Okay.

314
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,580
Which was button 11 but I've renamed it.

315
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to put in these and to do that to override the style I need to override hover pressed and

316
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,650
normals should put new Starbucks texture in each and the bug won't show here.

317
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,300
It only shows when we're making a thing.

318
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm not making a theme overwriting.

319
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,830
This will work fine.

320
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,660
So hover is what color is that let's take a look.

321
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,410
Hover is red pressed his yellow.

322
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,810
Okay so hover is going to be the right corner.

323
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,000
And I can pass that again pressed is going to be the yellow corner

324
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,040
that lives here.

325
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,390
Yep there it is.

326
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,110
And normal is going to be the blue corner.

327
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,850
OK.

328
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
So there we have a lovely little novel pad.

329
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,600
It's not wide enough.

330
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,410
It doesn't work yet.

331
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,120
But we've used themes to make this look pretty awesome.

332
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:47,180
And the great thing about using themes is once the thing is set up every time I'm making any control

333
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,660
element that's going to use that theme.

334
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,440
It'll just build upon the elements we have.

335
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,390
So just built from the default phone and onwards and already we've got this lovely looking number pad

336
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,830
and I'm quite happy with that.

337
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,300
Well I think I might do in a good container is just spread the buttons out a bit more let's give them

338
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,350
a two pixel separation in all directions note that's nowhere near big enough.

339
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,620
How about an eight pixel separation all directions so good maybe even a little bigger.

340
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,630
Lewis go crazy with twelve.

341
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,600
How do we feel.

342
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,460
Feels good.

343
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,180
I quite like it.

344
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,930
OK.

345
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,400
That is our number pad.

346
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,610
I'm saving it and I'm pretty happy with it.

347
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,810
So in this video we've looked at how to create a pop up note how to create a thing and how to overwrite

348
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,760
things in specific notes.

349
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,270
That's got me so that is really useful in future games.

350
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,660
So excellent work.

351
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,880
And we'll see you in the next video.
