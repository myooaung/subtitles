00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.240
Hello again you splendid go to people let's finish play detection let's add line of sight into our game

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.880
and by that I'm also including by that I'm also including with that I'm also including the concept of

3
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.580
a maximum view distance.

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.600
Okay so just to clarify what we mean.

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.080
We talked about field of view right.

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.370
This is the field of view is the angle that you can see the line of sight is this dotted line here right

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.210
at the moment.

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.210
There is nothing between the Guard and the player.

9
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.430
However if you put something there the line of sight is blocked all the guard can see this wall here.

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.510
So that's what we're talking about.

11
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.450
So if that's the case then here's what we need for player detection.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.860
We're gonna set up the concept of a line of sight right.

13
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.060
We somehow need to reach inside gotto and say draw a line from here to here and check its unbroken.

14
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.260
If something is in the way I can't see you return False if you're too far away.

15
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.720
I can't see you return false then we're gonna check if a player is in line of sight just like we did

16
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.520
with check if it's in the field of view and we're gonna return true or false on the entire thing.

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.930
So every frame we're going gonna check is the player and field of view and line of sight.

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.640
Okay so let's get into it.

19
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.180
First thing I do is wonder why we've still got this Templar character.

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.920
Let's get rid of template character template character doesn't need to be there.

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.530
And while we're at it I don't think I want to play it have a torch I'm gonna remove the torch in the

22
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.120
player into the blessing.

23
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.260
Delete the torch.

24
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.460
Boone save that.

25
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.640
Back into the template level no torch.

26
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.270
Great okay.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.370
Now I need to open a camera script over the camera scene and into camera body and the play The the script.

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.280
Okay.

29
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.240
So the beginning of this is pretty simple right.

30
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.900
We're going to have to add this concept of in line of sight so every frame we're gonna process if the

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.990
player is in the field of view and player in L.A. s and that's a function of it if the brackets.

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.820
And is gonna give me an error there's no such thing called let's make one copy this control an end to

33
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:15.090
get the bottom my script make some lines he gets on doing and put it right here but pass for the moment.

34
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.180
Now there are a couple of ways we could do this.

35
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.600
Do you remember when we made the cloud that spawned lightning in Happy Days and we used a ray cost 2d

36
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.160
to see for something underneath.

37
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.150
In theory we could do that but we couldn't do that with one Ray cost.

38
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.290
We're going to need a whole bunch and that's gonna start slowing the game down.

39
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.740
Right.

40
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.680
If any of them are hitting the player Check every frame.

41
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.060
How many cameras do we have.

42
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.580
Even if we assume we do one per degree that's 40 different rays that feels like a really great way of

43
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.050
slowing our game down.

44
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.420
Instead we need to get into gotto and say okay.

45
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380
Just draw a line from here to here.

46
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.070
Don't draw on the screen just draw it in the physics engine.

47
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.800
Okay let's do something sneaky.

48
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.030
I want Gordo to think about the entire environment around the entire world.

49
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.860
I gonna call this a variable called space.

50
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.620
And in that I'm going to get world 2D get well 2D is a specific function that just says Okay find world

51
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.330
2D what's well 2D.

52
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.910
Let's click on that.

53
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.090
The class that has everything pertaining to two dimensional world.

54
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.320
Right.

55
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.230
So the two dimensional part of the engine everything that is in 2D.

56
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.830
So get to that part.

57
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:33.300
And now I need to go direct space state direct space they takes a little while to get used to what this

58
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.330
is doing is getting the worlds physics space which allows us to do arbitrary queries for collision.

59
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.080
Let me put on a slide.

60
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.330
The world 2D is everything that is a 2D environment the 2D rendering part of the engine.

61
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.240
The direct space state is the physics of that right.

62
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.940
The 2D physics engine which allows us to do things like check that there is a line from here to here

63
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.350
which is exactly what we need.

64
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.940
OK so we have a concept called space.

65
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.980
Now I need a concept called l OS obstacle the line of sight obstacle and what less house.

66
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.990
That's a spell of so what I need to do is get space and draw a line.

67
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.870
OK so I'm going to use space.

68
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.950
Let's put that properly not intersect Ray right.

69
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.770
So literally draw a ray from one point to another and it's saying where are we going from.

70
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.130
While we're going from my global position right.

71
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.460
I am an NPC I am looking directly at the player.

72
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.810
So look from here to the player where are we going to the player.

73
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:50.660
Player dot global on the school position great an array of things to exclude.

74
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.390
So make an array and inside one right self.

75
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.830
Don't look at me.

76
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.310
And finally we're gonna put you can't really see it here can you.

77
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.670
Let's put this on the next line.

78
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.370
There we go.

79
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.040
Finally we need to put the collision layer.

80
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.770
Now I could write the integer for the collision layer as a bit mask but instead I'm just going to write

81
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.650
collision mask and this means that we're going to have to now go into the collision layers and make

82
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.720
sure the player's grid maps and ed pieces are on the right collision.

83
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.890
So let's do that

84
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.670
I'm going to look at my placing video into the scene to make sure that all instances of player like

85
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.710
this and we haven't set up any of these layers.

86
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.370
OK so project settings scroll down to physics to the right physics to the render to the physics.

87
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.740
There we go.

88
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:52.680
OK layer 1 is going to be player layer 2 is going to be tile map length Layer 3 is going to be NPC cool.

89
00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:02.120
So with that done let's put the player on the player map the mask player can hit themselves they can

90
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.840
hit the time up they can hit the NPC.

91
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.100
Now let's go back to the main scene and set the collision masks for the tarmac.

92
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.970
So a collision.

93
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:12.660
Here we go.

94
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.920
You are not a player you are a tile map and you can interact with the players and the NPC is the NPC

95
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.470
can bump into things right.

96
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.340
Finally for the camera body because that's the cinematic body that set you to be an NPC and you can

97
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.600
interact with the player and you can interact with the tile map.

98
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.370
We could also have them bumping into each other.

99
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.340
That's a thing we could do for now.

100
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.970
I'm not gonna do that.

101
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.190
But if you want guards to be able to bump into each other just click here.

102
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:52.400
OK so emphases on the MVC layer and they can interact with either players or tile map awesome save that.

103
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.700
And now let's get back to a script and take a look what this means.

104
00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.300
The concept of the line of sight obstacle is a ray from my position to the Player Position ignoring

105
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.830
myself using my collision mask.

106
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:05.480
OK.

107
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.320
So now we have a couple of things first let's put an error check in if there is no collision was for

108
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.210
some reason.

109
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.890
So if not Ello s obstacle.

110
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.080
Return false.

111
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.490
If for some reason things haven't loaded incorrectly or something slowed down let's put a little bit

112
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.360
of error checking.

113
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.640
So if he can't find a line from here to the player.

114
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.710
Don't even worry about it just return false it'll fix itself.

115
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:40.280
Otherwise we need a couple more points we need to figure out the distance to the player and there's

116
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.920
all kinds of fun that we can do with that but I'm not gonna bother with that.

117
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:52.940
I'm going to use a distance to function so let's get to player dot global position dot distance too.

118
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.660
And while it's the distance to meet

119
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.800
and now we need to do is check what's the thing you're looking at.

120
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:11.850
So if Ello s obstacle and I need the collider not the node the actual collider.

121
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.270
Right so collider

122
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.600
is the player

123
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.660
return True else return.

124
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.500
That's a weird word.

125
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.640
Return false.

126
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.370
OK.

127
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:36.980
So if the collider the collision layer of this obstacle is the play.

128
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.340
If you are colliding with the player then that's true.

129
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.410
Okay so let's double check that we have everything we need.

130
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.660
If you're in the field of view and you're in line of sight return true.

131
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.670
Let's see if that works.

132
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.290
OK.

133
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.800
That I can now hide behind objects right.

134
00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:01.250
And if I get into the line of sight the camera can see me.

135
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:08.150
Now you'll notice it's a little bit off and that's because it's finding the player from the center of

136
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.980
the player right at the edge of the player won't count.

137
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.610
No I mean we could probably find a fix with that but I'm not too worried about that but this is awesome.

138
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.920
One thing we haven't done low is put it's got the concept of a max distance.

139
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:30.200
Now currently there's light beam is 320 pixels long then a white took me so long to find that word is

140
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.570
320 pixels lol.

141
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.610
So what we need is the concept of a maximum distance.

142
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:43.720
So my challenge for you is to add a constant called Max detection range with a value of 320 that's 320

143
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:49.350
pixels and then use it to limit the NPC is a line of sight by distance.

144
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.850
So little bit challenging for some people very easy for others it doesn't matter.

145
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.390
It's all about practice a pause the video give it a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution

146
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.410
and welcome back.

147
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.240
So there's a few ways we can solve this but let's start by making this constant.

148
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:17.370
So I would put it right here under F of tolerance Max detection range equals 320 pixels much separate

149
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.680
these obviously these are color constants and these are visible things.

150
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.160
Wow.

151
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.670
Really bad speaking.

152
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.880
I'm a professional teacher.

153
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.240
Okay let's make a new variable here.

154
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.490
Court play out in range.

155
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.490
Why am I doing it this way.

156
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:39.100
It's going to be a lot more readable because here what I need is distance to play a

157
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.430
is less than Max detection range.

158
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.990
Okay now this is a true false statement either.

159
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.270
The distance to play it is less than the max detection range or it isn't.

160
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.840
So now ladies do is go and play out in range.

161
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.410
Okay so let's see if it's what OK.

162
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.830
So I can be saying I'm out of sight and I will walk back in and that shit.

163
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.480
Oh oh yeah.

164
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.950
OK.

165
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.370
I gave you that information that 320 is the midpoint I mean 640.

166
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.550
I will edit that in so you can see the problem.

167
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.260
But let's take a look.

168
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.210
Totally professional.

169
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:24.800
Everything's fine.

170
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.190
You can see me right to the end.

171
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.590
Can you see me past the end.

172
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.000
No.

173
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.630
If I walk in you can see me.

174
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.090
Perfect.

175
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.450
We now have the concept of a maximum distance and a line of sight and a field of view.

176
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:41.160
We have Ed pieces that can see the player sneak past here.

177
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.030
Don't mind me.

178
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.510
Ah I'm so sneaky like that.

179
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.840
We have the beginnings of a stealth game.

180
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.610
I'm really happy with that and that feels like a great place to end this video.

181
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:55.590
In this video we've had a quick introduction to the concept of world 2D and direct space state and using

182
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.030
it to check collisions and tunneling line of sight.

183
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.280
Really good work.

184
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.780
It's a little bit complicated I know.

185
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.810
So if you get confused we have questions awesome on discord ask them in the Q and A here.

186
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.680
Keep practicing.

187
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.240
Watch the video again if you need to.

188
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.660
But this is a fantastic foundation and from here on in we can start making things a little bit fancier.

189
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.510
Great work and I'll see you in the next video.
