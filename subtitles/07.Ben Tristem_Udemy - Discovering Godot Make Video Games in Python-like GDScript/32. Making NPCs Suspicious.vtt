00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.160
Hello again you delightful God.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.720
People in this video.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.390
We're going to make n.p. sees suspicious of stuff.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.220
We're going to add stealth to our stealth game.

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.420
So let's talk about how suspicion's going to work in heiss mice's.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
First thing there's something called Suspicion it's going to be a variable of some kind.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.510
Right.

8
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.910
This is going to go up every time the player is seen by any NPC.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.560
And if it reaches a certain threshold the game is over.

10
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.740
However if you can't be seen I want suspicion to drop slowly.

11
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.070
And we should have some way of easily tweaking those values.

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.280
Furthermore we need a way of making sure suspicion can never be below zero.

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.450
There's a few different ways we could approach this.

14
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.020
The first we could do what we could make a game state right here and level one and then we could link

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.970
to the go through a signal and go from there.

16
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.680
I really want to do it that way for a couple of reasons.

17
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.830
One having something called Level 1 with a script on it is going to cause us problems later.

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.740
I might want to level two three four maybe tutorial level maybe a little 53 whatever.

19
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.160
Do I really want to keep putting this script on each one.

20
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.530
I can but maybe I don't.

21
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.700
Secondly if we go to the gooey scene and we look at the texture progress everything we need is actually

22
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.400
already in this gooey element.

23
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.130
Instead of updating the gooey element from somewhere else why don't we have the gooey element be in

24
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.480
charge of the thing it's measuring.

25
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.730
Why don't we put suspicion in the suspicion meter first thing Monday by the way I want to rename texture

26
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.910
progress to suspicion.

27
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.530
Because that feels good.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.690
I also would rather use a group than a signal.

29
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.930
This feels counterintuitive.

30
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.330
Having a group of one but it means that it doesn't matter where this is or what's seen with it.

31
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.760
I don't have to reconnect every scene I just have to have it's own group so let's put suspicion meter

32
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.780
in a group.

33
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.460
Somebody clique suspicion meter node groups and add it in to suspicion meter.

34
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.310
Right exactly as I've written there because it's easier.

35
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.880
And there it is with the same capitalization now.

36
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.410
Anything that calls suspicion meter will affect this.

37
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.870
If they're in the same scene.

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.230
So far so good.

39
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.910
Next thing I do I'm going to add a brand new script I put it right on the suspicion meter itself.

40
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.970
So the actual gooey element that's measuring suspicion is the one that's actually applying it.

41
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.250
So let's add a new script and I'd put it in the strips folder.

42
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.620
And Nicole a suspicion meter.

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.500
And it's good to go.

44
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.990
So what do we need in here.

45
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.410
Well first me to do is to close a bunch of scenes we're not using.

46
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.280
There we go.

47
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.960
We did a couple of variables the first me a variable called a suspicion this I'm on a set as 0 4 now.

48
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.110
I don't need a max suspicion and I'll tell you why.

49
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.990
If we look at the Such progress we look at max value of mouse over it the description says range is

50
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.500
clamped.

51
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.070
What that means is this can never go above maximum value.

52
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.060
So we already have a max value that we cannot go above.

53
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.980
Awesome.

54
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.660
There are a couple of other things I do want though I want a variable called Suspicion step.

55
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.120
Listen to one fanelle.

56
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.670
What is this list but then the comment.

57
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:36.990
This is how much suspicion goes up every time we're seeing one another variable and I want this to be

58
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.800
suspicion to drop off.

59
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.110
I want this to be less than the suspicious steps.

60
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.640
For now I put zero point to five.

61
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.520
Feels like a nice low number and that's going to be how fast suspicion falls.

62
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.970
I can also put these export variables which might make some sense rise up of them like this so that

63
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.800
if we go back into this goofy element we can then find it shot.

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.440
We can do it this way.

65
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.710
Let's put them in there a couple of different ways we could do this.

66
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.660
We could put these up on the player for examples expert variable and then on ready we can transmit the

67
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.960
missed signals before now.

68
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.510
Let's keep this nice and simple.

69
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.810
It's just going to be in the place that is going to affect it.

70
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:29.500
Okay so let's start with what happens when the player seen a function called Player seen what happens

71
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:39.080
when a player seen then the suspicion is going to go up so plus equals by the suspicious step.

72
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.340
In other words whenever this function is called raise suspicion by this.

73
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.160
I say that's correct.

74
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.860
One more thing I need to change the display right.

75
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.670
A suspicion is not the same as value.

76
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.620
I could make it the same value but suspicion's legionaries So when the player is seen as do value which

77
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.410
is the built in value right here.

78
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.330
Value equals suspicion.

79
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.550
Let's make that work.

80
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.330
If we go to scraps we just need to find player detection.

81
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.310
All we need to do is put the connection in here.

82
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.410
Why just here.

83
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.420
Because all non player characters are either using player detection script or a script that is derived

84
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.190
from it so if we change it here they will all have access to it right here.

85
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.750
If player is an F over tolerance and player is in line of sight the Tortuga read and will do get tree

86
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:47.980
call group and will group we calling we are calling a suspicion meter and were calling a function and

87
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.660
that function is play a scene.

88
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.010
If I've done this correctly that value should now go up.

89
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:04.780
So let's go into game and walk into the nearest piece of light and the value will go up.

90
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.380
Now the value isn't dropping yet but that's okay.

91
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.460
I'm not worry about what happens if it's two fold because it can't go above the maximum value.

92
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:19.170
So now let's go back into our suspicion meter script let's put in this drop off.

93
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.930
I do this every frame so that's neat.

94
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.700
I want two lines between functions function.

95
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.360
This is going be on the process.

96
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.720
Why process and not Process Physics because we only use physics which is his process what happens every

97
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.760
frame suspicion minus equal suspicion goes down by suspicion drop off.

98
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.190
And that should work fine except what will happens.

99
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.160
A Pressplay.

100
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.360
Make a nice big screen here I am walking in the dark.

101
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.440
La la la la la.

102
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.290
Walk into the light and there's a gap.

103
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.530
It takes ages for this to go up.

104
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240
And it also doesn't seem to be dropping.

105
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.200
Why is it dropping.

106
00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.830
Two reasons.

107
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.490
One I'm not dissing the value so let's move value because of some suspicion into process Delta.

108
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.830
But what was that gap about.

109
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:18.510
Well let's print suspicion now print suspicion in processo every frame or get a new print out.

110
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.830
Let's repeat what I just said here I am walking in the dark.

111
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.890
Look at the values were already at minus 70.

112
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.050
It takes ages for it to catch up right and then it drops.

113
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.370
We need a way of making sure that suspicion can never be below zero which is much ality.

114
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.170
I would like you to stop negative suspicion there's no such thing as negative suspicion Heise mice's

115
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.870
very suspicious game.

116
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.920
Now there's a few different ways you could do this.

117
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.100
Suppose the video find the one that works for you.

118
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.170
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

119
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.240
And welcome back.

120
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.540
Couple of ways you could do this.

121
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.480
Probably more than a couple.

122
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.240
The one that comes to mind first is going to be a condition right someone some use and iffley.

123
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:14.030
So I could go if suspicion is what I mean greater than zero.

124
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.260
Then do that.

125
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.990
However I don't really want to be running a loop every frame.

126
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.170
Try to avoid what we call hot loops.

127
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.340
This won't make too much of a difference in game fact.

128
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.390
I can run this and show you it'll work just fine.

129
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.780
But if you get too many of these going slow start slamming the code down because running conditions

130
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.850
every single friend doesn't need to look it drops it drops it drops it drops it drops back into the

131
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.220
torch and it should immediately go up again so that's working great.

132
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.010
What if we don't want to use an IF condition we can use clamp.

133
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:54.470
So after suspicion equals drop off or minus equal drop off let's do suspicion equals clamp and we've

134
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.450
got to clamp for right.

135
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:59.290
This means you can never be outside of these values.

136
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.720
OK so what do we compete with clamping suspicion.

137
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.760
The minimum value is zero and the maximum is well it's whatever we've said here right.

138
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.980
So max value Max underscored value.

139
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.200
I don't need to define that as a variable because built in.

140
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.790
Come back Max value.

141
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.490
I don't need to put maximum value in a variable because it's already there.

142
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.330
Realistically I could take out suspicion and just call it value.

143
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.390
I'm leaving that in because that feels a lot more readable than value minus equal suspicion drop off

144
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.950
if someone comes into the script later they should see how this works.

145
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.900
Let's take a look.

146
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.750
And we should say exactly the same behaviour is the flip.

147
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.450
But we're not running an extra condition in there so suspicion goes up and suspicion goes down.

148
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.480
But it shouldn't go below zero and we know it doesn't go below zero because I leave it a few seconds

149
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.980
and then walk into the light and immediately goes up again.

150
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.080
All right.

151
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.170
One more thing I want to do.

152
00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.080
I'm a put in a new IF condition on placing.

153
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.360
If.

154
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.800
Suspicion is the same as max value.

155
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:14.010
Y equals equals and not greater than because Max value is clapt.

156
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.970
You cannot have suspicion higher than max value.

157
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.200
Right it's impossible.

158
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.860
So what greater than it will never happen.

159
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.420
Eagles Eagles rather than eagles.

160
00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.020
Because remember I'm checking a value.

161
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.340
Am not setting value.

162
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:32.920
So if that happens end game to make a function higgle end game.

163
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:39.190
We don't currently have an end game screen so long to do this in a really abrupt way for now and we

164
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.820
can fix it later so get tree.

165
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.810
Quit all that's going to do is just drop us out of the gate.

166
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.970
So let's press play and see how that works.

167
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.730
Walk over into the torch.

168
00:10:54.770 --> 00:11:00.530
Oh no I can be seen unlike a deer in the headlights and it's quits really abrupt.

169
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:07.040
We are going to have to fix that but for now that's basic functionality and that means we now have stealth

170
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.760
in our stealth game.

171
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.850
Which brings us to the end of the video in this video we've looked at how to use tecture progress as

172
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.720
game logic.

173
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.270
So using the googie as central game logic rather than something to plug into your game we've also added

174
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.330
stealth to a stealth game and looked at how to quit the game.

175
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.020
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
