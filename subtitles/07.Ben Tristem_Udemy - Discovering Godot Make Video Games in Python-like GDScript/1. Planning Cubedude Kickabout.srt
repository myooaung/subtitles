Hello again, you incredible got two people in this video, WRC, a brand new section, and we are about

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,430
to move from Tudi to the world of 3D because God can do both.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,410
And I quite enjoyed working in 3D.

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,230
I'm looking forward to this.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,540
And we can be making a game called Cube Dude kick about now before any further.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,280
Let me show you my prototype of Cubitt.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,930
You kicked me out some just stop here.

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,950
And this is a local to play off multiple local to play game, local multiplayer game so I can use WSI

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,260
data on this character.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,490
Cazares with this one.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,170
And it's just a very simple physics based game with some fun effects and.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,250
There we go.

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,610
Lots of fun things happening.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,140
So let's begin with designing what the game is going to be.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,350
And as always, I want to welcome the game's essential experience.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,840
Now, when I'm thinking of this game, I'm thinking the cube did kick about is a fast, fun and playful

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,560
local blame.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,190
Noko multiplayer game to play is trying compete to score the most goals.

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,130
I don't usually like reading slides out like that.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,650
But what are the key words here?

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,510
Well, fast, fun, playful local multiplayer and compete.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,360
Now one of these words isn't that useful for what?

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,820
Fun to think about fun.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,410
It is not great feedback.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,820
If I say you make your game more fun, you don't actually need to do is remove fun from the equation.

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,780
And what we're left with is will design a game that is fast, playful, local multiplayer and is a competition.

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,450
So with that done, let's get to the next video and start creating our first 3D game together.
