00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello again you lovely girl.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,590
People in this video.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,520
Let's actually fix this bug right the IS ON FLOOR Buck.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,190
You've been really patient with me.

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:18,910
So let's get it fixed to remind you what it looks like it's getting game and let's run into a spike

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,290
doesn't work sometimes works inconsistent.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,730
Why is this happening.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,980
OK.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,290
So a nice little thing you can do when you're trying to fix a bug is go through a little checklist first.

10
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,870
What is the bug and then why is the bug.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,960
So let's actually break down what the bug is.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,780
If Bonnie is on the floor spikes and jump pads don't consistently move money into the air OK.

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,350
And is on floor as an issue.

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,400
What's happening.

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,550
Why is this happening is we're forcing bunnies why motion to zero if bunnies on the ground as a little

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,630
bit theoretical that's actually look at it in code.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,720
So back in tomorrow and let's open the play a script.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,560
If we go down to where is it applying gravity here it is.

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,140
If IS ON FLOOR OR ELSE IF is on floor we can set motion not why to zero.

20
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,380
I mean if you're on the ground don't fall and don't jump set.

21
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,750
Keep that to zero.

22
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,040
We originally put this in because of gravity right.

23
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,830
We didn't want gravity to be building up.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,260
Otherwise the long we played the game the faster Bunny would fall and the worse jumping would be.

25
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,150
OK now let's look at hurt.

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,500
We're going to move up by one to not be off on the ground going away to frame and then we're going to

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,960
add negative jump speed or subtract jump speed.

28
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,150
However if we're already on the ground this is going to trigger before anything else happens.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,470
If we're falling we might be falling too fast and we're going to hit the ground before anything happens.

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,280
I would point at which point motion dot why is zero before we go anywhere.

31
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:58,060
So what we need is something on is on the floor an extra condition and another condition here.

32
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:04,150
What I want to do is say if you're on the floor and you're not trying to move up well how would I do

33
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,410
that.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:13,030
What what to do is say and motion don't y is greater than zero Y greater than because positive y is

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,710
down negative y is up.

36
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,170
Okay.

37
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,050
So if you are falling at all and you're on the ground set motion to dot y to zero.

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,570
Otherwise we're just going to skip it.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,680
However before we go any further let's go back down to hurt of this here where we put them top speed

40
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,990
and that's not actually what we mean.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,600
We don't mean negative equals jump speed we need mean equals negative jumps being set it to the jump

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,340
speed don't add the jump speed.

43
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,900
So let's try that again

44
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,730
looks good.

45
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,010
Let's make sure this is actually the works I'm back to game state.

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,990
I'm a simple Nine Lives to 30 and press play.

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,360
Now if I'm right every time I enter this spike it should work

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,720
even if I'm on the ground.

49
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,470
And it should work for all jump pads as well as going to jump ahead Boing Boing Boing

50
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,020
looking it up.

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,470
Set this fact to three and just make sure that we've got boost set to negative jump speed as opposed

52
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,380
to negative equals jump speed and that's looking good.

53
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,770
So no challenge for this one as just a simple bug fixing video.

54
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,990
But there we go now.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,510
All hazards will be working correctly as well or jump Pat.

56
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,700
So excellent work.

57
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,000
And we'll see when the next video.
