1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,490
Hello again you glorify God.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,140
People in this video really get started with actually customizing the character.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,360
What we can do is make a play a customization scene.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,480
So let's talk about player customization means and food fight.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,970
The player is going to be able to switch between two pieces which currently I haven't named male and

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,900
female.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,370
It's a little bit more binary than I'd really like but these are the assets we've got and frankly we

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,660
can make this fun.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,340
The players are also gonna be able to cycle through textures so you can be able to pick which character

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,130
you've got and what they look like.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,160
Now this is going to be more of a proof of concept where owning and change want texture but if you had

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,170
a character model with several different materials we could just expand this and have for instance something

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,920
for the skin colour something for the eyes something for the hair maybe switch the models.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,760
This will work for all of us thanks.

15
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,710
We also want something where the player can customize their character.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,970
So when the game is actually running you'll be able to go to the escape menu and hit that customize

17
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,920
character button that county does nothing and relive that scene.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,510
Speaking of scenes let's make a character customization scene so I'm gonna make a brand new scene and

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,380
see 3D.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,300
So I think spatial is a good root node and I call it.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,660
Character customization.

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,070
Okay first thing I do and I'm bringing a character I need to scale everything around them so it doesn't

23
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,310
really matter which one I pick.

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm going to go in two scenes characters.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,890
Players list you play Ethel.

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,350
They are excellent.

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,080
OK.

28
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,220
So this is just for us to work with.

29
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,560
I'm going to rename this

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,050
immature.

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,760
Now start building some scenery.

32
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,220
Create a simple note and Nicole this scenery.

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,070
Right.

34
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,470
Let's stop putting in some shapes.

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,750
So these are only measures since this is a simple mesh instance.

36
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:56,740
And I would make a poem you must make a poem that's going to be a cylinder there we're going to call

37
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,220
this podium.

38
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,740
And in this case I can just scale it because it's it doesn't have any kind of collision it's not going

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,980
to do anything that looks pretty good.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,320
And I may just drag it down a bit.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,120
There's no podium.

42
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,520
Next the spring of floor.

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,390
Another measure measurements.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,430
And it would be a plane that at least be a lot bigger than it would to move it down.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,290
But first we see this podium and let's scale this up sort of transform 10 by 10 light and that looks

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,060
pretty good.

47
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,200
Now right now I've got no materials and these things are put those in later and I'm going to rename

48
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,410
this floor.

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,460
Finally the walls.

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,430
Now I'm looking for a nice curved effect it's going to look much better with lighting and a lot more

51
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,030
dramatic.

52
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,770
So all we do is make measurements and I gonna make it a sphere and make this really big let's say 10

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,350
by 10 meter

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,120
and it's vanished.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,230
Why has it vanished.

56
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,780
It's very well it actually hasn't.

57
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,290
If we zoom out it's right there.

58
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,400
But remember the materials are being cold on the inside insights on what to do is some do is go to the

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,350
material and give it a new spatial material so new special material when you click on it.

60
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,530
And on parameters I'm going to call the front.

61
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,790
And now when we look at it we have this very dramatic looking down and that's looking much more like

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,050
it.

63
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,770
Let's call it what.

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,170
One more thing I do.

65
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,670
And we go back up to character customization and we make a note and recall this lighting.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,380
That's one of my lights because this is going to need some dramatic lighting.

67
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,810
So at this stage I think it's time to let your creativity shine.

68
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,850
Before we begin over here in the materials folder you'll find a bunch of materials that we use for all

69
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,820
kinds of things you can use any of these.

70
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,110
You don't have to.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,910
However what I'd like you to do is decorate your customization see make this look awesome using your

72
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,020
creativity.

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,640
Play with textures materials lighting to get the effect of most proud of and share that I'd love to

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,850
see what you guys have got so put it in the forum put it in a Facebook group put it in discord wherever

75
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,420
you want it.

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,710
Let's get lots of really cool cosmesis customization seems out there.

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,710
Well that's hard to say.

78
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,620
Support the media and when you come back I'll show you how I would do it.

79
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,230
And welcome back.

80
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,870
I personally do start with some customers.

81
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:19,940
Let's start with the podium and the podium is going to have a nice dark wood material.

82
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,300
I think that's going to look good a little bit dark because the lighting there fixed that in a little

83
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,240
while the floor on the other hand I think you want to give this a to.

84
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,090
I think the kavakeb material may be let's find out.

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,850
Not looking good is it.

86
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,690
How do you feel about dark metal as do that dark metal floor.

87
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,290
I might have to tweak this as the lighting comes in but that's fine.

88
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,070
And this back home I could give this red mateer I think that look really cool.

89
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,310
However then it's going to mess up the parameters and mess up the flag and I don't really want to mess

90
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,490
with that so something we're going to material have made and just change the beat and hitless.

91
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,940
Give this a nice dark red and have a look at tallack nice and I think lots of roughness and looked to

92
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,370
the roughness up to one.

93
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,750
OK right now this looks dark.

94
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,720
More than awesome So let's put some lighting.

95
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:17,100
I'm going to make a simple spotlight and one more to do here is use a little bit of the actual training.

96
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,370
I won't use the three point lighting technique frequent lighting techniques as you have lighting from

97
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,440
three directions.

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,440
So first let's move this light up to the front and side.

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,250
Wouldn't want anything directly in front.

100
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,110
We put it front and side and put the local rotation where it is nice and easy.

101
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,730
So from the sort of 45 that 30 to 45 degree angle and that's looking pretty good and its angle you didn't

102
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,060
come back and let's angry you down.

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,890
Yeah that's looking pretty good.

104
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:58,450
Okay so I'm going to call this my fill it up and let's make you slightly orange.

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,760
I only go for a sort of filmic look some of these teal orange here so nice warm orange but I'm must

106
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,560
nice and bright so head up to No.

107
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,590
3.

108
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,900
That's looking pretty good.

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,620
Alright so that is my thing like now only the key light the key light is what's going to give this scene

110
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:24,940
or the subject that really bright focus so let's give you a nice bright fill so that lights a spotlight

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,550
angle do a key light and this is going to focus right on the face.

112
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,460
And let's just move you over here ish.

113
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,790
That's good.

114
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,480
And I think it is one about eye level.

115
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:54,680
You know a little bit more in front not so much the side of us looking very nice.

116
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,000
And I keep this one open white for now.

117
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,680
Put that up too.

118
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,400
OK.

119
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,520
So we can see here.

120
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,520
I've got two very subtle differences.

121
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,640
I've got an orange and a white.

122
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,140
But what I need is one more light.

123
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,390
Right is a three point lighting system and he's a.

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,500
Phil light which is giving you the general shape the key light which is highlighted to look at and the

125
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,800
backlight in the back.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,170
It's important because that's going to give things shadow and depth.

127
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,970
So that's going to go as you might expect from the back.

128
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,330
I don't need to snap on because we can be a little bit rough and ready with this.

129
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:34,170
What I will do is go above the head a little bit but I think that's the wrong one.

130
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,020
How did you do that so many little light things to look at.

131
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,590
That again I'm going to raise that one straight up.

132
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,590
OK.

133
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:50,060
So my backlight is going to be a nice teal colour.

134
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,110
And let's give this a really strong for.

135
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,560
Now you're not going to notice it immediately but it should if we've picked it right.

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,510
Just make the edges of everything pop.

137
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,490
I might even go dark at this I might go for a deep blue as best as he'll.

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,410
She's going to add a little bit more shadow under her coat now to put some lights on the wall.

139
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:20,230
And I want to use another spot and this is going be a very small spot in theatre a very very small spot.

140
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,650
It's called a birdie.

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
Don't ask why.

142
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,840
It's a really bad golf joke.

143
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,400
Yes it's actually a golf joke.

144
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,790
So do is it that put snap on I'm going to angle this at night.

145
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,180
Whoops angle this 90 degrees straight up.

146
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,350
And let's just move that to here.

147
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,530
Grab the being that narrow the focus a bit and you know I think it should go a little bit closer so

148
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,070
let's put it right up against it.

149
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,970
And what I'm looking for as this go all the way up there we go that looks better.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,920
I'm looking for is this very cinematic kind of picking out the details of the wall.

151
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll lower this slightly.

152
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
This thing at a snap.

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,170
And on to come from almost the floor is going to look like there are little lights hidden here.

154
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,470
There are little lights hidden here but we see them and with duplicate that put snap back on.

155
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,800
Put another one right there and that I think is looking nice and dramatic.

156
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,830
We could put a couple more in if we wanted to let's put one here over here.

157
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,300
And another one.

158
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,560
Over here.

159
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,120
Is looking pretty solid.

160
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,000
Of course that's my lighting for this.

161
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,570
Okay.

162
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,130
Now let's not forget a camera put a camera in the sink

163
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,410
and that's going to live.

164
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,030
You think about here.

165
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,590
Here's that look.

166
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
So a little bit.

167
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,600
And so where are we.

168
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
That's looking pretty solid.

169
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,770
In fact it might go lower and angled up a bit so we could look up at the character.

170
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,600
Less dramatic.

171
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:07,940
Up shop they go back on my camera great and make this camera current which I forgot to do last night

172
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,180
and that is the basics crossing.

173
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,990
So first thing I need to do before I go any further is remember to save this because I haven't done

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,140
that yet so let's save this in scenes in customisation l'enclos carrot customization doctor.

175
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,400
Yes.

176
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:20,790
Yeah.

177
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:31,050
Second thing I do is a bring in the second character some an instance in play em and I want play em.

178
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,720
To be in the same position.

179
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's see if I hide play a f and preview that that's in the wrong places and it's another Braves player.

180
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,450
A little bit were cheating slightly but that's okay.

181
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,490
It's too high.

182
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,250
Camera is actually not where I want it so I lied.

183
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Let's go into global mode and he's pulled back a bit down and back.

184
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,540
And down a bit Bob.

185
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,590
You know I'm aiming too high.

186
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm trying to get this podium in here.

187
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,760
Cool.

188
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,910
Let's play a comment a preview.

189
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,620
Can I go back there.

190
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,320
Okay cool.

191
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,820
So we've got this character and this character and they are actually the same height remember.

192
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,390
I'm going to move this one over to the top.

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,940
They are actually the same height but the animations of the idle animation is different at the moment

194
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,380
then this one image.

195
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,190
And that is a pretty solid start so what we have here.

196
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,790
In fact I might even make this a little bit brighter on this one direction lighton.

197
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:58,910
So light directional white and I'm just going to make this one when I come back there you are.

198
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,740
Let me use this to wipe the floor.

199
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,580
So let's put you all to the side and put you back in local mode so you're easier to aim.

200
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,450
Yeah.

201
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:16,960
How's that.

202
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,790
Look let's find out.

203
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,740
I may have wrecked this.

204
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,310
Just look at one character at a time.

205
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,550
Now that's pretty good isn't it.

206
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,590
I like that a lot.

207
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,530
Still a little bit of orange is causing this.

208
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,290
I saw shadows we can angle these a bit differently.

209
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,570
We could put in more and more of these birdies going all the way around the wall if we wanted.

210
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,740
But I'm kind of happy with that so far.

211
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,480
And that brings us to the other video in this video we've looked at creating a customization scene with

212
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,070
exports and basic lighting techniques and we're on to a really good start.

213
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,630
Next up we're going to create a gooey so that we can actually change customization.

214
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,310
Then going to plug the whole thing together so that the customization iterates through the game and

215
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,190
then it's just polish we're almost done.

216
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,040
We're doing really great.

217
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,480
Don't forget to share your customization seen so far and excellent work and I'll see you in the next

218
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,040
video.
