00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.630
Hello again wonderful God people in this video.

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.030
We're going to put some furniture into our level and we're going to do it with a tile sheet.

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.590
So before we go any further let's talk about why we're putting furniture in.

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.340
There's a few things one the levels are kind of bare right the little bit empty.

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.590
So let's put some stuff in to draw the iron which is also going to make a level feel more believable.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.580
That's going to improve what we might call player investment or buying in.

7
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.110
Right.

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.580
They're going to feel like they're part of that world if that world feels like a real world.

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.120
But there's also a gameplay reason the players can have places to hide.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.040
That's going to massively improve tension.

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.920
If I conduct buying a plant as a guard just saunters past it doesn't seem me.

12
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.310
So that means that the furniture is going to have to block NPC line of sight.

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.200
OK.

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.150
So how do we get that started.

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.050
Well let's start a new scene as you might expect.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.970
And we need to make the route ain't no 2D.

17
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.630
Why.

18
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.700
Because we're setting up a tile set just like we have before.

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.150
And just like with other tile sets there's a few things we need to get right.

20
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.020
First off let's name it let's call this furniture.

21
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.720
And the next node down is going to have to be a sprite.

22
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.070
And if we look inside graphics tile sheets we use tile sheet complete.

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.180
If you to use the double sided the double sided the two times when the double sized one go for it.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.770
And here we have our tile.

25
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.810
Well this tiles way too big.

26
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.070
So what we have to do is we use a region of the tile.

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.070
Now we're going to do this because if God only has one of these to load in as opposed to a couple of

28
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.480
hundred for example that's going to cut down on load times and resource use.

29
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.710
And the reason is it's going to treat it as one asset.

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.950
And once I just look at this little bit of the assets and to get that little bit working within his

31
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.520
region so that's enable the region and the whole thing's vanished.

32
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.140
But if we press texta region down here this looks very much like the auto tile menu but instead of saying

33
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.670
okay your one time you're not at all.

34
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.500
All we're saying is this is the part of the texture we care about so let's practice.

35
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.370
Let's take a nice office chair.

36
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:17.720
So I'm going to put on SNAP merge Smith's nice and easy Anema set the grid to 64 by 64 because it's

37
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.080
our tile size.

38
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.100
And let's pick a nice office chair.

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.310
Which one do we want.

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.350
Say this looks like a decent officer.

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.550
Actually I use the yeah I like arms on our faces when we scroll down you'll see it's already changed.

42
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.060
So let's move that down here.

43
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.210
And we now have a split now.

44
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.950
We also want things like collision to make collision work on a tarmac.

45
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.950
Remember we have to do this in the right order the Sprite has to be the parent.

46
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
Underneath that we're going to put our body in this case it's going to be a static body Judy.

47
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.220
And underneath that we're going to put the collision shape closer shape to Dee and Michael it's shaped

48
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.260
hoodie is going to be a rectangle to skip nice and simple.

49
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:15.760
And let's use the extents to get a pretty good size that looks like that's going to be 22 by 19.

50
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.100
And it looks like it shouldn't actually be Santa doesn't.

51
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.920
So let's move that down to about here.

52
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.090
And call at 22 by 20.

53
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.880
Yeah that's pretty good.

54
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.240
Okay let's go back and see whether transformers that Transformers 0 1 point fall.

55
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.930
I'll It's a bout a peg's salaf Summary get a little bit bigger.

56
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.760
So this bit's a little fiddly.

57
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.390
But the key is that over here in the scenery we need Sprite as a parent.

58
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.860
We need static what to do is the child and colours shape 2D it's a child of that.

59
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.760
What we shouldn't do is have static body to DS the parent and Sprite as a child of that.

60
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.270
If we do that it won't convert to a timeout that has predictable results the collisions not the work

61
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.020
properly so if you're doing it and it's not colliding properly make sure you've got this kind of hierarchy.

62
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.360
Marino this office chair.

63
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:21.370
Now we could in theory just duplicate this and I'm going to make sure I move that parent and not the

64
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.120
child so let's put these snappy things on there we go.

65
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.920
And we drag of a chair over here.

66
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.410
And then we could say well let's just pick a new region so up don't use the mouse We'll zoom not scroll

67
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.190
let's say.

68
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.790
I don't know this small comfy chair.

69
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.830
OK.

70
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.220
The small comfy chair has a different colour and shape.

71
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.920
So we might be tempted just say okay well I'll just drag this.

72
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.910
But look what happens.

73
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.570
But I'll take her snap off to show what happens if I do this.

74
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.650
They're the same collision shapes and when I move it.

75
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.150
I tweak all of them.

76
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.540
So if we just duplicate each one of these We're going to get unpredictable results unless they happen

77
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.060
to share the same things.

78
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.250
So we can't just duplicate them like that.

79
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.130
So instead let's take a look and decide in advance which ones we want.

80
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.780
Well I've got a nice desk chair as well as some sort of desk.

81
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.180
I'm tempted to just pick this as a desk although if you wanted to you could do a left a centre and a

82
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.030
right and then also have this small occasional table here.

83
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:30.390
So I'm going to undo all of those changes and I'm going to do one large one one small one comfy chair

84
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.820
and a sofa thing and I might pick a plant as well.

85
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.900
So I'm going to fast forward a bit and just set those up.

86
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.160
Right.

87
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.770
So I've got myself two forms of desk and a couple of tables and you know what accounts some sofas let's

88
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.720
put a sofa in there as well.

89
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.520
I've put in a large TV aquarium.

90
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.780
I'm not going to put in the small TV because I'm going to use them as computers and I want the player

91
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.190
to know if I see that that's something I can use.

92
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.590
But it's put a so for him I can match it to theme.

93
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.880
So let's pick this nice black leather wooden one you're going to be so from.

94
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.250
And that's going to live here.

95
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.790
I've also noticed that my plant if I zoom in a bit there's a line of pixels.

96
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.480
The great a slight the office let's pick my plant and on the region I'm just going to.

97
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.970
First of all find it.

98
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.150
A disable the snap for a moment.

99
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.870
Snap mode.

100
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.070
None.

101
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.480
I'm just going to move the scale bit down there.

102
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.680
Perfect.

103
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.160
All right.

104
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.610
Let's save a scene.

105
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.880
So in scenes this could be furniture.

106
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.990
Now we need to go in and give all of these collision.

107
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.370
So take snap off for a moment on some of these is going to be easier than others.

108
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.550
Right.

109
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.050
These desks shouldn't be too difficult.

110
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.410
But we need to decide what kind of collision the plant has.

111
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.990
So let's start nice and simple.

112
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.370
It's got the office chair give its collision backs that's can be a collision.

113
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.370
To Dee.

114
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.220
And new rectangle shape.

115
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.160
And I'm just going drag the stance without grids snap on so I can get nice and centred so that one's

116
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.020
done analogy of the comfy chair.

117
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.570
So back then the static body and might add in its collision shape.

118
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.210
That is the most recent one I'm going to double click here and give it its rectangle.

119
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.250
Now this is a little fiddly and time consuming isn't it so it's a little bit of set up but again just

120
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.440
like you did with auto tiles.

121
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.100
It will be worth it.

122
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.930
So what I would do is just set up a couple more of these with you in real time so you can heal in doing

123
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.070
so.

124
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:51.150
New child node collision shipped eudi and this is not a rectangle shape and just drag the extorts.

125
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.920
And then just like before I'm going to fast forward it so that you don't have to sit here while I very

126
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.400
painstakingly move accidents.

127
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.470
Everything has a collision shape.

128
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.330
One thing I did is I made the plant have a circular tilting shape.

129
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.210
I don't care if the leaves stop the player they probably shouldn't unless they're made of metal which

130
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.110
will be a very strange plant to have an office and everything else is just a question of dragging them.

131
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.800
The right thing.

132
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.190
Now remember the reason we didn't duplicate the collision shape's is that if they are all duplicates

133
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.340
they're effectively the same collision shapes of I change one they will all change in a little while

134
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.460
we had to put occlusion on this.

135
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.640
But for now let's see what they look like in getting.

136
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.690
So save it just to be sure.

137
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.660
Go to scene.

138
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.000
Convert to.

139
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.810
Tile set and in tile sets.

140
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.290
I'm just gonna call this furniture furniture.

141
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.130
Dot t r e s.

142
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.140
No you have to put the tiara's.

143
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:59.010
So let's hide our canvas modulates of you'll be doing and I'm just gonna put some furniture so brand

144
00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.770
new note.

145
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.190
And this is going to tile map.

146
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.430
It should be quite familiar by now and which town.

147
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.140
Please let's go back up to tile sets.

148
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.780
Drag furniture into here and here are items.

149
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.970
So I'm to start making this a kind of reception area so let's have a sofa.

150
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:25.140
I don't need to snap to grid because we already have a cell size of 64 so what I need to do is place

151
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.490
things.

152
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.020
I want a sofa in here.

153
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.010
Feels pretty good doesn't it.

154
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.470
Or maybe right here are the players on removable break here with the players.

155
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.120
But look my sofa is in the wrong place.

156
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.060
I need to rotate it for that.

157
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.510
I only use these four objects so this is rotate 0 degrees 90 180 to 70.

158
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:49.140
So let's rotate it by 90 degrees and there looks pretty good and let's move the player play a stat behind

159
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.530
the sofa we can't be saying.

160
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.290
And now this pillar feels like this in the wrong place.

161
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.520
Let's move that pillar you live here.

162
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.870
I've got magic tile selected time at furniture must remember you rename that.

163
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.070
And that's going to live right by the wall so here's what that is now.

164
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:20.570
OK so let's put a small comfy sofa here and maybe up here and you can have a plant house or take the

165
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.470
plant just to make it look a bit more real a sick place and start here.

166
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.970
And now we have a place to hide.

167
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.780
So with that there I'd like you to install some furniture.

168
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.720
Pause the video make your awesome level even better.

169
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.980
Don't be afraid to tweak the level like I said if you need to.

170
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.830
It's not that you know we've made it nice and simple and if you start changing the layout of rooms.

171
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.830
Pause a video and when you do the level come back and I'll show you my layout.

172
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.090
And welcome back.

173
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.580
I've taken the liberty of putting stuff together so we've seen this bitless come out this time from

174
00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:03.700
an over here we have this nice SEO style office with a TV desk where the couple chairs are a much fancier

175
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.030
office here with nice chairs a little aquarium.

176
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:13.180
I've gone and change the size of this wall and put in a couple of desks here but some desks here and

177
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.200
haven't put chairs there.

178
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.020
In fact let's move this guard for now.

179
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.300
Guard which guarded you are this guard you start over here.

180
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.700
Let's put some chairs in this room.

181
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.750
Furniture and chairs.

182
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.000
Boop boop.

183
00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.380
Actually they don't live there do they.

184
00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.300
No no no other pictures there that you can see at a tables.

185
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.080
This is going to be a Voltaren So I'm not pulling anything there yet.

186
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.480
Maybe a security section but we've put up some stuff now.

187
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.820
We have now changed the layout of the level so the next thing is to make sure as can the guards walk

188
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.420
here.

189
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:49.410
So where do I go after my navigation point on to inside navigation to see and switch on navigation point

190
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.980
on but you'll notice we can't see it.

191
00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.380
And the reason is flaws as in the ways and its hide flaws.

192
00:11:56.570 --> 00:12:02.090
Make sure I have navigation polygon to be selected and what I need to do is make sure that the guards

193
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.400
aren't trying to get inside.

194
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.720
These little areas here so it helps.

195
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.680
So let's drag this a bit more like that.

196
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.980
And that's close stop the guards getting stuck on these bits of furniture.

197
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.270
So it's really.

198
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.060
Beautiful.

199
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.860
Excellent.

200
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.180
So when I just go through a few more times you might find yourself an area like this.

201
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.290
Now if I drag that.

202
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.660
That doesn't look good.

203
00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:38.520
What I can do is add in a new splice and to do that I will use this edit mode control and left mouse.

204
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.470
That's on Windows if you're on a different operating system it might be something else.

205
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.200
Just check the tooltip So that goes there.

206
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.800
That one lives here.

207
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.570
Great another guard won't go down that way.

208
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.610
Maybe the guard doesn't want to go down to the plants.

209
00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.790
Add a couple more and there and let's just double check in here.

210
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.640
You don't go into fair but you might go here.

211
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:09.930
And you know what.

212
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.530
You don't go by that desk.

213
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.020
So just really making sure.

214
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:23.640
That there's no easy place for the guards to get confused and stuck.

215
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.990
So soldiers do to do what you have here.

216
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.030
It's me.

217
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.110
We don't drag the whole thing like I just did.

218
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.260
No that's wrong.

219
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.530
I don't need that fact.

220
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.330
I don't need this want to go so far to remove a point I'm going to click this read.

221
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.310
I come here I just delete the point.

222
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.360
That's now an area where the guards don't care.

223
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.200
So let's tweak this a bit make a bit neater.

224
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.330
I do kind of ongoing here this summer.

225
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.170
Add a couple more points adjust.

226
00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.900
That's pretty good.

227
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.380
Don't need that point of remorselessly right.

228
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.100
That's.

229
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.790
Nice.

230
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.800
Just a quick sanity check.

231
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.430
Make sure there's no where else they could get stuck.

232
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.860
I can't go on his desk area so let's just move you.

233
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.110
In fact you know what we don't need you at all it's delete you and delete you.

234
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.520
And that's a lot cleaner.

235
00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.680
And they can't go inside these plants.

236
00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:28.400
So let's add a point here and here and just drag that over like so and appoints.

237
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.340
So on doing some hitting control to edit points and just making much nicer shapes.

238
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.040
OK.

239
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:47.210
Let's see how that feels so I'm going to re-enable canvas modulate and get into the web.

240
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.130
Disable the floors again.

241
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.000
Haven't I got a re-enable floors.

242
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.160
Otherwise I won't see any light.

243
00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.180
Let's try that again.

244
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.010
Okay.

245
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.440
We have some guards walking through.

246
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.430
No we all we haven't done is added occlusion to our furniture yet but will do that in the moment.

247
00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.850
But already look this feels like an office.

248
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.130
This guard getting stuck at the here.

249
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.770
I need to tell you this but yeah look it's just get stuck.

250
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:28.450
So let's just tidy up that navigation to do a really quick and hide my floors.

251
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:28.960
Where was it.

252
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.220
It was right here.

253
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.000
Yes of course yes.

254
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.440
OK.

255
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:38.910
Hi mcandless modulate so we needs to add a point here.

256
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.560
Drag that down and drag that down.

257
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.140
And now he won't try and cut through that chair.

258
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.420
OK.

259
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.470
Let's give that a shot.

260
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.400
But the floors and caps modulate back.

261
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.660
And it feels a lot better doesn't it.

262
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.590
Now we're going to put doors in we put a whole bunch of other clutter in.

263
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.300
But already this feels like an actual office this feels like a place.

264
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.780
It's very dark obviously and later going to give a vision most of the play is going to be to see or

265
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.670
this furniture easily.

266
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.120
But when they do that they won't see where the guns can lock.

267
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.630
But already this is looking much better now what we do need to do is add play or add light collection

268
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.800
because I want that light to be blocked so to do that we have another fiddly bit.

269
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.890
Let's take a look at our office chair and you it to hide the shape for now and under office chair going

270
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.700
to add a light occlude to deal with a new light occlusion polygon.

271
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:47.340
Just have a drawer in where I want the light to be occluded souls go like that.

272
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:57.390
Needed to be too precise right now and I'm not closing all the way unless I do close it.

273
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.500
I can go into includer and you clockwise and switch off.

274
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.420
Closed.

275
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.780
The reason I'm doing that is I want to be able to see the texture but at the same time block light.

276
00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.440
Let's make it nice and easy to see that let's do the plot.

277
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.230
We know that the plant is a good example of that.

278
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:20.880
So let's put this plot in the light occlude it truly had a new occlusion polygon and I'm going to make

279
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.740
sure I've got the right thing added.

280
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.290
Just make a nice rough circle.

281
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.590
Leave a little gap here before I close it and make it includer and I unclose it.

282
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.760
The last gap I did is the bit that it's not going to do unless you clockwise it.

283
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:46.430
OK so I'm going to save that I'm going to convert it back to its own tile that again overwrite it converted

284
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.640
it.

285
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.160
Let's go back to this level and just to make it nice and easy to see if it's working.

286
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.890
Let's put in a piece of furniture.

287
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:58.390
Put a plant right from his lap it's already blocking light so we know that's working.

288
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.290
And just as with a lot like a game.

289
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.860
Great lot more atmospheric.

290
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.160
So you remove that ply by right clicking on it and now we're back into furniture.

291
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.660
I'm going to add occlusion for each one of these.

292
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.090
I'm going to speed this up so that it doesn't look too dull.

293
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:31.160
Again at occlusions everything's a little rough and ready in places convert to tiles at the same tile

294
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.340
sat back to the level and now we should see.

295
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.080
All the furniture is going to start blocking light.

296
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.160
Now this is important because it's going to give the player the feedback they need right.

297
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.140
The game doesn't actually use the light occlusion to detect where the player is.

298
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.570
That's just feedback.

299
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:58.580
But if we don't tell the player the guy can't see you is not going to cut that they're actually hiding

300
00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.250
by the Democrats.

301
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.040
Find some more way around here.

302
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.970
Cameras down here.

303
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.950
We had a camera in there.

304
00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:07.710
Let's see.

305
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.230
Security cameras put duplicates.

306
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.870
It's really a camera in this room.

307
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:20.010
Final thing on the do is on make sure that the furniture is on the right collision masks.

308
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.570
Let's take a look here.

309
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:27.240
You are not a player you're not really Walt's you don't.

310
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.820
You do interact with a player the player will stop you.

311
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.200
I guess your walls walls really needs to be touraine doesn't it.

312
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:42.180
Ah yeah that's called Let's rename walls let's call walls to do physics.

313
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.780
You're now called touraine.

314
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.620
I could also make a phone at you one but let's not add an extra as you don't know.

315
00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.090
Let's just give the good name.

316
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.020
A quick refresher on what we need to do with putting in any kind of tile set like the furniture.

317
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.000
First we can make the scene then going to add the sprites then we will add the kill the collision and

318
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.470
occlusion to as a child of each Sprite and then we will export as a typeset.

319
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:10.850
And if we want to make a change we need to make sure that one we keep that kind of rhythm going that

320
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.700
pattern going and too.

321
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.420
We always save and re-export that tile said if we just change the seam the tile set won't change.

322
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.460
That brings us to the end of the video in this video we've looked at how to make a level more believable

323
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.730
setting up texture regions and how to rotate tiles.

324
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.050
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
