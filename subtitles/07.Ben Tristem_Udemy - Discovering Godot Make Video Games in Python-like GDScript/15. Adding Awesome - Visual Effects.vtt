00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.400
Hello again, you delightful go to people in this video, we're going to finish off the game with some

2
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.380
adding awesome.

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.740
We want visual effects.

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.280
We want some way to really get the plants a feel that best achieve something in the game.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.860
So when the when the goal is scored, which is harder to say than you might think, we want to do a

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.400
few things.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.060
First thing we do is have particles from the plants go to go nowhere 3D so we can be using mesh in our

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.600
particles.

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.360
We can have an actual 3D object as a particle.

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
I will put a spotlight on the player that scored the goal and then we'll see.

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.090
That's what light I want.

12
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.510
Dim the main lights.

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.800
Okay.

14
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.860
So three things.

15
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.120
Got it.

16
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.300
Let's get started.

17
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.810
I think I will start with the spotlight that feels like a bus stop to make a brand new spotlight.

18
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.110
Not.

19
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.560
The spotlight is very much like a directional light.

20
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.460
But the main difference is that where directional light is just say there is light come from this direction.

21
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.610
A spotlight actually cares about things like Webb, whether light source is and what the angle of the

22
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.180
beam is.

23
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.060
Neither of those is true of additional light.

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500
So let's put on a shadow here so we can see a little bit more clearly.

25
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.220
I'm actually going to hide the directional light just as Lacasse now.

26
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630
And as you can see right now, the spotlight isn't hitting anything.

27
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.300
I can extend it if that forgets the light spot.

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.610
Rather, I could change the range to 20.

29
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.860
And the angle to 20.

30
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.920
And you could just about see it make it really, really bright.

31
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.240
Make it absolutely clear what's happening.

32
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.140
I'm going to go into the camera and preview what that would look like.

33
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.440
There's a spotlight, you can see, because of an angle, isn't she reacting well to that to the world?

34
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.210
It's spreading realistically if you have them.

35
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.990
It's lighting.

36
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.300
That is absolutely what a spotlight would look like.

37
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.320
When unhide directional light right now.

38
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.010
Let's make this point directly down.

39
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.170
Some of it snap back on.

40
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.050
Let's actually select the spotlight.

41
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.470
I do this.

42
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.450
I'm going to transform it.

43
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.300
So it's rotated to face directly down as much and light on the X Adam.

44
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.020
Put this on zero Z.

45
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.580
And let's say, well, then why?

46
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.550
What does that look like?

47
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.080
Bri, preview that linoleum.

48
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.900
Let me show.

49
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.860
I've actually lost everything.

50
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.760
That's my camera.

51
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.810
There's my camera preview.

52
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.880
OK.

53
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.630
So the spotlight looking straight down.

54
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.350
Awesome.

55
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.920
OK.

56
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.710
Now this spotlight is going to be triggered on a group call.

57
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.650
Now the group call is the same for everybody.

58
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.850
When a goal is scored, a second look at what happens when I go to school.

59
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.210
Go.

60
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.580
We gonna call game play pieces and then call freeze.

61
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.660
Now, there's one more piece of information I want to put in here, which is the goal idea because we

62
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.310
need to know where we're pointing out.

63
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.230
So let's put that in goal.

64
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.430
Heidi, Net, when I call this, we might have a slight issue because the players are going to have

65
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.230
this freeze come.

66
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.720
Coming in now, because we do this as a group call.

67
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.170
It's going to drop the arrows.

68
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.570
We are technically getting ARRIS to play a script.

69
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.790
Freeze right here isn't taking arguments.

70
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.570
It should be.

71
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.010
But I'm not to worry about that right now.

72
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.550
But if you wanted to, you could go and update them so it would have the actual name of the company.

73
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.890
OK.

74
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.640
So we have the Dunwoody's coming through.

75
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.260
So now let's make it actually work.

76
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.970
So in our not directional light, in our spotlight, which I'm going to move up to be next to, are

77
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.810
actual like Southern.

78
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.310
Much easier to work with.

79
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.860
Let's put this in the group game pieces.

80
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.290
Let's just double check how that's written.

81
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.910
Game on, Scott.

82
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.960
I don't have to do that.

83
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.630
I can manage groups and just add it to that group.

84
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.090
So it goes in.

85
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.010
It's belongs to la la la la la.

86
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.240
Let's just take such a spotlight.

87
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.380
And I mostly put the directional lighting we will use in a minute.

88
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.670
So it's do directional.

89
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.390
OK.

90
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.580
So they're all considered game pieces at this point.

91
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.580
Let's now give a script to Spotlight.

92
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.270
Ha ha.

93
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.640
You have a new script and it's perfect.

94
00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.970
All right.

95
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.680
Let's start the game with the light off.

96
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.370
So in your ready function and let's just use height.

97
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.120
Much easier.

98
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.780
I could play with things like the energy, the light, the rest of it.

99
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.160
But if I hide it, it's the same thing in one line of code.

100
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.460
OK.

101
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.930
Now I need to bring in this freeze function, which will bring in the goal lighting.

102
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.350
Giladi, who has scored.

103
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.760
Right.

104
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.390
So let's take a look at that function.

105
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.600
Freeze.

106
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.800
And as they come in with a plan.

107
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.490
This is the goal.

108
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.000
The argument and I'm renaming it play out, because here that's what I'm dealing with now.

109
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.130
I need to know what the players are.

110
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.380
So let's bring it in.

111
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.150
I need a variable player, one and a variable for play to that list.

112
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.410
Right.

113
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.130
Player one of these.

114
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.240
Tweak it to make this as malleable as I can.

115
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.470
As adaptable as I can.

116
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.920
I'm not gonna go up to the parent and then find the player wanted to.

117
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.770
We might reorganize this at some point.

118
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.050
Right.

119
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.360
Instead, I want to find it my name.

120
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.290
Now, we've done it before.

121
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.840
This is going to be get tre.

122
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.340
Dot gets route.

123
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.410
So go back up to the beginning of the century.

124
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.100
And then Greece finds note and we need the name of its player.

125
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.670
One.

126
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.410
And then we do know, is it recursive?

127
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.370
Yes, it is.

128
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.300
Is it owned by this node?

129
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.120
No, it is not.

130
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.710
OK.

131
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.150
So just duplicate that.

132
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.980
Do the exact same thing with plant to.

133
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.150
Finally, I need a variable for target.

134
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.030
Now, Target is going to be looking at.

135
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.210
So to make this work, I'm going to I could use an F or a match, to be honest, that pretty similar

136
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.390
here.

137
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:52.070
I was gonna say if player is equal to one target is equal to player one dot.

138
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.020
Translation.

139
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.800
Else he targets.

140
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.810
Is equal to player to dot translation.

141
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.220
Note, I'm only doing this in the free section itself, I'm not making these play a one play at two

142
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.260
things instance variables.

143
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.390
They only need to exist at this time.

144
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.590
So that's all they using it for.

145
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.970
Finally, we need to make the spotlight point in the right direction.

146
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.840
And to do that.

147
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.210
I'm going to use look at.

148
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.350
So here is a quick challenge for you.

149
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.410
I would like you to use the look at function to aim the spotlight at the player that's just scored.

150
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.990
And remember, in 3-D, if we're using look at we have to use a second document.

151
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.070
The first log meets your target.

152
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.870
The second argument is the optimal one, which was the orientation of the of the object.

153
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.640
If we don't provide that, it won't work.

154
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.720
Suppose the video.

155
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.680
Give that a shot.

156
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.850
And then when you're ready, come back and I'll show you my solution.

157
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.170
And welcome back.

158
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.220
OK.

159
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.310
So I want to look at Target.

160
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.040
That's already a translation.

161
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.990
Now I need to provide a vector three up.

162
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:18.280
So I was going to like vector three and it's zero on the X one of the Y zero Z because remember in 3D.

163
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.640
Why is up in 2D.

164
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.870
Why is down.

165
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.950
Because of reasons.

166
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.670
OK.

167
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.440
Finally we need to switch the lights off when that thing resets.

168
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.450
Now we know that we're using a reset call.

169
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:40.300
And I know that because if I go look at the level D when the time is finished, which is here, cool

170
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.000
group game pieces which we remember of reset.

171
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.360
Great.

172
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.150
So when the reset comes in, what we need to do, we just need to hide.

173
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.730
Done.

174
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.240
We don't need to be looking at this target every frame because the objects aren't moving.

175
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.620
So that is all we need.

176
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.270
Let's just check if that spotlight works.

177
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.220
Yeah.

178
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.020
For the future here, it doesn't work for two important reasons.

179
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.190
First, I forgot to actually show the lamp.

180
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.270
So it will look in the right direction, but you will never know.

181
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.280
Secondly, in the player, I told you, you don't have to update that I was wrong.

182
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.580
So I'm going to give it the word I.D. because I'm not using it in the script.

183
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.050
We're not actually gonna use that argument.

184
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.680
But if it's not there, the play was Signoria.

185
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.870
So let's try that again.

186
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:25.230
Well, again, I tried it and then cut this part of video, but you will now see a spotlight show,

187
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.100
then vanish now.

188
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:27.690
Great.

189
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:28.770
So that done.

190
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.240
Let's now face the directional light.

191
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.050
And to do that.

192
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.150
I'm just going to go to the directional light here.

193
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.620
I'm going to add a child and that's really an animation player, animation players.

194
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.490
All right.

195
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.100
I need a brand new animation and I will call this Faid.

196
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.840
And I need to pick my key, my key is going to be the light energy.

197
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.210
So start.

198
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.740
At one point, five can be a one second animation.

199
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.200
It's going to finish at zero.

200
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.940
That's the entire animation.

201
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.100
Now I need to get a script to my directional light to actually make use of that.

202
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.120
Let's give that a script.

203
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.530
Will you be here?

204
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.420
And this is the exact same process, right?

205
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.090
So we need a function freeze and a function reset.

206
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.500
And the freeze needs to have a player.

207
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:21.460
So let's do function freeze I.D. and I just go animation player thought play fade.

208
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.550
So that will fade it out.

209
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.310
Now, what happens on the reset function?

210
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:28.930
Reset.

211
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.460
Just have an argument.

212
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.880
I need to use that light energy, right.

213
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:34.420
So I'm going to mouseover it.

214
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.230
And that's light.

215
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.010
Underscore energy.

216
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.090
That's what you're changing.

217
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.190
So light underscore energy equals one.

218
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.810
Now, that's all good.

219
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.520
As long as this is in the right place, just to make sure, let's put in a ready function.

220
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.900
Function.

221
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.170
Ready.

222
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.000
And I'm going to call the reset function.

223
00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.660
Nice and easy.

224
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.360
OK.

225
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.630
We should now have dimming lights.

226
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.210
Let's find out.

227
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.690
So here we go.

228
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.940
And dimming lights.

229
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.610
Look at that.

230
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.750
Myson dramatic, too.

231
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.090
OK, so that's all good.

232
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.060
Now, I don't.

233
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.400
It.

234
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.810
Now let's make a particle effect.

235
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.400
And to do this.

236
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:19.180
I want to get into the default places where I can play one open play template and I want to add a particle.

237
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:26.690
Now, we've played with particle's Tudi particle's 3D works in a very similar way, except we can also

238
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.470
use a mesh.

239
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.940
So let's first off position this thing directly above.

240
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:34.390
The head of the play.

241
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.100
I want little particles going out here.

242
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:41.000
And if you look at the models and we don't get the particles, we've got this lovely star.

243
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.010
Just open that up that there.

244
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.520
There's my stomach.

245
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.680
So we'll have that appear above the play.

246
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.400
And it's gonna sort of fountain outwards in a very dramatic city way.

247
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.900
So let's begin.

248
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.660
By hitting that draw passes a new.

249
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.480
And here, impulse one, I'm going to load.

250
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.220
Models.

251
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.150
Particles start Omeish.

252
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.480
OK.

253
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.780
So there is the lovely star.

254
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.540
Now let's click on that, because now I can do things like give the material.

255
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.850
Let's give the new spatial material on what you think.

256
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.330
Gold.

257
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:24.900
I think gold's recently yellowy orange color about all can give it some its palette.

258
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:26.650
We get it.

259
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.660
No roughness is OK.

260
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.680
So that's a good material.

261
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.880
Me.

262
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.570
Now let's go to actually working.

263
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.620
So it's not emitting.

264
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.900
If I switch that off, it'll just vanish.

265
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:42.580
So let's start by looking at the time, the silence.

266
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.230
This is a three second pulls on.

267
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.090
But so let's say this lost for one point five seconds or two seconds and we can sense a one shot as

268
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.330
well.

269
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.510
Now, if we make it a one shot, going to be hard to see today.

270
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.860
So for now, we leave it alone.

271
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.050
And let's get down to processed material, because this is where we designed the actual particle.

272
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.550
So let's bring you back and get new particles material.

273
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.420
And now we have some behavior.

274
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.320
Now, this is not the head we want to start.

275
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.670
So clicking on particles, we have all of these traditional options you might expect from the particle

276
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.110
system, the same we saw in particle 2D.

277
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.500
Now, first thing I want is I want these things to head upwards.

278
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.250
So let's head down to gravities here today.

279
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.340
It's Carani heading down.

280
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.200
I should move it up.

281
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.440
That's nice and easy isn't it.

282
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.270
And it even speeds up as it goes.

283
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.910
Why with there.

284
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.230
Let's look at the spread.

285
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:27.700
So that's the first thing.

286
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.350
Now would look under flags.

287
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.550
I want to rotate on the Y axis currently is going to spread of 45 degrees.

288
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.590
Let's bring it up to 180 and rotate on the wine.

289
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.550
We might not see any changes just yet, but we will see at five.

290
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.470
Got the initial velocity.

291
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.140
I want us to start nice and fast.

292
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.690
We're starting to see some differences.

293
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.970
No good play with the angular.

294
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.570
So let's say as an angular velocity, like how much it spins of 10.

295
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.980
Look at that.

296
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.050
And you think you should be a little smaller.

297
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.110
So it's got to scale.

298
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.750
And she's to scale 2.5.

299
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.480
Right.

300
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.710
I mean, that's pretty good.

301
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.450
And it's parent just what the hell?

302
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.070
Actually, move it up a little bit.

303
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:11.640
OK.

304
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.640
Now, I encourage you to play with these as much as possible, looking at documentation of the particles,

305
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.480
right, click on it and open the documentation and see where all these things can do.

306
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.920
Just a quick example.

307
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.700
Now, I don't want this emitting immediately so much, but to one shot and switch out.

308
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.880
And one more thing to do before I knew that actually do want more of these.

309
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.250
A 64.

310
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.860
Maybe that's too many when you think that to.

311
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.000
Yeah, OK.

312
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.040
And it's a one shot.

313
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.710
So switch off, emitting emit.

314
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.240
I'm going to buzz of source.

315
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.010
What's it like with 64 is a bust?

316
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.230
Not bad.

317
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:53.490
OK.

318
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.210
So I don't have it like that.

319
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.190
So here is our particle system.

320
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.270
Now let's make it work.

321
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.710
Well, the easiest thing to do is go into the script for the player and head on down to freeze.

322
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.840
So go can move equals false.

323
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.430
And we're bringing in the playwright.

324
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.320
Well, let's use that.

325
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.320
Let's say if a player.

326
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.120
Sorry, if the I.D..

327
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.510
Is equal to the player.

328
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.020
Heidi.

329
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:23.890
Then particles stopped emitting vehicles.

330
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:24.430
True.

331
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.110
Now, because this is a one shot, I don't need to switch that off.

332
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.220
Let's see how that works.

333
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:42.060
OK, so all being well, I can move this plane on the way over here and we can get E!

334
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.480
Not bad.

335
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.590
Right now there's a lot of things you can do to play with these particles.

336
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.050
We could go to the materials here to draw passes and get it.

337
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.650
We can make them transparent if we wanted.

338
00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.160
And Jason, off the value of it here.

339
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.770
But I think that's really solid.

340
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.900
And I'm showing you a quick victory lap of the game.

341
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.280
So let's have one more load in.

342
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.430
Because this is cute, dude came out.

343
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.170
I hope you enjoyed this section.

344
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.280
I really enjoyed making this game.

345
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:11.390
It's a very, very simple introduction to the kinds of things can do 3D.

346
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.380
And we've used a lot of techniques with these before.

347
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.710
Right.

348
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.540
So a lot of physics, a lot of.

349
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.600
So a lot of physics bodies with particles, huge textures.

350
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.950
