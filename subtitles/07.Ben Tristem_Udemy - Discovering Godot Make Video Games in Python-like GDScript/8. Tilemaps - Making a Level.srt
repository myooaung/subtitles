1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:06,370
Welcome back glorious God.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,280
People in this video we're going to look at Awesome ways to make a to de level.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,190
We can explore tile maps.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,700
Why would we do that.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,050
Well right now we have these platforms right I've created the manually and we put in the Sprite and

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,060
the collision polygon.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,490
And we've duplicated them.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,440
And that works fine.

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,200
A tile mat is kind of like a paint palette.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,090
We can create elements of scenery a platform whatever paint with them very quickly.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:37,450
Now it does take a little while to set up but once it's set up we can make really cool levels very quickly.

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,490
First thing to do is get reties platforms so by by platform nodes we now have a bunny floating in space

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,790
and we press play the bunny will fall.

14
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,140
By bunny.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,110
How do we set up a time map.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,960
First thing we do is create a new scene.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,560
So here I am in my branagh's scene and I'm going to create a Node 2 d as a root node I'm to call this

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,380
platform's makes sense right.

19
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,250
I misspelled platforms correctly because that would also make sense.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,430
There it is.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,900
And now only to find the zero point because I've moved it.

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,690
A why did that.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,350
Now I'm going to bring in a sprite.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,210
So let's make a sprite.

25
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,260
And what Sprite shall we bring in.

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,610
Well it's got our graphics environment and you'll see there's a bunch of platforms.

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,230
Now if you downloaded the full jumper pack from Kenny or are using a different thing you might have

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,090
a bunch more options.

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,120
But I've paired it down so we've really got large and small version of ground cake ground grass ground

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,470
sand and ground snow.

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,040
Let's start with ground cake which could put it here because you know a cake.

32
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,880
It doesn't really matter where this is positions.

33
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,650
I'm a dragon of his.

34
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,800
I can see it.

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,080
And let's switch on our grid.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,480
It's quite a small grid isn't it.

37
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,580
And you snapped on that.

38
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,280
Next thing way to do is give this Sprite a static body.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,460
Now you can create things that are static bodies with spikes as children but for time that doesn't work

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,750
great.

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,890
We need a sprite as the parent so the static body is there and within the static body end under collision.

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,940
You have a couple of options here.

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,900
You could do a collision shape and then make a rectangle.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,420
And in a lot of cases that would be fine.

45
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,230
But here it's not going to work out that well.

46
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,170
And the reason is we don't have a regular rectangle so the player is going to expect to hit the side

47
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,330
and it's either the player's going to hit right here and slide off before they hit the platform or from

48
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,330
a get smaller.

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,420
They're going to think they're gonna hit the brown thing come down.

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,190
I am going use a collision polygon So let's get rid of this.

51
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,350
Brand you can get in shape.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,450
Collision polygon.

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,950
And I will try to keep as close to this as I can when I have to tweak it in a moment.

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,420
And this is a point where the grid is not actually helping that much is it.

55
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,080
OK so let's switch the grid off.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
And there we go.

57
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,430
Get this nice and close.

58
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,760
Getting close to the platform is a really good idea and the reason for that is the more precise things

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,850
like collision are the more control the player feels like they have.

60
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,060
In other words if you think of a platform game like Super Meat Boy it was all about a high stakes collision.

61
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,220
No precision not collision getting exactly a pixel off is very challenging.

62
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,930
But the play feels like it's fair.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,230
If the platform doesn't behave in the way that we might expect players going to feel duped trapped not

64
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,280
trapped tricked probably dead.

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:56,710
Let's take a look at that and switch my grid view off so I can see it looks pretty close doesn't it.

66
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,070
This one is a bit off.

67
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,790
Nice.

68
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,540
OK I am going to make sure the whole thing selected it and I'm going to call earning this thing on and

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,510
name it.

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,780
Ground cake.

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,340
Let's duplicate that and shuffle it over here.

72
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,020
Now for this one I take the small ground cake or ground kick small.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:28,820
You call it ground cake small and you'll notice that the collision is completely wrong.

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,540
So let's fix that.

75
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,820
Get on to my collision and move some things around.

76
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,130
Now part of me kind of wants to fast forward this.

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,600
But on the other hand setting these up is something you need to do correctly.

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,130
If you don't take the time to do it you're getting it.

79
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:54,650
Had behaviour in your level so I decided in the end I'm sure show you the entire process that would

80
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,210
probably have a few too many points that way.

81
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,770
So if you go over to the edit and just mouse over it you'll see the options so I'm shooting left mouse

82
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,960
button to move points.

83
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,820
You can also split segments of your on ADD.

84
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,800
All right mouse to erase a point.

85
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,080
Sounds good that's a razor point that one would probably do only that once so you can get here and you

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,030
can go here.

87
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,250
Looks good.

88
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,150
Some strange things happening there.

89
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,640
Split that segment split that segment.

90
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,490
And let's make sure that you are actually where you need to be.

91
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,980
Okay that looks pretty good.

92
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,380
Before I go any further I want to put these on their own collision layer.

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,490
What does that mean.

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,210
Well collision layer and a collision mask is a way that we can keep track of what's interacting with

95
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,510
what.

96
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,690
It's quite possible we don't want everything to be able to collide with everything else.

97
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,140
In other words let's say we make an enemy we can write.

98
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,290
If you collide with something.

99
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:02,240
Check with that thing is and if it's the player then do a thing or we can just make it so that enemies

100
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,480
can only collide with players and that way if it collides.

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,810
It doesn't need to run the check a collision layer is what layer the object your editing exists so if

102
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,440
we're the player we exist on the player layer that's one to say the collision mask is what layers you

103
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,160
can interact with.

104
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,710
So where would we find those.

105
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:28,280
Well on any of the physics bodies on static body on kinematic body on a rigid body you'll find under

106
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,150
a physics body tuley which is their parent class collision.

107
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,660
We can set any of these as layers and masks.

108
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,470
That's kind of irritating though because we can't see what these are.

109
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,710
So let's name them.

110
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,380
Got a project settings and we scroll down to two physics let's call layer 1 we can lay them.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,890
A coal mine player and layer two is going to be touraine.

112
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,330
So I'm going to select the ground cakes static body and put it on the tray there but not the player

113
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:07,470
layer and it cannot interact with the player to do the same one with a small cake cake now.

114
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,500
So on the static body collision it's not on the player it is on the torain.

115
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,830
I'm also going to go back over here and open the player seen and make sure that the player.

116
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,930
Does not interact with itself because it makes no sense.

117
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,710
It does interact with the touraine.

118
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,390
If we if that's switched off it'll fall through the train.

119
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,140
Okay.

120
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,020
So right now we have a couple of cake based things.

121
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm going to highlight both those and duplicate them and then move the duplicate things down.

122
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,250
It doesn't really matter where let's make these ground grass.

123
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:55,250
So ground grass that this one is rename It's now the reason I did it this way round is that all of the

124
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,700
large platforms have the same collision shape and all the small ones have the same colour shapes on

125
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,190
a click here and on your Sprite.

126
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,830
I'm going to put this in.

127
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,700
If I remove those.

128
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,770
You can see what they look like.

129
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,480
And we some did get some nice pieces.

130
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,690
And just going to take all of those and duplicate them one more time.

131
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,270
You can be ground sand.

132
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,130
And I mean you get this texture.

133
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,240
It can be ground sand small.

134
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,750
Whoops.

135
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,740
Great.

136
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,910
And what do we have left.

137
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,830
This one will be snow.

138
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,330
Ground sand.

139
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,670
And ground snow.

140
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,950
Small you make sense.

141
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,760
I'll get to see what I'm doing.

142
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,100
I'm going to remove all of the polygon visibility so I'm not looking at a polygon.

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,250
Collision shapes.

144
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,890
I'm just looking at the terrain.

145
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,910
Well it's pretty good.

146
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,710
OK.

147
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,630
We have these sprites and they have collision.

148
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,380
How do we use them.

149
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,600
Well first let's save the scene.

150
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,370
We're going off to the scene folder and we're going to see this as platforms now going to generate a

151
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,290
tile map to do that we up to the scene and you press convert to tile set.

152
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,480
And I want to put this in a scene's folder and on call it platform tiles.

153
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,580
Must use an extension.

154
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,350
That's right I forgot about that.

155
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,940
We have to have manually type in dot t r e s.

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,310
So it's one of these two options here.

157
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,830
Texture resource file.

158
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,370
So platform tiles dot trv espress safe.

159
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,880
There it is.

160
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,090
So how do we actually create a time that this.

161
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,890
Well in level one that's a new node and it's going to be a tile map.

162
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,620
And the tile set we're going to use will be inseams which is not under graphics.

163
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,940
It's in the scenes.

164
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,670
Platform tiles and we'll put that in there.

165
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,070
And look all of these options are here and we care about that because I can just paint with them.

166
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,660
And I press play.

167
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,750
The collision has worked right.

168
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,210
Everything we've just done has worked perfectly.

169
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,010
Now we can tweak it a little bit so make it a bit more interesting and fun.

170
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,560
So now I can actually jump around.

171
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,660
But one thing I notice is the camera isn't following me.

172
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,840
So before we go any further let's create a new scene.

173
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:02,120
And in this scene we go make a node called camera to me and very important we have to mark this as current.

174
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,930
If it is not current it will not work.

175
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,500
It's going to be a camera that is switched off.

176
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,760
Save that camera scene inside look at one instance the scene remember this little chain icon on the

177
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,420
player so slow.

178
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,990
Play player an instance.

179
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,470
That new camera scene.

180
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,200
And we have some options.

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,220
We can change here.

182
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,110
Well we can play those a little later but for now if I press play.

183
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,060
You'll see that the camera is following running around the place a little jerky So get a camera and

184
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,480
I think we need to put smoothing on so it will smoothing.

185
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,200
A little bit better.

186
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,670
Now there are a bunch of options we can play with.

187
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,810
We'll look at those a little later.

188
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,590
We have some more elements.

189
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,260
But look we have a basic level.

190
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,020
So my challenge to you.

191
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,950
I'd like you to make a days.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,210
That way you can make it as large or small as you like but use your tile map to make an awesome level.

193
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,670
If you just wanna do one thing let's say just cake.

194
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,280
Go for it.

195
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,990
If you want to mix them up maybe it starts with ground and and it ends with cake.

196
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:04,670
Go for it.

197
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,190
Whatever you come up with why not share it with the community.

198
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,960
We'd love to see it share on our forum.

199
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,290
Share in discord Sheraton the Facebook group wherever you want to share it.

200
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,320
We'd love to take a look.

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,520
So pause the video here.

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,790
When you come back I'll show you the level under the make.

203
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,720
Okay time to make a level.

204
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,710
So I now have this tile map and if I want to erase things I can just go to where it's set and right

205
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,000
click on them so beep beep beep beep beep I'm not gonna start with Kay.

206
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,750
I feel like cake is something you want to build up to.

207
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,250
So let's start with a nice ground piece.

208
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,530
I want to give the player a couple of choices where to go.

209
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,580
Oops didn't mean to play like that.

210
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,390
Maybe a few more Ovie.

211
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,110
Oh there's another one of those pointy ones.

212
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,930
I like this big dramatic drop.

213
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,020
Let's put some small platform jumping bits here.

214
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,480
And let's see that's might actually be awesome.

215
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
Let's find out if it's awesome.

216
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,130
It's actually a little difficult for me.

217
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,350
Oh let's see.

218
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
I had to jump a little bit earlier than they thought.

219
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,670
Yeah that's working fine.

220
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,970
One thing I would like to do and I zoom the camera out so let's get to carroty hoodie and here is a

221
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,390
zoom instead of one point one.

222
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Um we do two poitou so we can zoom out now when look at it.

223
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,520
We can see a lot more of the level now.

224
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,580
This might be the wrong size.

225
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,430
Feeling going to go for one point five.

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,080
I might actually go 4.5 but I quite like to look at this.

227
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,070
Maybe one point I was right.

228
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,650
One point five.

229
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,150
Yeah.

230
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,980
I think that's the one one point five minutes.

231
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,540
One more thing I can do.

232
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,160
You'll notice that I've got all this camera they'll keep going forever instead of that I can set limits.

233
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:06,890
So up here in tiny tiny tiny numbers I can see that this is positioned 320 on X so I can set my left

234
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,660
to three to zero.

235
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,300
See how that works.

236
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,350
Now you know the camera will not go further left than that.

237
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:26,710
Right so I have a hard left let's put area we can't go any further down so I don't know we'll call that

238
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,630
me.

239
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,670
Here is good.

240
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,740
3000.

241
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,170
We have a less single level.

242
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,250
And if we drop all the way down.

243
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,200
It'll drop for a while and then stop.

244
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,120
Right.

245
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,220
And that's everything for this video.

246
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,230
So in this video you've seen how to create a tile map how these collision layers and collision masks

247
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,420
and how to set up your camera.

248
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,930
Great work and I'll see you in the next video.
