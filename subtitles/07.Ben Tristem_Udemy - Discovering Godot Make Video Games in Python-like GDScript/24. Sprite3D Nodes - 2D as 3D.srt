1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,550
Glorious God to people in this video.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,870
We're going to continue making a gooey.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,660
But this time we're getting a kind of fancy.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,520
See I want to measure how many lives or other display how many lives each robot has.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,210
And we might have a bunch of robots in the level at any given time.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,010
So I don't really want to make a gooey that shows all the different robots and all the different you

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,870
know lives they might have is going to clutter everything up.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,400
Instead let's show this in the three dimensional space in this video were going to discuss Sprite 3D

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,630
notes and look at how to make truly objects work in three dimensions.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,290
So let's get right to it.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,060
First of all to do is go into this robot snoad an open one of the robot scenes and in here are going

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,650
to make a Southern node and call it spatial.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,450
I'm not going to use node in new spatial and I'll tell you why node doesn't have positional information

15
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,520
and spatial does the robots are going to move.

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,480
And I'm going to animate some stuff later.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,340
It can get very complicated if I use spatial then the nodes within here are going to use local transforms

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,830
and it'll work just fine.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,010
OK I want to call this lives.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,340
And in here I'm going to put some Sprite 3-d Somewhere make a sprite 3D and Sprite 3-d is exactly what

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,110
it sounds like some open graphics and get one who's hearts and let's pull on snap and move it up here.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:33,240
This is a sprite drawn in the 3D world you'll see it has no depth as depth of zero but it's being rendered

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,300
as a 3D object must scale this up a bit so let's I'm going to transform and give this a size of two.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,190
All right so here we have a life.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,190
Nicole this wife and I don't want this just to vanish.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,400
I want this to animates a when the robot is hurt.

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,340
I want stuff to happen let's make this fancy and put an animation player as a child of life.

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:01,580
And in this animation player I need to put a simple animation on called lose life.

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,180
There goes.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,860
And what should we do.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,990
Well let's start by making a key frame for scale.

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,380
And I think a nice short animation half a second sounds good.

33
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,130
So like the zero point five.

34
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,090
And at the zero point five mark on a change the scale to 0 0 0 and put a key.

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,430
That's not quite enough.

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,980
I'd also like some fancy rotation so let's rotate it rotation degrees and put a key frame at 0 0 0 and

37
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,320
half a second.

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,790
I'm going to rotate on the y axis by three hundred fifty nine degrees.

39
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,190
Why not 360 degrees because 360 degrees is the same as zero which means it won't actually rotate.

40
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,960
Here's what they look like.

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,910
Cool.

42
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,900
I don't just want to have a scale of zero though.

43
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,930
I wanted to vanish at half a second.

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,220
So one more track can this add new track but then when I add a call function track and it says where

45
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,590
you want to call the function I want you to call the function on life which is the parent of this animation

46
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,130
player.

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,890
So the zero point five let's insert a key and press this green Plus an insert a key there.

48
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,070
Now I need to edit that key So that's at the key click on it and under name right.

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,380
Q free I don't need to put brackets.

50
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,570
I'm going to call the function Q free life doesn't have a script but it doesn't need one Q free is a

51
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,670
built in function.

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,260
So when this elimination is played this will happen.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:35,920
It'll run the animation and then remove life from seeing a duplicate this small animal put life.

54
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,390
Let's put it down here.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,330
That look.

56
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,560
Looks pretty good at life 3 and a put down here.

57
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,400
So lose the first life then the second life.

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,590
Then the third life.

59
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,040
With these however you want.

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,090
You dont have to have a snap I've just done this for simplicity.

61
00:03:50,220 --> 00:04:00,210
You will notice by the way that right now lives as a variable is set to 3 and I happen to have three

62
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,840
sprites.

63
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,170
Dont have a way of automating this.

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,030
I am alright with this for now.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,480
I'm okay with all characters having three lives in the.

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,320
But if you wanted to automate this you'd have to do something fancy with a script.

67
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,400
But I think it's a little beyond the scope of got of tie to this and it sets off snap sleets lives one

68
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:26,320
and three and just make up not to come back and just move them a bit more like that make more of a friendly

69
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,050
arc shape.

70
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,050
Okay so let's save that and see how it looks going.

71
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,510
I was looking pretty good.

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,870
Let's see how they make.

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,130
Awesome.

74
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,210
Now we need to make these things actually vanish right.

75
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,190
I've displayed these sprites when even to vanish.

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,240
To do that I'm going to go into the robot script which if I go to script view is right here fantastic.

77
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,440
We have updated lives and we have it in play.

78
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,900
And we have it in roebling we get to our daily lives and player.

79
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,950
And here it does this whole thing in Robot.

80
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,150
I want it to not do pass.

81
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,240
This is we're going to write the information first thing I need to do is check.

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,370
Do you have ZERO lives.

83
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,910
Why am I checking this first.

84
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,490
I'll show you.

85
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,230
It's going to character and you'll see on hurt which is this one right here.

86
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,630
Here's what can happen if you've been hurt.

87
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,920
Subtract one life.

88
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,660
Play the hurt sound effect check your lives and then update lives.

89
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,500
This is going to run.

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,720
No matter what so if you have one life left and then you lose it.

91
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,540
We're still going to run this.

92
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,920
If you get hit by two things at the same time that's going to be an issue because there isn't going

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,090
to be a life to remove from lives.

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,290
So let's check if you haven't if lives for greater than zero.

95
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,580
What are art to do.

96
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:52,780
Well what I want to do is grab the top child of lights and play the animation with an with an outfit

97
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,720
know and play the animation within it.

98
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,670
Okay so I need to grab the top shot of life grab that top child and tell it play this animation.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,430
OK.

100
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's get into that.

101
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,690
So first we create a variable and I call this life and this is going to be lives.

102
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,560
Got get child and which are many.

103
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,050
Meaning get zero.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,710
So what does zero means zero means.

105
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,900
Count the children down and we're going to count from 0 9 just like we do with a raise.

106
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,780
We almost always count from zero and programming.

107
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,390
And then what the child of that somebody get child 0.

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,290
One more time.

109
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,370
Okay.

110
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,240
Now I want to have a love life stopped play because it's going me an animation and when I'm playing

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm playing the animation loserville life.

112
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,780
OK.

113
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,320
Let's see how that works.

114
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,430
I going to this nice next you can see it versus grab some.

115
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,190
Look try not to die while doing this.

116
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,440
Grab some ammo and see if I can hit one of these robots.

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,000
Boom.

118
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,330
Do they now.

119
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,980
So back to my own game.

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,600
There it goes.

121
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,310
Awesome.

122
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,410
Now there's a pause that and show you remotes Let's see who was actually running like right now and

123
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,500
open the robot's folder open robot one.

124
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,460
How many lives do you have.

125
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah three open robot too.

126
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,670
How many lives you have.

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
You have to like it.

128
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,990
Okay so we know this is working.

129
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,350
Remote is what is actually running live right now and local is what does the scene look like when it's

130
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,980
not running.

131
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,820
So we know that this will now work.

132
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,110
OK.

133
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,390
So right now we have a victory condition which is all the robots are defeated and we have a loose condition

134
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,920
which is the play is defeated and we have screens to go to Windows.

135
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,630
Now what that means is when all the players.

136
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,280
When the player is dead we need to go one way and when the robots are all dead we to go another way.

137
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,260
But right now Di is within the character script which means I don't want to hear and want to put a different

138
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,960
dice script in each set of a dice script for the player.

139
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:12,300
And what you do is very simply get tree change scene and what scene with the change to.

140
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,170
Well let's go get it.

141
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,130
I want to go to.

142
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,550
When the player is dead we're going to the game over sing live.

143
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,570
So that's going to live right here in those quotes.

144
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,530
And I have missed the bracket.

145
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,100
That's okay.

146
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,860
But more brackets in when a player dies will go to the scene.

147
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,560
Let's just double check that I've done that right.

148
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,730
One two three lives down.

149
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,830
Awesome.

150
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,850
I demand a rematch.

151
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,060
And we're back here.

152
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,320
Great.

153
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,100
A quick note.

154
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,760
If you're running this and got a three point one you might now get an error and the error you're going

155
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,370
to get is that you're calling a function in this script that isn't in this script.

156
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,450
Got a three point o doesn't check that first got a three point one does.

157
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,450
Now this will actually run fine because the script is being inherited and we are never running character

158
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,060
on it's own.

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,520
It's always being run from another script.

160
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,620
However if you want to run this one you're probably going to do some sort of workaround.

161
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,160
In this case I would probably use character type right so I would have if character type equals character

162
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,820
type player then do this if it equals robots that do this.

163
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,200
And I would put everything on in a die function within character.

164
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,270
However I'm using God 3.0 So I'm not going to be doing that.

165
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,940
I also need to make a game stick script because now I need to keep track of how many robots we are we

166
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,270
have.

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Let's make a game six reps I'm going to go to level 1 and I actually can open the template.

168
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,320
Because all levels will have this script.

169
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,480
So let's add a script to level template and as you might imagine this will live in the script folder.

170
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,340
I want to call it game state Judy.

171
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,240
OK let's quickly function called remove Henley.

172
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,260
And for now you can put a in here and save that.

173
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,870
And just to make it really clear that all robots have a template.

174
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Court robots has got to node.

175
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,650
Let's make a note rather than call it robots and check.

176
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,990
That's what I called it level 1.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,470
I can.

178
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,690
Yes I did save that.

179
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:35,470
Now I probably should have done that first because if I now look with in this scene tree you might have

180
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:35,920
a situation.

181
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,820
We have robots and a different robots.

182
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,900
If you do that's fine.

183
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,010
Just run the game.

184
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,030
And you can look at remote and should now find that you only have one robots follow.

185
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,550
Okay so you should be good to go.

186
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,570
So this will sort itself out.

187
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,370
But if you don't want it first you might see two robot notes.

188
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,200
Don't panic.

189
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,170
It's easy to fix.

190
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,130
So now there's robots folder is always part of that script.

191
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,760
I won't make a signal

192
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,730
signal there and call this would move me.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,350
Okay now I want to connect this but I'm going to try to connect it to a specific node that's going to

194
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,730
have a different name each time so I can't use FIND name right.

195
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,970
So I said I'm gonna have to get this by locations of her look at level 1.

196
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,970
All seems have this node here which might be called level 1 level 2 office bank.

197
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,900
What Whatever going to call it right here and the robots are all going to have children of a node called

198
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,470
robots.

199
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,250
Suddenly I get a parrot get parrot.

200
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,540
It's a little messy but I'm okay with it.

201
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,620
So let's do that now in the robot script back to thing.

202
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,830
I'll make it variable called Game.

203
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,590
Let's call it game it get parents got get.

204
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,560
Parent and now I need to connect this notes to connect.

205
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,750
And I should be in the robot scene so I can actually order correct.

206
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,560
So when am I correct I'm going to connect remove anything to connect that to game States.

207
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,710
One more thing I need to tell it and it's tell it what method are you calling.

208
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,320
Well you want to call remove.

209
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,350
And it's exactly the same name just to make it nice and legible.

210
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,870
Great.

211
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,860
So that's my enemy when we are now going to call that signal.

212
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,150
When are we going to call that signal on die.

213
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,120
I need to put die in Robot remember because I've taken it out of character put it in play.

214
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,470
I don't have it here so let's put it in here.

215
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,240
Function guy I need to emit underscored signal.

216
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,550
And the signal I'm emitting is not signal.

217
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,880
That's crazy talk.

218
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,650
Remove enemy.

219
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:54,690
So I am letting the game state script know an enemy has been removed.

220
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,220
Great.

221
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,820
After I've done that I can remove myself from the game as can be.

222
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,330
Q free some weird things happening there but not much.

223
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,780
Let's push this challenge up a notch.

224
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,440
One thing I was slightly tricky in now is a few more steps in this.

225
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,940
I think you're probably up to it but don't worry if I struggle a bit.

226
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,980
Let's just get that grey matter going and see how comfortable you are.

227
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,200
I would like you to have game state Judy lo the victory scene when all the enemies are defeated and

228
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,320
some say animals not animals the robots enemies are defeated.

229
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,460
Quick tip you can use get child count to find out how many nodes are children of a node.

230
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,240
Robots pause the video give it your best shot and when you've either found a solution or you've got

231
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,180
a little frustrated.

232
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,460
Come back and I'll show you how I would solve this.

233
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,940
And welcome back.

234
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,990
I won't go into my games script and the first thing I need is a variable.

235
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,750
My variable is going to be called Enemy count.

236
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,250
Now I need to fill that value and I'm going to do this in ready.

237
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,330
Why am I doing it.

238
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,920
Ready.

239
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,790
Because every level is going to have a different amount of robots at least potentially right maybe level

240
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,200
one has two enemies making level two has four maybe level 3 has 16 while went to for 16.

241
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,020
I don't know just round numbers.

242
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:20,430
So on ready I'm going to fill enemy kotzer Enemy count equals and all I need to do is because we know

243
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,570
that this lay aren't going be the same for all levels because this is a template I just need to get

244
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,820
to the robot's node.

245
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:31,250
So let's grab that and I need to count the children to do that.

246
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,010
I'm going to get child count at all.

247
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,740
That's just going to return an integer of how many direct children the node robots has.

248
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,150
And that's precisely what I want.

249
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,900
Okay now we've received a signal.

250
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,100
An enemy has been removed.

251
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,330
I don't need to recount it.

252
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,030
I can just say enemy count minus equal 1.

253
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,050
Alright so let's call to keep track of how many enemies are on the scene.

254
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,110
But it's not actually going to get us to the victory screen so let's get to the victory screen.

255
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,680
I'm assuming going to the screen not the next level.

256
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
Right now which making one level.

257
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,800
If you want to make multiple levels you have to keep track of what level on how many levels there are

258
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,520
and then go from there.

259
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,220
But for now let's just go to the screen so say this is going to be an if statement is going to right

260
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,450
here.

261
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,770
If enemy count there it is is equal to zero.

262
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,920
Now Im hesitating a little here because remember we could in theory lose two robots on exactly the same

263
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,280
frame.

264
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,500
It's almost impossible but it is theoretically possible.

265
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:35,580
So let's change that a little bit so if the enemy count is less than 1 okay that's 0 and everything

266
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,560
belief beneath it will work fine.

267
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,330
Now I just need to get tree to change scene.

268
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,250
Let's go grab that scene.

269
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,540
So that's going to be in levels in gooey victory.

270
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,050
And now we should have a basic game.

271
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,710
So let's make this nice and big.

272
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,970
And let's see if I actually survive long enough to see a victory to see it all go away.

273
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:07,970
Giant hamburger at these projec does on much bigger than my version.

274
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,110
This is much harder than it was in the prototype but two is damaged.

275
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm hiding behind a table like some sort of table hiding mouse.

276
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,460
Oh they are so close.

277
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,800
Well what vitrines mind.

278
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,470
What.

279
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,570
You have been defeat.

280
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,070
Oh this is the victory screen.

281
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,400
And have left you have been defeated which is a cheap victory screen.

282
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,250
So now let's do that real quick.

283
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,630
Ha.

284
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,280
Okay.

285
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:39,100
Didn't think of that.

286
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,880
But victorious.

287
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,690
It's exabyte tourist cook.

288
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,320
Okay so we now have a fully functional game.

289
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,150
Right now there's some polish we need to do.

290
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,970
I still wanna put character customization in so we're not done with a section but look at that.

291
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,900
We have a tense game that can quite frankly kick my backside side and there's a lot we can really tweak

292
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,420
with this one he's going to tweak.

293
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,570
To be honest is I'm going to play a scene and the camera back so I can see where I'm doing a bit more.

294
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:12,660
So let's quickly go in to player grab the camera.

295
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,290
Let's just move back a bit to camera was looking a bit better.

296
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
And do you think of that.

297
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,310
No too high.

298
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:24,460
Was he what would an upset look snap off an.

299
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,820
Too little too little.

300
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,730
Maybe.

301
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,640
See what that looks like.

302
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,690
I have a lot more idea of what's happening now so that feels better.

303
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,950
Cool.

304
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,360
And that brings us to the end of this video.

305
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,850
In this video we've looked at counting lives as objects because our enemy count is a variable but we're

306
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:48,010
counting them every time we at a level based on how many robots are within a certain node.
