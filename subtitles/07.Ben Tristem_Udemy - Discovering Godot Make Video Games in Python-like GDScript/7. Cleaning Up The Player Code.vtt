00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.340
Welcome back wonderful God people in this video.

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.180
We're going to tidy up our code a bit.

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.300
And the reason is I want to show you if I open the play a script we've got quite a lot of things happening

4
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.460
now.

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.860
We have moved things into their functions.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.400
But this script is doing more than one thing and it's handling play a movement where the actual play

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.340
is animation what the player Sprite looks like.

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.920
That's not very elegant.

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.960
So what do you mean when we say code is or isn't elegant.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.960
Here's some tips for elegant code because it's quite a slippery concept.

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.740
First off and we've mentioned this before your code should be readable by a human.

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.470
Machines can handle most things but it's very hard to quickly understand where code is going wrong or

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.700
how to use someone else's code or just pick up code you wrote a while back.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.930
If it's not really easy to read I should get a glance at it and understand what each thing does.

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.320
Secondly one script should be in charge of one thing.

16
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.730
There's two parts of that right.

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.450
First off do not have multiple scripts doing the same thing.

18
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.550
So if I've got the player script home player movement and then I've got something else affecting player

19
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.970
movement that said Jump pad and something else up.

20
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.530
Changing player movement on I don't know.

21
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.030
A laser beam that's going to be confusing everything that affects player movement should be in one script.

22
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270
The other side of that is don't have one script doing multiple things.

23
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.730
If the player script does player movement it shouldn't keep track of lives.

24
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.150
It shouldn't keep track of animation.

25
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.370
It shouldn't keep track of sound effects.

26
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.470
If we go back into the player script how would we do this.

27
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.150
Well I've got all this information here made animated Sprite animated Sprite animated Sprite and it's

28
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.530
all repeating itself.

29
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.960
So what I'm going to do is inside the play a scene.

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.990
I'm not going do it.

31
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.170
In level one I would do it in the play a scene in click right here on the little film cracker thing.

32
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.800
I'm going to create a new script on animated Sprite so new script and I'm in it to make sure it's not

33
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.400
in scenes it's in scripts because I need to give a finesse and many sprites on a great name I someone

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.500
call it player animation.

35
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.230
Play animation Dungey.

36
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890
And I don't need any comments.

37
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.420
And when we create it there it is.

38
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.480
So we now have two scripts going on and it's easier just to go over here and close the kinematic tuti

39
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.310
thing and I can switch between the scripts here.

40
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.860
I don't want to run something on the physics frame.

41
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.090
And the reason is I'm already doing a physics process here so every time the physics process techs do

42
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.510
these calculations I don't want to keep doing that.

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.860
The more I add here the morning slow the game down.

44
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.660
So instead I'm to create a brand new function and I call it update.

45
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.930
So every time I ask you to do something I need you to update it.

46
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.690
We need to pass information from the player script through to player animation.

47
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.190
Well luckily we already have some information ready to pass.

48
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.870
This motion thing should work great.

49
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.590
So let's create a new function in player to pass information across the.

50
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.650
We could do this in physics process but animation doesn't really require physics right.

51
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.420
I don't need to calculate how things are interacting moving I just need to every frame check if I'm

52
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.150
animating So underneath Asics process I am going to put.

53
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.190
Function process.

54
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.620
That's a built in thing.

55
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.670
It already has Delta.

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.360
And what do we want to hear what's in it.

57
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.540
Updates animation.

58
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.200
I guess we have the animation.

59
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.010
Let's put that.

60
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.510
Well just here really it's a great place to put it.

61
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.330
Function update animation.

62
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.920
Make sure I've spelt that right which I haven't.

63
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.830
And what does that need to do get the script from the child unknown which is animated sprites and it

64
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.720
needs to update.

65
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.430
I'm going to update motion now.

66
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.910
It's worth noting though when that value comes in here.

67
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.710
Animated Sprite or player animation doesn't care what this value is.

68
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.480
It'll take whatever that value would be but it's not going to check.

69
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.410
Is this the actual motion.

70
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.900
I could actually call this something else.

71
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.910
I call it Bob and it would work fine player dog edhi the player script knows what this value is.

72
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.720
We've defined it in the script.

73
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.010
It's just going to come in with values with a with a variable such a quick motion just keep it machine

74
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.770
readable and it's going to do stuff.

75
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.600
In order for this to work.

76
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.650
I actually need to call this without motion.

77
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.930
So every frame we're going to run process with update the animation.

78
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.880
We're going to go into up the animation and just see what has to happen and it's going to crit it's

79
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.530
going to run this function.

80
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.260
What needs to be in this function.

81
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.150
Well we have most of this right.

82
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.550
All I'm going to do is check what the motion value is.

83
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.550
If motion dot x is greater than zero.

84
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.550
In other words if you are moving right.

85
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.280
Then we're going to play what you know what I don't need to just write all this.

86
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.970
I can just take it from here can't I I'm a cut that if the player is physically moving right.

87
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:30.630
If the motion value the x of the motion value is greater than zero play run and don't flip and l.f.

88
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.550
and upset your life.

89
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.530
Nope.

90
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.380
X is less than zero.

91
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.130
This spacing is more readable and I'm going to cut it from here.

92
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.340
I don't have to cut it like a duplicate of the place but if I cut off from here I know it's gone.

93
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.220
OK so what happens if you're not doing else.

94
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.760
I don't actually need to keep putting these other things in right.

95
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.080
Either you are moving right or you're moving left so if you're not moving right.

96
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.010
You're not moving left.

97
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.780
Just play idle.

98
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.720
And that can disappear.

99
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.860
OK.

100
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.530
Already the run function is a lot easier to read because all I'm looking at as a human style person

101
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.760
is when I press right and I'm not pressing left just change the motion and if I'm pressing laughter

102
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.460
not right just change the motion.

103
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:26.360
Otherwise go this way before we go anywhere and I copy and paste stuff.

104
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.030
This isn't going to work right.

105
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.660
We're in animated Sprite and this dollar sign means check a childhood.

106
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.420
And I mean it's bright.

107
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.610
No don't do that.

108
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.880
So remember when you're copying pasting make sure you keep an eye out for your actually copy and pasting.

109
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.270
Our computers always do what you tell them to do.

110
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.820
Not what you want them to do.

111
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.380
So now it's Pressplay.

112
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.760
Dad are left and right.

113
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.160
So now we have basic information being controlled by the player animation script and we have play movement

114
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.190
being help both play a script.

115
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.690
What I'd like to do is animate the jump.

116
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.000
We have a jump animation and I'd like to put that in.

117
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.820
Which brings me to the challenge for this video.

118
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.780
I would like you to make bungee jump while in the air.

119
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.620
So if you're not on the ground you should be jumping.

120
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.680
Pause the video and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

121
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.480
Welcome back.

122
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.670
So there's a few different ways we can do this but the first thing I do is I'm going to give this priority.

123
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:34.040
Okay so the very first thing you need to check is if you are jumping What do we need to do.

124
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.540
Well if motion dot why.

125
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.180
Is smaller than zero.

126
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.010
We're going to do and to play jump.

127
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.020
Let's see how that works out.

128
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.810
If we are moving up.

129
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.440
Jump.

130
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.150
And it's as simple as that.

131
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.840
Let's talk about what I just did.

132
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.750
So why smaller than.

133
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.160
Well remember the chordettes we looked at in the last video.

134
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.410
Negative.

135
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.020
Why is up positive why is down.

136
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.180
This can be counterintuitive if you're used to normal geometry the way we would normally right this

137
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:27.190
as human style people positive y for me mentally is up but it's got a positive y is down.

138
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:34.710
So if the Y value is less than zero in other words if that direction I am moving in the linear velocity

139
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.980
if my direction is up Jup if it's not start falling.

140
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.770
Right before we finish off one more piece of tidying.

141
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.030
I don't need all this in physics process remenham I'm saying this has to be machine readable.

142
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.350
I actually have a little trouble reading everything physics process so we have this update information.

143
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.500
Why don't we make update motion.

144
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.300
Past delves into this and I'm going to create a function.

145
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:11.270
Make that tidiane and then call it function updates motion with Delta coming.

146
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:13.500
OK.

147
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.260
When the colon in there.

148
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.220
So now we have on the physic process.

149
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:27.770
Update motion and on the non physics process just process update animation.

150
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.420
Let's move animation down a little.

151
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.890
Now that's actually fineries is thing on the talk about is a kind of gloss over this last time we are

152
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:36.940
calling for.

153
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.500
With Delta and if we go down to fall I can use this menu here and go to the full function.

154
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.580
You'll see that motion dot y plus equal so every frame.

155
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:54.130
Add gravity times Delta that you might remember that we are using move and slide here and move and slide

156
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.360
has Delta built in.

157
00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:03.070
So really what we're doing is motion dot y plus equals gravity times Delta times Delta or gravity times

158
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:04.330
Delta squared.

159
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:13.180
Why are we doing that well simply because we're not moving we're accelerating and accelerating is speed

160
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:13.660
times.

161
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.230
Time squared.

162
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:16.570
Which brings us to the end of the video.

163
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.220
So great work in this video.

164
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.870
We've looked at how to make sure you're keeping your code elegant by making sure every script is focussed

165
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:29.590
on one task and also making this readable by human style people and how the enemy will jumping so phenomenal

166
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.220
stuff and are seen in the next video.
