00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.510
Welcome back lovely God people in this video we're going to start putting some serious functionality

2
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.120
in our game.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.080
We're done pretty well so far right we can ask the play for prompts.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.160
We can put those prompts into a story we can display them back and we can restart the game as needed

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.150
in this video we can use the awesome power of dictionaries to create a story template we can have several

6
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.260
stories and pick them randomly.

7
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.380
Were pretty close to feature complete.

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.740
To do that we need to learn about dictionaries.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.970
There are different ways we can solve this.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.490
Dictionaries are the one I'm going with for this video.

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.890
We're going to convert our story and our prompt variables into a single dictionary.

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.510
That's right.

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.210
No longer we need those two different variables.

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.470
We need a single variable that has a dictionary with both the story and the prompt inside them.

15
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.290
Then we're going to turn our dictionary into an array of dictionaries.

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.540
It's going to get all kinds of inception in here.

17
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.830
Then we need to update our script to actually read the new dictionary were at work and pick a random

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.030
story.

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.110
Lots of cool stuff.

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.090
Let's get to it.

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.260
So the obvious place to start is what is a dictionary.

22
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.150
We've looked at the concept of a variable as Ben describes a variable.

23
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.880
It's a box.

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.580
So here is my variable.

25
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.860
Now variables can have all kinds of different things in them and there are different types.

26
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.930
There are strings in our floats and are integers and are billions and there are arrays.

27
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.050
Technically an array is a special type of variable.

28
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.260
And we've looked at an array as a shelf and the shelf can hold as many separate boxes as we need right

29
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.510
here.

30
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.920
A badly drawn boxes and we know how to use arrays right because each one of these is a value and that's

31
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.080
value 0 and that's value 1 and that's value too.

32
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.440
Right so we have an index of where these values are.

33
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.940
A dictionary expands on that.

34
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.480
So if I have my dictionary dictionaries are a little bit different.

35
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.060
They work like a race but they have one additional thing.

36
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.610
So every entry here is a value.

37
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.230
But what if it's not just a value.

38
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.080
It's a key Plus a value.

39
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.600
So every entry has a unique key.

40
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.330
Could be one two three.

41
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.520
Could be donkey monkey hedgehog.

42
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.470
Terrible handwriting right now.

43
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.120
And the values can be anything we want.

44
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.230
Now this can get really useful not just for a story game.

45
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.900
Let's say you're creating an inventory system right you have one of a drag and drop grid based systems.

46
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.970
And I could add another shovel in here and I could put a pickaxe in here and axson here because all

47
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.230
survival games have these things apparently.

48
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.280
Well I can tell the code is that this is Gooly position 1 or 2 position 1 2 3 and inside that here is

49
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.210
the values the value is a shovel a pick axe or an axe.

50
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.150
Dictionary is a great.

51
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.440
So how long.

52
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.790
Well what I want to do is to put them inside curly brackets.

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.400
If I'm using square brackets that's an array.

54
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.670
If I'm using curly brackets G grip knows this is a dictionary which is great news for C language people

55
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.120
so C sharp C++ and all the other variants.

56
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.090
Because when you're sitting there going Dude where are my curly brackets.

57
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.120
Dude they are right here.

58
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.940
OK so we need to make a dictionary.

59
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.120
If we make it an array we just need to put the values in the entries.

60
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.570
Right so a value one comma value two and we can keep adding commas as needed in a dictionary.

61
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.720
We're going to do the same thing but we're going to pair a key and a value key colon value this colon

62
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.730
tells it.

63
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.710
These two things are paid.

64
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.130
The key is always on the left.

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.180
The value is always in the right keys have to be unique.

66
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.130
OK so far so what how does this help us.

67
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.940
Well we don't need to call this my dictionary.

68
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.880
We can call it corrent story and we don't need to just call it key value key value because it's not

69
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.590
helpful.

70
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.480
Instead we can call it prompt and link that to an array and story and link that to a string.

71
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.360
Let's look at what it looks like in the script.

72
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.130
Here we are back in our lovely lovely script and the first thing I need to do is actually create our

73
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.720
dictionary.

74
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.620
So let's create one called current story because that's what we're making right here is our story.

75
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.390
Later on the video will make a template system but for now let's just get this working.

76
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.910
Okay.

77
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.770
And this is going to be a dictionary to make this easier to read.

78
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.650
I'm going to separate them.

79
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.450
Dictionaries allow you to do this right we can format the inside of a dictionary to make them a little

80
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.300
bit more readable.

81
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.930
And I'm not going to use two indents because that's the convention in Judy's script to tell us this

82
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.560
is within this one variable this one dictionary.

83
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.860
Right.

84
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.520
Two indents tells the reader this isn't split up because it's part of a code block.

85
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.150
This is split up for readability.

86
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.910
OK what needs to go in here prompt.

87
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.250
Now I'm going to put this inside some quotes and I'm doing this specifically because I don't need this

88
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.330
to be a variable.

89
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.780
Right.

90
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.550
So I'm good so don't worry about what this value is just treat it as a string and I'm going to link

91
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.350
it to a value so his makki It's called prompt and one of do is copy that and there it is prompt is our

92
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.830
key.

93
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.780
And the array of prompts is our value.

94
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.440
OK.

95
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.210
So next thing comma.

96
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.490
Right.

97
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.920
I'm going to make a new entry in the dictionary and I going to create a story.

98
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.820
And that's the key.

99
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.080
Let's put the space between them nice and legible and let's just copy this.

100
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.110
So.

101
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.830
And paste.

102
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.540
There it is.

103
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.630
And I'm going to put a couple of tabs there so I can easily see it looks much more legible to me so

104
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.380
now we don't need these very what's right would any profit or story because they're within current story.

105
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.210
So let's get rid of them entirely.

106
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.560
Lines four and five.

107
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.710
Goodbye.

108
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.100
Right now we have a dictionary if we run this game it won't work.

109
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.300
The reason is whenever we're looking for prompt we're looking for a variable called prompt and I've

110
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.480
just removed it.

111
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.650
So what I need to do is tell it look at the key code prompt within current story had to do that.

112
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.500
I mean click here on prompt.

113
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.200
What do current the school story dot prompt.

114
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.530
Right.

115
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.520
So current story that's a dictionary.

116
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.440
So want to do dot the next thing is going to be the key.

117
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.970
The current story prompt playworks Size just like before.

118
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.250
Now I need to go through the script and replace every time it's looking for these prompts.

119
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.500
With that and every time is looking for the story with that you might be tempted to use control.

120
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.400
Ah which is find a replacement type in story or prompt.

121
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:37.050
I would seriously recommend that you don't do that in the default idae E in the default code writing

122
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.050
egd script.

123
00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.620
It is not easy.

124
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.960
Click on prompt and just change those prompts and not change prompt player right which is what's going

125
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.450
to happen if I change prompt to current story prompt replace all.

126
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.410
I've now changed everything and that won't work right I can't change a function name to current story

127
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.610
Doc prompt.

128
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.070
So let's do this manually We only have a few instances.

129
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.700
We have this one in ready and we have this next one which is going to be in where is it story done derrida's

130
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.880
WITNESS.

131
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.200
Close that replace thing I don't like it.

132
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.120
There it is.

133
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.780
Current and a Scott story.

134
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.950
Dot promises.

135
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.690
Fantastic.

136
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.420
And of course in prompt player right.

137
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.570
We when we promised the player where we prompt it from current oscorp story not prompt.

138
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.550
Finally Intel's story.

139
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.780
That story is now a key within the dictionary.

140
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.850
So let's hope that here's a dictionary current school story dot story and that should work this wind

141
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.180
up.

142
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.990
I love it when a plan comes together.

143
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:43.870
Fantastic.

144
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.310
So now we have this functionality.

145
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.810
Let's put it to good use right.

146
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:53.980
Let's create a template variable something to rename current story template if I can't remember how

147
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.580
to spell.

148
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.360
Good Lord yeah and let's create a current story.

149
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.340
Don't forget to do this bit because otherwise we won't know what the current story's template isn't

150
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.030
going to be a dictionary it's going to be multiple dictionaries right.

151
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.840
We'll have several of these dictionaries to get the prompts and stories linked.

152
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.920
How can I do that.

153
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.290
Well we know how to do that we're going to create an array an array of dictionaries.

154
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.340
Dun dun da.

155
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.510
Let's put that over there so I can see it.

156
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.700
All I need to do is every time I want to add a new story I'll just put a comma in.

157
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.760
As duplicate this which I will do with control B.

158
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.140
I probably don't need that comma there.

159
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.390
Make it nice and neat.

160
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.950
Now I just need to create a brave new story which is my challenge to you.

161
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:42.350
I would like you to add to our template all I'd like you to do is create at least one more story that

162
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.610
goes within the template.

163
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.020
Remember the easiest way to do this is to write your story as a string and then look for the word you

164
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.680
want to replace replace them with 3 percent.

165
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.420
S That's the format string operator and create your prompts to go with it.

166
00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.020
So pause the video right at least one more story within your templates array and when you come back

167
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.550
I'll show you how I do it.

168
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.270
Welcome back.

169
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.300
Okay let's first remove all the stuff in the string so stories empty.

170
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.050
Remove everything and prompt prompter's that day.

171
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.200
So let's go now.

172
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:28.820
Once was a thing called name that live as a..

173
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.290
As a noun there once was a.

174
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.100
Think so.

175
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.750
Get rid of a thing that's going to be.

176
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.340
Percent.

177
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.690
That's great.

178
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:49.690
Called let's copy you turn that into n small.

179
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.050
A name.

180
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.800
That lived as a..

181
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.160
I discovered that many people don't know the what adjectives so let's call it a description word an

182
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:08.950
adjective that lived as free as a noun.

183
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.040
So that's another one of those.

184
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.140
And that goes like this.

185
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.070
What was it now.

186
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.920
A thing they're going to do it on a full stop at the edge of that great here is our second story.

187
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.720
I've actually written five more of these.

188
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.440
So just to make it complete I'm going to fast for a little bit and put them in.

189
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.040
Okay here we are a whole bunch of stories in here.

190
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.940
So let's just minimize that for now.

191
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.170
I don't need all those lines of code so this little arrowheads click on that you see the dot dot dot

192
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.350
it's hiding stuff and you can see line for jumps Slide 31.

193
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.840
And let's put a gap between our variables and office function.

194
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.300
Okay.

195
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.290
We now have a template with a whole slew of stories and we are going to make that easier to read and

196
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.230
future video.

197
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.090
What can we do to make a random's.

198
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.080
What we do to pick a random story for current story.

199
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.910
Well the first thing we need to do is tell it what current story is right.

200
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.970
Current story equals something find out who wrote Zero so doesn't throw a fit.

201
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.690
That's not what's going to equal that's just a place holder.

202
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.030
What do we need to do.

203
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.470
I need to pick a random number.

204
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.000
How random is a little tough to do with computers right.

205
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.530
Computers are not very good at random.

206
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.390
Human brains are not that good at random either.

207
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.750
But computers aren't good at it.

208
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.840
What they tend to do is they generate a random seed so they generate a random seed.

209
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.490
You need to use a randomized.

210
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.250
There is some brackets.

211
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.630
Randomize is creating new random seed every time you generate something random.

212
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.610
It's going to use the same seed.

213
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.100
So if you needed to pick a different random number than the last time you need to run randomise again

214
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.700
for our purposes were only running at once in the script on ready.

215
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.300
And the reason we're only running at once is because the next time we play the game we're going through

216
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.900
the whole script anyway so we're just going to go back to read it.

217
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.130
So we have randomise what's current story going to be kind of story.

218
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.560
It's going to be something from template and template is giving something within the array template

219
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:05.850
was going to be it's gonna be a random integer number an integer is a number that has no decimal points.

220
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.110
So what that's going to do is it's going to pick a random index position.

221
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.570
Right so the integer is the index position.

222
00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.290
So let's look 0 1 2.

223
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.290
Each story is a different entry right and we looked at this.

224
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.410
Okay well we can't just do random number.

225
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.910
You can't just pick any random number.

226
00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:28.080
If we look at the documentation for random integer which would double control and clicking on it you'll

227
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.310
see that the format is random integer percentage and then number and returns a random number between

228
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.260
0 and that number.

229
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.880
If you need it to be between 1 and the number you need to add 1 to it.

230
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:50.090
In programming we count from zero right so random integer percentage 20 means start from zero and count

231
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.080
20 random things.

232
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.560
Pick one of them so that's what it's going to pick between 0 and 19 which is perfect.

233
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.480
That's just what we need.

234
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:04.220
So pick a random number sent from template dot size like count how many things are in template.

235
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.610
That's your upper limit.

236
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.020
Generate the random thing so that should work.

237
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.510
You'll find out.

238
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.220
Let's find out.

239
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.170
Can I have a noun donkey.

240
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:18.640
Ben likes donkey let's use dungheap can have an adjective a description word delicious.

241
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.810
Another No.

242
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.000
2 Can you like make two cans.

243
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.560
Yet another noun headphones.

244
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.830
Now just look around my desk.

245
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.410
Humans are not very good at random.

246
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.460
An adjective polite.

247
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.430
And one more noun.

248
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.670
Smart car.

249
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.070
Get a verb to fly.

250
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.620
The order of a pizza recipe makes one packet of Dunky with three spoonfuls of flour.

251
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.750
Neither dough for three minutes until delicious.

252
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.070
Roll the dough flat on on a two can and sprinkle one pinch of headphone and three cups of plate Smart

253
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:53.440
Car big for 70 minutes on a high heat and then remove from the oven and to fly.

254
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.450
So to fly and the look we have random stories based on the templates in this video.

255
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.000
We've looked at the awesome power of dictionaries and g.d. script.

256
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.740
Great for any kind of two dimensional array.

257
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.410
We've looked at nesting dictionaries in arrays so a dictionary with a dictionary an array with a dictionary

258
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.210
dictionary with an array array with an array and any combination you want.

259
00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.560
Right.

260
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.380
Turtles all the way down and we've looked at how to generate random integers all of which are really

261
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.360
strong foundational skills.

262
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.530
So great work.

263
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.710
See you in the next video.
