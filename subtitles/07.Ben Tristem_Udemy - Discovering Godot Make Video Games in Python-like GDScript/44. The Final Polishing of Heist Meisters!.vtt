00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.620
Hello glory has got people in this video very exciting when you do in the final polish of heiss Meister's.

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.010
We are going to finish the game off and take some time to look at what we've created because it's really

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.720
exciting.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.350
Just a few things I want to do.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.770
First let's plug the tutorial in the game.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.600
But there's great you tauriel set up play I can't get to it.

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.530
Let's fix that.

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.850
Second let's fix that bug with the tutorial gooey changes place.

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.690
If we Reece's the screen because that gets annoying and let's add a little bit of flash to the Google

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.080
let's add an animation to the tutorial.

11
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.600
Or it's a first thing plug in the toilet is the get go.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.180
So we've already made a scene that looks a bit like what we want.

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.130
If I go into my scenes and I go in to my was my game overall victory screen either closer to victory

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.490
screen or something like that is looking pretty good.

15
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.000
So I'm just going to create a new scene that has.

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.990
HI MY a hi mice's and a couple of choices.

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.880
So let's do that.

18
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.500
Let's make a new scene root note which is a canvas layer.

19
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.750
And within that and with a nine patch rectangle rectangle.

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.200
Yeah.

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.720
And put a nice patch rectangle and you were a just made up.

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.860
It's lovely.

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.720
My patch wrecked.

24
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.180
They were gone.

25
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.720
I actually don't know if that rect means rectangle I've just been assuming it does.

26
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.530
And you know what this also put a centre note in so I'll put a centre container.

27
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.960
The nine patch will be inside of that and a nameless canvas layer welcomely or a splash screen I guess

28
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.250
is the right word.

29
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.490
Splash screen welcome screen.

30
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.460
OK.

31
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.760
So we have this sent a container which I'm going to make for rect and when I anchor it to four Act case

32
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.960
that should now change its lay out the pin in what's in there and anything inside it will be centred

33
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.140
and just to make sure I can show the helpers.

34
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.170
So here is on patch in the middle.

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.780
OK.

36
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.530
Let's put in a background and it'll be under graphics interface PRNG.

37
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.670
And once again one of these metal panels.

38
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.810
And yeah I still like this one.

39
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.740
This metal panel with the little screws in the corner.

40
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.570
However it's a size zero right now.

41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.070
Well let's fix that and let's give it a minimum size of 400 on the X and 300 on the y.

42
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.220
It's pretty good.

43
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.370
So now I have this patch ready to go but I don't have a text yet so let's drag that in March more like

44
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.300
it.

45
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.000
Patch margins 12 I think was good.

46
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.220
Yes 12 is good for the structure.

47
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.750
All right.

48
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.820
And I'm just going to zoom through this so within the nine patch rectangle I'm going to have some children

49
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.800
that are just going to be a VS split container.

50
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.480
No I don't mean these but contain I keep doing that.

51
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.770
I mean VR box first is going to be a box.

52
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.360
The box container and that's going to be full rectangle anchors full rectangle split.

53
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.920
And let's just give that a margin so give them a margin of 22 left 20 to the right probably mean negative

54
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.270
20.

55
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.180
I do 20 from the top and negative 20 from the bottom.

56
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.960
So within those four screws or bolts whatever.

57
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.520
And within that let's make our options.

58
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.770
We have a label that's to say

59
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.050
Welcome to hi Meister's Let's add the theme in.

60
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.740
I'm going up to the centre container.

61
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.120
Just select anything I put within here is going to be in the right theme.

62
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.590
Load my theman up and heiss mice's great card doesn't work for me so let's change the colour for this

63
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.120
label.

64
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.450
I'm going through this quite quickly because we've done this recently but they're welcome to heiss Meister's

65
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.000
And I mean go to the top of the label in the Inspector a line I'm going to Santa.

66
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.250
So that's a good start.

67
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.020
We could make this a bigger font we could make having a font.

68
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.520
Lots of things we can do to play with it.

69
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.120
For now this is looking good to me.

70
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.680
So underneath here I'm going to put a bunch of buttons that are centred while getting back to my box

71
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.600
container and I make another centred note because on my button to be Santa Alice but a button with it

72
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.240
on my text right.

73
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.060
Play tutorial.

74
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.270
Okay that looks pretty good to me.

75
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.670
So I'm seeing a duplicate this button make a brand new button that I call this one level one.

76
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.580
And let's not play a space on codenames named Skip consistent.

77
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.710
And I'm sure I level one in this button.

78
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.360
One more thing I want to do on a duplicate this and quit button.

79
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.880
There's a problem or one button.

80
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.590
Quick button is going to have quit game.

81
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.780
All three of these buttons are a different size.

82
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.330
Not doing them size is all 162.

83
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.990
So I say the minimum size is 170.

84
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.470
I mean go through all three buttons.

85
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.810
I don't do that manually.

86
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.030
I'm doing this manually because I found if I select multiple undo the size it doesn't always stick.

87
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.830
Just to be really shown and make sure that I see what's happening.

88
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.160
I a pick a minimum size of 170 for each and I would save that scene goes into levels and this is splash

89
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.180
screen.

90
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.170
I go out there and come again.

91
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.200
It's looking good.

92
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
Now this reebok's is right at the top.

93
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.860
I don't want that some of scroll top which has alignment unhit Centre looking better.

94
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.470
Now this welcome.

95
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.260
Hi mice's actually do want a slightly bigger font than that so let's go back up to label.

96
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.360
And scroll down to font.

97
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.780
Do do do do custom fonts.

98
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.700
New Dynamic font.

99
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.680
Click right.

100
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.050
Select out fonts on a load of future and my size is going to be 40.

101
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.900
Look how huge that is that's way too big.

102
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.950
So I'm going back and I'm going to do auto wrap come out of the screen and back in and it's Orta wrapped

103
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.320
itself VAT's looking a lot better.

104
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.610
Now if we wanted we could try getting one of these taxes in.

105
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.340
So what is this like with blue.

106
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.460
Actually not too bad.

107
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.480
Maybe read and I can alter the patch margins to be able to work that in.

108
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.140
So if I wanted to I'd go 20 patch margin maybe a 40 patch margin and that's looking a lot better right.

109
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.510
So there's a lot of options you can do to really customize this game.

110
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.760
Maybe I wanted him blue bluefields a stealthy a colour than red because I don't know reasons.

111
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.880
Or maybe just want his metal pants.

112
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.670
Either way we now have the basic level so to make this work.

113
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.400
Let's give it a script on Splash screen I believe a new script and I'm going to save this in my script

114
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.490
solin because I'm a traditionalist.

115
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.170
And you know what.

116
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.920
I don't need the default template.

117
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.710
I want an empty template.

118
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.320
Pick out button off first button.

119
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.460
She tore a button and I'm going to connect it as a signal.

120
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.410
So when pressed connects to splash screen.

121
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.060
Field Level 1.

122
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:56.500
UPS come back and quit but button suppressed splash screen at the close.

123
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.690
All of these things.

124
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.350
I don't need I'm pressing catterall W to close them all.

125
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.870
In fact you know what I could probably close all.

126
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.580
There we go.

127
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.140
Save the splash screen.

128
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.460
Awesome.

129
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.750
I'm back in a splash green and a splash screen.

130
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.670
Great.

131
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.700
So I've just closed all the scripts I don't need.

132
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.590
Because there are a lot of them quitter's going to be the easiest right that's going to get Tre not

133
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.930
quit so that one just works back up to my scenes folder.

134
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.230
You do in two levels.

135
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:32.900
And here I since I get so to get to the tutorial and you get a tree change scene and I'm just going

136
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.620
to drag in my better.

137
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.050
Awesome.

138
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.420
Now I'm going to duplicate this control be and move this down Alton down here.

139
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.260
I don't need this pass anymore.

140
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.660
But I do want is to make sure that level one actually gets me to level 1.

141
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.930
All right.

142
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.310
Let's see how that works out.

143
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.620
Apology Tour.

144
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.860
Here I am at the tutorial.

145
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.210
Great.

146
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.170
Let's run that again.

147
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.450
Play level one.

148
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.870
Here I am in level one.

149
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.490
And finally quit.

150
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:03.880
I quit the game.

151
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.840
Outstanding.

152
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.350
Right now we have this scene we want to start the game at this season so how do we change the default

153
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.730
start.

154
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.360
Because right now if I just run the game if I was to export this it's just going to take me straight

155
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.920
to Level 1 which is not what I want to project settings and under run.

156
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.330
You see right here this is my main scene.

157
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:30.730
Well let's change that I want to be level 1 so I'm going to file good scenes levels and splash screen.

158
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.260
And now when I run play on this game not play scene but play.

159
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.960
And take me directly to here.

160
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.380
Awesome.

161
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.830
That's task one done.

162
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.750
The next thing to do with the tutorial Gary so I was going to a tutorial scene which is handy right

163
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.370
here.

164
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.410
And the problem we're having with this is when I open the tutorial the go is going to come up.

165
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.720
That's great.

166
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.310
But it's not anchoring properly.

167
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.740
Now I've done a lot of experimentation.

168
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.840
And the problem with this appears to be the pop up.

169
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.070
So if I go over to the tutorial Gary you'll see that the pop up is a pop up.

170
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.470
And for some reason this node is not updating its anchor its just setting the ankle once and then leaving

171
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.890
it.

172
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.760
If I change this someone right click on it and you change type.

173
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.180
Let's just say control mode.

174
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.680
This will not anchor properly.

175
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.000
Right so it's still called pop up.

176
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.580
Im not going to change that because various paths are using that even there's a little bit of change

177
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.090
the type to a controller.

178
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.500
Now when I run this scene

179
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.720
this is now anchored probably wise I say once there was a lovely sound which because I read that she

180
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.590
tauriel gooey scene or the tutorial but its fine.

181
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.170
I run the tutorial scene the same thing should happen.

182
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.010
Great.

183
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.980
Now one more thing I wanted to do is I wanted to make this goofy things.

184
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.190
Let me show him in.

185
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:52.830
Weve got this message coming in and a move to the subjective and the message changes but its not immediately

186
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.630
apparent.

187
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.880
I want some kind of animation to happen here.

188
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:04.220
So I want this window to change size or to fade in and out something to let the play that's happening.

189
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.950
So what I'm doing and go into my tutorial gooey scene again and I'm there and an animation player.

190
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:20.820
And I will give it a new animation and I call this message transition to contain days but Transition

191
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:21.530
transition.

192
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.160
No it isn't transition.

193
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.470
I know what I'd like to do is before I show you how I'm going out to make this.

194
00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.400
I'd like to get you to do it.

195
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.990
I'd like you to an inmate that she tour illegally so use the animation player to create some sort of

196
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.860
transition between messages.

197
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.820
Use your creativity.

198
00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.670
Do you want it to fade in and out.

199
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.650
Do you want it to change scale.

200
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.140
Do you want to go off screen and come back.

201
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.710
Pause the video make an animation you're happy with.

202
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.600
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

203
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.470
And welcome back.

204
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.590
Well I'm going to do is I'm going to first select what's going to happen.

205
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:05.000
So what I want is for this window to go up to this corner and come back.

206
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.790
I think half a second is a good length.

207
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.670
This is zero point five seconds.

208
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.420
And just to give me a lot of control.

209
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.060
The steps we zero point zero five.

210
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.650
So every one is at 20.

211
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.120
The second I can make a change.

212
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.510
Zoom right in so I can see you're doing.

213
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.710
That's what I'm looking at.

214
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:22.490
OK.

215
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.040
I want to change the size so I'm going to use right here on rect size.

216
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:35.290
That's my first key to create that track and it's going to come back again at the end of this five second.

217
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:41.430
Now if I zoom out even further what I really want is around two and a half second marks right the middle.

218
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.710
I want the size to be zero zero and I will create.

219
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.320
That's a key.

220
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:53.150
Now you'll notice we've still got this little shape why that's on Patch wrecked.

221
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.830
We've told it you must keep this corner at all times so saying okay I will.

222
00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.900
And look for play this animation.

223
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.080
Doesn't look cool.

224
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.530
I want to use this place from start.

225
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.050
Now one thing I do want to do is I want to stop the techs from doing something go right back to the

226
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.730
beginning and on the label.

227
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.740
I'm going to scroll down.

228
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.710
Doo doo doo doo doo visible.

229
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:23.700
And I'm I make a key on the on the zero frames and that goes there at zero point zero five the very

230
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.150
first key and the switch that invisible and I bring it back right at the end.

231
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.600
However.

232
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.930
I've got this little JOP jerk jealousy thing that I like.

233
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.510
I'm gonna move.

234
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:41.250
The first moving sister points a five and now want to play this animation that looks pretty good.

235
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.980
I'm digging that's going to save that and now I need to run this animation.

236
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.450
OK.

237
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.340
So let's go back into our tutorial script.

238
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.000
And make it nice big.

239
00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.580
And what I want is on Update point position right.

240
00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.960
This is where everything is happening so let's put it in here and do it just as the sound plays because

241
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.780
that right now feels like a nice place to do it.

242
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.920
Animation player.

243
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.570
It can be in the tutorial gilio major player not the door that he will play.

244
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.020
And what are we playing message transition.

245
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.460
Let's see how that works on a run the game from the beginning.

246
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.490
I really get into much torian LOOK AT THIS.

247
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.690
I like that.

248
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:30.750
Now you could play with the timings you could make a lot of different ways that bind you different ways

249
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:36.330
you could do this if you want to change fate in a now you could go into your nine patch rectangle or

250
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.760
your label go to visibility change the modulate and put an offer in lots of different things you can

251
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.450
do here but you can really personalize these messages.

252
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:49.760
And that finishes off Hice I surmise this is a lot of different things you could do.

253
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.130
But we have a working concept for a game which means this is the end of the video in this video we've

254
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.720
added a level selection to our game because remember if we can select tutorial level 1 we could make

255
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.480
a bunch of other levels and select them as well with polished high slices to a lustrous polished sheen

256
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.280
of shapeliness.

257
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.270
So excellent work there.

258
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.990
And we've finished heiss Meister's.

259
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.310
Now we're going to have a wrap up video to talk about where you could go from here and to look back

260
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.150
at all the new stuff we've covered.

261
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.680
But excellent work well done in your game and share which you've got.

262
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.740
I'm dying to see your house Meister's and I'll see you in the next video.
