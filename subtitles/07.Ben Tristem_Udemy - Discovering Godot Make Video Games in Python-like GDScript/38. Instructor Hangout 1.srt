00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,870
Welcome back you delightful God people to this our lonely Let's wrap up.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,210
And first it's like to hang out and I'm joined by my very old friend Ben.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,110
Ben you look very old how I met her.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,840
Shut up I'm very well thank you.

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,130
Yeah feet feeling young and sprightly so don't care.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:19,860
All right.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,460
What do we got for people what are we seeing in the looney lips.

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,010
Well first why don't we share some of the stuff that we've been seeing.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:33,160
What do to give a particular shout out to find the right thing to do while you're giving a shout out.

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,010
I want to give a shout out so those of you who've been busiest on the forum so specifically Keith veltroni

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:45,620
to Bindy Richard to name just a few you guys have been super busy on our community game live TV site

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,420
so keep it up.

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,350
And also spend some time on discord.

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,220
I'm sure you do as well.

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,620
The live chat server.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,560
And just one of a look really quickly over on Facebook.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,540
Daniel McPherson who's done some fantastic work in all sections has taken lonely lips and turned it

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,470
into hang man up a very brief video of it right here.

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,490
Just take the basic concept add a couple of assets and just run with it which just goes to show what

20
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:13,120
you can do with this very key building block in lowney lips and really make all kinds of fun games.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,670
So I'm really excited to get you guys off the ground learning lists of course is designed to just give

22
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,890
you the very basics of some aspects of the engine and the very basics of Judy's script as well.

23
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,930
I've been doing the C sharp conversion with you.

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,740
I hope those more advanced programs are you being getting on well with that and seeing the pros and

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,030
cons of C sharp.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,520
That was a quick question of somebody about closing files.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,570
Both applies to both Judy's script and C sharp.

28
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,390
When you do file duclos basically as soon as you can.

29
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,550
As soon as you've read the data file just close it you don't need to keep it open beyond that.

30
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,740
So just to put them to bed there's another site you should be closing them before you return function

31
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,360
otherwise the close doesn't happen so well you got it certainly before you close the function and finish

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,710
the function.

33
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,500
But also as soon as you finish writing that data into an instance variable whether you're putting it

34
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,930
into a local variable then you can close the files.

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,110
And I want to talk a little bit about what you can do with linae Lips.

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,690
I showed you you know his hangmen which is fantastic but if you think about it the key concepts we have

37
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,960
here allow you to make some really complicated games so putting things in Jason files and I've mentioned

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,500
this a few times in the videos that doesn't just have to be you know basic text input that can be dialogue.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,520
It can be inventory it can be item descriptions can be lawfully a world if you're making a huge gain.

40
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,100
These are the building blocks you need.

41
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,280
So already we've got some key concepts in there.

42
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,570
So that's luly Lips and we've got some fun stuff happening in the next section.

43
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,300
Then you will talk a little bit about the next action.

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,180
Yeah just just before that there was one other thing that comes up a bit which is fine no vs. get no

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,250
daryl's get it he asked this so fine noad Looks for their descendants and it looks at them by name so

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,070
descendants of the current known by name Get know how does get known work and get noad will still find

47
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,460
ascendants if you want it to but get know you're actually giving it a path.

48
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,870
So instead of saying find a node that has the name Panda you'll saying go here and get a panda so it

49
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,220
can be a descendant but it can be in a completely different part the scenery and you'll set a dollar

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:04,510
symbol.

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,130
You say you use that over and judis Script is a shortcut to get node.

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,410
Yes because I can't be bothered writing get note every 10 seconds so.

53
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,410
So it's obviously a common function call.

54
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,040
Okay so sorry you were saying we're about to move on to our next section.

55
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,070
Really looking forward to seeing what you guys can do there.

56
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,080
I'll quick advice and this is true in all our courses is you've got to the end of the section before

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,050
you take a break.

58
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,630
Start the next section.

59
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah because that means psychologically you're not already be invested in it.

60
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:37,760
If you stop at the end of the section and take a little break it's much harder to get back into the

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,300
course.

62
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,810
So watch a video two from that and then take your break.

63
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,400
The first video is pretty short.

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,660
I think it's just getting the assets and planning everything together.

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,370
Get started and would love to see you do in that section.

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,870
Also I'll see you at the end of it guys and see you later.
