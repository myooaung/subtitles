1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,150
Hello again you Fantastic.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,800
Got a people in this video will make simple doors.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,160
Later on we'll extend them to make locked doors.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,110
But first we'll make simple doors.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,780
Let's take a moment to think about how doors and work on our game.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,190
I want these doors to give a little bit of tension there also and give some gameplay bonuses.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,740
I will talk about that a second.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,100
So how are they going to work.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,210
Well the player has to actually use the door.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,010
I'm not thinking of a door like you would get in let's say Wal-Mart or supermarket where you get close

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,740
and a magic eye detects you and they open for you.

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,930
You're going to have to physically open the door.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,590
How do you do that.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,730
You're going to left click on them.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,480
So you've got to move the mouse to the door and left click.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,510
And I won't be able to detect the player is in the clickable area.

17
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,550
In other words is the player close enough to actually click on this door.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,590
Now we need to do that because otherwise the play will be able to click on the door from anyone the

19
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,560
level which is not what we want.

20
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,850
Now we also need to make sure that we're checking when the player has left the clickable area.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,030
So we make an error 2D when to check when the players entered it and when they've left it I'm going

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,160
to use those to change a variable called can click the player has to be in range of the door but NPC

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,570
is just opened the door by getting close.

24
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,750
This means our area is going to do different things depending on what type of character has entered

25
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,840
them.

26
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,240
Those are also in a block light.

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,280
Now I mentioned this can be a gameplay bonus at all.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,820
This is the gameplay bonus if the doors close.

29
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,480
I can see there's a guard on the outside of it.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,020
The guard can't see me and the doors have to close automatically.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,380
I don't want to have to click on them again to close them.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,850
All right.

33
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,660
So let's get into the game and what I want to do is get into the template level first song that click

34
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:44,080
on the little film icon hit to open the template sing and let's make a brand new node for doors so brand

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,120
new node you can call it doors say that and get back into Level 1 and you can see we now have this new

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,540
thing called doors that's why the doors will live but doors are going to need a brand new scene.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,880
So it's like a brand new scene.

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:05,110
And we need a custom node as our base and our custom node is going to have an area 2D so our doors are

39
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,210
actually area 2D that are going to have collision inside them.

40
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,590
So first here we have our door and let's see we need a brand new collision shape so let's make a collision

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,900
shape 2D.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,390
There you are.

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,330
Yeah.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,620
And on the shape we'll have a brand new rectangle shape and a click on the rectangle shape and just

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,380
set the extents to be 32 by 42.

46
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,680
Where am I getting 32 from.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,890
Well if you look on the graphics under P and G and on the tiles you'll see that I've actually pulled

48
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,570
some of the tiles out from the tile she I'm going to be using this one tough three four seven so I just

49
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,520
drag this in the sprite.

50
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,590
This is 64 pixels.

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,140
The extent is from the center to the edge.

52
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,140
So half 64 is 32.

53
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,650
Let's move this sprite to be a direct shot of the doors is not a child the collision shape.

54
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm going to rename it to dork sprite.

55
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,010
OK.

56
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,610
So the doll sprite transform 0 0 right in the center there.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,610
That's looking good so this collision shape here is going to be a character detector sector let's call

58
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,400
it that Let's rename it character detectable.

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,020
And that's going to be what we gonna use to check.

60
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,100
Is there a player in here.

61
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,440
Is there an NPC in here and when it is going to send some signals first however this is just a sprite.

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,990
People will be able to walk through it.

63
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,160
So we have this error to date.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,780
It has its own collision but we have no collision to stop people walking through the doors.

65
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,310
So going at a static body as a child of the sprites static body so anybody 2D which is going to need

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:44,120
its own collision shape collision shape duty and the expense for this it's can be a rectangle shape

67
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,020
makes makes sense.

68
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,350
And this is going to be 32 by 10.

69
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,710
There we go.

70
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,600
We can now hide that before we go any further let's make sure that we've actually set our collision

71
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,150
layers.

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,920
This is going to be really important.

73
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,120
So what LaRose we are part of the tile map we could call this layer level inside but we've called a

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,320
time up so stick with it.

75
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,450
Doors a part of the tournament and they can interact with players and pieces they can't interact with

76
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,410
time Ms.

77
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,510
The really important one is going to the character detector.

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,530
This is vital.

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:21,120
So on the door for the area Judy got a collision and make sure the layer is set to tile map and make

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,060
sure the mask is set to player and NPC do not set this as Tama.

81
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,060
If you do it'll detect the level and that's going to cause all kinds of problems.

82
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,610
We don't want to detect the level we just want to detect characters and our characters so far are players

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,000
and gods and technically cameras.

84
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,670
But I don't know how a camera would get in here.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,760
OK.

86
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,950
So we can now hide this collision shape.

87
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,110
So we have a collision shape.

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,600
We have the sprite and it's a static body so far so good.

89
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,970
I also want to add a light include I'm going to add this is a child of the sprite.

90
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,940
So let's go to light occluded Tutti and we want to make sure that we're hiding what's happening here.

91
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,180
It's a brand new lighter cleaner as a polygon.

92
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,260
There it is.

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,840
And let's draw it in.

94
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,090
So at new node I'm going to draw as close to these coins I can.

95
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,900
You could use a grid here but you're going to have to set the snaps to one and I don't really feel like

96
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,260
doing that.

97
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,010
OK.

98
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,250
So there's our door.

99
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,730
I'm going to click on the clutter and I'm going to open it somewhere until closed.

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,130
So that would just blocking the three corners We're not blocking the slide so far so good.

101
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,080
This still shows an error it's like click the side.

102
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,360
It shouldn't do but it is.

103
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,780
So we can hide you.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,150
And that's everything to look at two more things you want to do.

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,580
Let's go right to the top of door and on to add an animation player and that's what we use to open the

106
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,340
door animation player not animation tree or tree play animation play and one more thing we want is we

107
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,270
want some sort of sound effects effects adult and audio stream play 2D.

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,880
And when Al gets to go we can now start making things first thing I do is I make this animation for

109
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
the doll set to make the animation for the door and to make it brand new animation and to call it open

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,780
and it looks good.

111
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,980
I think this can be a force a confirmation is going to open.

112
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,840
Wait.

113
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,140
Close associate four seconds.

114
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:18,950
And I'm thinking oh one second snap I'm going to animate this door sprite by moving the sprite it'll

115
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,000
move all of its children.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,520
That's going include the static body and the lighter clutter which is exactly what I want.

117
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:31,250
So let's go to transform an under position let's make a brand new key and go to one second then I'm

118
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,400
going to move this negative sixty four and there goes and then I click it that and the stay there all

119
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,770
three seconds into a three second mark and make a new key and then four seconds it's gonna go to zero

120
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,900
and we'll make key there.

121
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:52,700
So if I play this it opens it stays for two seconds and it closes pretty good.

122
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,760
You can play with those times you can play with the speed you can do what you want with that but that's

123
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,520
looking pretty solid.

124
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,000
Which brings me to the challenge.

125
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,570
I want to make some sound effects of audio the audio stream play a 2D so that we shown how to do that.

126
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,850
And I want you to figure out your sound effects before getting further.

127
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,130
I've given you some options here.

128
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,210
So if we go to SFX you've got all these different door open door close ones.

129
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,240
Let's play one

130
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,310
and it's looping.

131
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,220
So before we go any further just go to select all of these go up here to the import tag uncheck loop

132
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,980
and here's the really important bit press re import.

133
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,140
If you don't press re import nothing will happen.

134
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,640
Back to seeing now when you check any of these.

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,170
Right.

136
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,010
OK.

137
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,040
So if I guess the animation player I would like you to make the door play a sound when it opens and

138
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,750
it closes pick the sounds you want.

139
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,010
Figure out how you do this.

140
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,660
Now there are different ways you can do this but see how familiar you are with it with the interface

141
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,790
with the animation play See if you figure it out.

142
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,620
Don't go crazy if you get frustrated.

143
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,070
That's OK.

144
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,340
Come back I'll show you my solution.

145
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,820
Meanwhile pause the video give it a shot.

146
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,240
And when you come back I'll show you my solution

147
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,440
and welcome back.

148
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,220
OK.

149
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,230
So how many to do this.

150
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,300
Well what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a brand new track in my track is gonna be an audio playback

151
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,410
track and it's going to say Okay where's the node that I'm going to animate.

152
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,590
I want to animate the audio stream allegedly.

153
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,000
Now this is not the only way we could do this.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,450
Okay.

155
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,260
We could also go to audio stream play 2D animate stream is a key and then animate playing is a key.

156
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,000
So there are a couple ways you could do this but this allows me to do everything in one place.

157
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,550
So on add a brand new key here insert key.

158
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,710
Click on that and so say what's my stream.

159
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,690
I must say door open to maybe see what that sounds like

160
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,490
yeah I quite like that kind of movie.

161
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,610
And then the door closing one so it's insert a key here and stick with twos and they sound.

162
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,960
So when the OS so I'm going to click on that key and see a stream empty press.

163
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,970
Here we go.

164
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,560
How's that.

165
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,070
Oh I don't like that one it's all.

166
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,870
Okay.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,550
How you know even worse.

168
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,190
Let's pick one.

169
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,240
OK.

170
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,960
So those string one it is.

171
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,810
And let's make sure I'm clicking the right key.

172
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,970
CLICKING There.

173
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,250
And I also think it needs to be much later that sound effect should happen when it closes.

174
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,990
So one more time

175
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,940
very nice.

176
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,150
OK.

177
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,370
So that's almost done.

178
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,210
Let's actually say that some say this.

179
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,340
Make a brand new folder.

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,480
Call it doors Rosen locked doors in here and save it.

181
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:39,820
OK.

182
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,890
So we can now put in our door.

183
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,330
I'm going to put in a test of analysis when I open it.

184
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:53,310
So I'm going to add a new scene put in my doors and click on move and just move it down to here.

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,890
Great all I can test right now is does it have collisions.

186
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,170
I mean we'll test that this press play and move past this plot of randomly put here and we now have

187
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,530
a door that doesn't do anything.

188
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,360
Let's make it do stuff.

189
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,810
Let's give it a script.

190
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,430
So back to doors and a brand new script.

191
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,300
Brand new script can be empty.

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,640
It's called doors and doors.

193
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,010
It's perfect.

194
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,340
First we need is a variable called can click.

195
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,790
And it's going to default is false.

196
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,080
Now next thing I want to do is add in some signals.

197
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,210
So let's go to the door.

198
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,710
The area Judy gets the note and there's three signals we want body entered physics body body exited

199
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,300
physics body and on the collision shape input event.

200
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,730
Now this is going to detect when some sort of input is happening on the area.

201
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,210
And that's gonna allow us to check if someone's clicking on the door.

202
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,710
What's going to give a little bit of leeway.

203
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,560
Actually check if we click anyway here.

204
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,390
But I'm okay with that.

205
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,780
And the heat of the moment I think that's fine.

206
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:53,970
So body entered physics putting in a connect that to door Let's just do the other one body exited connect

207
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:03,190
to the door and finally let's go to input event and that connects the door as well.

208
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,440
OK.

209
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,030
So when we've entered here we need to check.

210
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,400
Are you the player so going to need some sort of if but what are we doing.

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,160
We've got this variable coming at this argument body.

212
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,190
Something is entered and if we take a look over done with the door and the collisions only two types

213
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,410
of things can answer players and pieces.

214
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,470
It will not detect anything else.

215
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,030
So we know anything that entering must be either player an NPC as a couple of ways we could do this.

216
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:41,350
We could say if body whatever the argument is has a property called name which is equal to player then

217
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,110
do a thing.

218
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,510
This is great as long as we don't rename the player the other way they do this and the one that I would

219
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,180
rather do is to use the collision layers if we mouse over the layer you see that the properties called

220
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,650
Collision layer and if we look at these values these are binary values.

221
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,880
So this is one this is two.

222
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,090
This is four.

223
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,350
So if I had this one and this one together that's three.

224
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,150
This one is four.

225
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,340
This is six.

226
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,660
OK.

227
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,190
So basic binary I only care about whatever this value is and that value is 1.

228
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:20,150
So what I can do is if say I can say if body dot collision layer is equal to one.

229
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,020
This is another way of saying if you're detecting the player please note if we haven't set up these

230
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,300
collision things properly we're going to start checking finding things like the door itself the static

231
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,690
body.

232
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,150
Right.

233
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,850
So this layer and these must must be done properly.

234
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,620
We have to make sure that we're not detecting things like tournaments but if everything set up correctly

235
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,240
this is going to save us a lot of time.

236
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:52,400
So if you're the player can click is now equal to true else open let's make a function called open for

237
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,220
any fella let's get rid of this thing go away fine.

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:07,110
Function open and this is just animation player dot play what are we playing with the animation open.

239
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,920
There we go all right.

240
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:17,090
So if something is entered it must be either player on NBC if it's on collision level one then you then

241
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,020
we can change that.

242
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,870
Otherwise just open it and that's going to detect and pieces for us.

243
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,180
OK.

244
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,500
So now if you just say if something has exited the body or we need to do is check if is the Plaza.

245
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,210
If body dot collision layer

246
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:44,400
is equal to one can click is equal to is now equal to False we'd only spot an Elson here because nothing's

247
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,810
going to happen on nails.

248
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:55,590
Finally let's take the mouse click and to do that I'm going to use if input is mouse button pressed

249
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,370
his button left which is a constant.

250
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,520
Great but I don't want it that's the text that it's being clicked on to check if we can click.

251
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,830
So speak and can click.

252
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,120
That's the same as saying and can click is true.

253
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,200
So I don't know something else if I can do both of those then open and that should be everything.

254
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:24,860
Let's test it and I want to go to night vision and walking out the door I can open the door wait for

255
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,870
it and the door will close.

256
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,440
Now did you notice that the door get close enough is over the wall.

257
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,380
I read on like that.

258
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,130
Let's fix that to fix that we're going to use something called z index.

259
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:47,590
So if I go to the door and we go to the sprite there it is the sprite has a z index or z index.

260
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,110
Imagine you're looking down at a piece of paper the top players have a higher number the bottom layers

261
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,110
have a lower number.

262
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,870
Someone set the z index here for one great but that doesn't help us because the entire tile map isn't

263
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,290
is one layer.

264
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,910
So let's fix the entire time that being one layer.

265
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,130
If I go to template layer and look at the template we need to be careful.

266
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:16,420
We could set the entire zone decks higher so let's say I set this to my save that and go about the level

267
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,740
the door will vanish.

268
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,520
It's actually still there but it's underneath it's not being drawn.

269
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,920
If I set it back down to 1 it's going to look fine let's just say that it's going to look fine but when

270
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,270
it opens it will walk you show it will still open like that.

271
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,750
Okay.

272
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,410
So what's the solution here.

273
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:40,210
Well back to template level keep the basic z index is 0 going to go to the tile map.

274
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,090
We're going to go and show the full screen here.

275
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:49,880
Click on the tile sheet and what I want to do is click on the wall section that's counters a single

276
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,910
tile as an altar tile got a selected tile and changed this selected tile for two.

277
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:02,570
Now in a press save and minimize this area and go back to the level I can move it and it's above the

278
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:09,460
floor but below the walls because the wall altar tile has a different z index to everything else.

279
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,430
Now when I look at it

280
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:20,720
I can run up to the door click on it wait for it and close it.

281
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,920
OK so now all that and we need to do is add some more doors.

282
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,140
OK.

283
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,740
There's a difference.

284
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,600
Let's see how this feels and play the game again nice and moody and a sick look.

285
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,960
The gods should make it through the door.

286
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,220
Except I happen to know that God won't make it through the door because I know that something wrong.

287
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,090
But let's just check it.

288
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,560
Come on God.

289
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,010
Three go.

290
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,340
Nope can't do it.

291
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,330
Why can't the god do it.

292
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,980
Because remember say be very careful.

293
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,660
Collision lines let's open God up TSM.

294
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,470
Take a look at the gods collisions.

295
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,960
So on the physics body the gods a player.

296
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,900
God is not a player.

297
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,180
The god is an NPC that God can interact with players and tile maps.

298
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,620
Now let's try that again.

299
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,660
So now the gods can already go to the doors already gone through really keen.

300
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,930
He likes this door.

301
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,490
Come on God.

302
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,340
You can do this still to

303
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,250
is he going.

304
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:27,470
Yeah.

305
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:27,980
Here it comes.

306
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,130
Come on you can do it God.

307
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,900
I believe in you.

308
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,920
You has guards can open doors doors close automatically.

309
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,940
There's still too many torches and in this mode we can fix that.

310
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,880
And next video.

311
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,500
Look at that.

312
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,370
That's looking awesome.

313
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,870
So in this video it looked at how to detect mouse clicks how to change the behavior of your door depending

314
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,230
on who's using it.

315
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,000
Changing audio sources an animation player and using a z index.

316
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,590
So excellent luck and I'll see you in the next video.
