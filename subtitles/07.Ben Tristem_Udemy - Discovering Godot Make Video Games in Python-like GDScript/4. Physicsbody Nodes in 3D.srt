1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,160
Welcome back lovely God.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,470
People in this video will get a look at physics body in 3-d.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,090
Our game is going to rely on physics every time a player moves the ball.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,630
The ball is going to be using godey's 3D physics engine.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,380
So we should get this right.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,650
And right now we're not off to the right stuff.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,550
We show you why.

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,960
When getting game and you know what we need to make a default scene.

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,500
So what do we put a special note as the root cause spatial as the default 3D node.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,440
And I want to call this game and just save this as my default scenes are in scenes I now have again

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,990
seen.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,740
And in this an instance in the pitch.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,700
So let's do that let's.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,920
Instance in the pitch.

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,890
And the scenes there's my pitch looking good.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,160
Alice is this in the ball as a child of game.

17
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:58,940
If we look at this the pitch is a mesh instance and the ball is a mesh instance.

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,460
When I press play when I want to alban's the ball should fall to the ground but it worked to demonstrate

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,510
that I knew the camera.

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,510
So let's go back into the game and create a camera.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,190
So we need a camera note not a camera 2D is in 3D now.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,070
And I'm going to move this over here.

23
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,470
You can see by the way I've got my gritz Snapping I think me a double check that off again.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,250
And I can use this preview and see what the camera can see not the angle on a stick with the game.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,230
The sword affinia.

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,220
Let's run this song now.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,880
You'll notice in the last video I accidentally set pitched my default scene isn't set right now.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Just your mind you have do that forget to project settings.

29
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,320
I got to run main scene is now blank.

30
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,810
Right.

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:48,310
So I blacked it by going here and just using the reset I can play this scene and use my game scene as

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,170
the default.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,910
The ball doesn't know why doesn't the ball move.

34
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,270
After all we have a mesh here and a mesh here.

35
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,150
I would expect objects and space to behave like they should behave and that's because the mesh is not

36
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,680
a physical object.

37
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,730
So why can't we use a mesh instance in a physics game.

38
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:14,590
Well a mesh instance is a type of geometry instance where it will look at the documentation it'll show

39
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,520
us there what that means is the measure.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,250
This tells me what the object looks like.

41
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,990
Not help behaves meshes on not a type of physics body.

42
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,640
And we want to use collision of physics.

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,730
So we need to be using a physics body not a mesh.

44
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,660
We do want a mesh because we want to see the object but we want the object to be able to behave.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:46,000
So what we need to do is I need to open up my pitch scheme and change this from a visible piece of geometry

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,920
that doesn't actually behave like an object.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,230
It has no collision.

48
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,630
It has no physics.

49
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,040
I need to change the root node to a physics node and I need to move ammash to be a child.

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,110
Okay well we know how to change a root note right we can just go change type and I can type N.

51
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,920
Static body or just pick that width.

52
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,640
Now the problem is all the information that's in that mesh is going to vanish.

53
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,200
It's now gone.

54
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,400
So I'm now going to quickly undo everything I just it's a change type meche instance and this is going

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,660
to get done very quickly.

56
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,140
Right.

57
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:32,570
And I have a 20 by 15 I believe size and the material you'll be using is the pitch material there it

58
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,280
is.

59
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,030
And I think that was about right.

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,630
I'm safer now.

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,430
If I want to keep redoing this right now this isn't too bad but if I have like a more complicated ammash

62
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,660
or forgot what the parameters are this is going to get irritating.

63
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,600
Well the next thing we could try is duplicating right we could duplicate this have another picture as

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,630
a child and then just change the route of a pitcher's root notes.

65
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,880
If I go to duplicate it I can't.

66
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,250
You can't have multiple root notes.

67
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,430
So have I just messed up and do we have to start again.

68
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,000
No.

69
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,510
There is something we can do.

70
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,370
First let's create a new mesh instance as a child of the pitch.

71
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,880
We have a back up to the Petsch and I'm going to use this screwdriver and spanner or screwdriver and

72
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,400
wrench depending on poverello you're in and I'm going to go.

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,950
Copy programs and a copy all of the parameters.

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,170
Then I'm going about this meche instance.

75
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,760
I press the icon again and paste all the parameters everything that was in pitch is now a mess meshes

76
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,950
that's now go back to the pitch and I change this to change it to a spatial for now.

77
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,380
It's now a spatial node that has a mesh inserts as a child.

78
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,770
Before we go any further let's double check what kind of node we actually wants to be.

79
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,330
I don't want it to actually be a special node I wanted to be physics body so let's remind ourselves

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,750
of the three types of physics bodying in God.

81
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,370
And we're now using physics body not physics body to deep because we're not into hoodie anymore.

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,280
First we have a static body a static body is a fixed object that isn't expected to move or wall a floor

83
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,610
a ceiling something that I could call lined with it has solidity.

84
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,700
It exists in the physical object in the physical space but I dont need it tomorrow.

85
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:20,020
Then we have a rigid body in a rigid body is an object that reacts to physics something that is moved

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,530
a door for example or a chair.

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,650
I don't expect it to move at itself.

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,930
Now I've put reacts in italics because that's the key word here.

89
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,050
It's something that physics is applied to rigid bodies have built in physics parameters right.

90
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,110
They have mass they have weight they have gravity.

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,540
They are they have gravity applied to them.

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,690
They have things like how bouncy they are.

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,210
But the point is they're not expected to move themselves right.

94
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,950
I shouldn't be using I shouldn't be using things like Translation.

95
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,710
X plus equals one on a rigid body.

96
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,690
It's supposed to cut its own movement.

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,550
Then we have a kinematic body.

98
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,290
This is an object that does move itself.

99
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:09,820
So a player would be a kinematic body an NPC that can move like the player does is a kinematic body

100
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,810
an NPC that is moved by something else is a rigid body.

101
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,530
By the way I'm saying there are three types of physics body lying.

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,330
There are four.

103
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,220
There's also a vehicle body which is a specialized rigid body that simulates car physics has things

104
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,580
like suspension.

105
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,800
It has things like dampening has all these really cool things but we're not looking at this.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,900
So for now three types of physics body looking at the three types of and leave the fit the vehicle body

107
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,280
on screen.

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,390
For now look at the three types.

109
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,910
I know that the pitch should be a static body because it shouldn't be moving.

110
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,670
It is something that things move on or against.

111
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:44,920
Yeah.

112
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,450
It is static.

113
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,340
So that's one it doesn't change the pitch change type.

114
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,420
To static body and rammer I don't want static body to D.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,870
You seem to confuse everything.

116
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,620
It'll immediately tell me you don't have a collision shape.

117
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,730
You have to have a collision shape.

118
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,220
Let's have a collision shape.

119
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,740
So one of the do is create a collision shape around this.

120
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,130
Now I don't have to do it this way I can actually auto generate them I can click on mashy instance and

121
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,570
right here this mesh button.

122
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,940
I can create a sibling exacerbate a sibling of this the college must be a child of the physics body

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,900
not of the mash so I could create a child's sibling.

124
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,110
However I reckon not doing this.

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,850
If you don't have to these are pretty simple shapes right.

126
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,910
A plane doesn't need an automatically generated shape but just to show you can create a tri mesh shape

127
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,540
and it's created a tri mash static body.

128
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:47,740
As a child of the misha's I don't want that from a leap that I want as simple a collision shape as possible

129
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,080
because the more complicated it is the more resources God has to spend trying to figure out when it's

130
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,830
being used.

131
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,570
So let's make a collision.

132
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,430
No collision shape.

133
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,580
Not galician shank to leap is back in shape.

134
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,230
And what's the shape it's going to be a box.

135
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,430
I could make a plane but I'm not making a box and I'm going to use the stance.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,420
To make it the right kind of size.

137
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,490
In fact I could just go into the accent and type in the size.

138
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,160
So the X looks like it's 10.

139
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:24,340
The While looks like zero point wonder looks good for now and the Z I'm guessing will be 5 No.

140
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,890
6.

141
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,020
KEEP GOING.

142
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,850
Seven point five.

143
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,900
Dead on.

144
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,550
What do you want to make sure of is if I look down here I want to make sure the clear shape is slightly

145
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,240
higher than something with it up.

146
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,350
A touch is at too far that is too far.

147
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,570
So it was moved back down back to transform and other translation.

148
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,240
That's how far you move on the various axes.

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm just going to give you to zero.

150
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,600
And that should be pretty good.

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,070
I get it.

152
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,880
So we now have a static body.

153
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,710
And if I go back up to the pitch you'll notice has friction and Bout's anything there that moves against

154
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,150
the pitch is a factor.

155
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,520
If you want to make your game crazy bouncy you can you could change this tomorrow.

156
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,170
Right now we've got no way of looking at that.

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,830
But that's okay.

158
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,310
I must save my pitch.

159
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,060
Now look at the pitch.

160
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,300
The pitch is now a static body.

161
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,270
The ball is still a mesh instance which brings me to the challenge.

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
I'd like you to convert the ball to a physics body.

163
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Pick the right kind of physics body for the ball.

164
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,140
Now your choices are a static body a rigid body and a kinematic body.

165
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,890
You really don't want to be making this a vehicle because you're not driving the ball.

166
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,990
So figure out which one you want and convert the route scene of the ball from the meche instance to

167
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,210
that type of physics body.

168
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,340
Pause the video when you're hanging with the solution.

169
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,950
Come back and Shane my solution.

170
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,080
And welcome back sir.

171
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,690
I'm going go into the diebel scene which is right here.

172
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,800
And I want to first before I do anything else copy my parameters.

173
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,370
Now I'm going to create a child that has a mesh to do.

174
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,060
There is a paste.

175
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,830
There's pragmatism.

176
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,300
And as it's going back up the ball and here's a moment of truth what I want this to be.

177
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,910
Well let's go look at the slides again.

178
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,820
We know it's not going to be a static body because I want this to move.

179
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,940
Now theoretically yes I can move a static body through code but I really shouldn't be doing that too

180
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,410
much.

181
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,840
It's not going to be a kinematic body because balls don't move themselves it's going to be a rigid body.

182
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,340
OK.

183
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,510
So let's make this a rigid body.

184
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,080
It's a change type.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,470
And rigid body.

186
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,660
Awesome.

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,580
I'm sure save that.

188
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:49,610
Now before we go any further I need to put a collision shape on this elisha's in this collision shape.

189
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:49,840
OK.

190
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,870
We need new leadership.

191
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,590
What do we want to generate a mesh for this one.

192
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,320
Not really.

193
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,180
Because this is a simple sphere.

194
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,560
Sphere is a type of collision shape.

195
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,890
So there we go it's a sphere.

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,780
Now all I need is to give it the same excellence as the measures.

197
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,510
Let's go to the missions and see where they are.

198
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,770
And click on the mash.

199
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,100
Got a radius of zero point two five at the height of point five.

200
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:17,350
Becky the collision shape quick on a sphere shape radius zero point five Nope zero point two five point

201
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,370
five is the circumference always confuses you.

202
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,980
Press save I shall see if this works.

203
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,590
Boom.

204
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,170
See ramp if anything touches the ball.

205
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,080
It will move.

206
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,320
Let's just make sure that's right.

207
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,170
Winner take the pitch until that angle slightly and as the Gloc.

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,630
See that ball pick up speed and off it goes.

209
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,650
Fantastic.

210
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,120
I don't want my picture that angle pickersgill be really unfair to those on this side of the pitch.

211
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,930
So let's move you back and undo that.

212
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,310
All right before we go any further I just want to make sure that my collision layer's meeting is set

213
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,350
up some collision.

214
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,510
And the project settings and I'm going to go down to 3D physics and here my layers as they lay I want

215
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,950
it's pitch layer two can be ball and layer three will probably play.

216
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,480
And now mimic the pitch.

217
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,950
Take the collision.

218
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,370
Now put it.

219
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,090
Michael agila it is a pitch and it's going to interact with balls and plays great.

220
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,930
Say that and it's a ball.

221
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,250
When do the same thing but with slightly different collision because you know obviously.

222
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,030
So let's go into the layers.

223
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,760
You are not a pitch you are a ball and you interact with the pitch and the players before we sign off.

224
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,780
Let's just look at some rules of thumb of how to use a rigid body rigid body nodes should not move themselves

225
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,710
so don't use translation or transformation or whatever.

226
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,920
Plus equals 1.

227
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,390
God will let you do this but this is inefficient right.

228
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,800
They have their own physics.

229
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,940
Instead of you need to move a rigid body directly.

230
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,160
You're going to apply and imposs this is a function with the inner rigid body that tells you okay you

231
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,760
are being move from this direction.

232
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:09,360
With this much force right rigid bodies don't act they react they are moved by things they don't actually

233
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,460
move themselves.

234
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,420
And that brings us to the end of this video.

235
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,770
In this video I had a refresher on these three four types of physics body.

236
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,320
We've looked at how you can pick the right type of physics body for the task.

237
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,570
We've looked at changing the root node of a scene without losing important parameters.

238
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,020
Right so if you got very excited and brought your first mission and then realized oh I can't use this

239
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,370
yet how can we copy and paste the parameters to a child node without losing all the detail.

240
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,530
Are off to a great start.

241
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,220
We're almost ready stuttering players.

242
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,510
So excellent work and see in the next video.
