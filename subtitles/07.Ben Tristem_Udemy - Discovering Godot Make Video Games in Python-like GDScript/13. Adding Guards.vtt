00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.280
Welcome back you wonderful God people in this video are going to add some guards to a level.

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.620
We're not going to get the guards moving yet.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.310
We're just going to get them ready tomorrow.

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.240
So what are we to do.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.910
We need to create an instance of the character seen extend play detection change the sprite and add

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.700
a torch.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.070
We also need to tweak the torching a little bit and show you why when we get there.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.630
So let's get to it.

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.260
First thing to do is go to scene you inherited scene.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.280
And I'm going to move to characters and it won't extend character.

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.470
So what are we extending from.

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.020
OK so here we have an unsafe scene so I know that this is the right one to be very sure let's call this

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.760
guard and say that this is now the guard scene.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.640
I'm going to hide the light occlusions like a seal I'm doing.

15
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.680
Let's change the Sprite So our Sprite is going to be under.

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.580
Graphics.

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.680
Angie.

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.910
Soldier one.

19
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790
And I'm just going to replace the Sprite with that one.

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:10.580
Great weather got one when they want to do is I want to incense in the torch which is the scenes torch.

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.920
There goes.

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.800
And I also want to remove the script right now using the character script.

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.050
We don't want the character script we want a brand new script called God.

24
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.890
So when I wrote that script and add a new one.

25
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.540
We're going to make sure we put this in our scripts folder.

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.260
It's going to be called Guard.

27
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.100
And it's going to inherit.

28
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.550
From player detection.

29
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.560
So play that action Harrison character.

30
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.500
And God inherits from play the techron.

31
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.380
That means God will have access to everything in character and everything in play.

32
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.430
The section which is great.

33
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.660
Okay.

34
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.930
So because I say that script for now we don't need to play with them.

35
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.980
What I need to do is make sure this is working.

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.340
Let's put a guard into our level just like we did with security cameras.

37
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.830
I'm going to put in a new note today.

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.610
Animals call us guards.

39
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.800
Let's instance one in

40
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.390
and immediately you could see why I need to tweak the torch.

41
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.710
And we had this problem already and we fixed it with the camera scene.

42
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.730
But what I did if I look at the camera seen I tweak the values in here.

43
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.360
So here's my texture offset.

44
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.160
And I scaled it down.

45
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.510
That was a mistake.

46
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.170
So mean to put this to scale back to one one and I'm going to reset this offset just like it was originally.

47
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.780
Now let's go into the torture scene and fix them.

48
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.140
Here is the texture Scout's point five.

49
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.840
Now it's half the size.

50
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.260
I'm not going to offset 340 and I'll set by half that.

51
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.870
And if I can't be bothered to do the maths I want to 340 divided by two and little figure out for me.

52
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.050
Aren't computers wonderful.

53
00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.440
I must save this or it won't work so save I will go back into the level all the cameras and all the

54
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.410
guards now work great this is rotate the guard and there we go.

55
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.560
We now have the beginning of the guard.

56
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.460
Get rid of that's weak as it were doing so well I would like you to do is go on a hiring spree.

57
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.850
But some dads in your level.

58
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.620
Now don't be afraid to redesign your level.

59
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.260
We have a proof of concept.

60
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's actually make something dramatic.

61
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.480
Do you want to make an office building do you want to make a military complex Do you want to make.

62
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.230
I don't know Candy research facility and maybe you're breaking in for the for the newest M and Ms flavour

63
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.650
are now making myself very hungry either way.

64
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.710
Pause the video puts some guards and your video.

65
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.970
No don't put your guards and your video.

66
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.160
Put your guns in the level I make in the video.

67
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.920
You'll make an A level.

68
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.330
OK we're clear on that.

69
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.830
Add some more cameras if you want.

70
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.150
Get something for mattick when you have you if you got unpause the video and then when you come back

71
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.760
I'll show you my version.

72
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.780
And welcome back.

73
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.840
So I'm not ecstatic with this layout because it feels what it feels like a random level so I mean I

74
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.300
go into my own walls and I'm going to.

75
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:29.230
OK.

76
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.020
So here's my quickly redone video that I sped the video out for so you didn't have to watch that.

77
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.460
For this bit of floor actually I'm not that I'm off this floor.

78
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.470
I've made a serendipities extra room and put my certainty plus extra room right here for all the serendipity

79
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.420
and give it a floor.

80
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.910
We just talk you through what I've got here.

81
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.390
So we're going to start over in this area this could be the reception room down here.

82
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.930
We're going to have some seating in someone's reception desk up here possibly an entrance and exit up

83
00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:57.620
here.

84
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.180
This area's going to a bathroom because reasons that's now a janitors closet my janitor's closet of

85
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.500
serendipity.

86
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.300
Over here we have a main office area.

87
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.370
This is going to be a secure office area SEO office vault and another server room thing.

88
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.780
Or maybe you put the see your office here and all the rest of it will be able to lure the player to

89
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.090
go from one end of the place to the other.

90
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.130
Remembering secret codes.

91
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.050
Great.

92
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.410
Let's now move cameras and guards.

93
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.480
So where's my guard.

94
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.510
There's my guard.

95
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.450
Let's move off first guard.

96
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.900
That's God's going to live over here.

97
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.770
No.

98
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.420
Actually make sure I'm on my guard not my God.

99
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.560
Note that we move you over here.

100
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.230
Duplicate you you live your own bathroom.

101
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.540
You're over here and it's moving down here.

102
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.720
And another guard move you two up here.

103
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.750
And I think maybe one more.

104
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:56.820
Fantastic.

105
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.960
Now there's going to be lots of furniture and doors and so on so we're going to really clutter this

106
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.530
up and give the player lots of little places to hide cameras.

107
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.760
OK.

108
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.780
Was this camera this camera is there.

109
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.750
Let's move this camera.

110
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.660
This camera is going to move to that pillar that looks like a good place.

111
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.350
What about this camera this camera.

112
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.170
It's actually pretty good where it is.

113
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.360
I like that camera there.

114
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:33.870
In fact I'm going to duplicate it and rotates and move this one up here one here and one there.

115
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.240
Let's make this nice and tense.

116
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.450
Could that camera you know I want to give the player a good starting area one where they won't be seen.

117
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.480
So let's call that this area here and then move this camera.

118
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.110
To over here.

119
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.020
Right by this door great player.

120
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.810
You're going to live over there.

121
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.600
Let's see how that feels.

122
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.750
Now we don't yet have any moving guards but we do have quite an atmospheric space so we hear that's

123
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.800
going to feel good.

124
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.950
Here's on the guard more applicable to the guard helo like the peller you're guarding.

125
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.590
And here's a guard looking for lonely at the place where the desk or arrive.

126
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.210
But I here are late this is a sad guard.

127
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.820
He is filled with sadness.

128
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.300
I will leave him so he doesn't feel insecure about the fact that I'm looking and feeling sad.

129
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.690
I'm sure if he wants my support he will ask me for it.

130
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.520
But meanwhile in this video we've looked at how to tweak a scene this instance elsewhere.

131
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.470
I made a mistake by changing one instance of the torch.

132
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.670
How do I reset that.

133
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.830
But then the torture scene and propagate the change everywhere.

134
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.860
And we've hired guards we're ready to get them moving.

135
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.870
So excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
