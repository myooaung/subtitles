00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,010
Hello lovely God people in this video were going to reset the game when a goal is scored so the goals

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,550
scored.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,560
The players in the ball to go back to the beginning.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,080
Otherwise whoever just scored a goal could keep scoring goals.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,910
So let's look at what has to happen when a goal is scored.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,780
I want to stop the ball and the players and their tracks or when to freeze time.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,190
I mean we're not actually freezing time.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,410
We're stopping everything from moving but it's gonna look the same.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,510
Why are we doing that.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,860
Because I want to give whoever just score time to celebrate and whoever didn't time to a few.

11
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,390
I mean no one actually fuming I want the feel good.

12
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:39,100
But you know when I see them I want to move the ball and the players back to the start positions and

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,090
allow them ultimately that's going to go.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,640
And before I even do that there's a small bug I want to fix.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,300
If you're under in the last video and I hope you don't.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,090
When we set up the collision for the gold I brought them right up to the edge here so I can actually

17
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,810
show you see the collision goes right up to the post.

18
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,710
I since discovered something.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,670
So I start the game going and do this.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:12,460
And when I gently get the ball over into the corner No I can't go into the corner and if I touch the

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,420
post it just happened.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,610
If I touch the post from the outside we're still scoring goals so let's go into all the goals I've seen

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,490
doesn't really matter.

24
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,330
Both the same one and all I need to do is just shrink the Golden Section down a bit so as to the collision

25
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:31,630
shape of the extant I said schrank I don't really mean trick and as turning to one point seventy five

26
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,970
there's no way the ball is going to get through that gap but it will have to get in through the actual

27
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,020
pillar.

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,000
We can also shrink it down a bit just in case it bounces on top of the net.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,790
It's an edge case but just in case.

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,380
Let's do that.

31
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,340
So let's shrink it down on the y axis.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,500
I'm going to say a point seven.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,420
Now let's move it down.

34
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,540
So point seven of a height.

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,160
I actually don't mean that do I at say a point five.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,640
Nice and low and so maybe a point six will compromise.

37
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,200
Great.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,840
And that will be a lot better.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,960
So what do we need to do.

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,130
Well when the goal is scored I want to freeze time for a bit so the first thing I need to do is at a

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,170
time out right.

42
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,420
Because for a bit is my key.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,250
What do we say 2 seconds when you feel like a decent amount of time later in the game going to add some

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,720
effects or work and put a sound effect make some lighting some particles happen so we can make it really

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:35,430
clear what just happened but for now let's just pause the game now first thing I do is I'm going to

46
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,460
stop the ball from moving.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,660
When it crosses the golf so let's go into the game script and right here on goal detection entered were

48
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,630
currently printing that somebody has scored.

49
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Let's also stop the ball moving.

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,570
Well first we need to get the ball on finding the ball.

51
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,140
Just go there in front of the ball.

52
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,000
I should probably figure out where I need it.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Do I just need it in this function.

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,500
Well no because this isn't just going to happen when the goal is scored right when the goal detection

55
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,120
body is entered.

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,450
We also need to know where the ball is when we move it and when we free it.

57
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:16,850
So this is probably going to be right at the top here so unready variable ball equals and in a capital

58
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,470
B because the ball is a..

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,560
And only to get only to find that I don't.

60
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:31,160
So that's a get tree get root and then I need find no ball.

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,900
Now I need more than that.

62
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,630
Let's go larger because there's these two extra arguments.

63
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,640
I want recursive and I dont want it so recursive go through hoops Robert and then go through all of

64
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,850
the subbranches at the scene.

65
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,170
True and false.

66
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,830
It doesn't have to be owned by the current note.

67
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,390
It will be on by the current note so I don't know one put it false there but it's going to have to get

68
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,680
into it.

69
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,600
I mean true or false.

70
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,430
So we can now get the ball.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,230
So what needs to happen.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,150
Well first where say you scored.

73
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,340
And actually before we say we scored let's actually freeze the ball so all.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,260
Dart Alright what do we need to happen.

75
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,080
Well we can freeze the ball quite easily.

76
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,320
Now no it's not actually moving itself it's reacting.

77
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,400
But if we look down here to access lock that's what you want.

78
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,200
I can lock the x y and z.

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,530
What this will mean.

80
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,210
In fact I can show you in a start the game with these locked.

81
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,940
Loops and or comment out this piece of code let's try that again.

82
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,830
The ball has been told you're not allowed to move in the axes I've locked.

83
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,050
So while physics is still working it's been told Okay you're now locked in these and this axis and I've

84
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,360
lost all three axes so the ball is immobile and just like most other things.

85
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,800
Probably all other things.

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,820
If it's an inspector I can reach it in script so ball.

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,150
OK so what do we need to find.

88
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,450
Well this mouse over a linear x.

89
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,230
I don't need to worry about angular because I don't care if it rotates.

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,330
I just want it to not actually move.

91
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,970
Right so what's linear X is mouseover that and its axis underscore lock on a scale linear underscore

92
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,960
X Brecht

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,050
axis on a scale lock on the scale linear underscore X equals true and duplicate duplicate twice and

94
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,050
Y and Z.

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,090
So when the ball enters the goal stop moving.

96
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,070
Let's see if that works out.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,100
Nice run up and it as I as they can and it stops immediately which also stops it from bouncing against

98
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,720
the back wall and scoring again.

99
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,770
That's the real reason I want to do this right.

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,260
It should now not be possible to keep scoring awesome.

101
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,380
Well now let's do the same with the players.

102
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,850
Let's stop the players from having to do this.

103
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,880
I mean at a boolean into the place.

104
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,380
Go into the poleon know into the player script.

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm not going to the billion.

106
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,300
That's nonsense and I need a new variable and this variable is going to be called can move.

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I set the default to true.

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,550
And over here in physics process I am going to add a condition if I can move.

109
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,290
And I'm going to put movin there if he can move.

110
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,280
Move.

111
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,580
Awesome.

112
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,010
So how are we going to get there.

113
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,130
Well let's do a group call because we have the player let's put those players in a group.

114
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,990
So I'm just going to it's probably easier rather than doing this to both players individually let's

115
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,010
just go into the play a scene and add all instances of place the group because we want all players to

116
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,790
be part of the play A group.

117
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,210
Great thing to say that for that change to stick.

118
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,310
And now all players should be part of the playgroup.

119
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,450
OK.

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,870
Let's get into this.

121
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,920
The game script.

122
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,360
So get Tre dot.

123
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,890
And well to call the group call group.

124
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,080
It is called the great player.

125
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,190
And what are we.

126
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay now here we're going to do it and make a method called can move right which you will recognize

127
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:07,200
as the actual variable and we can't change the variable as a group Corbel we can do is pass a value

128
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,970
in.

129
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,470
So I'm gonna make a method called Can group and parse in a value.

130
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,100
So let's do that as go function can move value.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,010
And all this is going to do is say can move the variable.

132
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,700
Is this value whatever that value is.

133
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,060
So let's see how that works.

134
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,810
Now summarize my animation is still playing let's take a look at that and the simplest way I can do

135
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,140
this is to change when an inmate is being called to one to do here.

136
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,650
If can move which can move an inmate into canvas.

137
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,890
If you can move an image.

138
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,020
If you can't ducked and that means that the animation will stop the moment it comes to the end of its

139
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,410
cycle.

140
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,440
So here we go and they stop and instantly they stop and again with not something instantly.

141
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,820
I think it is slowing down.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,930
It's good.

143
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,710
Alright so we've stopped the players now.

144
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,690
We need to actually use this timer so back into my game.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,940
Let's start the timer so timer start start alright that time is going to start and we're going to connect

146
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,210
it as a signal or connect it signal rather it's time out back into the game.

147
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,630
The game is going to decide whether we can go again.

148
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:34,370
So now I want to do is figure out what's going to happen and then make a new function called Reset pitch.

149
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,370
Alright so going to reset the pitch to do that Ops there shouldn't be a colon there to do.

150
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,970
That's what I want to do is create start positions for all these.

151
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,170
So let's make some suppositions and I'm going to put them in their own little note folder so as to make

152
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,080
a new little node folder.

153
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,260
There's a little note and mikkel this start positions

154
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,640
within which I make 3 position loads just like position 2 D.

155
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,250
But the position these because they're in three dimensions.

156
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:14,520
And let's first move it's the right place so this one can be for the ball and put this right up here.

157
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,170
Ball spawn.

158
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,840
And now I make em go and duplicate that and move it over to here.

159
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,490
I could probably pick a nice grid reference for it's a minus 3 2.

160
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,170
And that's got to be play once born.

161
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,040
You could also call it player 1 Start.

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,290
I'm calling a player once born because I don't know why.

163
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,790
Reasons to up and as player to.

164
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,320
Lots of hoops to there and you start there.

165
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,310
Now I've said this in the centre of where the pitch is not the centre where the texture is and that's

166
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,660
not going to look right so much is going to move that very slightly.

167
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,690
If you know what let's move all three in the same mounts I'm going to select all them and just drag

168
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,940
it so that the down arrow.

169
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,200
That sporty pointy thing is going to be right above there and that looks get great analysis use those

170
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,250
make a new function called the reset pitch.

171
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm going to call it on Ready set reset pitch.

172
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,150
I get what's going to happen every time the pitches reset.

173
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,690
Well the first thing I want to do is spawn where they go.

174
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,220
Right so let's make a function.

175
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,180
Reset pitch.

176
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,400
Okay.

177
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,880
First they reset pitch is going to do is it's going to move the ball to its spot like we need to get

178
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,600
the spawn point so variable Paul.

179
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,510
Storm Eagles.

180
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,070
And I'm just going to do this.

181
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,650
I'm fine no thanks.

182
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,510
Nice guy nice and big so I can go running.

183
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,220
Copy this get Tre get root find no business and change what Baller's chords or what's it called.

184
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,510
It's called Ball spohn

185
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,130
or spon.

186
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,640
Great.

187
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,970
So we now have that.

188
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,680
We really got the ball so now we need to move the ball to the spawn points.

189
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,620
Let's do that ball dot.

190
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,770
Translation.

191
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,220
So it's X Y and Z information.

192
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,080
Where are you.

193
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,890
Eagles ball spawn.

194
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,300
Translation.

195
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,560
Awesome.

196
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,460
So when this is called The ball will go back there.

197
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,920
Let's make sure we're actually calling it's a reset pitch.

198
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,180
Yeah.

199
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,690
Okay.

200
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,600
Now the players won't be able to move still.

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,180
Wrong.

202
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:34,770
What's wrong.

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,260
Not found balls.

204
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,130
Mom it's here.

205
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,340
I hear it.

206
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,180
See the different name up there.

207
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
Okay let's give the same name.

208
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,550
Let's.

209
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:54,780
OK.

210
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,280
So in a move that when have one too.

211
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,690
And there it goes.

212
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,630
I get the ball has moved.

213
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,360
Now I still can't have the players but it's okay now when I do the same thing for the players.

214
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,400
Now what I want to do here is not put this in the games.

215
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,650
The players are responsible for getting that position.

216
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,010
The ball isn't because currently the ball doesn't have a script.

217
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:20,040
So I'm going to do it and make a new function within each player called Reset.

218
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,780
So let's call that and I've just broken that.

219
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,600
So get tree call group.

220
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,250
He's already got the players in the groups let's use that player recept.

221
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,790
OK let's go back to a cube root script and let's make a reset and win a court.

222
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,820
Use this above move because it feels like an important thing to know right.

223
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,570
Getting so function resets OK one needs to happen.

224
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,570
The first thing needs to happen is we need to get the correct position that each player has its own

225
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,670
spawn point right.

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,990
And I want player 1 to go to the player once born to do that.

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm going to use the same can captivating trick that we used earlier.

228
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,160
So first let's get our sport point vare my spawn

229
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,110
which sounds like I'm a frog but that's okay.

230
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:21,280
I can be a frog my spawn equals and let's find it so get tree.

231
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:29,660
Get roots going to the Stones get the tree get the top of the tree and then find a note.

232
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:40,330
And that node is going to be called Player mikan cat and eating this in so many use percentage s spawn.

233
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,940
Kaplan There pretty sure I did I did.

234
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,040
Now I need to put this in a second bracket like so.

235
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,490
And what I can guarantee it will keep getting into in the play Friday.

236
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,610
It's another space there make nice legible and then Uncle billions.

237
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,430
So that's a yes recursive.

238
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,020
No it's not owned by me.

239
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,830
OK so we've found the sport.

240
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,190
Now what do we do with it now.

241
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,090
Where to tell it moved to this position.

242
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,230
So what I'm doing is I'm going to say.

243
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:19,850
Translation so my translation where I am at right now on the x y z equals my sporn Dot.

244
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,480
Translation.

245
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,760
So that should mean both players after the time has run out.

246
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,310
Which I think currently 2 seconds should do.

247
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,870
If I can ask you about play my own game.

248
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:42,460
See I was good at sports school either and I get it runs frozen and Iran's back position now back position.

249
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,120
But they can't move and that is my challenge for you.

250
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,410
I'd like you to game on.

251
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,690
Let the ball and the players know that they can move again once the pitchers reset.

252
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,600
Possibly to give that a shot and when you come back I'll show you my solution.

253
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,850
And welcome back.

254
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,550
All right.

255
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,680
Well we start with the ball.

256
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,850
So many go in to the games script.

257
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:15,120
And as reset pitch I'm going to add is extra of mission or I'm really going to do is copy this.

258
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:24,010
And paste it here and you could change all three of these truths to false.

259
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,730
So what am I doing.

260
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,140
I'm selling.

261
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,600
Okay.

262
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,030
Whenever the pitches reset make sure that your x y and z axes are not locked.

263
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,790
So you are allowed to move in all three directions.

264
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,710
And that should be enough of the ball.

265
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,880
Now what about the players.

266
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,900
Well the players need to be told you're allowed to move.

267
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,790
I'm already tying them reset so I can put this in the reset function so let's do that.

268
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:50,190
Let's go into reset and I'm going I can move and we have a function called can right.

269
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,430
I'm going to use that can move true.

270
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
I've already got this function.

271
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,680
I may as well use it.

272
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,410
Let's see how that works.

273
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:08,180
So let's just have a nice run up weighing one two and look at that.

274
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,910
Now one thing I have done wrong is I've allowed this to keep looping which does make for an interesting

275
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,270
game.

276
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,830
Can I kick a score before it gets there.

277
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,690
No it can't know what I want to do.

278
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,310
So to fix that I just need to go into my timer and make it a one shot.

279
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,380
Dunno I didn't think of that before but apparently I didn't.

280
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,260
So now let's play and everything should work exactly as intended.

281
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,730
Excellent.

282
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,470
Now I could play with a bounce I can make you know all the little tweaks I want but we now have a system

283
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,660
whereby I'm not gonna score multiple goals and I can have a nice dramatic moment of this plus scored

284
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,840
which were going to do in later video and that brings us to the end of this video in this video we have

285
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,120
looked at how to use Access LOC and how to move players to the right position nodes like in cats and

286
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,350
ating in the string.

287
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,820
Right so we're using the fact that God is string referencing to our advantage.

288
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,030
So excellent work and I'll see you the next video.
