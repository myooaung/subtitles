00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,670
Hello again, you wonderful go to people.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,770
And welcome to this new section, Food Fight, which is gonna be our more advanced 3D game.

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,770
In this video, we're going to plan food fight.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,530
I must show you a quick example of the kind of thing we can make by the intersection.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,880
That's from the previous version of this course.

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,360
So there will be some changes happening to talk about our sint experience.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,110
Let's start with our essential experience whenever making a game, as you know by now.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,050
That's wrong to start with.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,540
So I'm thinking that I want a fast, frantic game about throwing food.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,640
What about while avoiding being hit by more food?

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,230
Primarily, I wanted to make something with the kind of feel of a third person shooter.

12
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,710
But I don't really feel like I'm in a shooting.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,360
People in the head with guns kind of a place.

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,150
I'm kind of over that whole gameplay mechanic.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,220
So what are keywords here?

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,690
Well, we have fast, frantic, cheerful, throwing food and avoiding being hit.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,580
Which gives us this little shot here.

18
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,780
I also want to add in some some basic character customization players.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,320
We will pick between two different measures, two different characters, and select a color scheme top

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,220
to and select color scheme to really make it theirs.

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,440
So let me show you the kind of thing what to make.

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,600
So just jump in here.

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,540
I'm going to begin.

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,940
I'm going to pick Frey and let's not pick a random color scheme that will jump in.

25
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,560
And here we are in food fight.

26
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,790
We have these lovely little robots trying to kill me, shooting food at me.

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,620
And I have to hit the robots three times each to get rid of them, which is surprisingly hard to do.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,240
That's being hit myself.

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,820
I have one life left and I'm down.

30
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,870
So quite difficult.

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,890
I did manage to hit one, but you can see here we've got a lot of cheerfulness happening.

32
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,090
I demand a rematch.

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,350
We'll try it one more time.

34
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,790
This is what we're making.

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,040
So take a look at what you see on the screen.

36
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:57,670
We have these fun flying, almost shooting gallery pedestrian's going on here.

37
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:01,400
We have these very simple robots throwing randomise 3-D food at us.

38
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,310
We have this piece of furniture that fly around the room and quite a fun little 3-D space.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,620
So looking forward to getting started.

40
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,100
And I'll see you in the next video.
