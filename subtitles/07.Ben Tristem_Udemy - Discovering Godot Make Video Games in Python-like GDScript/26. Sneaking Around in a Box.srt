00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,780
Hello again you superb go to people in this video we're going to add some key gameplay to our eyes my.

2
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,910
We've already got an end in condition right.

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,320
The player can lose.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,710
So if the guard spots you for too long you can get seen.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,490
But what would a stealth game be without the ability to hide in a box as we all know hiding in a box

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,860
makes you completely invisible.

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,150
Which is why you can't see the 17 pictures of cats in this slide.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,040
They're all in boxes.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,890
And before we do that let's remind ourselves how stealth works in heist meisters.

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:45,320
We've got the NPC checking if the play is in line of sight in field of view and in range.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,240
Is there a clear line of sight to see you.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,630
Are you within where my eyes would be.

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,320
Are you close enough NPC is know what they're looking at the player because they're checking the player

14
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:01,540
collision left if something is on collision allow one to play a collision later and it's in that field

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,930
of view that line of sight and in that range the NPC will see it.

16
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,520
So that means what if we move the player to a new collision lair.

17
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:15,410
If we tell Gordo when we're in the box we're in a different collision layer.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,950
None of the detectable will work and we'll be invisible.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,980
So that's what we'll do.

20
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,900
First thing I do is I'm going to get back into Gordo and we'll be playing with a player scene.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,140
So let's open that up.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,980
He's replacing and here's my player Hello player.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,830
And you know what.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,980
Let's I'm not the script.

25
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,390
Actually before we open up the script was about to leave you.

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,660
Just quickly show you on the graphics under PMG on the tiles.

27
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,730
We've got down here some boxes.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,010
I'm thinking to use 130 lessons small if drag that in about the same size of the player.

29
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:48,640
You don't have to.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,900
You could use the big one.

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,660
You could use that one.

32
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,940
I could be using 130.

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,350
That's gonna be my disguises box.

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,340
So let's put in some new variables and then make these instance variables they can exist at the top

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,380
of this pile of script.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Let's call this player sprite and I'm going to drag in the player sprite.

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,020
So that's going to be over here.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,160
MAN 1 drag you in.

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,920
Why am I doing this.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,620
Because when it should be changing the appearance of the player.

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:16,860
Right.

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,150
So when we press the hide button This sprite which is right here is going to change.

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,600
We also need it to change back.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,010
So it stole both of those so variable was its box sprite.

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,370
Yes.

46
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,140
Box right.

47
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,490
Equals.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,650
And I would write these in now.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,900
Each spring these variables.

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,080
But as a current me this doesn't change at runtime so you know what let's make these constants and as

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,490
they're constants let's make those capitals just so we can see the Capitals when we write the code.

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,330
So let's play a Sprite and there's box sprite.

53
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,430
Awesome.

54
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,370
Next up let's add a key on abusing E.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,550
So your project settings project settings.

56
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,840
There it is input map and what we've got we've got toggle vision mode.

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's call this toggle disguises toggle disguise and I'm just gonna put in he e you can use whatever

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,940
key is best for you.

59
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm on a British quasi keyboards a W as a D movement visual space e is toggle disguised.

60
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,880
Okay so we now have that.

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
We need that to works under input.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,250
Let's put this in now.

63
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,860
I'm going to put this as an F as she is.

64
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,280
Give us some space.

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,420
There we go.

66
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm gonna put this is an F not an else or an F because it's quite possible that we're gonna disguise

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,520
ourselves and toggle vision but at the same time.

68
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,340
So let's go if input dot is action.

69
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,060
Just like above just pressed.

70
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,430
Fantastic.

71
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,700
And I want to toggle disguise.

72
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,650
There you go.

73
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,100
Boop.

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,700
OK.

75
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,840
So what's gonna happen is that we are going to toggle disguise.

76
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,440
Yeah.

77
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,580
This guy's gonna be a branding function.

78
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,600
Let's make a brand new function called toggle.

79
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,620
This is if we don't put that got a plane is everything good.

80
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,400
Let's find out.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,220
Magic magic magic everything is shiny.

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,550
OK.

83
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:21,650
We need to toggle the skies which means we need to be tracking all we disguise and that's another instance

84
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,370
variable.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,570
This one is a variable not a constant.

86
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,800
Let's call that variable disguise.

87
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,410
I'm going to start not the skies.

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,030
So that's false.

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,110
All that back down.

90
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,570
And this has been this very simple for ourselves.

91
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:42,730
If we disguised that we're going to reveal all else we're going to disguise.

92
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,940
So what does the button do.

93
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,410
It depends are you disguise.

94
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,760
If so reveal yourself if you're already revealed disguise yourself that way you can use the same button

95
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,130
to switch back and forth.

96
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,370
Let's just put those functions inside function reveal and function.

97
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,970
Disguise

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,610
that space that would make this nice and consistent.

99
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:06,960
Okay.

100
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,960
It's looking pretty shiny.

101
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:08,680
Okay.

102
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,830
So what is revealed it will reveal is going to set off sprite back.

103
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,380
So I'm gonna call the sprite which is a child so it's going to use the dollar sign.

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,380
Same as getting old remember and was the property we want.

105
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,400
Well let's take a look.

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,560
Mouse over it it's texture great so texture equals.

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,990
Now I can't just use play a sprite because player sprite is a string.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
We need to load in a file.

109
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,120
So we need to use load.

110
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,210
What we're really doing is is changing the nature is horrible we're costing the variable.

111
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,200
But this load player sprite.

112
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:50,700
And we need to remember that disguise is now false.

113
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,820
If you're revealing yourself you'll no longer disguised.

114
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,290
Great.

115
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,530
So now let's just do the same thing here.

116
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,910
But with a different box so sprite stopped.

117
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:08,220
Texture equals load box Sprite and disguised equals true.

118
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,880
Okay so I run the game now.

119
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,860
What we gonna get is the ability to press E and switch between the play at a box.

120
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,260
Now at the moment this isn't actually the skies right.

121
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:31,300
Let's open this 0 9 1 9 2 fantastical 9 1 9 2 guys and see I am disguise but I can still be seen.

122
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,360
Right.

123
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,840
So let's make that luck.

124
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,370
Now if we look over in the collision less back and player looking Inspector you can see that the mosque

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,090
is what it can be interfering with is fine.

126
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,760
We still want the box we able to bump into scenery to be able to interact with computers and doors but

127
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,730
the player is on volume 1.

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:00,090
We know if I just open this that one is players two is tile map.

129
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,520
This next one which is 4 is in pieces.

130
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,720
This one is computers.

131
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,430
So the one we've got free is left five.

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,850
So if I just take a look at one side that's computers that is value sixteen so we're gonna toggle 16

133
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,020
on.

134
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,040
So let's mouse over what it is and we can just use the property collision layer.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
Well great let's do that.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,900
So I'm going to go back into my reveal.

137
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:33,310
Now when your player collision layer equals one when you disguise the next free one is 16.

138
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,210
So collision layer equals 16.

139
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,800
So what should happen now.

140
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,470
And I press play

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,480
Let's do the deal first.

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:52,140
I always forget that 3 2 9 9 3 2 9 9 3 2 9 9 Debbie Bobbi Booth.

143
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:00,890
Okay I'm visible I am disguised I am disguised as a little hard to see myself here is that I am disguised

144
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,240
but my shadow is wrong I can't to fix the shadow so that's what we'll do now we're going to change the

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,220
occlusion lap now this is gonna be part of a challenge to you but before we get into that let's remind

146
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,940
ourselves what's happening.

147
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:18,110
We have here and a clue to write what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up the template character which

148
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,120
is the one that the play is inheriting from and it doesn't like to clutter and honest down our arms

149
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:34,080
for safe characters I'm going to save this as human a clearer break so there's I on you included.

150
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,880
So we now have a file where we can come back to.

151
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:45,420
So here's my challenge for you I would like you to change the players occlusion shape to Max match the

152
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,980
shape of the box when disguised now as a few steps and this is a little bit challenging but give it

153
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,960
a shot for extra credit have it change back when the player stops being disguised as actually a little

154
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,720
bit easier but give it a shot so we can do.

155
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,610
Don't worry too much you get lost we can always come back to it but pause the video and when you come

156
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,660
back I'll show you my solution

157
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,540
Welcome back.

158
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,530
OK.

159
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,300
That's the need to do is I need a box to work with now I'm using tile one thirty so got a Sprite and

160
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,510
just drag that in boop OK and we can only see that the occlusion is wrong let's go here and I'm going

161
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:27,060
to clear this occlusion so it is no longer using what is inheriting I'm like a brand new one and this

162
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,470
only the shape of this box while it's okay I'm make sure on grid mode so on SNAP mode and I'll make

163
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,470
sure I see the grid and that's a little bit out of sequence and it is a little bit too big now I know

164
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,700
that these tiles are all in multiples of eight that did you by 32 or 64 by 64 so in grid settings right

165
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,710
here I'm going to go configure snap so these three little dots here they can figure snap and I will

166
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,270
make this an eight by eight grid new eight by e eight not eight by 256 that's very different and that's

167
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,160
lining up now it's going right up to the blurry edge but that's fine that's why I wanted to be and now

168
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,800
I could just add these beep beep beep beep boop that's why included I'm a save that

169
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,730
as books include A

170
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,810
OK let's reload the human one so that's going to be characters human occluded.

171
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,980
And let's bring that human sprite back in so before any further let's take a look what the properties

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,070
called when a mouse over clear.

173
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,650
It's called a cluster.

174
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
Nice and easy.

175
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,870
So what I can do when I change the sprite to be the player sprite.

176
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,900
As you note before we do that let's actually bring these in as constants.

177
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:50,060
So constant player clutter is equal to I don't mean distraction.

178
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,530
Freeman It's hoped for this toy.

179
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,560
Let's go back to my to do characters.

180
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,480
And here we go human include a loop drag that in Nice and easy.

181
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,520
And same thing here.

182
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,150
Box or clutter equals and just drag and drop that.

183
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,900
Awesome.

184
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,420
We're now ready to go.

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,980
So now let's bring those in.

186
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,600
So back into structure free mode in reveal insulin here.

187
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:30,190
Tom I liked to D include a I like to put a 2D rather dot floater is equal to load player of CUDA and

188
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,920
down here when we change our sprite to the box sprite let's also change all white include a dot a cluster

189
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,840
equals load

190
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,830
box cleaner OK let's see if that works

191
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:51,750
OK.

192
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,240
Let's not forget the computer this time.

193
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,710
So 2 7 8 3 fantastic 2 7 8 3.

194
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,270
OK.

195
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Here we go.

196
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,990
So people shaped box shape.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,870
Look at that.

198
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,540
Now what we could also do is we get that a light source inside the included to make the play glow.

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,730
But I think that's a challenge for different video.

200
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,320
I am really happy with that.

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,760
I now have a little box we can sneak around and we will in the next video make it so you can always

202
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,200
see the player or the player box when they're on screen so we don't have this black on black on black

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,400
but I'm really happy with that and that feels like a really good place to end the video.

204
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,540
So excellent work and I will see when the next one.
