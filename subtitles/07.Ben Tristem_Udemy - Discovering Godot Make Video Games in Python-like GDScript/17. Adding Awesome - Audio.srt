1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,910
Elegant alive for God.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,940
People in this video were going to continue adding awesome and we're adding awesome audio because alliteration

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,400
is fun.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,330
I will add some critical feedback.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,770
This is the kind of thing that can really make a difference in a game.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,630
The player should know that certain things are happening without even being aware that they're being

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,790
informed about them.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,380
So what kind of feedback do we want to put as audia.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,010
And by the way I want thing audio feedback.

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,990
I don't mean that irritating thing we put a microphone a guitar too close to a speaker.

11
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,100
I'm talking about things like when the ball is kicked the player should know that they've made contact

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,770
should be immediately apparent.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,270
So I want a sound effect to play when the ball is kicked and I've got just the sound for it and I want

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,980
a sound effect.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,610
When a goal is scored I know we're freezing the game but we should tell them why the game is for us

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:45,960
the snus.

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:46,930
This isn't a bug.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,100
Something important has happened and I have to adjust the sound for it.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,460
I also have some pretty awesome background music.

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,050
Quick note.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,140
You don't have to use any of these sounds you can find your own sounds or if you decide that your game

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,360
is best played in silence.

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,610
That's cool too but let's add some critical feedback as audio and I'm going to put random pauses in

24
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,360
the sentence because I dont know why.

25
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,380
OK let's get back to normal.

26
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,030
So here we are in game you've noticed by the way I think I accidentally put my camera too high.

27
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,940
I quite like it here.

28
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,690
Keep it for a bit.

29
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,120
I can always adjust it later but that's not all we're doing to that we're doing audio.

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,410
Let's start with background music was a good place to start new scene and make audio stream player and

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,570
in sound effect you'll see there are these three ounces Elkhorn that's gonna happen the gold place because

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,410
reasons.

33
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,420
There's frog Block 0 3 that I found link you to where I found it in the beginning of this section as

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,910
a nice link to it.

35
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,210
I have no idea what a frog lock is but it sounds awesome it sounds like this.

36
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:41,790
Why is that awesome.

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,560
Well our whole game has this little toy box aesthetic and these characters look where they're made of

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,670
wood and the ball looks like it's made of wood so let's have the sound effect of wood and it doesn't

39
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,310
actually sound like wood but it doesn't get.

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,100
And then we've got this lovely piece of music and I really like this piece of music.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,510
Isn't that great.

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,590
Now a quick note.

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,770
When you bring in audio make sure you know when you want it looping and when you don't.

44
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,530
So let's go over to the airport.

45
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,130
I've already done these.

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,710
The sound is an old g.g..

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,580
Oh g.g. is a great pick when you doing music because it compresses quite highly which means you have

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,440
long pieces of music without taking a lot of disk space or memory space.

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,440
However I can take a while to load in.

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,860
So it's great for things like this.

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,720
It's actually not great for sound effects but we have what we have where it is better for sound effects.

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,600
It doesn't compress as well but loads very quickly.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,740
The reason is the more it's compressed the longer it's going to take to decompress.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,720
So here we have our Domino pizza.

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,380
Catch me or Catch Me If You Can.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,290
What the track is actually called and I must have said it to auto play so this is set to looping this

57
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,980
piece of music.

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,440
Why.

59
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,120
Because it actually loops.

60
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,160
I happen to know this piece of music loops perfectly.

61
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,270
When it gets the end she's can start over and the player shouldn't hear the difference.

62
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,780
However the frog block is set not to loop.

63
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,510
Now if you need to change anything remember you have to press reimport just clicking the box on its

64
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,850
own won't change it and the air horn definitely won't loop because that's going to get annoying very

65
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,680
very quickly.

66
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,670
Or does the sound like.

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
It sounds like.

68
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,670
Remake's.

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,180
Sorry.

70
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,620
OK let's put the song in.

71
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,910
And it's being set to auto play now going to rename all your string player to music or background music

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,390
quality music much but name and a save that's seen as music.

73
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,320
And just like we didn't hide my says I'm going to autolog there seems to be a singleton so auto load

74
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,400
the scene for music an add it as a singleton and there it is.

75
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,340
Why am I doing this.

76
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,510
Because otherwise the music's going to restart every time the level is reloaded and I don't want that

77
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,800
at the level to be continuous.

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,730
This is one ongoing experience.

79
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,870
We all want to start again.

80
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,880
So to say that now let's take a look.

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,900
I wasn't having my goals scored for this one.

82
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,900
I don't want positional audio just like I didn't want positional audio with the music player mean is

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,450
an audio stream player so in-game and I make an audio string player.

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,850
There it is not 2D.

85
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,440
Not 3D because this isn't positional and I want to call this air horn.

86
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,370
And let's put the airhole sound in and listen to it just because isn't that awesome.

87
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,590
Now if you want to mess with volume and so forth you could do that right here in volume dbe for now

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,750
I'm going to leave this.

89
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,250
But if we want to change it we can tweak these settings when I edit this video because just because

90
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,870
it sounds good in-game doesn't mean it sounds good.

91
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,280
Try to explain stuff over the top of it so what you're hearing isn't actually what I'm hearing.

92
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,890
All right so when is this going to happen.

93
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,790
Well when a goal is scored and we already measure what to call a score so let's go into our game.

94
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,220
Where is a gold body.

95
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,650
Great.

96
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,360
There it is.

97
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,510
So under time a star can do air horn which what we called at play.

98
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,480
Now I'm not sure how long the air horn sound is but it is theoretically possible that these two will

99
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,560
play back to back out so we should add some sort of protection.

100
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,340
Let's do that.

101
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:14,240
Say if air horn got is playing and we don't want that so let's say.

102
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,630
If not air horn is playing so if not air horn is playing air play.

103
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,180
So if there is an already of sound playing play this out I see how that sounds.

104
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,790
And I'm just discovering a way to the people right now.

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,230
Can I first restart back in again.

106
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,180
Fantastic.

107
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,470
All right.

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,790
One more thing I want to do I want the sound effect from block to happen when the ball is kicked.

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,070
OK.

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,800
So first thing we do is we go into the bowl scene.

111
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
Give us a script.

112
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,640
That's the script.

113
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,740
I want to give it a script we're meant to do anything to put that in scripts and call it bulldog.

114
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:03,390
Now before we go into this we do actually need to check some sex before I give you the challenge.

115
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,700
There's one more thing I need to do look down here by these contacts right so I've got continuous C.D

116
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,480
continue Cedi is continuous collision detection.

117
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,660
We've also got contacts reported and contact monitor contact monitor monitor the contact and how many

118
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,800
contacts we monitor right now.

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,510
This is at zero.

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,320
So it's actually not going to check if it's touching things it's not going to report back to the script.

121
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,420
Let's change that to one you could change the two if you like without these.

122
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,040
The challenge is about to come up is going to be a little bit tricky about that challenge.

123
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,330
I'd like you to play this out.

124
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,820
I want you to play the the right sound so whatever sound you've picked uses from block whatever block

125
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,030
is.

126
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,880
But now I'm picturing a frog made of wood.

127
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,410
I want that play when the player and only the player is kicking the ball.

128
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,800
Now you could do it whenever anything touches it.

129
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,960
But I don't want that sound and I want the sound of I don't want a sound effect to play on the floor

130
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,760
or a goal is touching the wall just when the player is king.

131
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,240
Suppose the video give that a shot.

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,320
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

133
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,390
And welcome back.

134
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,330
OK so the very first thing I need to do is find some sort of audio string player and we have three choices

135
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,940
so audio stream I have all issued player with no position information to me.

136
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,930
And three I'm thinking three because I actually care about where the ball is in relation to the camera.

137
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,940
So let's put that in and I don't need to rename that because it's just getting sustainable.

138
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,430
But I do need to put in frog like wax.

139
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,600
Now here we've got the maximum sound.

140
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:40,150
Put that all the way to the max which I think it's six and let's raise the unit decibels by three something

141
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,020
as three.

142
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:48,100
So has a glass out for some reason playing stuck on I think my God so is boater's was tapping on evidence

143
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,410
and put that in.

144
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,250
It's a what does the script wanted to.

145
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:58,720
Well I need to detect collisions so let's go into the signals and do body shape entered and it's just

146
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,770
gonna loop back to itself and that's fine.

147
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,670
I don't need this ready function and I've got these things coming in and one of recalibrates body right

148
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,210
so body is whatever's coming out.

149
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,780
Now there are a couple of ways we could do this.

150
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,490
I could tell the ball okay you can only interact with the player and your college and thus I can go

151
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,390
down you clearly shape and say you only interact with the player but then it's all fall through the

152
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,750
pitch.

153
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,830
That's no good.

154
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,130
So instead I'm just going to figure out what type of thing is touching it.

155
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,730
So if body is the key word gives.

156
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,270
Right which is checking for a certain type a class what note is it.

157
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,000
Is it kinematic.

158
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:46,980
What if the body is kinematic body and audio stream play a 3D.

159
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,040
Is playing I always forget to put the not there and not all your string player is playing.

160
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,260
So if those two things are true if whatevers touching you is a player and only the players are kinematic

161
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:04,250
bodies right now and there's not a thing and not audio stream player is playing.

162
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,700
Then I want you to play what a string player that three not play.

163
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,310
And that should be something we need.

164
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,340
Let's check.

165
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,980
Now that should work.

166
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,510
But again my God is bugged.

167
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,760
Right.

168
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:25,090
There's a thing happening where play is not D selecting So what it will do is save this and I'm going

169
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,930
to quickly restart my computer so I'm just going to pause the array here and welcome back in.

170
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,900
Thank you again.

171
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,330
It looks like just delete in the load and put it back in worked for me.

172
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,040
Yep that's working so let's see if that actually works in getting a switch playing off.

173
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,160
Now that is happening but it's very very quiet.

174
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,480
Let's make it louder so my maximum decibel sex change that the size of that unit is 3.

175
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,680
So let's see how it sounds now.

176
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,790
I get this.

177
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,870
Playing my music is to love to hear.

178
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,360
So that's important information.

179
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,970
Let's turn on the music scene for now.

180
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,200
So I'm going to go into my scenes here.

181
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:15,220
Open music and just for an hour and put the volume down at minus 10 minus 10.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,780
Yeah.

183
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,370
So how does that sound.

184
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,270
Very quiet.

185
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,000
It's like that the all is happening sometimes.

186
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,980
The ball sounds happen sometimes when others if you look closely it's when the ball isn't on the ground.

187
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,060
That's because I've made a mistake here Kent contacts reported one.

188
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,310
Well the floor is constantly being reported so let's change that.

189
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:44,160
But there are three ships off the highway set that the more work and giving got in there it is.

190
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
Have a nice little kick sound which can be a little bit louder.

191
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,610
Let's make that even louder.

192
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,350
How to make this even louder.

193
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:56,530
To you that d.b. really let's put that tent I can get this but 15 let's make it loud.

194
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,930
OK.

195
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,690
That's really loud.

196
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,100
OK.

197
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,350
Now bring the music back up.

198
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,390
And there

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
is the sound of home.

200
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,390
Whatever it's called.

201
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,310
Awesome.

202
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,730
And that brings us to the end of the video.

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,630
In this video we've looked at how to check for no type with which we've actually done before if you

204
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,290
remember the glorious if button is Button experience.

205
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,310
That's what we've just done.

206
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,530
If body is kinematic body and will look at enhancing the experience by giving audio feedback at key

207
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,860
moments we'll put a cool soundtrack in.

208
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,990
I think it's called sound track if you put something else in.

209
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
Go for it.

210
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,680
And whatever you do shaer experience I'm dying to hear what you did.

211
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,910
Did you change the sound track.

212
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,530
Did you decide that no this isn't gonna work.

213
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,420
I really need some punch nails or Taylor Swift or I don't know Willie Nelson whatever does it for you

214
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,030
or the fraggle rock song.

215
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,440
Did you use a different sound effect.

216
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,210
I used some of the boying sound.

217
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,110
Did you want it playing when it hit anything.

218
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,560
Share what you've got so far.

219
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,220
Next up we're going to start putting some visual feedback one of goals scored.

220
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,790
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
