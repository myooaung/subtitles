00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.340
Hello again you marvelous Gato.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.150
People in this video let's make a game over screen.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.690
We need a lose condition for our game and we want a screen that tells the player the game is over.

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.250
And do you want to play again.

5
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.350
First thing we need to do is text when Bunny falls too far.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.160
This is gonna be the first way the player can lose.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.090
Right if you fall down too far if you fall off the edge of the world your game is over.

8
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.560
Then we need a game overseen.

9
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.300
Right we don't want to just quit the game.

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.220
We have some feedback to the players on this says game over and a button says try again.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.720
Then we need to function to get from level 1 or whatever level we're on to game over.

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.210
And we also want to function to get back.

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.180
So let's start by detecting when Bunny falls too far.

14
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.860
So here I am and got first thing I do I want to open the play a scene because I want to be using that

15
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.160
note in a moment and let's open the play script.

16
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.550
Now let's go back to 2D view and just talk this through.

17
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.910
I'll never won when Bunny falls a certain level down.

18
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.150
We want this to trigger.

19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.690
Right.

20
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.110
I'm gonna start by setting a constant limit called World limit and it's a constant someone writing capitals

21
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.860
just to remind me.

22
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.960
And this is going to be let's say 3000.

23
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.750
What does that mean.

24
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.720
It means 3000 pixels.

25
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.210
I'm going to measure Bunny's position on the y axis and remember in two dimensions positive y is down

26
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.930
not up.

27
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.790
Okay.

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.570
So we have world limit and we're already applying gravity and it feels like a good place to put it.

29
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.570
So I'm going to put right here if well I need to measure Bonnie's position.

30
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.330
How do I get that.

31
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.400
Let's look at the note and under no two days on the transform you'll see this position right here.

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.260
If I mouse over it the property I want is position all lowercase so I can use that.

33
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.370
Let's go back to script position.

34
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.820
Well I want just the vertical position right.

35
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.680
So position dot Y is greater than Weld limit.

36
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.570
It's there it is Weld limit.

37
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.560
So what it's gonna do is just check is the position greater than 3000.

38
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.760
I don't want to just write 3000 here.

39
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.650
I want to use a constant so that when I see these numbers I know what I'm measuring.

40
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.920
Okay.

41
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.390
So we need a new function.

42
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.200
I'm gonna call this end game and now it's going a little warning.

43
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.710
You're calling a function doesn't exist.

44
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.260
Not a problem.

45
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.770
Let's make it right here.

46
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.300
Line 51 or functional end game.

47
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.470
Okay.

48
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.140
So I want a way of testing this.

49
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.480
If I just do pass on the full of the world's going to call this function but nothing will happen.

50
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.730
Right.

51
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.450
So here we go.

52
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.530
We don't know if it worked well.

53
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.660
Let's do this.

54
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.640
Get tree so we can say go to the whole tree.

55
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.600
And as a function we can use here Quint which does exactly what you might think.

56
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.640
So if we're detecting this boom I should go a little further and that could mean let's say 4000

57
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.150
K better.

58
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.880
That very abrupt so clearly quits is going to work.

59
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.010
But it's a good starting point or at this point we want to make the game over screen and that's a brand

60
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.860
new scene.

61
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
And this going to be a user interface seeing something to click here and it's gonna give us control

62
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.620
node.

63
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.680
The first thing to do is rename this to end game.

64
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.780
OK.

65
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.870
Next thing on to do is make this the full screen.

66
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.940
So let's put this at a full rectangle anchor and a full rect layout so the whole Goonies take up the

67
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.930
whole space.

68
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.610
I also want some sort of background which needs a texture rect.

69
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.130
I mean like this nice and simple.

70
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.700
I mean the graphics the background I'm going to use the background.

71
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.510
Now one big solid color I could actually use a solid color if you wanted to you could remake the parallax

72
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.860
background and then give it a little script to gently scrolls the side.

73
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.580
But I'm happy with just a simple color.

74
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.430
Good would expand on full rect.

75
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.870
So now it'll take up this.

76
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.030
So when I press play it'll say oh no save the scene yet to save it on two levels and game.

77
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.830
You know what that's a silly name it's called Game Over much but a name.

78
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.420
OK.

79
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.520
So now in a Save this as game over in levels that shouldn't be a capital V chase that they're that we're

80
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.550
tidy up my typing.

81
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.480
La la la la la.

82
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.380
For now when I press play scene rather than play game it's just gonna play the seamer in here's a nice

83
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.400
big blue screen and when I resize this no matter what size this is it'll always fill it up.

84
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.670
Fantastic.

85
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.090
Now this screen could be various different sizes and I want to game over to be right here.

86
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.690
In fact you know let's make this visible with a pencil.

87
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.630
Let's take up small space

88
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.600
and get my pen out and what I'm looking for is game over in nice big letters roughly in the center right.

89
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.290
There's always wants to be here a little what size the screen is underneath.

90
00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:04.850
I'm going to have a little bunny and try again now because this is going to be of different sizes.

91
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.750
I need a way of making sure that's calculating these positions in real time.

92
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.010
Luckily there are some nodes we can use for that specifically if we get a game over and we look under

93
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.220
control and he kept us texting looking to control.

94
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.010
There's a couple of container nodes we can use.

95
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.360
I'm going to start with a center container and we're going to use every child in this container is gonna

96
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.220
be kept in the center.

97
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.160
This note if I get a layout and I go full rectangle I make sure I've anchored it to the full rectangle

98
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.230
just in case.

99
00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.080
Now any child of this will be in the center.

100
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.360
Then I can put another container.

101
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.950
Another way of organizing child nodes and I only use vertical box v box container.

102
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.490
And what this is gonna do is gonna organize all the children of it vertically and I can start with a

103
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.290
simple label and I'm gonna give it a custom font so custom font is gonna be a new dynamic font.

104
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.130
There we go.

105
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.060
Click on that to give me the settings click on font.

106
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.220
Just like we did for looney lips his candles or TTL.

107
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.060
Which is a nice bubbly font.

108
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.160
I also want this nice and big I must say.

109
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.200
Would you think 128.

110
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.000
Let's see it looks like okay.

111
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.050
White on light blue.

112
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.630
Terrible choice but not a problem we can fix that.

113
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:24.050
Let's go to custom colors which is underneath custom fonts and just enable black.

114
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.370
Yeah that looks pretty good.

115
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.590
Also to use a filter to get rid of all the jagged lines nice and smooth could probably make it bigger

116
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.030
if we wanted.

117
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.850
I mean 256 is a bit much.

118
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.690
Let's take a look this way big.

119
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.910
So a hundred twenty eight is good enough now and there's lots of other things you can do now.

120
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.630
Now you'll notice a change back to 128 and game over is now off center.

121
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.420
This is because God gooey elements as user interface elements don't always refresh.

122
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.080
Actually it's going to be calculated right but if you get that go off screen and come back and it's

123
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.410
fine.

124
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.900
Okay so we have the game over label underneath with this.

125
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.740
I want a button and another label but this isn't gonna be a normal button that's gonna be a texture

126
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.210
button.

127
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.570
It's going to look like a Bunny's head.

128
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.590
So I'm gonna have two horizontal elements to do that.

129
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.810
As a child of the box container I want

130
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.600
each box container horizontal box container.

131
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.280
And in this I'll put another label

132
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.550
and a texture button.

133
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.540
Great.

134
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.770
You'll notice we can't see any of these because I have two blank elements on a start with a label and

135
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.130
right.

136
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.710
Try again and once again after a custom font let's make a new dynamic font.

137
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.920
Click the dynamic font and we'll load it in so click on font drag candles into font data will make it

138
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:44.670
a little bit bigger.

139
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.080
When you think 64 64 is pretty good.

140
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.320
Colors terrible though so it's got a custom color.

141
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.090
Make that black.

142
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.510
OK so we have try again.

143
00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.140
I also have a button here and if I go to textures you'll see a whole bunch of models.

144
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.800
The only one I really want is normal.

145
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.060
Let's go into graphics on the HUD.

146
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.840
Heads up display.

147
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:12.450
I got life's you should say lives and always his life's fine and there's money all right.

148
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:18.710
Now I've got to H box container you see alignment begin I got split alignment center alignment and you

149
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.300
put it in the center.

150
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.490
Yeah.

151
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.290
Now if I want the bottle on the left all I have to do is change the all of these around so I could put

152
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:30.480
the texture button above the label just by dragging it there and it's done because all these containers

153
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.830
take then the same tree order to calculate things.

154
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.280
So for example on the button above.

155
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.090
Game over.

156
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.810
I can take the box container and just drag it above the label just here.

157
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:40.450
Right.

158
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.270
This is a great way of visually figuring out where you want everything to put that back for now.

159
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.200
How many this button.

160
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.270
A better name

161
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.100
and that's looking pretty good.

162
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.290
We could also make this a little bit bigger but I'm actually came with us for now.

163
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.860
Let's take a look with this scene looks like right.

164
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.580
Got a button.

165
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.520
This is a button.

166
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.210
It's just not doing anything.

167
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.760
And a nice little game over there.

168
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.850
So now we need a script right.

169
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.830
This needs to do something.

170
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.630
So I'm going to put a scripting game over new scripts.

171
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.340
Let's just make it empty lives here is called Game Over.

172
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.540
Yeah that's good to go.

173
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.520
Great.

174
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.260
Awesome.

175
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:30.440
What I want to do is make the script react when Game Over is pressed so to do that I just need to get

176
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:36.040
a node and connect pressed connect that to game over.

177
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.550
So now we press the button.

178
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.420
It's going to tell it's gonna do something right and send a signal because Lebanon is sending a signal

179
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.800
but that signal isn't doing.

180
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.920
Thanks a here's my challenge for you.

181
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:54.940
I'd like you to have the try again button load level one now quick hint we did this in Looney lips right.

182
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.960
We change scenes in learning apps a seeing figure of how to do it.

183
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.220
Look at the documentation.

184
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.170
I'll give you a clue it's under get tree.

185
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.100
Don't worry if you can't remember it's not a problem but pulls a video give it a shot when you're ready

186
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.570
come back and I'll show you my solution

187
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.360
Welcome back.

188
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:14.760
OK.

189
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.450
So the answer here is I'm going to use get a tree right.

190
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:20.460
That's going to affect the entire tree.

191
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:29.730
Dot change scene and then you see the path and easiest way to get the path is to go to the levels.

192
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.970
Level 1 I'm sure.

193
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.570
Drag that in the Okay so how do we know that's worked.

194
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.820
Well let's play the scene on its own.

195
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:45.100
Here's my button pressed the button level started to fall off the edge of the world quit the scene.

196
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.720
So now I need to connect that.

197
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.110
Let's go back to play G.D. to see the exact same thing.

198
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.920
Get tree change scene.

199
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.580
And this time I'm going to chase scene to game over.

200
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.150
Okay so now I play the game.

201
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:05.860
So I could jump high I can play a game I can fail the game I get to game over screen and I can reload

202
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.760
the level.

203
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.390
Perfect.

204
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.700
Exactly what we wanted in this video.

205
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.740
We've looked at creating a game over screen.

206
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:17.550
We've introduced container nodes specifically sent a container the box container and each box container.

207
00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.160
They're really useful there's a couple of others we look at later in the course but they're really great

208
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.350
ways of organizing everything no matter what the screen size is.

209
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.590
So excellent work.

210
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.910
And I'll see you in the next video.
