00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.850
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.370
Lovely God.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.130
People in this video are going to create robot in pieces.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.920
It's just the start of them were going to tweak them later on the course.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.660
But what I mean visioning it is what it's wow that's hard to say what and seeing with these robot indices

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.220
is the following very very simple.

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.910
All they're going to do is use a ray cast to figure out when they should fire.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.040
When a player crosses a ray they know to fire and they're going to move from side to side in a regular

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.910
pattern.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.080
Really these are glorified extras from Space Invaders.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.290
Right.

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.010
That's what I'm seeing.

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.420
I'm just seeing them in three dimensions.

14
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.240
But that's the kind of behaviour I'm looking at.

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
We don't need any complicated behaviour trees or state machines.

16
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.720
They're just going to move from side to side and fire.

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.880
So let's go to got to the very first thing to do is take a look in models and in a robot and you'll

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.640
see there's a robot.

19
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.530
ESPN and Robert tcn ecn is the blender file right.

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.280
This is the import using the god importer.

21
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.390
And you'll see it's kind of messed up a little bit and I had to change it for robot TSM which is the

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.970
same thing but moved.

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
But I don't really want the tcn I want the robot armature.

24
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.440
So what I need to do here is right click on Robert omniture and save branch a scene.

25
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:28.260
So within scenes within characters make a new folder called Robot and then call this robot army tcn.

26
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.600
So all I've done is I've just removed the robot armature from its parent node the parent has a spatial

27
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.940
I don't want the spatial I just want the armature.

28
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.120
I can now close both of those scenes and instead look to a new inherited scene where we go from characters.

29
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.230
So when I go into scenes characters and use character what they want to do is remove the script from

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.830
this.

31
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.460
Robert's gone have its own script.

32
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.020
I'm not going to rename this robot and bring in the armature.

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.060
So let's import.

34
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.690
Where is it.

35
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.030
It's in scenes characters.

36
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.610
I've just done this thing in rambert.

37
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.360
ROBERT Yeah great.

38
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.180
And look it's twice the size it needs to be stuck with a scale that down to a transform scale.

39
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm thinking zero point five on up.

40
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.700
No that's wrong zero point five.

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.770
Not 0 5.

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.830
And that gets right up to the top and uses the same colour and shape and that's awesome.

43
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.520
Now I'm going to hide our mission in essence and I'm going to make sure we can see all the child knows.

44
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.810
Going to editable children.

45
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.270
First thing I want to do is figure out which animation I want buy into animations were not Coney's or

46
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.560
these.

47
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.930
But one thing I do want to use is running and that should be set to auto play and Loop.

48
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.950
So outlash see how that looks great.

49
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.880
And that should be good to go.

50
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.710
Cool.

51
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.320
So I now have my robot seen on a save that.

52
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.810
Under Robert.

53
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.250
I just call it robot.

54
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.940
There's a couple more things I want to do.

55
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.930
First this check that Ford is in the right place.

56
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.840
Ford is the right place.

57
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.300
But I also want a raise.

58
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.820
So let's make a new ray.

59
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.190
Back up to the root note.

60
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.310
I want a rake cast and the ray casts currently is at the bottom.

61
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.860
I don't want that.

62
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.140
I want it more roughly where the ford is to be honest.

63
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.160
So let's just raise that.

64
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.940
Now we need to cast to right now we are casting to zero on the axe which is good.

65
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.940
Negative one.

66
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.770
Why so.

67
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.540
Down on the wire.

68
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.420
Which is bad.

69
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.950
I'm not sure why he started running again.

70
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.910
So what it is zero and the z axis the z axis is all I care about.

71
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.950
So let's.

72
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.820
What do you think.

73
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.470
My son may have a hundred meters.

74
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.300
Anything that crosses that 100 meters that's way too big isn't it.

75
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.270
Fifty.

76
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.400
Yeah.

77
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.880
Let's find 50 in it.

78
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.400
So we have this ray and the idea is anything that crosses the ray is going to you know trigger a fire.

79
00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.530
So let's enable it and make sure it's excluding the parent and that should be most of the way there.

80
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.080
All right.

81
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.140
Before we get further let's put one in the scene so I'm going to go back to level 1 maguy new note and

82
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.490
call this one robots and let's see I'm gonna put a robot in instance and a robot right here.

83
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.120
So in this instance you in.

84
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.370
And how's that looking.

85
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.600
It's looking pretty solid game.

86
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.340
Play the scene make sure Robert looks good.

87
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.850
See if he animates.

88
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.640
He admits once but doesn't look as curious but he's looking good is a good size and like a fire thrown

89
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.400
at him.

90
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.090
Awesome.

91
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.570
Ah right.

92
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.150
So back into our robot scene.

93
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.350
Let's see why.

94
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:53.190
You are not animating properly did to do back into the correct running thing.

95
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.320
You are looping you should be working ok.

96
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.680
Sometimes when I import from ESPN I'm not sure why the animations don't loops are going to do that in

97
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.370
script for now outlets making script for a robot.

98
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.750
And as you might expect we're putting that doo doo doo doo in our scraps.

99
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.530
Which is not in scenes.

100
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.970
There it is.

101
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.890
And I'm calling it robot and it's going to inherit from character.

102
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.350
So what I want to do now is make sure that when the right cast is colliding the robot's going to fire

103
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.550
at us like a function.

104
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.490
And I'm going to do a physics process.

105
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.700
For some reason also complete isn't playing I'm not entirely sure why but that's fine physics process

106
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.620
which takes Delta.

107
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.230
What do we need.

108
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.470
We need if Ray cast there it is.

109
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.890
What is colliding.

110
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.010
And if it is we're going to fire now.

111
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.590
Couple of things we should be aware of.

112
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.400
First this railcars is just checking.

113
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.190
Is anything colliding.

114
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.920
And second we have nothing to stop it.

115
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.690
Little fire and it'll keep firing as long as anything now crosses that line which could look like this.

116
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.110
Always colliding with it.

117
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.470
And it's just going to keep quiet.

118
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.050
Okay.

119
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.800
That's clearly not what we want.

120
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.920
So let's solve problem one first.

121
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.180
We need to make sure that this Ray only detects the player is a few different ways.

122
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.530
We can do this but I'd like to see the solution you come up with.

123
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.900
So my challenge for you is to only fire at the player have the NPC Ray cast only trigger the fire function

124
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.450
when the player crosses it.

125
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.680
So pause the video give it a shot.

126
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.660
When you have you the solution come on back and I'll show you how I would solve it.

127
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:42.980
And welcome back.

128
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.050
OK there's a few things we could do here.

129
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.450
One we could go into the script and do something with is colliton we could get the collider and do that.

130
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.750
This you say Delta not detlor.

131
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.370
I'm not going to do that.

132
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.440
I am going to use collision masks.

133
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.470
So what I need to do is go into this scene and start adding some colour and that's we haven't done any

134
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.840
yet.

135
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.880
So I have touraine player NPC at the moment those are my important ones.

136
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.850
We can always add more later.

137
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.220
So let's go in to our physics 3D physics.

138
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.780
Here we go.

139
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:26.190
So level 1 I'm going to call touraine led to Michael player and play a three is going to be NPC coach.

140
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.370
Got those.

141
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.780
Now we need to add things in to the correct collision layers.

142
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.760
So let's start with our player.

143
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.720
Let's go into the actual player scene and do it here.

144
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.360
And that's going to be important because we're going to have the ability to switch players out later.

145
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.980
It's good to physics body collision mask.

146
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.540
You are not trained.

147
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.360
You are player however you interact with trains and end pieces you know.

148
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.820
We should probably have one for food as well but we can leave that for now.

149
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.050
And no you know let's put it in project settings.

150
00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.550
New Thing.

151
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.040
Great.

152
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.840
So you can interact with touraine and parks and food.

153
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.130
The way I minisub the game it's actually going to be impossible for the player and the food touch each

154
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.170
other and not play of food play an NPC to touch each other.

155
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.790
But maybe your game will be different and that's put in the possibility of changing.

156
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.660
Some are saying that that's going to a robot and.

157
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.400
Back in a physics body.

158
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:28.450
You are an NPC you interact with train players and food could also have you interact with them.

159
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.710
But let's not.

160
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.900
Finally let's go to projectile which is in sequence.

161
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.960
And ammo can open a projectile scene.

162
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:46.100
And I'm going to put in the collision information here so you are food and you interact with everything

163
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.540
including other bits of food.

164
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.220
I want to make it so that you can shoot food down right back into the robot.

165
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.850
And now the rope the ray cast only interacts the player which should mean.

166
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.820
So we're still at the crazing machine gunfire but only when the player crossed that line.

167
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.270
Now let's make that firing a little less hectic.

168
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.550
We're already using.

169
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:16.070
If I open the play a script right here we've got can fire which is part of the character scene so the

170
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.530
robot has access to it and the player has access to it.

171
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.340
And we've already got this logic here.

172
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.430
So what we do is just add all this logic to the script.

173
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.170
So we're going to add right here.

174
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.170
If recast is colliding and can fire that's going to work right.

175
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:36.070
So if can fire is true and the player has moved into the range of the two countries you want then fire.

176
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.540
We also want to set can fire to faults.

177
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.860
And I mean just look at my incredible typing for a moment.

178
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.890
VAT is kind of worthy of a small prise.

179
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.120
I mean I really feel like that should be immortalise maybe framed but let's write it properly.

180
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.790
Can fire equals false.

181
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.180
OK that's a little bit more professional.

182
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.050
And I also want to start this can fire Taino because that's what it's for.

183
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.450
So it can fire not start.

184
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.380
So let's make sure that everything works fine.

185
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.960
And it does.

186
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.290
The robot can only file once a second.

187
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.110
OK.

188
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:18.030
If I wanted to I could put another time in here and add a delay to say a half second delay between the

189
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.770
player going in and the robot firing if I wanted to add some reactions but I'm actually pretty happy

190
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.410
with this.

191
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.970
Well I do want to do is make sure that the robot is actually having a looping animation right now he

192
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.710
isn't.

193
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.760
Let's fix this in scripts and do function.

194
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.080
Ready.

195
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.520
And again I'm not sure why auto complete isn't working right now.

196
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.270
It really should be.

197
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.500
Should underscore or should.

198
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.000
And what they want to do is get the animation player and the correct information.

199
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.860
So first let's grab the animation player so animation player there it is and what it gets.

200
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.600
Animation and specifically I want robots running.

201
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.030
So robots.

202
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.380
Why aren't you auto competing you are so strange.

203
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:06.460
You're called Robot underscore running and I want to set the loop subset loop.

204
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.570
That's another function.

205
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.790
And that's true.

206
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.590
Let's double check.

207
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.720
And you are now running happily.

208
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.940
You're actually a little bit lower on the raise the robot up into the air slightly.

209
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.650
So here we go.

210
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.060
Robot you going up in the air.

211
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.200
Awesome.

212
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.870
OK.

213
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.190
Now I want this robot to go left and right.

214
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.500
And what I do here is add a second animation animation player within the robots that's got back into

215
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.040
the robot scene and at the root.

216
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:52.860
So at Robot this add an animation player and I'm sure they call this position animation.

217
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.650
I want to call it position animation because this one is animating the position the level.

218
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.970
The other one is animating the movement of the limbs.

219
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.680
I don't want to call either them Movement animation because that's a little bit.

220
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.420
So what I'm looking for vague.

221
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.190
There we go.

222
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:16.050
All right so let's get this robot and I'm going to give it some animations So let's start you over here

223
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.550
and your child as well children.

224
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:30.390
Isn't there was because I like to save save you and your child when I have a new animation work on it

225
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.940
call you Movement.

226
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.390
Let's start with your translation.

227
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.110
I make a key.

228
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:41.920
Yeah that's a good place.

229
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.830
Key.

230
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.280
Right.

231
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.240
OK.

232
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:51.960
So I think it's going to take one two three four seconds there and four seconds back some have an eight

233
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.820
second animation with steps of one second.

234
00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.480
And let's say four seconds to get to the other side.

235
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.050
So each corner of each of here is about right.

236
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:12.580
And you know I could just type in a number and then it's going to loop and auto start and that should

237
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.220
be everything I need.

238
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.090
Let's check.

239
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.720
You know what that's a little bit slow isn't it.

240
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.170
OK.

241
00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:23.210
So let's make you a four second animation has that feel.

242
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.830
Split the difference and call it six seconds.

243
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:29.450
There we are.

244
00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.960
Perfect.

245
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.870
And now I press play.

246
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:46.970
Now the moment we have no way of measuring damage but we do have is a robot NPC that can run across

247
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.270
a lot.

248
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.430
Actually I am going to speed that up for the four seconds.

249
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.290
I lied.

250
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.130
I did a terrible lying thing.

251
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:52.550
There we go.

252
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:58.500
So you can take two seconds to reach your side and your total unemotional like is four seconds.

253
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.000
Now let's say I want more than one robot.

254
00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.810
I don't want to just duplicate this one.

255
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.440
And the reason why I don't want to duplicate this one is if I duplicate this move I'm gonna be here

256
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.440
if I change anything to do this animation it'll change it for both look.

257
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.360
I move the animation here and now they both have that animation.

258
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.450
So let's undo both of those steps in ceremony instance in a new robot.

259
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.790
And this robot to who is over here can go right there.

260
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.570
Now you see here that the animation is actually still the same but that's because we're still looking

261
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.100
at the animation from robot one.

262
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.280
Let's open a robot to the child and look at this position animation very different.

263
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:46.250
So let's see where you are at position 0 you are here.

264
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.090
I was at Robert tu's positions zero to the other side.

265
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.200
So let's make a new animation

266
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.830
and set you to over here a little bit higher than that.

267
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:05.060
And there is your transform key at seven right.

268
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.880
And we're going to copy through the informations are 1 second steps and it's for second animation.

269
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.650
Is that right.

270
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.570
Four seconds.

271
00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.170
That is right.

272
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:13.730
OK.

273
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.470
Two seconds.

274
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.880
You are going to be on the other side.

275
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.140
And with a loop and auto start.

276
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.070
And now when I press play.

277
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.050
We have two robots.

278
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.720
They're aiming for us now a couple of things you'll notice.

279
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.510
One I can cross over this line.

280
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:42.240
Let's change that later too while the robots don't shoot at each other.

281
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.450
The back one can hit the front of time it just right.

282
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.160
Right so I want to make sure that that either won't happen or if it does that the food isn't down to

283
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.760
down the robot.

284
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.190
But right now I would have damaging.

285
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.140
We do have two robots.

286
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.130
So that brings the end of the video in this video with added adversaries with reused railcars which

287
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:09.070
we've used before but now we're using them in three dimensions with use a mask which we've used before

288
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:14.770
with building on all that knowledge to get to a position where well look we're almost there right.

289
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.800
We need to add some damage of some lights for ourselves and for the robots.

290
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.020
A few more animations but we're getting there this game is start to come together really nicely.

291
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.210
So what kind of solution did you come up with.

292
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.360
Did you also use lay a mask or did you do it in code.

293
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.580
Share your successes and your stories.

294
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.460
I'd love to hear them.

295
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.320
Meanwhile excellent work and I'll see your next video.
