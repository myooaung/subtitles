1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,010
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:06,840
Glorious God.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,820
People in this video.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,330
We're going to add lives that again.

5
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,610
We're going to start with the concept.

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,800
How many lives we have at the beginning of the game.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,760
We cannot keep track of the current game and were going to make it more challenging for Bunny as we

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:16,970
go.

9
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,370
So let's put the core game player into the game.

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,000
How do you do that.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,010
Well I'll start there.

12
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,960
He starting lives variable in my games script then add the lives variable and then connect the spikes

13
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,930
to game state.

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,630
I might even rename the spike script we'll see how we go.

15
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,140
Finally I'm going to make Bonnie react to the spikes and not just lose a life I want money to move to

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,470
jump up when hurt so we I do all that in this video.

17
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,520
Let's get to it.

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,640
First thing to do is open my games state script.

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,670
Here it is.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,800
And I'm going to create an export very.

21
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:55,280
All you know what let's go to fullscreen mode for moment as an export variable called starting out lives

22
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,960
and we start with three.

23
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,560
Why is this an export variable one notch the variable.

24
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:08,240
Well if it's an export variable it's shop in the inspector right here on my own that doesn't actually

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,210
save that much time.

26
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,280
Right it's it's as easy way to go to the script.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,260
Change it here than it is changing the inspector.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,260
But it's something that I'm probably going to tweak be tweaking quite a lot at the beginning and if

29
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,470
I was a large team of people if many people were working the same project the same time.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
This will allow people to tweak the values when they playing the game without having to or going to

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
the script in all things then don't make a variable called wives and in the ready function.

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,740
I'm going to go all wives he calls starting lives nice and easy.

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,920
So the moment you Sensi first tell the games state script who you are which is what this line does and

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,970
then set the lines value to our starting lives perfect we should now create functionality for being

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,070
hurt so let's do this above end game that feels like it should be right at the end.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,550
Let's put it here.

37
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:06,630
So a function but what's going to happen or function hurt lives minus equal one so lives giving a down

38
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,270
by one.

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,350
I also want to check that.

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,980
If we have no lives left.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:17,980
So if you have less than zero lives and game actually right that probably shall we.

42
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,440
MH No more majors.

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,300
Typo.

44
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,200
No.

45
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,240
Leave the mage alone and end the game.

46
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,480
Poor Harry Potter being ended by.

47
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,810
OK this might look like an off by one error.

48
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,110
Right so when Ben first saw this he meant don't you mean this.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,620
Actually I don't mean if lives are less than one.

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,880
What I mean is you can have ZERO lives left but if you have less than that you will lose the game.

51
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,030
Okay so we now have a hurt function.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,700
Let's connect it let's go into our spike script and it occurs to me the script could do with renaming

53
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,480
and it's ruining the script.

54
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,970
Let's reading spike stop to what we call it has it's and something good.

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,750
Name a rename.

56
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,980
Hazards.

57
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,790
G'day.

58
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,310
So.

59
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,250
All hazards one now use the script including enemies.

60
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,580
Anything that you could touch that hurts you will do this.

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,640
It's now changed its names are on spikes top entered.

62
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,190
Doesn't really work.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,210
I'm gonna fix that in the moment.

64
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,040
But for now what needs to happen.

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,200
Well global dot game States dot hut.

66
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,190
Okay let's see if that works.

67
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,160
So I should be able to answer once twice thrice and dead.

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,480
Perfect.

69
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,600
Now we're not updating the gooey yet will do that little later.

70
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,340
But first let's fix this on Spike's top body entered.

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,540
Doesn't really work.

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:54,880
Let's go into the subsidy for Spike and into to demote and let's reset this note so I'm going to disconnect

73
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,450
it.

74
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,130
And I'm going to connect it again to itself but give a different name.

75
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,490
So let's just call it on body at it.

76
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,350
And I'm a move this down here.

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,600
Get rid of the pass and I can get rid of that line entirely though.

78
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,160
When this body is entered run the hurt function in games state.

79
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,380
I'm doing this because now I can start using this script in enemy so it doesn't have to be spike.

80
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,690
We can have enemies that also use the Hasn't Judy.

81
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,110
Save that.

82
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,490
Which brings me to the challenge.

83
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,450
I'd like you to make body react create a hurt function in the play A deedy that makes the bungee jump

84
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,900
when hooked up.

85
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,800
Pause the video give it a shot.

86
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,710
And when you come back I'll show you my solution.

87
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,570
And work Mac.

88
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,640
Okay so I need to go to play egd right here.

89
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,190
And we need a new function function at heart.

90
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:11,600
And when we do insert motion dot why he calls jump speed.

91
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,870
Why am I not just jumping because I want this to happen even if the player is not on the floor right.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,500
If I was to just run jump has a function.

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,790
This statement here would mean that nothing would work.

94
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:32,030
So I want Bunny to jump up in the air when they touch a spike regardless of what the keyboard presses

95
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,730
are.

96
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,190
Now that's connected.

97
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,030
One global player got hurt.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,230
Okay Bonnie.

99
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,280
Show me what you got.

100
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,450
One two three.

101
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,260
And there.

102
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,510
And I wasn't press any buttons which precisely in the video.

103
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,320
Congratulations.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,310
With added threat to the game we have the concept of lives we haven't yet plugged the UI into this but

105
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,580
we're about ready to do that.

106
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,460
And a quickset now that you've made more ways for money to die maybe tweak the level.

107
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,140
I'm actually this week mine right now so COME connect to the slide the minute let's go into my tile

108
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,820
map for Level 1 do loop.

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,770
I know strange version of the level isn't it.

110
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,690
Tao map.

111
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,970
I actually don't like this starting one I want to go a little bit higher.

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,000
Make the process a bit more linear and let's put a cake here and give the player a reason to get there

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,450
a minute and then move you.

114
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,890
And let's move this spike was Spike you are the spike spike you live here.

115
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,690
Perfect.

116
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,200
Dramatic entrance and a much more linear progression loops.

117
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,850
I don't know if I can actually play this level.

118
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,430
I can play was level awesome.

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,900
So now it really and truly at the end of the video.

120
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,790
So Shane you little tweaks if you made them excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
