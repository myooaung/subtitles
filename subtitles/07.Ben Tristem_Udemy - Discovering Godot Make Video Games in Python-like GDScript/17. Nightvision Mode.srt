1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,450
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,220
Wonderful God people in this video.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,290
We're going to set up night vision mode which is a key gameplay mechanic and heiss Meister's.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,040
What's going to happen is the play is going to be a switch from that dark vision mode with all the torches

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,570
and see where the guards can see but not much else to a very bright night vision mode that doesn't let

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,360
them see what the guards and cameras are looking at that does reveal important information.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,470
So very quickly what do we need.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,910
Well we need to let the player see in the dark.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,660
Right now we're using a lot of darkness and shadow which is very atmospheric not easy to move through.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,360
So I'm going to make everything a much brighter green.

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:41,270
And we might look at some way of putting a cool down so the player can't just spammed a different vision

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,430
mode and make it easy to play the game.

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,800
Where do we start.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,060
Well we're already changing a vision mode right.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,930
We are using canvas modulate to make everything nice dark blue.

16
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:01,670
So I just copy this value this zero F 1 D 53 which is a hexadecimal red green blue code and look what

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,970
happens if we make this a much harsher.

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,710
Artificial grainless about us that look good.

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,230
Yeah that looks like my vision already.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,420
This feels different.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,770
It's all going to do is when I make a script and canvas modulate that'll switch between this vision

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,670
and this vision.

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,980
So first I going to rename canvas modulate to something more suitable as call it a vision mode and then

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:35,280
make a script for it which one to put in the script folder because reasons vision mode awesome and the

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,080
very first thing to do is put a constant then called dark and that's going to be colour with a capital

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,140
C and actually an equal not a minus.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,110
And this is a string and I'm just copying pasting that hexadecimal value I had earlier.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:57,800
So if I look at vision mode right here RAW mode right here and now let's pick a nice green.

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:06,540
So I'm thinking something very garish and a little bit brighter maybe.

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,150
That looks pretty well pretty vivid doesn't it.

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,880
That's going to be great.

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,940
OK so that is my new colour so what is that that is.

33
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,610
In vision mode and you constant called Night Vision.

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,000
And that's to be fi to be see 9 to be.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,230
You can use your own values by all means pick whatever you want.

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,930
You can also make more vision modes right so if you want to go for aliens first predator you could make

37
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,660
a thermal vision you could make that we had the quote ultraviolet bit machine vision they use to hunt

38
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,500
aliens.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,170
You could make all kinds of stuff here.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,080
But for now I'm just going take two and to check that I'm doing this correctly.

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,010
I'll make a ready function an image ready function.

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to do colour which is the property of vision mode which is a lower case which is that it always

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,540
confuses me.

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,580
He calls it dark.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,630
Now currently we have this green colour.

46
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,070
If I save everything and press play we should switch to dark vision.

47
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,540
Which shows me that were set up correctly.

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,410
Some went back into the script and I want two more functions.

49
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:23,100
I want function night vision mode on

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,950
and not monarchal this night vision mode and the next one dark vision.

51
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,550
The reason I'm doing this is if we ever want to add more vision modes I don't want night vision mode

52
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,100
on night vision mode off vision allowed on.

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,060
I just want to switch between them in a nice logical easy to read way.

54
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,330
So all of these do it well.

55
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,720
They kind of do this in at the ready function right so when we get an idea in mode colour equals night

56
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,160
vision and when we go in to.

57
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,690
Dark vision colour.

58
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,250
Colour.

59
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,260
He calls dark alright.

60
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,660
I'm not putting in any conditions that say when you do this in vision mode as a as a..

61
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,450
Because the player's going to control that.

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,300
Great so let's go back into the play a script and please set up a variable and will make the variable

63
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,990
called Night Vision and let's start off with a false so we don't see one night vision.

64
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,210
OK this will work we can have a boolean call night vision and every time we switch vision modes Ill

65
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:27,360
go.

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
True False True fostering false.

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,450
However I've said I would like to make this more scalable right.

68
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,550
I want the possibility to add more vision modes and so instead of this instead of using a boolean which

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,140
only has two possible answers let's make an even number and a numerator.

70
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:49,830
This is kind of like a boolean sets that has various possible things you can pick but it doesn't only

71
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,200
have to.

72
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,180
We get to define what possible values it has and to do that we have none.

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,100
And when to call this vision mode equals and we use the curly brackets the curly brackets just like

74
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,230
we have a dictionary and I mean to put in dark night vision.

75
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,180
And those are the two possible things.

76
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,670
None can have one thing I've done wrong I've just realized incomes don't need equal sign is just some

77
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,540
vision.

78
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,610
Awesome.

79
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:25,060
Okay now what I'd like to do this year this is I'm going to set up a function in put it out.

80
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,750
All right so we have this plate input event now what to do from here is only go into project settings

81
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:42,500
and I want to find the input map instead of what's the current space but map to space by is Map to you

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,370
eisel Lack.

83
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,140
I believe there is and when I remove space from you I select and make a brand new action.

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,840
And this is going to be you I.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,060
Vision mode change.

86
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,590
Let's add that and imagine Mikey.

87
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,600
Mikey is going to space I've just pressed the space but don't type in space.

88
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,380
I tried that once.

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,770
It's very confusing.

90
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,890
So if input dot is action just pressed.

91
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,900
And we called this you eye vision no change.

92
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:29,250
What we do we're going to we're going to cycle vision mode and that's going to be on next function.

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,160
Vision has a V in it.

94
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,070
Not a c.

95
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Ok so I've set up the script.

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,730
When we press the key currently mapped a space you either measure change within a cycle or not.

97
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,480
So let's set up cycle which a motor function cycle vision mode.

98
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,230
And let's make some space to make this work.

99
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,400
We need a default position.

100
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,920
So our default position is going to be vision mode.

101
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,710
Eagles.

102
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,790
Doc are you with the caps.

103
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:13,020
Yes because our constant thoughts put the knee caps and night vision and that's going to be duck alright.

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:21,930
If vision showed equal Eagles remember two equals is checking a value one equals a setting or baggage.

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,520
The word is IF vision mode is dark.

106
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:36,050
To make a comment here change vision mode and we're going to set the vision mode.

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,040
He calls night vision.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If vision mode is night vision.

109
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,570
Make a comment there as well.

110
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,620
About to put sociables in Wiltshire skip it for now.

111
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,710
Vision mode equals dark.

112
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,590
Now I could do this with a boolean.

113
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,760
As I've said I can make this a toggle not a cycle but the beauty here is if I put in some vision right

114
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,770
I could change dark to thermal

115
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,090
and then do.

116
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,990
If vision mode is thermal and and cycle back to ducks I can just make a loop and just change as many

117
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,190
times I like.

118
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,520
So far so good.

119
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,500
Now we actually have to run the vision mode script.

120
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,350
We have to run night vision mode and dark vision.

121
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,200
There's a couple of ways we could do this.

122
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,180
We could use those global parameters and then connect a signal.

123
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,150
Or we could use a group.

124
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,490
Let me tell you very quickly about groups.

125
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,060
Signals are awesome.

126
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,110
They're great way of connecting directly to a node and saying here is a function do this function.

127
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,530
So when the event happens whatever that event is don't worry about it.

128
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,370
That's my business.

129
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,130
But when I send you the signal do that thing I don't need to know that thing is that's your business.

130
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,610
But these are one to one connections.

131
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,700
Right now we're establishing once one connection but later we don't want to.

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,330
I'm going to want to do things like have all MP CS turn off their torches in night vision and I will

133
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:14,560
have a bunch of labels on a map that only sharpened night vision mode so I need a way of doing mass

134
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,390
signal connections.

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:24,970
We could just use a group groups use get tree core group to go to the top of the scene tree and broadcast

136
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,500
a function to all members of the group and then each node decides for itself if that's relevant.

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,650
Let me show how that works over here on nodes.

138
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,520
You'll see we have all these signals but we also have groups and we can put in our own group.

139
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,490
We can call this interface and it's the group.

140
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,350
I'm actually not going to do it that way.

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,130
I'm going to do it in script.

142
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,390
So you add to group and call this interface is later.

143
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,720
I want a bunch of other things to always change when ever the group interface functions are called.

144
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,640
This is good because I'm going to add other things to this group later and then the player can just

145
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,610
call one function to everything in that group.

146
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,130
Let's show you how that works.

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,740
When I go to my cycle vision mode.

148
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,960
If we're dark We're going into night vision.

149
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,300
So what it does is when you get tree call group.

150
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,590
A core group can take a look at its documentation.

151
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:28,820
It takes a string name for the group a string name for the method and then Vara tag via a haag which

152
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,050
is it's not all keish.

153
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
It's variable.

154
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,980
Arguments you put as many arguments as you need to.

155
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,050
So let's look at vision code and see what function we have we have vision night vision mode and dark

156
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,230
vision spiracles dark vision mode the night vision mode Darfur.

157
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,710
So Mplayer core group was the nervous interface as a double check I spelt that right because you know

158
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,270
me in typing.

159
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,390
In fact I got a copy paste.

160
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,770
Just because peace of mind.

161
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,580
Okay what function we call it where we're going in to night vision and the function is called Night

162
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,420
Vision mode.

163
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,150
Note by the way I am not copying the brackets I'm just copying the words and it's going to be a string

164
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,670
so night vision.

165
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,670
And I don't need any arguments.

166
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,450
So now I do the same thing over here.

167
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,080
Get tree call group

168
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,710
interface

169
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,650
and let's just double check what I called it.

170
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,640
I gave him a copy paste because of my typing dark vision mode.

171
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,820
Before I go any further I just realized I can't actually use is here I have to use equal or so equally

172
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,880
equal not it's.

173
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm so sorry.

174
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,780
That was my fault.

175
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,330
Let's just put it minus one thing I have noticed.

176
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,150
I've done a very silly thing here.

177
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,470
I've got two if statements so is going to run this if statement.

178
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,020
It won't stop and it'll run this.

179
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,740
So what is actually there.

180
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,070
Do you see.

181
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,330
Are you in Doc mode.

182
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,020
Yes.

183
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,260
Great call.

184
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,830
The vision of change.

185
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,700
Set to vision mode set to night vision with night vision.

186
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,520
Yes you are.

187
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,680
So let's put an elf and that.

188
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,110
Should meme.

189
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,260
That we can all change vision.

190
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,160
Look at that.

191
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,660
Outstanding.

192
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,210
Which brings me to the challenge for you.

193
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,220
So over time around and get the players to have to wait.

194
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,340
What a dissimilar time it could be a second degree five seconds.

195
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,080
Pick a number that feels right to you.

196
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,890
And let's set that up so the player has to wait before they can switch that tallyman again pause the

197
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,000
video give that a shot.

198
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
When you come back I'll show you my solution.

199
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,880
And welcome back.

200
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,790
I feel like the the smartest place to put this is in the players the players time.

201
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,660
So let's put that right here as a child of of player and I'm going to give this a what feels it two

202
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,200
seconds.

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,300
See how that works.

204
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,550
Let's rename this vision mode timer because I suspect players can have a couple of times going on and

205
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:03,800
connect it as a signal so on time out in play are on vision mode timer timeout.

206
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,770
Great.

207
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,890
And here I'm going to put in a another booleans probably put it right here make their own category so

208
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,970
variable.

209
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:24,370
This is going to be what we call it we call this vision change on cooldown and this can be false.

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,310
Let's make this a big screen.

211
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,430
I'll just double check.

212
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,790
Vision mode on.

213
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,640
Down.

214
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,400
Typing.

215
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,820
Alright so.

216
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,400
Put it right here.

217
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,720
And vision mode on.

218
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,270
Cool down.

219
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,490
Is that right.

220
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,850
Vision mode on cool down didn't auto complete So that's double check not dating silly.

221
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,320
OK.

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,760
And we don't want to get called elsewhere on and not vision mode or called out.

223
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,030
So currently there's a model called Dallas false.

224
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,070
So that should work tight cycle vision mode and I'm going to go.

225
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:17,330
There's an old timer dot start then but I actually put the madon call down to true so vision mode I

226
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,010
call down Legal's.

227
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:19,770
True.

228
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,170
Let's copy that and down here vision my time out let's say that's a false.

229
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,850
Get rid of these random spaces between functions.

230
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,130
We don't need those.

231
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,180
Let's give that a shot an image of span space bar.

232
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,180
Again feels Come along doesn't it.

233
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,010
I get it.

234
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,280
I will set my time at a slightly shorter.

235
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,500
What have I got set to right now.

236
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,630
But that's it's two seconds.

237
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,900
That was two seconds.

238
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,610
That said it's a one point five.

239
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,930
See how that feels.

240
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,450
Yeah looks pretty good.

241
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,070
Okay.

242
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,440
Later on in the Gooly will make we'll give it some sort of feedback to the player and see when it's

243
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:07,920
charged.

244
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,510
But for now that's pretty good.

245
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:16,940
One more thing I do want to do I want to give vision mode a sound effect so let's put in an audio stream.

246
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,470
Play up.

247
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,510
And if we go over to sound effects so effects you see here we've got night vision wave and night vision

248
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,030
of where we use those to.

249
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,410
I do want to put these in global So for now we're left click on Want a copy path and then let's open

250
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,850
the global Scripsit back in the scripts global It's right here.

251
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:48,120
And these are going to be assets as it links we up and make a note must be changed manually so we don't

252
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,710
forget.

253
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,090
OK.

254
00:15:49,110 --> 00:16:03,890
So we have variable night vision on SFX equals that variable night vision off effects equals.

255
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,800
That alright.

256
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,040
Save that and now in vision mode I could put.

257
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:16,980
The.

258
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,680
Stream we want so the stream property is going to be not stream.

259
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:35,890
Our audio stream player dot stream he calls global dots night vision on SFX because we're going into

260
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,230
night vision and we want to play that.

261
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:48,590
Now it's copy that and paste it here if we were using this more than twice and make this a little different.

262
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,700
I would make a new function call.

263
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,540
In fact let's do that let's make a new function called Audio place out effect.

264
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,870
So let's move you go play SFX.

265
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,060
Play us effects is going to live over here.

266
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,510
It's just going to be audio string players play.

267
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,680
And that needs a column.

268
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,190
Now one thing that's going to happen is this is going to crash in our show for press play.

269
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,090
It's going to say what you're loading a string you can't load a string.

270
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,800
Right.

271
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,210
The reason for that stop that the reason for that is I don't want to load a string.

272
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:32,050
I want to have files and when to cast it as a file using a load and that just tells it this is a file

273
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:39,410
not a string so convert whatever this is into a file Pressplay and we should have a very exciting.

274
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,290
So we had some an on sound off sound because I made two mistakes one that's off and two I'm not calling

275
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,400
the function.

276
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,250
This apparently is a day for silly mistakes.

277
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,210
So there we are.

278
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:02,380
Let's give that a shot and we should have some very dramatic on sounds of sounds.

279
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,630
We are in very good shape.

280
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,720
Which brings us to the end of the video.

281
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,870
In this video will introduce groups which are awesome and I love them and the like signals but supercharged

282
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,990
we've actually switched vision modes and we've introduced in arms which are also awesome that the power

283
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,760
of booleans.

284
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,040
But more so.

285
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,020
So we were in really good shape.

286
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,090
Excellent work and I'll see you in the next video.
