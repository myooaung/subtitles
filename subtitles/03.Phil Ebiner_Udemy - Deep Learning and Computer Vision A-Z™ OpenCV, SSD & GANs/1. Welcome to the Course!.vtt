Hey Guys welcome to the course in computer vision.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.790
We're releasing this course early on on behalf of London myself and the team behind this.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.730
I wanted to say thank you so much for supporting our efforts.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.530
Now this course is going to grow a lot.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.040
Right now there's only the first part of the course which is related to open Sivi and yet that is really

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.510
a huge part.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.700
You will learn all about the biology and functions are all all about the intuition behind it and then

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:33.540
you'll get the practical application in face detection then we're going to add another section on how

9
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.310
to use deep learning in computer vision.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330
And that's coming in the next week or so.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.860
And then after that we're going to use that on the section on Gannon's and that's coming in next couple

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.050
of weeks as well as all those courses going to grow.

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
But already you have a lot of things to practice and that's exactly why we're releasing it early so

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.950
that you can work through the course and you can start getting your hands onto the tools as they are

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.510
released inside the scores.

16
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.410
So scroll down check out the lectures have fun and we'll be updating you as we add more materials.

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300
And I can't wait to see inside the class.

18
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.130
And until then enjoy computer vision.
