00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.170
Hello and welcome back to the course on computer vision in today's tutorial we're talking about the

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.580
integral image.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.770
So what is this image that is so important in computer vision in the way all the Jones algorithm.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.750
Well previously we stopped off here where we introduced the horror like features and we found out how

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.700
they were calculated so briefly to recap we have a certain feature that is commonly found in certain

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:36.120
parts of the face for instance here we can see this line where it is like more white half was more black

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.540
is Representative sometimes on some certain photos in some sort in a certain lighting it can be present

8
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.680
in the nose here.

9
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.470
And then we calculated that through the actual pixel values in the image.

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.790
When we talked about threshold.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.480
So basically we found out that in order to calculate this in value for the feature to find out if it's

12
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.880
present in the image or not so that the criterion for that to evaluate the criterion for us and feature

13
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.950
we need to make perform calculations and we need to calculate the sum of all of these values and this

14
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.690
rectangle and the sum of all the values in this rectangle.

15
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.930
Strike one from the other.

16
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.070
And as you can imagine this can be quite a costly exercise in terms of computations.

17
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.080
It take quite some time to add all these numbers up especially if you have lots of these features at

18
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.040
evaluating and especially if these features are quite large.

19
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.630
So there is a hack to doing this very quickly and this is where the integral image comes in.

20
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.870
So let's just imagine that we have an image with a certain number of pixels us as shown here.

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.290
And for simplicity's sake we're only going to look at the intensity of the gray scale from 0 to 1.

22
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.460
We're just going to do it from 0 to 10 so we'll just multiply by time just so it's easier for us to

23
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.910
look at this example we don't have to deal in decimal point so let's randomly fill in this image.

24
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.140
Doesn't really matter what kind of image we're talking about.

25
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.890
Any image can be represented in this type of form where we have a value for every single pixel.

26
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.080
And so let's say we're calculating a whore like feature and we need to in order to calculate evaluate

27
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.700
that feature on this image we need to calculate the sum of all of the intensities in this specific valks

28
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.860
that we've outlined.

29
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.680
So what we normally do is we would just take 10 plus four plus nine plus eight percent plus four plus

30
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.960
one plus nine point nine percent plus we'll add them up and we would get some.

31
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.890
As we discussed this can become potentially expensive if you're looking at large features like this

32
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.620
one and there a three by four that's 12 values that you have to add if you if they can grow if they're

33
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.140
larger in size then is it going to be even more values that you need.

34
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.980
So basically the the larger the feature The larger the image the more you have to do some calculations

35
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.840
the more expensive that calculation is in terms of time and as we know in computer vision if we especially

36
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.220
for real time computer vision then time is very valuable we cannot.

37
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.630
We want to minimize the amount of time we spend calculating and plus you need to not only evaluate one

38
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.580
feature there can be lots and lots of features that you want to evaluate in one image.

39
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.360
So again another reason to minimize the time spent on this.

40
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.880
So what are going to do now is we are going to put this image the side here.

41
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.710
Are we going to forget about the box for now.

42
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.010
We'll get back to it.

43
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.130
I now we're going to move to constructing the integral image So here we've got the image on the left

44
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.670
and on the right.

45
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.830
We're going to create the integral image integral image is exactly the same size as the original image.

46
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.540
And all you need to do to calculate the integral image is a very interesting operation.

47
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.930
So for any given square in the interval and let's take the square for example the value that will reside

48
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.810
in that square is the sum of the values on the original image above and to the left.

49
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.180
So the square is here.

50
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.260
That means we take all of the values that are sitting here and the original image and we add them put

51
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.440
their sum into the integral image.

52
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.200
So in this case it's one plus 9 10 2 plus 8 25 plus 0 25.

53
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.450
And that's why we're going to put 25 again.

54
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:23.030
Now there's another one just to solidify this process was just around the square here.

55
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.100
So in order to calculate this square we're going to have to calculate all of the values they like to

56
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.330
take.

57
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:38.040
And it's not like over here which is this square and then go up and left and everything in this rectangle.

58
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.710
We need to add them up and put them put them into that squares.

59
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.970
If you add them up you'll get all 134.

60
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.500
And that's the value that goes into this square in integral image.

61
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.970
Now what we're going to do is we're going to fill in the whole integral image exactly that way so you

62
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.790
can just if you would like to you can pull this video and you just stick your hand value.

63
00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.500
So for instance 201 here would be the sum of all of the values that are in this rectangle.

64
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.460
And so that is how you calculate the integral image and so why do why do we use integral.

65
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:15.530
Because it's a very efficient hack to the exact problem that we have with the exact challenge we have

66
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.850
of calculating those howre like features.

67
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.100
And the reason for that is because HARLICK features are actually rectangle so let's have a look at an

68
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.670
example here.

69
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.010
So back to square that we originally were rectangle there were originally identified so we wanted we

70
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.360
said that hypothetically we want to calculate the sum of all of the values inside this rectangle in

71
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.900
order to evaluate a certain horror like feature.

72
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.070
And so what we would do here is we would use the integral image to help us remember we said that in

73
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.200
this original image if if we took our original approach of just adding stuff up we would have to do

74
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.310
four times three 12 you'd have to add up 12 values.

75
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.350
Now let's see one integral image can help us do so in an integral image what we'll do is we'll take

76
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.720
the value that represents this bottom right corner but we'll take an integral image.

77
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.660
So there it is.

78
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.660
And so this value is actually what does it represent.

79
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.940
It represents the sum of all of the values in here.

80
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.560
So let's outline them.

81
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.390
There they are.

82
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.500
So that's the sum of all those values is 235 So write that down at the bottom 235.

83
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.570
Now we're going to take the value in the top right corner just above the top right corner of rectangle.

84
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.000
And that value that 83 is the sum of everything.

85
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.980
Above all rectangle above.

86
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.140
In this area in these first two lines.

87
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:49.130
So if we subtract this new value from our existing value from 2 3 5 then we will remove all of these

88
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.420
values.

89
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.560
So we'll take it out.

90
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.840
So you can see like 235 we've got this big red box that's shaded.

91
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.150
If we subtract eighty three we will get just this box.

92
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.620
So let's write that down.

93
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.020
Now we're going to take the value in the top left just above the top left corner of rectangle So this

94
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.340
value over here of course ponse to this is a space in the image or here.

95
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.700
And that means if we add it we will add back this rectangle.

96
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.050
So it might be a bit counterintuitive but we're going to add it back because that's going to help us

97
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.590
in the next step.

98
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.020
So we added back and now finally we're going to take the value at the bottom left corner over here and

99
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.720
we'll subtract that as well because that represents the values on all of this rectangle.

100
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.400
So if we subtract that and write that down as you can see what we're left with is exactly that rectangle

101
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.770
that we are after in the first place.

102
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.780
So we took that value subtract that value.

103
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.850
So it took that value subtract that value took the green bottom right value over here.

104
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.840
Thirty five to check that A-3 added 47 to 71 34.

105
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:01.040
And the result is 65 and that is exactly what we were after.

106
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:09.650
So as you can see we only needed to perform four operations in order to calculate this rectangle the

107
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.610
sum of the values inside this rectangle as opposed to.

108
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.690
So when we need to to add or subtract for values as opposed to 12 values if you're doing it by hand

109
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.700
if we had to calculate every single you know add them all up here.

110
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:27.650
And the beauty of this is you will always only need to look at for values regardless of the size of

111
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:33.050
the rectangle so even if your rectangle is a thousand by a thousand you will still only need to look

112
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.850
at four values in the integral image whereas in the original image you would have to deal with 1000

113
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.550
times 1000 You have to deal with a million values.

114
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:47.420
So as you can see the integral image doesn't scale it does the time it takes you to process the integral

115
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:55.880
image doesn't change proportionately and doesn't change at all regardless of the size of the feature

116
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.560
that you're dealing with.

117
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.790
And therefore it makes it very easy and once again it is only possible to use an integral image because

118
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:08.010
as you remember all of the horror like features there are actually rectangles there actually are composed

119
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.220
comprised of rectangles black or white rectangle so you always will need to look at rectangles as like

120
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:19.310
a circle in there if there was some odd looking shape then it wouldn't be possible to help to use the

121
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.640
integral image.

122
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.530
And so that's why the hard features of while powerful are because even though they might not be ideal

123
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.830
they might not ideally find the right of the exact features of an image there might be a bit rigid some

124
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.700
in some places because they're just rectangles at the same time they make up for that with their computational

125
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:47.090
efficiency because we're using the integral image and that's one of the major advantages of horror like

126
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.560
features because you might find better features like circles or some other features that might be better

127
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:59.140
classifiers overall but because hard but HARLICK features they are much easier to calculate through

128
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.520
the integral image therefore you can use a lot of them you can use it you can evaluate them much much

129
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.230
quicker and that's why they make up.

130
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.630
So there we go that's how the integral image works.

131
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:18.200
And that's why it's such a huge advantage for the viola Jones algorithm that's why it implies it.

132
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.600
And yeah I hope you enjoyed it as a tural and aliquot seeing it next time.

133
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.180
And until then enjoy computer vision.
