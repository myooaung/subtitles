00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:07,510
Hello and welcome to the homework of module to object detection as you can hear by the sound of my voice

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:14,460
I'm super excited to start this homework because in this homework we're not going to try to build a

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,730
new state of the art 20:18 computer vision moral and therefore I'm giving you this homework for three

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,930
different purposes.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,350
First to congratulate you for passing the first half of this course.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,820
Indeed we have done the two first modules there are three modules so we are more than halfway there.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,520
Then the second purpose is to make sure that you know how to use the SSD model if you want to apply

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,870
it on any other video to detect any other objects.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,090
So that's what this homework is about.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,140
I'm going to give you a new video and I just want to make sure that you are able to use the tool we

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,740
implemented in module to to detect whether objects you would like to detect in the video.

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,270
So that's the second purpose.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,230
And then the third purpose is to give you some inspiration some excitement for module 3 because module

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:10,410
3 is going to be quite huge We're going to implement a model from scratch and not any model it's one

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,620
of the most powerful models in computer vision.

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,470
That's to Gannes generally adversarial networks.

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,050
And this time we're going to implement the whole model from scratch including the training that is we're

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,700
not only going to implement the code that will do the detections and this time it's not going to be

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,050
detection it's going to be actually creation.

20
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,350
So you're going to start doing some real creation with computer vision but there is not only that we're

21
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:40,320
also going to implement the training implementation that is the code that will do the whole process

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,560
of the training and therefore we need to fuel ourselves with energy inspiration excitement.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,400
That's what I do in my day to day intrapreneur ship life.

24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,900
I'm always seeking for some positive energy is inspiration and therefore that's exactly what I'm giving

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,030
you with this homework.

26
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,940
This is going to be an exciting homework.

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,350
We're going to do some object detection on an incredibly beautiful video of some horses running in one

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,690
of my favorite places in the world not going to tell you what it is now but it's really one of the most

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,740
beautiful places in the world and actually rode the horse there.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,870
So let's do this let's do this homework.

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,260
As you can see I am starting from scratch.

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,700
The first thing we need to do is to open Anaconda.

33
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,540
There we go.

34
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,620
Anaconda is opening.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,470
Now we're going to connect to the virtual platform because indeed we're going to use the SSD and we

36
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,410
need some pre-installed packages that are all in the virtual platform.

37
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,390
So there we go applications on virtual platform.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,410
Here we are inside and now we're going to launch spider.

39
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,640
And this will open itself in the virtual platform.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,130
All right so now spider is opened.

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,170
We are connected to the virtual platform.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,570
Now the next thing we need to do is to find the homework folder for module 2.

43
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,340
So as you might guess I put it in.

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:02,280
The computer vision is that for that but then in Mudgal to object detection here it is.

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,850
That's the homework folder and it contains exactly the same codes as before except the object detection

46
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,970
code because we will implement a new code in the Statoil.

47
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,440
But you're going to see that it's going to be so simple we will just have one thing to replace and I'm

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,020
sure you know exactly what we have to replace.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,000
So that's the code the solution of the homework that we need to implement to make that detection happen.

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,320
And now I'm going to show you the video of these horses these epic horses you see.

51
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,690
I named this video Ebeye horses and one of the most beautiful places in the world my favorite place

52
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,380
in the world that I visited.

53
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,830
And in case you don't recognize it in the video.

54
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,490
This place is Monument Valley a very mythical place.

55
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,480
You can actually ride horses there and you can do some other stuff like just driving but it's really

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,680
really really mythical.

57
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,550
So I'm going to open the video now.

58
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,430
The video is also mythical And so here we go.

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,240
Let's start the show.

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,200
So here is the video.

61
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a 10 second video.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,420
This time I'm going to press play I hope you will hear the sound because there is a beautiful music

63
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,130
with these horses running.

64
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,350
That's Monument Valley that's one of the big rocks in Monument Valley.

65
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:26,310
There we go play.

66
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,330
All right.

67
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,360
I hope you liked it.

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,340
I really like this video.

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,100
I think this is absolutely fantastic.

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,810
I'm going to put it again.

71
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,530
There we go.

72
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,820
Fantastic.

73
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,410
So of course we'll will have the video.

74
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,060
You can watch it as many times as you want.

75
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,620
And so now let's do the object connection let's see what our SSD is capable of doing if it's capable

76
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,050
of detecting the horses inside the video.

77
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,490
Well this should be actually good stuff for the SSD.

78
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,510
We're going to try.

79
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,670
And therefore we're going to implement the solution.

80
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,240
So I'm closing this.

81
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,970
I have homework solution that I opened.

82
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
And so now what do you think we have to do.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,670
Well as you understood this is a very important thing to understand this computer vision.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,680
It is a good package is not only of course it's also a toolbox that we're giving you so that you can

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,940
very easily reproduce the codes we're implementing in the course.

86
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,640
So that's why I want to highlight that the only thing that we have to do right now.

87
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,970
And actually that's the same as what we did in module one phase detection.

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,380
Well we only need to take our code from the module to which is here let's take the non commented version

89
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,300
then.

90
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,930
Exactly.

91
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,420
For module one we're going to copy the whole code and then going to close this.

92
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,920
And then we're going to paste it here and do the required changes.

93
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,930
But this time it's going to be even easier than Mudgal when we only have one change to make and this

94
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,000
change is not even technical.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,440
It is just the name of the video.

96
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,560
Of course this time we're not doing some object detection on the video of the funny dog bouncing on

97
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,180
the field.

98
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,060
We're doing some object detection and epic horses.

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,400
There is this video in the homework folder.

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,790
And and as you can see the name of the video is epic on the score horses and that's exactly what we

101
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
need to replace here.

102
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,810
Funded by epic horses.

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,080
And that's it.

104
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,660
You're ready to detect the horses in the video.

105
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,500
So make sure you understand this.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,110
You have a tool that contains a model that is already pre-trained and to use this tool you just need

107
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,260
to take your video include all these files here that are the same files as what we had in Mudgal to

108
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,840
put the video inside his folder and then just change the name of the video and then you're good to go.

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,100
The only thing that you have to do is select the whole code and execute.

110
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,450
And there we go.

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,190
The detection is on its way and you can recognize the same process as what we saw in module 2.

112
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:12,890
It is processing each of the images of the video and on each of these images it is detecting the objects.

113
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:19,720
So remember we had we worked on a two second video with the funny dog and this time we work on a 10

114
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,390
seconds video the two seconds video had about 67 frames.

115
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,750
If I remember correctly.

116
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,180
So here since it's 10 seconds video it should be around multiply by five.

117
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,140
That is something around 300 frames to detect.

118
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,890
So it should go up to 300 right now.

119
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,500
But it's OK it's going to come fast and it should take around five minutes on this computer I have a

120
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,620
pretty powerful computer so it might take longer for you but definitely you will get the result in maximum

121
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,120
one hour.

122
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,520
You don't have to worry about this it's not like training as easy as we saw in the previous tutorial.

123
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,870
You should get the result in maximum one hour.

124
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:05,950
I don't know how powerful is your computer but mine is pretty powerful but it's ok it's not a computer

125
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,410
from deep mind.

126
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,870
But anyway we're not going to wait for the five minutes here.

127
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,470
I'm going to accelerate the video and I'll see you at the end for the results.

128
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,860
All right.

129
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,160
All right.

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,360
So it's about and it should be according to my calculus a little more than 300 and up.

131
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,380
No actually it's already over.

132
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,540
So it's actually less than what I expected.

133
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,970
But anyway we have the results and exactly as in muchall too the result is given in the output that

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,180
MP for video which was created by the writer object from Image.

135
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,790
All right so let's see the results now.

136
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,960
Unfortunately we're not going to have the music because of course it's only taking the frames and not

137
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,860
the audio but it's ok what matters is to see if we get some detection.

138
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,470
So here we go.

139
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,860
All right so we can see a first preview of the results.

140
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,830
So far it's great great start.

141
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,870
We can see the detections of three horses here.

142
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,230
There is more but at least it can recognize some horses.

143
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,470
And so now let's press play.

144
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,900
Let's see if the detection is 100 percent perfect or if there is some false positive.

145
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,500
That's totally possible.

146
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,140
And also let's see if it was able to detect the birds here which I would be very surprised because they're

147
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,880
really small.

148
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,380
So I don't think I was able to detect birds but if it was it would be impressive.

149
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,890
So here we go.

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,730
Let's press play and SSD.

151
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,930
Let's see what you get.

152
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,510
All right.

153
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,060
So interesting interesting I can see well some detection of horses but some false positives.

154
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,820
We're going to play back.

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,530
I saw some cows and also some dogs.

156
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,070
So we're going to play that again.

157
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,690
I don't know if you saw this two horse horse cow cow cowhorse Doug.

158
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,330
Horse horse horse horse horse.

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,850
Yes.

160
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,250
So interesting.

161
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,090
Interesting.

162
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,990
So yeah the deduction is really really good definitely but we have some false positives.

163
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,520
This was expected.

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,670
It's hard to have a 100 percent accurate model today especially for these kind of tasks.

165
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,740
So let's have a look again at the video by moving the cursor.

166
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:21,660
So here it's perfectly well to take the horses and let's move forward a little bit horse so we can detect

167
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,460
this horse here.

168
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,030
This one and this one and that's it.

169
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,790
Let's move forward.

170
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,230
And here we go with the first false positive.

171
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,220
It is detecting right here a cow.

172
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:42,030
But actually he's pretty right when we think about this this this kind of wool here that we see on this

173
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,390
horse actually looks like the one of a cow right.

174
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,880
When many times in the countryside in France.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,730
I'm sure that I've seen this wool on cows before.

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,640
So you play the game to isolate this one without the context and without everything around it.

177
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,140
Well we even humans well myself actually could confuse it with a cow.

178
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,130
That's pretty interesting.

179
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,480
It's actually a mistake that we could accept.

180
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,110
And then if we move forward again I think I saw some other false positives.

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,970
Horse horse that's perfect.

182
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,330
Great protection here and here.

183
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:22,120
Another cow and maybe that's because you know cows or there are a lot of white cows.

184
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,240
And here we don't see the head of the horse and therefore it's also easily confusable with a cow.

185
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,390
Well it's obvious here that it's a horse but due to it's white color and due to the fact that we don't

186
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,200
see the head.

187
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,420
It seems fair that the SS did confuse that with a cow.

188
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,580
Then let's move forward even more.

189
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,320
And there we go.

190
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,130
Some of the false positives but this time with some dogs.

191
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,850
So here nothing to say.

192
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,320
The horses here definitely don't look like dogs.

193
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:58,410
But this was not very easy for the SS because you know this red rectangle here detecting a dog is actually

194
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,800
for this horse here and since this horse is hidden by this horse right here.

195
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,640
Well it's actually pretty hard to recognize a horse.

196
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,270
And besides if we have a little imagination we can style transfer it to a dog.

197
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:19,200
So that would explain but again I'm telling you this is really really hard to get a 100 percent attention

198
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,510
so let's move forward.

199
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,650
Again cow another cow here.

200
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,430
We first went from a horse to a dog and now from a dog to a cow.

201
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,730
So a lot of style transfers happening here.

202
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,810
And another dog here actually.

203
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,210
OK.

204
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,620
Two cows now and one dog so that's a bad result.

205
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,030
Here we see on this frame.

206
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,980
So pretty bad.

207
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,670
But remember in the end we get some absolutely great results.

208
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,860
All right let's move forward a little bit.

209
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,970
Nothing here nothing on this frame.

210
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,490
Two dogs one dog and one cow.

211
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,760
One cow two cows or three cows.

212
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,320
OK.

213
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,160
Pretty bad.

214
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,230
It's actually a sequence.

215
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,160
You know it's actually this sequence that is pretty bad but then it's going to get better.

216
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,160
And here we go again.

217
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,630
The SS is coming back.

218
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,810
It actually got tired but now it is now back in the game detecting correctly one horse and now it's

219
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:20,710
not only getting back in the game but smashing the detection detecting three horses and again one horse

220
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,550
and one cow one horse this beautiful horse.

221
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,360
It's actually great horse running sequence here.

222
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:36,520
Then two horses three dogs one dog one cow two dogs one horse one dog and then actually I think it's

223
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,040
making some correct predictions.

224
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,710
So that's the horse.

225
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,380
Dark Horse Doug.

226
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:51,550
Here we see three horses and one dog horse cow horse horse horse horse three horses horse horse horse

227
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:58,030
three horses again three horses so as you can see the rest is really really good horse horse.

228
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,420
Some horses everywhere.

229
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,590
Everything is great horse.

230
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,970
And again while you're here it's very obvious.

231
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:15,600
We can see some really clear frames of horses and actually here we can see the perfect detection of

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,520
what is happening in the frame because we have three horses in the frame and it is detecting the three

233
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,450
horses.

234
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,060
And as I told you impossible to detect the birds here way too small.

235
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,030
It's only for the humans so far in 2017 at some I'm speaking.

236
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,030
All right.

237
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,760
And let's move on to the end.

238
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,430
All right so happy ending so perfect.

239
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,000
I hope you like this homework.

240
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,040
And mostly I hope you are now inspired for the third module this course you're going to need some energy.

241
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,170
You're going to need some focus and I can't wait.

242
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,470
Implementing the Ganns with you until then.

243
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,590
And Joe can do revision.
