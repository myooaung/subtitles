00:00:00,510  -->  00:00:03,060
All right welcome back to the students from the future.

2

00:00:03,120  -->  00:00:09,660
Again giving you another great lecture on today's lecture we are going to be learning how to read the

3

00:00:09,660  -->  00:00:10,440
file.

4

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:11,310
All right.

5

00:00:11,310  -->  00:00:15,210
So we already know how to actually open a created and even right to it.

6

00:00:15,300  -->  00:00:17,710
But now we need to know how to read it.

7

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:24,450
So let's actually create a new file right here and it's a matter of fact we can do it from the writing

8

00:00:24,450  -->  00:00:26,780
files file.

9

00:00:26,950  -->  00:00:31,890
And let's do a Save As and this call this reading files.

10

00:00:32,130  -->  00:00:32,970
Beautiful.

11

00:00:32,970  -->  00:00:33,530
All right.

12

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:39,300
So this is going to be very similar to it but we're going to have to change the W for R and R because

13

00:00:39,300  -->  00:00:46,200
that's that's for reading and instead of writing We're going to do f. read it right here and we can

14

00:00:46,200  -->  00:00:53,050
save whatever we got from there into a content variable into it.

15

00:00:53,130  -->  00:00:54,930
You can name it whatever you want.

16

00:00:55,000  -->  00:00:55,670
Right.

17

00:00:56,100  -->  00:01:03,040
And instead of having this a second parameter we're going to have the bytes.

18

00:01:03,450  -->  00:01:10,830
And now each of these bytes each by equals a character.

19

00:01:10,830  -->  00:01:11,250
All right.

20

00:01:11,260  -->  00:01:15,690
So make sure that you know that it will come in there so you know.

21

00:01:15,850  -->  00:01:20,040
So right now we're going to read 10 bytes out of this document right here.

22

00:01:20,600  -->  00:01:21,290
All right.

23

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:24,180
And what we can do is we can

24

00:01:29,500  -->  00:01:33,140
whoops right here I was like where was I.

25

00:01:33,600  -->  00:01:40,190
So what we can do is we can do an echo right here so that where we can see it on the screen.

26

00:01:40,360  -->  00:01:41,120
All right.

27

00:01:41,250  -->  00:01:43,570
So that's all we got to do for here.

28

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:49,620
For this to be on it let's go here let's refresh and we see this it says reading files.

29

00:01:49,920  -->  00:01:53,340
Let's go ahead and try to read that arises.

30

00:01:53,340  -->  00:02:00,510
I love BHB but if I take this and I say I want to read just two bytes out of it which is two characters

31

00:02:00,570  -->  00:02:05,160
I come here and refresh it just reads one byte one character.

32

00:02:05,160  -->  00:02:05,790
All right.

33

00:02:05,790  -->  00:02:11,530
So now you might be asking yourself what if you want to read the whole entire file.

34

00:02:11,880  -->  00:02:19,560
Well you can use a function that will give you the file size and this function name is file size like

35

00:02:19,560  -->  00:02:27,590
this is another built in function file size which has a whole bunch of nice functions right.

36

00:02:27,900  -->  00:02:30,290
So we can just read the whole file there.

37

00:02:30,820  -->  00:02:35,730
And now we come back here refresh we get this and it doesn't matter.

38

00:02:35,730  -->  00:02:42,610
We can write whatever we want whatever we want and we will read it for us.

39

00:02:42,610  -->  00:02:44,750
All right.

40

00:02:44,820  -->  00:02:48,690
There you go see that beautiful.

41

00:02:48,690  -->  00:02:51,040
So this is how you read a file.

42

00:02:51,540  -->  00:02:57,090
Right now keep in mind for those of you that have some type of issue reading this file make sure that

43

00:02:57,090  -->  00:02:59,430
you give the right permissions to your files.

44

00:02:59,430  -->  00:03:04,200
Sometimes we get the right permissions of the folder and then we have a problem when we are reading

45

00:03:04,200  -->  00:03:09,590
the file because that's what that Apache doesn't have permission to redo the file.

46

00:03:09,640  -->  00:03:14,900
But but everything should work 100 percent they already show you how to go and get a D.

47

00:03:15,000  -->  00:03:17,540
The solution for any permission problem.

48

00:03:17,550  -->  00:03:18,200
All right.

49

00:03:18,480  -->  00:03:20,280
Thank you so much for watching this lecture.

50

00:03:20,280  -->  00:03:21,340
It was a pleasure.

51

00:03:21,400  -->  00:03:22,590
And I'll see you in the next one.

52

00:03:22,590  -->  00:03:23,610
Take care.
