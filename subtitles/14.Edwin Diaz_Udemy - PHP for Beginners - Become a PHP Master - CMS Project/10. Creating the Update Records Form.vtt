00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.390
High on the last video we learn how to read data from the database right on this Venia we're going to

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.310
be learning how to update the data using BHB is going to be really fun.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.790
But first I want to start separating the code into functions so that we can use it with any other files.

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.260
And this is what BHP is all about.

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.900
So I think it's about time we start doing this.

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.270
All right so I want to create a separate file for that connection.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.600
So that way every time I make a new function or a new element on my web or application I can just we

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.940
use this file every time.

9
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.670
I don't have to keep copying and pasting the same code over and over in all the pages.

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.280
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to do a Save ass on this log in underscore.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.840
Read up here.

12
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.290
And for us I want open this right here so.

13
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.830
So I can see where I'm going.

14
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.190
So let's just make it Logan on the score of the enter.

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.760
All right.

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.570
Now that we have this file that we can work with.

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.620
Basically what we are going to be doing is code refactoring right.

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.410
Right click here.

19
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.720
I'm going to create a new file.

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.520
And this is where I'm going to put my database DB up BHP.

21
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.450
All right.

22
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.340
This is where we're going to be put in the database.

23
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.840
So let's take this off.

24
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.530
Logging on the score update.

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.450
Let's take it all from there and let's put it in the D-B right here.

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.180
First it's open a BHB tag right here.

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.590
Right.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.130
There we go.

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.220
And let's go back to all of the I want to show you what happens when you you already know what happens

30
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.340
when you take the connection off.

31
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.070
It says undefined variable connection so we have a problem now where we don't have the connection here

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740
because we just took it off.

33
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.200
Well the trick is that you need to use a function called include and this function will bring in.

34
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.110
And let me show you how that works.

35
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
We bring in our file from from the D-B that BHB.

36
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.440
So we going to we're going include includeonly dot BHB let's make sure we put a semi-colon there.

37
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.760
And that way we get back to file.

38
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.680
Now we are using this file DB for our connection for database.

39
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.240
All right.

40
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.890
That's pretty cool now right.

41
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.840
So now we don't have to have this cold right here is that it was a mess before.

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.950
Right.

43
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.650
So now these three now so what are we going to do here.

44
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.540
How are we going to update this stuff.

45
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.830
All right.

46
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.330
First of all we don't need this right here.

47
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.190
All right let's make this a little smaller like this.

48
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.810
We need actually a file that we can put things in there in

49
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.530
a form a little form where we can put a user name and password.

50
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.200
And we can click all day and all of the data similar to the one we have on the create.

51
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.500
If you look at it create one.

52
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.050
We have this so what we want is a form like this where we can put our user name we can put a password

53
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.850
and then we can have an ID field here and click submitting.

54
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.040
We'll update that.

55
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.370
So that's what we want to do.

56
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.290
So let's go ahead and take some of this cold from here and use that because why.

57
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.670
Why write something else when we have this cold here right.

58
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.730
So let's just take this off here.

59
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.790
Copy it and bring it down to the to that log in update.

60
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.400
And let's go ahead and do it right here.

61
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.440
Let's just take all this off.

62
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.220
Stick with that.

63
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.820
We're going to fix something else in there.

64
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.670
Take this off and put on a cord right here.

65
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.440
All right.

66
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.370
So this looks like this because my resolution if I make it smaller you can see that it looks neat.

67
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.080
It looks more need them well that is there.

68
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.660
Just make sure we have that.

69
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.660
You see that it looks neater but if I make it big so you can see that's when the problem comes.

70
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.690
But anyway I hope you are not lost there.

71
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.060
All right so now we have this forum here.

72
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.550
And if I save it we have something like this there.

73
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.060
Now we need an ID field here for that.

74
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.420
I'm going to use a Select.

75
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.510
So let's do that.

76
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.700
Let's use a Select that is first used a this foreign group thing that we've been using with this framework

77
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.370
style framework through strap.

78
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.970
All right.

79
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.370
Let's go ahead and make a Selectric here.

80
00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.810
Right.

81
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.990
We're going to have a couple options in there.

82
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.450
There we go.

83
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.680
And this is what I do for now here.

84
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.740
So when we come back here we see that we have that there.

85
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.730
They just put one as a placeholder.

86
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.020
OK.

87
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.130
So we have that the one.

88
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.940
So what we want to do again.

89
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.830
Let me just right here of this so you get a better idea.

90
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:34.270
We are going to put a user name here whatever user name we want and whatever pass we want.

91
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.090
And we've got to go to the database click here and it's going to pick up an I.D. from the database.

92
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.960
I'm going to show you the idea that is going to pick up our co-host

93
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.840
now cause I'm sorry BHB my admin.

94
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.230
That's where I want to go right here.

95
00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.860
All right.

96
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.240
I want to show you this little application is going to be doing.

97
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.550
If you don't already know.

98
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.930
Let's go to users and.

99
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.020
All right.

100
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.920
So you see this idea right here.

101
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.730
This is the idea that we are going to be picking up on the field right here.

102
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.280
We're going to read the database and put that I did dynamic lead here so that we when we click here

103
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.570
we're going to have a list of IDS here.

104
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.720
And when we choose an I.D. Why let's say we choose the number one and we'll put whatever username and

105
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.470
whatever possible when we click update these data is going to change right here the user name is going

106
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.660
to change and the past is going to change for this specific I.D. in this case is going to be ID number

107
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.310
one.

108
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.400
So if I could I don't know Jose here or something and whatever password in that click Update.

109
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.890
This first idea is going to change.

110
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:53.510
Right.

111
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.240
Because that's the idea that I'm picking up over there.

112
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.070
Now the I.D. the user name is going to change referring to ID number one and the password.

113
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.260
So that's what we are doing here.

114
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.220
Right.

115
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.700
So let's finish refactoring this real quick.

116
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.610
All right so the next thing that we've got to do is we've got to bring that information from the database.

117
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:21.730
So I'm just going to cut the video here because I think is enough let's just do one more thing before

118
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.610
I cut the video.

119
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.780
And we're going to do it in the next video.

120
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.170
We're going to do the query to the database.

121
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.130
Let's go to the divi first.

122
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.950
And instead of saying we are connected that annoying text there all the time let's just say if not connection

123
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.310
then we get an error.

124
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:39.800
Right.

125
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.790
So you just take all this off here.

126
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.620
So if not connection then we get all this going here.

127
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.310
All right.

128
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:59.970
So for example if I make a mistake here Ira I make this mistake here and I put this here and it's not

129
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.770
connected then we get an error right here.

130
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.250
You see that

131
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.670
and that you get an error.

132
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.190
Give us an error in the other file.

133
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.760
So let's go down to our logging off day.

134
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.970
And you see we have a narrow here.

135
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.060
OK.

136
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.760
So let's go ahead and fix that.

137
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.620
All right so let's just call it a hand safe.

138
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:20.960
All right.

139
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.110
So now we go so we don't get that we are connected all the time there.

140
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.630
Right.

141
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.990
So anyway on the next video here we are going to be updating we're going to be pulling information from

142
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.800
the database dynamically.

143
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.390
We're going to put it up pulling the ID from the database from specific fields.

144
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.060
OK.

145
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.940
So anyway thank you so much and I see you in the next lecture.
