1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,830
All right guys I had to go get something to eat because I was hungry.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,810
I couldn't even record one video without hearing my stomach going crazy.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:11,540
But anyway.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,100
So here we are.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,100
And that was still working at it.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:16,980
OK.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,080
Let's organize this just a little bit.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,590
Now the next step is clicking here real quick.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,750
Here.

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,880
Go the next step.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,270
We should make is to play a little bit around with this stuff here.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,190
OK.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,390
So I just take this for reference only I take it to the back to the functions OK.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,250
So let's come back here and let's say we want to get all

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,500
users publish

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,920
posts.

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:12,270
Actually like this how we go.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,560
So let's think about this for a minute.

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:24,460
We want to get all the published polls for the user that should be very simple to do.

20
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:30,960
Matter of fact list you get one of these guys out here they say here and we just need another statement

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,130
here we just need another then post status.

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,780
I believe that's the name of the and should be equal to publish.

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,560
Shall we go.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,690
That's And we should make one for the draft as well.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,550
Let's now that we're here right.

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,630
Draft.

27
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,590
See how easy this thing is guys.

28
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,770
Now in the future you know if I was starting this mess from scratch.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,310
Now I will instead of using strings to say publish and draft I will use one for those published posts

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,080
and zero for draft OK for active and instead are using POST status.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,690
I will use status just like that.

32
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,640
OK.

33
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,310
If I was starting this from scratch I started this.

34
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,470
You know it was a very small project like I mentioned before and just got really big over time without

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,650
much planning to make it that big.

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,170
Just because you guys are always making requests so we can start actually coming here.

37
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,690
And replacing some of the stuff like that.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,110
That's the published polls count that's my fact.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,710
Yeah that's what it is.

40
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:59,010
But we need to make sure that he has the I always say records for us count records.

41
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,950
And then let's see if that changes right.

42
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,890
We'll pass on the fine connection that is in functions.

43
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,680
Let's refresh here again.

44
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,500
Publish.

45
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,740
Oh yeah I think I left that in the now fix it yeah.

46
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,140
That's my ADHD or something.

47
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,980
Here we go.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,920
A very real connection that is in

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,770
connection function.

50
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,830
Eighty six with it.

51
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,470
Oh that's because I have all this stuff here.

52
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,310
I was going to say too early for that.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,850
All right.

54
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,090
So active posts so they usually has one active pose.

55
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,780
He has one posting Torro.

56
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,610
And let's check out the draft let's do this for the draft.

57
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,040
As a matter of fact you can copy the whole thing he is very similar

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh we have to do is change the draft here.

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,280
This is from which you srong.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,720
Come on.

61
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,230
Oh right.

62
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,670
This refresh.

63
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,900
And yeah he says we don't have any draft post.

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,990
Let's see that's true user would ID number 28 come forward please one here.

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,760
And he says he has one publish post doesn't have any more.

66
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,420
So yeah that's awesome.

67
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,310
Are some guys learning a lot.

68
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,340
Let's take this all the way to the top.

69
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,030
Put it there.

70
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,030
Just because we can.

71
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,980
So awesome.

72
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,330
You guys are more awesome than I am.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,560
So let's do approve and describe it in the next lecture guys just to make things short.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,370
See you in the next one.

75
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,730
Take care.
