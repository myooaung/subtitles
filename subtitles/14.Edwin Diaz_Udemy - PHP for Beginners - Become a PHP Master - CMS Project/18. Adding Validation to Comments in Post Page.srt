00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,520
Welcome back my students in this lecture here we are going to be improving our CMOS a little bit.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,210
I want to show you a functionality that I want to improve.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,310
I hope you're doing good and having a great day because I'm having an awesome day I have a chance to

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,480
teach you something new today.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:22,140
So what I want to teach you is let's go to you will post right here I want you to pay very close attention

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,570
to these comments.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,400
Number right here.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,280
All right.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,770
Now if I go to the front of the side I'm going to right click and go there and I click on many of these

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,220
post pages.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,790
All right.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,050
You can see that we have a title here that we need to remove.

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,290
That's one improvement and another improvement is that we are also going to be if I click here you can

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,620
see that this is empty right.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,090
We don't we don't see anything we're not letting the user know that they can't do that.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,550
They can i just click here and Swaminathan we have to let them know that this field cannot be empty.

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:53,870
Right.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,940
So we've got to let them know that with some javascript we are going to be using BHB to produce.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,320
All right.

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,510
So let's go ahead and let me show you what happened to this number.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,880
If I click enter you can see that number increased.

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,330
Right that is a problem.

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,220
I'm going to show you the problem how that is happening.

24
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,810
So in your root directory and you see a mass folder go to post up BHB which should be very close to

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,880
index that BHB and find this if set create value right here.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,540
All right.

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:39,930
Well the problem the problem is that when we click the form by the submit button or this query gets

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,740
executed and he's not checking to see if these fields are empty or not.

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,240
So let's go ahead and do that.

30
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,870
Let's go ahead and checked to see if the schools are empty or not.

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:57,450
And all this stuff here that we're finding or we are improving our site is being left by me intentionally

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,330
because I want you to learn new features.

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,730
All right we can well of course from the beginning do all these great things and you know and build

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,040
this.

35
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:11,280
But but then you won't learn how to actually improve your CIMS you will learn how to do the first time

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,940
just one way and that's it.

37
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,960
You know you know you won't be learning but if you build a system if you see a system like this and

38
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,430
we keep improving it then that means you use your mind to be creative.

39
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,210
All right.

40
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,490
And and then he helps you see problems and fix them.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,010
So anyway does my whole idea hopefully you agree with me.

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:30,530
OK.

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,240
Now you can send me a message and let me know.

44
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,650
But I've been teaching for a while I know what works for my students or how they can learn better.

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,620
So I think this is very beneficial for you.

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,350
So anyways so if it's said here we need to actually provide another statement and that's how I want

47
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,760
to do it.

48
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,430
There are a couple of different ways of doing it but this is actually the best way for you right now

49
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,050
for this system.

50
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,510
So I'm going to create another statement here and I'm going to check for these fields to see if they're

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,840
empty or not.

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,680
All right.

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:12,480
So first I want to actually cut all this because I don't want this to run on unless we first check actually

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,380
hold on.

55
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,280
Let's just cut this one off and put it right here right because we need this before the IF statement.

56
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,090
And let's cut the rest and paste it in between the statement.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,670
All right.

58
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,260
So that's going to be the Querrey or the wiring there all right information from the form is going to

59
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,380
be outside.

60
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,750
So how we're going to be checking to see if this feels empty Do you remember a function that I use very

61
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,540
simple function as a matter of fact has the name of where we want to do.

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,570
All right so let's use this knot and then let's use the empty function.

63
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,970
Let me just make this a little bigger so you can see that we go.

64
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,390
I think that should be visible for you.

65
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,060
Put this to the side here.

66
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,570
All right.

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,700
So if it's not empty was not empty the comment.

68
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:11,240
All right then we are going to be using that and Procyon here a couple times right twice.

69
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,390
This means.

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,280
And for those of you that forgot already I'm just going to copy this and paste it here a couple of times

71
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,790
and then just change the name of it for the e-mail.

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,260
When I checked for the e-mail field and for the content field.

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,050
All right.

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,180
So this is not empty.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,940
Then we're going to run on this square and this is going to happen if not then let's go ahead and do

76
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:44,580
on if statement and let's do it before we finish that if set create come and here right here else.

77
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,870
So here I want to show you on a really neat trick with BHB and Javascript.

78
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,980
For those of you that don't know javascript you should know javascript is super useful.

79
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,430
I got a really good course on it right.

80
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,630
So let's go ahead and open source script hacks just like we doing actually e-mail and descript of course

81
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,450
I'm going to be dynamic right.

82
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:17,380
So I'm also going to be using on a function call alert and some single quotes here because it will put

83
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,570
double cords you know we will close your statement before it happens.

84
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,220
So let's say fields cannot be empty.

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
All right safe.

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,900
Let's go back and check that out.

87
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,810
All right.

88
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,560
So I'm going to refresh this here.

89
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,110
Whoops.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,520
We have an error here and 77.

91
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,110
OK.

92
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,970
Let's check it out real quick.

93
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,890
I might have forgot so then you probably saw.

94
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,630
You didn't tell me.

95
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,510
Right.

96
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,810
So two two.

97
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,910
Let me just make this morning because I can see where I make the mistake.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,720
It says 77.

99
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,270
If it's not empty.

100
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,080
I made the mistake right here for I forgot the ampersand twice.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,740
Here we go.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,820
It was easy.

103
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,020
Boom boom boom boom boom boom.

104
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:17,670
If I click here we get this super Bhatra he says fields cannot be empty so we got some javascript helping

105
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,420
us right.

106
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,720
Beautiful.

107
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,450
That is just beautiful.

108
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,470
So now if we go back to outman I'm just going to reichlich angle and go there.

109
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,840
And we go to the polls.

110
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,800
This is not going to be incremental because jousters stopping it.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,520
Click again.

112
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,870
Come come back here.

113
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,050
Refresh.

114
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,410
Nothing.

115
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,380
All right so perfect.

116
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,640
So we learn a new feature here for those of you that are happy with what I'm showing you and with all

117
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,500
this improving and for features.

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,820
Please take the time take one minute of your time and write me a review help me out.

119
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,910
Create more lectures and more videos for you more courses in the future.

120
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,260
All right.

121
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,370
I'm planning to create a lot of horses right now and I need your support.

122
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,760
So for those of you out there that like it just take one minute of your time.

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,690
Thank you so much.

124
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,760
And I see you in the next lecture by
