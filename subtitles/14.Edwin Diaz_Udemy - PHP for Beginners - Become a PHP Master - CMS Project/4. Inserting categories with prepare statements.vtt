00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.100
Welcome back my students so we learn a lot on the last couple lectures.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.150
We learned how to use prepared statements that's pretty cool but we learn how to fetch it how to fetch

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.540
the data.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:09.860
Why.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.480
Well we learn how to prepare.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.620
We learn how to bind it we learn how to execute.

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.920
Basically you've got to follow the sense steps but the last one here Banyon the resoled.

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
You only do this when you want to fetch some data right when you want to get the result out.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.760
But let's actually test this out with insert categories here.

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.310
So this functionality.

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.140
Super simple.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.150
This is what we got right here.

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.870
So right here we are inserting some data in this field here.

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.680
Now this is not a it's not really this is not coming from from outside because they're using here.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.580
But what if the user knew our pages and they want to put the square is under you or else they know everything.

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.190
And I didn't know how to get to our pages and in the end they know how to put queries in there you are

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.750
able.

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.090
So they can still do a secure injection even though the 9 syre application from outside.

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.880
So how we do this here.

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.570
First of all here we're checking for some method we're checking for is empty.

21
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.250
Here is what we're doing this.

22
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.790
So the first step is replacing this loops

23
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.120
with the prepared statement function.

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:39.360
We first want to parse the connection then we come here we placed these variable of course where if

25
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.250
you don't have to what I like to do it as T and T and T there.

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.480
And let's just take this out and give it up and put it in one line values.

27
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.800
And remember we don't pass the whole value we pass the question mark.

28
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.710
Now here you don't have to do this because you're going to do a couple of things here.

29
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:14.120
First of all you're going to say my eschew a lie as you lie as TMT and you are going to bind the programs

30
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.540
here.

31
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.860
Super simple.

32
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.230
See if I remember correctly.

33
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.720
Yes.

34
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.590
Per annum.

35
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.880
Now when you using a lot of frameworks you're not really doing this.

36
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.070
This is when you're doing BHP from scratch.

37
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.060
So when you see that I forget some of the function guys speech is huge.

38
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.310
And I use a lot of tools every day I don't codes from scratch every single day.

39
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.080
So it's not you know it's hard to keep everything intact on you know you have to keep going back to

40
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.770
the documentation and taking a look at it.

41
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.550
So when you see me forget stuff is because you know that that happens when you use a lot of tools and

42
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.190
when you don't use this everyday.

43
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.170
So but the concept is the same I mean once you learn it you already you don't have to really do everything

44
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.920
from scratch.

45
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.360
You already know this stuff.

46
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.460
You start to remember the functionalities and the parameters.

47
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.500
So we pass a statement here and we're going to say the same is going to be a string and string is going

48
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.660
to be the CAD title.

49
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.760
We fire him.

50
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.140
And that's where we want to fetch.

51
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:23.400
So we can serve on the input and then you said to cutis as TMT.

52
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.200
That's a cute way.

53
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.340
And what are we executing well we execute in this string are made the statement that say and then here

54
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.970
what you can do is you can grab this guy here and pass it right here and you can check forward to see

55
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.580
if it's if it works.

56
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.280
Let's say this and see if it works if it does and we'll fix it.

57
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.000
But let's add something else just at PI.

58
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.950
And there you can see it works.

59
00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:04.080
If we make some type of mistake here and we pass there saving back here refresh around and we can see

60
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.800
that we have a problem.

61
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.610
And this is a type of errors that hackers would see when they try to do this.

62
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.250
If you have the errors turned on on your website.

63
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.890
So make sure that if you are in production turn them off because you don't want them to see stuff like

64
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.240
this because that gives them an idea where they can do.

65
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.020
OK they have the they see the functions that you're using and they see your pathing all that.

66
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.310
OK.

67
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.370
So this is their insertion.

68
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.680
Really simple guys the same thing with all of them.

69
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.550
You prepare it you bind it you execute it.

70
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.220
That's all you're going to be doing for all of them.

71
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.090
See you in the next lectures.
