1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,450
Or write so now that we've made that table put some data into it.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,870
Fix the links and make the pages we need to modify a couple of things.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,840
Our users tables don't look like our category tables right.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,790
Of course not.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:16,330
Well they look like it but they don't have the same columns right.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,100
So we need to fix that.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,820
So let's go to the user's view all users.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:26,310
That's the first one we are going to be facing view users and here on top which you have the headings

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,090
right here.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:36,040
So let's go ahead and open let's just open our DHP our users table here in the database.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:42,800
Let's just put it to the side here and let's go ahead and get some of this stuff right.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,430
So on the first one we have the ID then here we have the user name and the password we're not going

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,960
to show that of course not first name my last name

14
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:09,810
would go last name and not name name would it.

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,450
I right.

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,350
An e-mail would be nice right.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
What else can we display by the user.

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,820
We can display an image but we can do that in the user name.

19
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,980
Sigh there so that's fine.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,160
What about role.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,370
Is that something that we can do.

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,810
Yeah.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,710
We can do roll roll actually roll that's fine roll.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,680
And that said for now we've got something else that will we'll put it in later on but right now that's

25
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,880
it for now.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,560
That day it was created that would be nice to know.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,030
And this is the lead on this.

28
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,220
So we've got one two three four five six seven this year save IList see how it looks.

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,930
Let's go here.

30
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,390
Refresh.

31
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,540
All right.

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,470
Perfect.

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,300
Right.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,090
So what else.

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,450
All right.

36
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,400
I think that looks pretty good.

37
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,390
I think we're going to leave the rest to during the next lecture says we're going to do a lot of modification.

38
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,630
It's going to take some time to do so in the next lecture.

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:25,740
We're going to continue modifying the of your users and trying to display some data from our table in

40
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,610
the database.

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,110
All right.

42
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,890
Thank you so much.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,070
And I see your next lecture
