00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:06,390
All right welcome back I'm a student so my name's Edwin Of course I'm used truck to but I'm Edwin from

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:10,370
the future and I'm here just to make things a little bit easier for you.

3

00:00:10,380  -->  00:00:10,650
All right.

4

00:00:10,650  -->  00:00:15,950
On this blog and up BHB we have created this blogging functionality but this is now working for everybody

5

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:16,530
right.

6

00:00:16,530  -->  00:00:17,730
Some of you are having issues.

7

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:19,590
Maybe not maybe yes.

8

00:00:19,980  -->  00:00:23,870
But I come here just to make this functionality a lot easier for everybody.

9

00:00:23,960  -->  00:00:24,380
All right.

10

00:00:24,420  -->  00:00:29,940
Even though in the future we're going to be changing this into a more advance and easier system.

11

00:00:29,940  -->  00:00:35,730
Believe it or not so in later lectures many probably many lectures after this we are going to change

12

00:00:35,730  -->  00:00:39,150
this because we're going to be adding a lot more lectures you're going to see a lot more lectures in

13

00:00:39,150  -->  00:00:39,540
the course.

14

00:00:39,540  -->  00:00:42,660
But anyway let me make this a lot easier.

15

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:43,080
All right.

16

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:49,740
I wanted to show you how to use the L F and ignore that in the course because my goal was in the past

17

00:00:49,770  -->  00:00:55,310
was to show you and still is was to show you how to use all the functionalities all the things that

18

00:00:55,320  -->  00:01:00,500
you learned in the course in the course in the beginning to apply to see a mess.

19

00:01:00,810  -->  00:01:04,990
So that's why I created some of these functionality using else if any else.

20

00:01:05,100  -->  00:01:11,520
But we can make this a little easier and let me show you instead of having this not checking if this

21

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:17,150
is not equal to this we can say OK let's just make sure that this is equal to that.

22

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:18,720
And this is equal to this.

23

00:01:18,720  -->  00:01:23,680
And we can make it very strict by doing three equal symbols.

24

00:01:23,760  -->  00:01:27,280
All right two equal symbol makes it equal.

25

00:01:27,300  -->  00:01:29,140
This would make it identical.

26

00:01:29,190  -->  00:01:37,500
So it needs to be this just to make sure that the pass were in use in this pass when this pass is exactly

27

00:01:37,500  -->  00:01:38,540
identical.

28

00:01:38,560  -->  00:01:40,070
But anyway.

29

00:01:40,500  -->  00:01:41,520
So if it's the same.

30

00:01:41,520  -->  00:01:42,400
What we want to do.

31

00:01:42,450  -->  00:01:46,720
Well we want to set some sessions so that way we can use them later.

32

00:01:47,030  -->  00:01:51,360
Whoops right there.

33

00:01:51,360  -->  00:01:53,460
All right so we got the sessions and then we ran.

34

00:01:53,550  -->  00:01:59,680
We want to redirect to admin and we don't need this one and we don't even need these.

35

00:01:59,690  -->  00:02:01,450
What else if here.

36

00:02:01,450  -->  00:02:02,510
There we go.

37

00:02:02,970  -->  00:02:04,150
All right.

38

00:02:04,140  -->  00:02:05,700
That means check the curly brackets.

39

00:02:05,700  -->  00:02:07,940
See if they match this one matches.

40

00:02:07,950  -->  00:02:11,760
And this all matches the function idea up here.

41

00:02:11,760  -->  00:02:13,320
All right so I hope you see what we did.

42

00:02:13,320  -->  00:02:14,460
Super simple.

43

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:20,220
If they use any from the form and they a name from the databases are the same and if possible from the

44

00:02:20,220  -->  00:02:23,130
form and the puzzle from the database is the same.

45

00:02:23,190  -->  00:02:28,620
We set these values here and redirect to outman else.

46

00:02:28,620  -->  00:02:34,240
Something went wrong here and then we redirect it back to when it's super simple right.

47

00:02:34,680  -->  00:02:36,720
But anyway thank you so much for watching.

48

00:02:36,720  -->  00:02:40,510
Hopefully this will help some of you out there and I'll see you in the next lecture
