1

00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:04,360
All right welcome back my dear student now.

2

00:00:04,700  -->  00:00:10,980
So in the last lecture we were able to create this code here that would pool the ID from that specific

3

00:00:11,280  -->  00:00:11,830
link.

4

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:12,830
Right.

5

00:00:12,840  -->  00:00:14,960
So now that's beautiful and everything right.

6

00:00:15,150  -->  00:00:16,710
But we need more than a link.

7

00:00:16,710  -->  00:00:21,680
We need more than the ID to THE LEAD at night and we need to send out get requests.

8

00:00:21,900  -->  00:00:27,150
So if we go up a little bit we can see that we are getting a get requests from that comment that our

9

00:00:27,150  -->  00:00:34,490
link right here and the ref we're getting it from postop BHB and he has the idea of specific folks.

10

00:00:34,500  -->  00:00:35,000
Right.

11

00:00:35,160  -->  00:00:35,950
So we need that.

12

00:00:36,000  -->  00:00:40,920
Let's copy this copy and let's go back all the way down.

13

00:00:40,920  -->  00:00:41,460
All right.

14

00:00:41,640  -->  00:00:48,120
So now we can create a variable here let's call it delete on the score you throw some quotes around

15

00:00:48,120  -->  00:00:49,590
it and paste that in there.

16

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:54,830
Now we have this dynamic BHB data here we don't need this here.

17

00:00:54,930  -->  00:00:56,410
It's not going to work for us.

18

00:00:56,430  -->  00:01:01,120
What we need is some dynamic javascript data.

19

00:01:01,130  -->  00:01:08,700
And I just put too close symbol here because we are going to concatenate string in a javascript variable

20

00:01:09,300  -->  00:01:14,190
and that's how you do it in javascript and I have a really good course in Giac work by the way in javascript

21

00:01:14,860  -->  00:01:15,500
anyway.

22

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:21,850
So now we have this delete link right with everything with you are l n d id.

23

00:01:21,870  -->  00:01:28,630
And if you want to see it we've got to do is face sitting here save it.

24

00:01:29,580  -->  00:01:30,540
And

25

00:01:33,660  -->  00:01:37,310
I'm super hungry so in the last lecture I messed up.

26

00:01:37,410  -->  00:01:39,140
So I had to recreate the lecture.

27

00:01:39,210  -->  00:01:42,770
But anyway if you click on it you can see the whole linking here.

28

00:01:42,810  -->  00:01:49,530
I was actually I created a lecture where I was checking for a value in this link here when I was supposed

29

00:01:49,530  -->  00:01:52,130
to be checking in the Moldau and I'll show you in a minute.

30

00:01:52,390  -->  00:01:57,710
But I was I'm still so hungry but I say you know why I'm going to finish it and I'm going to do it.

31

00:01:57,900  -->  00:02:01,060
And then I go eating which is pretty bad idea.

32

00:02:01,050  -->  00:02:02,370
When you hungry you shouldn't code.

33

00:02:02,400  -->  00:02:02,850
Right.

34

00:02:03,000  -->  00:02:09,810
But anyway so now that we have to delete the whole link here with the ideal we have to do is insert

35

00:02:09,810  -->  00:02:14,510
it in the Moldau right here and this ref.

36

00:02:14,520  -->  00:02:15,970
And we already have an ID right.

37

00:02:15,990  -->  00:02:21,900
So we grab this and this is where I messed up on the last video which I was thinking I was checking

38

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:31,550
for this for this value here in the link in this one like for 20 minutes if you don't believe me sometimes

39

00:02:31,560  -->  00:02:34,610
you can get really stuck on little simple things right.

40

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:39,070
But anyway let's go to our viewer polls page here.

41

00:02:39,100  -->  00:02:48,790
When a piece that in there for now but what we want to do really is target that right.

42

00:02:48,840  -->  00:02:56,350
And we are going to be targeting the 8 TTR a Tref.

43

00:02:56,700  -->  00:03:02,090
Now we have the ATF right here it is javascript.

44

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:07,890
The beautiful thing about this little function here that not only do we grab the value of whatever attribute

45

00:03:07,890  -->  00:03:10,030
we want but we can change.

46

00:03:10,050  -->  00:03:12,990
We can put something in there in this specific function.

47

00:03:12,990  -->  00:03:21,330
So if I put a coma here and I said you know what I want to put that value in there.

48

00:03:21,460  -->  00:03:25,110
It would do it for me with a second argument right.

49

00:03:25,320  -->  00:03:28,050
So now if we save this like this

50

00:03:30,870  -->  00:03:33,970
come back here and we click here.

51

00:03:34,110  -->  00:03:37,160
Actually this is not even work here right.

52

00:03:37,500  -->  00:03:40,080
Well we don't have any events there.

53

00:03:40,080  -->  00:03:49,890
If I click on Moldau here and I right click on this link right here it should give me the H ref with

54

00:03:49,890  -->  00:03:50,430
the ID.

55

00:03:50,460  -->  00:03:51,060
But it's not.

56

00:03:51,090  -->  00:03:55,030
And this is where I made a ball when the lights video.

57

00:03:55,830  -->  00:03:56,720
All right.

58

00:03:57,000  -->  00:04:04,830
So should be inserting something in this Moldau link.

59

00:04:04,860  -->  00:04:05,510
All right.

60

00:04:05,850  -->  00:04:10,920
But it should also also be showing us them will dial when we click on it and that's not actually doing

61

00:04:10,920  -->  00:04:12,100
that either.

62

00:04:12,180  -->  00:04:15,280
So we need to do that.

63

00:04:15,880  -->  00:04:16,490
All right.

64

00:04:16,500  -->  00:04:22,150
So first of all let's check in to see what's going on with this Tref.

65

00:04:22,290  -->  00:04:23,540
Let's go back to them now.

66

00:04:23,610  -->  00:04:29,590
Here we get we get the refrain right here.

67

00:04:31,020  -->  00:04:32,860
We've got this here.

68

00:04:33,660  -->  00:04:36,790
Let's go back.

69

00:04:36,810  -->  00:04:39,230
Supposed to give us this new data here.

70

00:04:39,240  -->  00:04:43,800
And he's not doing it.

71

00:04:47,100  -->  00:04:48,900
OK.

72

00:04:48,900  -->  00:04:49,180
All right.

73

00:04:49,230  -->  00:04:55,050
I think let's go ahead and let's go and open them.

74

00:04:55,050  -->  00:04:55,690
All right.

75

00:04:55,770  -->  00:04:56,890
Let's do that.

76

00:04:57,360  -->  00:05:04,790
Let's target them all though and I think there's Mother those polled my mother now.

77

00:05:05,460  -->  00:05:06,790
That's an idea for it.

78

00:05:06,810  -->  00:05:07,680
All right.

79

00:05:08,010  -->  00:05:11,280
Let's take this one out of that we don't need it anymore save it.

80

00:05:11,430  -->  00:05:15,410
Come back here and let's target it.

81

00:05:15,730  -->  00:05:18,750
And it's a specific function here Moldau.

82

00:05:18,810  -->  00:05:21,640
And then we want to show it when we click on it.

83

00:05:22,050  -->  00:05:28,410
All right let's do that refresh.

84

00:05:28,410  -->  00:05:33,110
Click on it and it should be showing the mother for some reason he's not yet.

85

00:05:33,270  -->  00:05:35,000
Let's inspect that element on it

86

00:05:38,000  -->  00:05:42,990
and let's find out why he's not being optimal though.

87

00:05:43,020  -->  00:05:43,730
Click on it.

88

00:05:43,740  -->  00:05:46,570
Let's do a console.

89

00:05:47,190  -->  00:05:49,800
Just refreshing OK I think I know why.

90

00:05:49,800  -->  00:05:59,280
Let's go to that link as a naturalist but it doesn't have like a pound seemore Santina instead of a

91

00:05:59,280  -->  00:06:05,350
pound symbol we're going to put javascript call in void.

92

00:06:05,400  -->  00:06:10,170
I'm going to call this method and I end up with zero.

93

00:06:10,170  -->  00:06:18,440
This is going to prevent that just a pound symbol from showing up and it will not go anywhere.

94

00:06:18,570  -->  00:06:20,550
Refresh click on it.

95

00:06:20,550  -->  00:06:26,790
Now we have them all now and when we could do inspect their on it we have the link right.

96

00:06:27,000  -->  00:06:30,480
So everything is working now if we click on it.

97

00:06:30,480  -->  00:06:33,560
This is this is actually ID number 46 right.

98

00:06:33,840  -->  00:06:39,180
When we click on it now a deleted that ID number 45.

99

00:06:39,180  -->  00:06:40,650
Let's do it again let's cancel it.

100

00:06:40,650  -->  00:06:42,100
We don't want anything right.

101

00:06:42,330  -->  00:06:47,480
But we can always see that keeps deleting it beautiful.

102

00:06:47,520  -->  00:06:48,360
So now we're done.

103

00:06:48,360  -->  00:06:48,980
All right.

104

00:06:49,170  -->  00:06:55,370
I was able to do it while I was hungry which is a really bad idea and I don't recommend it.

105

00:06:55,380  -->  00:06:59,830
Eat well you know quench your thirst your thirst.

106

00:06:59,880  -->  00:07:04,000
Well and cold all day beautiful right.

107

00:07:04,020  -->  00:07:08,370
So anyway let's see.

108

00:07:08,370  -->  00:07:10,120
Everything is working right here.

109

00:07:10,200  -->  00:07:11,500
There's nothing that we got to do.

110

00:07:11,640  -->  00:07:17,280
If you want to go ahead adjust your tax right here you can if you want.

111

00:07:17,280  -->  00:07:18,110
All right.

112

00:07:18,390  -->  00:07:22,550
You can make it on H-3 to make a little smaller.

113

00:07:22,550  -->  00:07:24,300
All right.

114

00:07:25,800  -->  00:07:28,700
So your model could be like this on H-3.

115

00:07:28,790  -->  00:07:35,870
And he says are you sure you can even make sure that this is center by putting a little class here at

116

00:07:35,880  -->  00:07:39,100
Center from Bootstrap.

117

00:07:39,120  -->  00:07:41,880
Pretty cool stuff.

118

00:07:41,880  -->  00:07:43,210
Let's do it.

119

00:07:43,540  -->  00:07:44,260
Let's see.

120

00:07:44,280  -->  00:07:45,010
Click on it.

121

00:07:45,300  -->  00:07:46,410
And now you can see it.

122

00:07:46,470  -->  00:07:48,530
We have a really cool Moldau.

123

00:07:48,650  -->  00:07:52,260
It's a lot better than that little thing that we had before.

124

00:07:52,260  -->  00:07:53,280
All right.

125

00:07:53,290  -->  00:07:57,840
So thank you so much for watching guys and I always have you on my mind.

126

00:07:57,840  -->  00:07:59,490
I'm always thinking about writing more lectures.

127

00:07:59,490  -->  00:08:04,890
I know this call of course is kind of long but some of you have finished and you come back and you learn

128

00:08:04,890  -->  00:08:05,340
some more.

129

00:08:05,340  -->  00:08:06,700
Why not right.

130

00:08:06,720  -->  00:08:10,390
Take care and I'll see you in the next lectures or courses.
