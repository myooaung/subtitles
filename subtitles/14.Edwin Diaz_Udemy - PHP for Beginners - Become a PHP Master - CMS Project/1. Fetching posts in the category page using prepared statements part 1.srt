00:00:00,630  -->  00:00:04,910
Welcome back my students in this section here.

2

00:00:05,040  -->  00:00:09,630
Well we're going to be doing is applying a more secure system to our application.

3

00:00:09,630  -->  00:00:11,940
We're going to be using prepared statements.

4

00:00:11,940  -->  00:00:15,120
I won't say I'm going to be explaining what prepared statements are.

5

00:00:15,270  -->  00:00:17,430
I'm not going to go into that.

6

00:00:17,810  -->  00:00:18,370
OK.

7

00:00:18,390  -->  00:00:23,430
In prepared statements because this is not a prepared statement course and for that we can have a whole

8

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:25,020
course in prepared statements.

9

00:00:25,020  -->  00:00:28,510
Now there's a bunch of the communication there and the PH be on their website.

10

00:00:28,590  -->  00:00:29,570
You can Google it.

11

00:00:29,660  -->  00:00:30,200
OK.

12

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:35,030
And you can find out more information but I want to show you what the first images are.

13

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:40,800
I want to show you how to use them and I'm not just basically not going to get into why each of those

14

00:00:42,780  -->  00:00:46,620
special functions do because they do a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

15

00:00:46,620  -->  00:00:47,930
OK.

16

00:00:48,090  -->  00:00:48,560
All right.

17

00:00:48,630  -->  00:00:52,830
So I mean category that BHB here and one of the first things that I'm going to do here that I see this

18

00:00:52,830  -->  00:00:56,090
code that we read thing a long time ago.

19

00:00:56,100  -->  00:00:58,490
Right.

20

00:00:58,740  -->  00:01:02,730
What I want to do is I want to actually

21

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:15,450
I want to change this for this because we have this admin functionality that we added to our application

22

00:01:15,730  -->  00:01:16,340
guys.

23

00:01:16,560  -->  00:01:22,200
These couple lectures that I'm about to make here for you is because I want to add value to the Course

24

00:01:22,200  -->  00:01:27,900
is not something that I was planning to but because you guys make requests all the time and I you know

25

00:01:27,900  -->  00:01:32,070
even though it takes me a little while to get get them applied to the course I do.

26

00:01:32,250  -->  00:01:37,920
I have thousands of students over eighty nine thousand I believe right now and you know it's just hard

27

00:01:37,920  -->  00:01:39,870
to keep up on my courses up today.

28

00:01:40,110  -->  00:01:43,690
But I tried my best and I keep my courses up today.

29

00:01:44,160  -->  00:01:49,490
And if I if I'm not there yet I will if you taking some of my other courses that I haven't really of

30

00:01:49,490  -->  00:01:52,620
data that costs something that I say I would I'm going to.

31

00:01:52,620  -->  00:01:53,160
OK.

32

00:01:53,220  -->  00:01:54,650
Just like I'm doing this one.

33

00:01:55,140  -->  00:01:58,130
But anyway hope you guys appreciate this.

34

00:01:58,170  -->  00:02:04,110
So let's just say we want to check keep this guy.

35

00:02:04,230  -->  00:02:05,020
He's available.

36

00:02:05,130  -->  00:02:05,410
OK.

37

00:02:05,430  -->  00:02:14,050
And this is we're just making sure that this guy's not mean if he's not an admin then you know.

38

00:02:14,580  -->  00:02:17,530
And of course we get that problem.

39

00:02:17,630  -->  00:02:30,360
This is because we have a whole bunch of little parentheses there and there's no way it is there's line

40

00:02:30,410  -->  00:02:33,870
20 if it's set at his admin.

41

00:02:33,870  -->  00:02:36,350
Actually we can do this.

42

00:02:36,350  -->  00:02:37,330
There we go.

43

00:02:37,390  -->  00:02:40,080
And that's going to work better.

44

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:40,760
There we go.

45

00:02:40,890  -->  00:02:41,460
OK.

46

00:02:41,640  -->  00:02:44,900
So now you can see that I'm little down.

47

00:02:45,540  -->  00:02:50,240
I wasn't lower than I was and then I looked down and you could see that it is working OK.

48

00:02:50,250  -->  00:02:58,770
So another way to know that this is good actually is that if I make this draft if I'm not admitting

49

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:05,760
I shouldn't be able to see that actually draft let's go here.

50

00:03:05,790  -->  00:03:10,470
Migdal the one draft as well.

51

00:03:12,030  -->  00:03:16,080
And now if I go to another browser

52

00:03:19,920  -->  00:03:21,930
you can see that he says no poses available.

53

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:23,420
That's pretty cool stuff.

54

00:03:23,900  -->  00:03:24,840
OK.

55

00:03:25,340  -->  00:03:26,370
All right.

56

00:03:26,910  -->  00:03:33,090
So now let's go back to here and let's see what prefers stamens are and how we can apply it to our code

57

00:03:33,150  -->  00:03:35,090
and our application basically.

58

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:41,760
So this is the regular Querrey right we creating a Querrey here and we are taking all these into our

59

00:03:41,760  -->  00:03:44,160
database prepared statements work in a different way.

60

00:03:44,160  -->  00:03:46,060
They don't take all this in.

61

00:03:46,260  -->  00:03:47,860
They don't take this in.

62

00:03:47,880  -->  00:03:50,050
They take a placeholder instead.

63

00:03:50,160  -->  00:03:54,600
So we put a question mark in the prepared statement and then we send that in.

64

00:03:54,750  -->  00:03:59,870
And that gives process and then later on we bind the original value which is this guy in this case for

65

00:03:59,880  -->  00:04:01,370
this Querrey.

66

00:04:01,380  -->  00:04:03,090
Now let me show you.

67

00:04:03,450  -->  00:04:08,200
We use a function call mice you lie as a prepared statement actually.

68

00:04:09,110  -->  00:04:09,810
OK.

69

00:04:09,810  -->  00:04:12,130
And this function is going to take two parameters.

70

00:04:12,270  -->  00:04:14,520
Well you already see one parameter there.

71

00:04:14,520  -->  00:04:17,790
The first parameter is going to be the connection.

72

00:04:17,860  -->  00:04:18,670
OK.

73

00:04:18,750  -->  00:04:23,300
And the second would be the query with a placeholder.

74

00:04:23,400  -->  00:04:25,090
We're not sending those values in yet.

75

00:04:25,110  -->  00:04:29,050
And this is the great stuff a bow prepared statement.

76

00:04:29,130  -->  00:04:33,050
Again they are a bunch of the communication of bodies.

77

00:04:33,050  -->  00:04:33,970
You want to go into that.

78

00:04:34,010  -->  00:04:36,930
But I'm going to try my best to explain it here.

79

00:04:37,500  -->  00:04:41,010
Remember this is an extra feature so it's not a course for it.

80

00:04:41,550  -->  00:04:42,090
OK.

81

00:04:42,210  -->  00:04:46,760
So this functionality though we are going to have two different statements though.

82

00:04:46,800  -->  00:04:53,360
Usually we have one but because we created this little function I did to just find out if we have a

83

00:04:53,350  -->  00:04:58,230
news Nazmi we're not admen we have to create two statements.

84

00:04:58,260  -->  00:05:04,160
So what I want to do is I want to first of all before we go to the next line.

85

00:05:04,770  -->  00:05:07,800
We don't want to say we want to get everything we want.

86

00:05:07,800  -->  00:05:09,830
We want to specify what we want out.

87

00:05:09,840  -->  00:05:17,280
So I'm going to specify the idea believe this below here would give me an idea what I need so I need

88

00:05:17,280  -->  00:05:19,590
all of this feels okay.

89

00:05:19,770  -->  00:05:25,590
So I don't want you to see me typing in so I did super fast you so that OK.

90

00:05:25,740  -->  00:05:34,700
So basically what I did is I'm selecting every column here that I want to get out of my database OK

91

00:05:34,730  -->  00:05:40,110
or the columns or the information that I want out later on of course because this is going to be going

92

00:05:40,110  -->  00:05:41,720
to be fetching data on this case.

93

00:05:41,730  -->  00:05:43,860
Sometimes we need to insert data.

94

00:05:44,070  -->  00:05:47,260
So we would do the same thing but of course we change our queries right.

95

00:05:47,550  -->  00:05:48,340
But anyway.

96

00:05:48,720  -->  00:05:50,530
So this is statement number one.

97

00:05:50,850  -->  00:05:53,310
And now we need to create them in number two what I'm going to do with them.

98

00:05:53,310  -->  00:06:00,450
Number two is I'm going to copy everything to this point here and I'm going to pace stay there.

99

00:06:00,450  -->  00:06:02,160
Now we have two conditions here.

100

00:06:02,170  -->  00:06:05,400
We first check checking to see if the category is the same.

101

00:06:05,400  -->  00:06:13,230
We replace it with a question mark and we do the same thing with this privilege static string which

102

00:06:13,320  -->  00:06:21,300
we are going to be putting in a variable here because one good thing about previous statements that

103

00:06:21,320  -->  00:06:29,280
it doesn't take strange in some of the functions so we need to make it a variable polish and we're going

104

00:06:29,280  -->  00:06:29,990
to use this later.

105

00:06:29,990  -->  00:06:32,220
You're going to see where I show you.

106

00:06:32,640  -->  00:06:35,510
OK so we're doing pretty good here.

107

00:06:35,550  -->  00:06:44,140
Now let's replace this let's just replace it from here and here.

108

00:06:44,160  -->  00:06:46,540
Make sure that we wrap it.

109

00:06:46,710  -->  00:06:54,200
Make sure that we put our connections here and make sure that we have a variable here.

110

00:06:54,210  -->  00:06:59,990
Now because this is statement number two we get to make sure that it is tainment number two there.

111

00:07:00,360  -->  00:07:03,240
OK so we are done with this on the next lecture.

112

00:07:03,270  -->  00:07:08,200
I'm going to show you some of the functions that this uses because we're not done here.

113

00:07:08,550  -->  00:07:11,730
OK we don't we can use the same functions again.

114

00:07:11,730  -->  00:07:17,480
We have to use different functions since we're using a different type of format of the API of my obscure

115

00:07:17,490  -->  00:07:18,060
lie.

116

00:07:18,060  -->  00:07:19,300
I'll see you in the next lecture
