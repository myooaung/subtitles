1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,180
All right on this lecture we're going to be you know fixing this links when you click on it we want

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,430
those links to go to specific pages just like this right here.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,960
All right.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:19,180
So let's go ahead and do that first link that we're going to be facing is the view polls right right

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,920
here.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,710
And let's go to the ad man for Slash and it's so actually we are there right now and that view the tails

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,040
is on here somewhere.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,790
So is right here.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,170
New polls.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:34,590
All right.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,010
So

12
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,980
if we click on it that's going to take us to the polls right here.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,310
So it's going to take a two post-up ph.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,920
Now this link has all their stuff in there so we need to go to that link actually.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,670
Let's go to the ad men navigation and let's check out the other link.

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,190
All right.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,070
That's the best way to actually get the right values out of that link because we added some functionality

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,150
there if you remember.

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,860
So let's go to the view users view or post a link.

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,620
And as you can see right now we are directing it right here.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,030
All right.

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,900
So let's go back to it.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,120
And I thought we did add a.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,670
Actually we did add it right here.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,060
Right.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,490
But not that's for that polls.

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,570
All right.

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,460
So we had it we did add a function right here for this one but not for this one.

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:32,750
All right.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:41,790
So we are good Let's go to whatever page we're working on which was in that house and I thought I had

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,980
in my working files right here somewhere

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,730
right here.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,000
OK.

34
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,880
And we are on post view details and make sure that we can find them right here.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,280
So make sure that these values are going to the polls that's for and we click on it and takes us to

36
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,250
post.

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,880
Now we're going to do the same thing for the rest.

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,330
Right.

39
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,460
If you want to you can go ahead and do that.

40
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,550
It's very simple.

41
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,540
All right.

42
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,400
Make sure that you click on comments it takes you to the comments that BHB page right.

43
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,420
That's all you've got to do.

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,050
You want to go to comments that BHP and we already did is impose.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,300
So if we go ahead and do this here what happened with click on it it takes us to the same page because

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,990
basically that is just saying that he's on that same directory.

47
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,320
All right.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,440
So we didn't really need it out there.

49
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,030
I'm just sometimes I like to put it in there.

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,640
But anyway let's go to comment and do the same thing on comments and we have the link right here.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,180
We're just going to say Come up here.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,940
And as you can see right here right there I just got used to doing that.

53
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,360
It just says that it's on the same directory basically two dots means you get out of that directory

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,350
OK.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,690
See that.

56
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:17,490
So you know that I do that just because I just the way I learned things from the past.

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,560
All right so now the next one is users

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:34,470
go to uses that BHB I think users goes to the view users and check it out.

59
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:35,630
All right.

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,750
So that's going there that's going.

61
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,700
All right so perfect.

62
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,450
And if you if you are wondering why in the world this all this is working like this.

63
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,650
Just remember that I when you downloaded that form I added some of those links in there already.

64
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:51,950
All right.

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Just know that.

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,650
So basically that's all they are links.

67
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,650
There's nothing advanced there that you should learn.

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,460
It just links dashboard and categories take into the categories that BHP.

69
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,080
All right.

70
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,690
And you're welcome to check on those links.

71
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,740
As you can see right here this is the categories and the view dieter's is down here and we just send

72
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,350
out a link to the appropriate page.

73
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,970
Right so there is nothing there that it's advance or anything that should you should have learned you

74
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,130
already know that just add those links there and you should be fine.

75
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,610
All right.

76
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,860
So we have this page already.

77
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,800
Let's test it a little bit let's add a comment to something right.

78
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,370
So let's do polls.

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,250
And this is published already so I'm going to go to these polls and ask them some comment to it just

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,600
to check it out.

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,380
Right now says no poll sorry for this.

82
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,320
We need to.

83
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,140
This is part of the bog that we need to fix.

84
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,290
So don't worry about that we will get that done.

85
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,380
But right now let's just add a comment to this section to this post right here and they say something

86
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,290
like.

87
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:15,820
And when they alter my e-mail we're doing it 20 years that come my coming is just a comment comment.

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,260
All right.

89
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,520
Submit.

90
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:17,910
Perfect.

91
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,320
Let's go to admen and we see that we have two comments now.

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,840
Perfect.

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,760
We have another user here we can check that out.

94
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:31,680
We wanted to looking at another user say something like Quincy I don't know what kind of usage that

95
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,550
quenching which is going to give him a subscriber because I don't know who he is.

96
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,290
And let's just say.

97
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,420
Q Is his last name actually this.

98
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,510
This is say something like.

99
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,840
PETERSON

100
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,990
Right.

101
00:05:51,090 --> 00:06:06,390
And b c it is is a user name and B C G mail that and some crazy password update at the user I mean and

102
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,570
that's got to dashboard and we can see that we've got three users.

103
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,760
So all this is working.

104
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:20,580
Let's do one more in categories and let's add another category and say HCM L5 category that's where

105
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,150
you can see that everything is updated successfully.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,020
So we're doing a pretty good improvement here on dashboard.

107
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,290
And the next one we're going to do.

108
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,690
We're going to be doing some graphs.

109
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,130
And just to show you real quick why that is

110
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:42,340
loco's blog at men and let's go to we're going to be adding this dashboard right here.

111
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,450
You might be asking yourself how they were going to do that.

112
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,760
Well it's complicated when you're you don't know how to but don't worry I'll make it easy for you.

113
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:58,290
So anyway if you're here and you are accomplishing all this Congratulations you are really really something

114
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,940
right so keep going.

115
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,120
We're almost there.

116
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,770
And if you for some reason don't want to send some of the lectures.

117
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,460
Rewind them on your terms and to you all this information is super valuable is going to help you out

118
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,230
right.

119
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,180
So keep going.

120
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,820
Let's shoot for the money that makes so much careers go up some income with this existence.

121
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,650
This get some new clients and let's keep on going.

122
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,100
Right.

123
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,970
Anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture
