1

00:00:00,840  -->  00:00:05,400
All right so we've got a lot of functionality here we're able to change the roles of users delete.

2

00:00:05,410  -->  00:00:08,340
We are even able to add users.

3

00:00:08,610  -->  00:00:13,050
Now what we want to do is being able to edit the user.

4

00:00:13,050  -->  00:00:19,350
So for that we're going to go to the edit user that BHB page that we made but the difference with this

5

00:00:20,940  -->  00:00:26,180
page is that it looks the same as the Post's page.

6

00:00:26,310  -->  00:00:30,930
Does that show you right now if we go to the viewer polls and we click Edit it's gonna look like this

7

00:00:31,170  -->  00:00:37,110
one that we won that edit user page to look like the AD user because it's going to be going to have

8

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:38,960
the same fields here that we need to edit.

9

00:00:38,970  -->  00:00:39,720
Right.

10

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:46,340
So we need to do a save as we need to copy this one into the edit user into Aceves.

11

00:00:46,350  -->  00:00:51,880
Let me just show you real quick how the added user looks at that user.

12

00:00:52,140  -->  00:00:55,410
You see that we don't want that.

13

00:00:55,410  -->  00:00:59,520
All right so let's go and open a new tab here real quick.

14

00:00:59,520  -->  00:00:59,890
All right.

15

00:00:59,940  -->  00:01:02,870
I just want to have two tabs there.

16

00:01:02,970  -->  00:01:04,610
We've got to get is you are out in there.

17

00:01:04,610  -->  00:01:05,850
So all right.

18

00:01:05,850  -->  00:01:15,500
So it does go to the user user and this command or control a select everything and command see Control

19

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:16,540
see.

20

00:01:16,650  -->  00:01:22,920
And let's go to the end user command a command VI control VI.

21

00:01:23,160  -->  00:01:29,760
If you are in a Windows and now that we change a list save it has come back here and actually not here

22

00:01:29,850  -->  00:01:31,550
here refresh.

23

00:01:31,560  -->  00:01:34,760
And when we got on the French table here.

24

00:01:34,760  -->  00:01:35,120
Right.

25

00:01:35,190  -->  00:01:37,390
And the different form perfect.

26

00:01:37,800  -->  00:01:43,050
So we need to start actually adding the query so that where we can pull some data from the database

27

00:01:43,530  -->  00:01:44,880
have it right here.

28

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:45,240
Right.

29

00:01:45,240  -->  00:01:48,600
Even the the rules.

30

00:01:48,930  -->  00:01:54,150
And and then we are able to update and change a couple of things on this form right here.

31

00:01:54,830  -->  00:01:55,450
All right.

32

00:01:55,680  -->  00:02:01,790
So this edit user and we don't have to change much.

33

00:02:01,800  -->  00:02:04,780
Actually we are sending the same information.

34

00:02:04,800  -->  00:02:12,490
This just changed this year and we're going to say use as a user right.

35

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:16,010
And what else do we need to do here and add a user one.

36

00:02:16,440  -->  00:02:20,080
Well for starters we need to receive that data somewhere.

37

00:02:20,550  -->  00:02:31,530
So if any user write it where we see that data from somewhere from here then we are going to be actually

38

00:02:31,530  -->  00:02:36,180
the first one of the first thing that we need because right now we're not going to be using the form

39

00:02:36,270  -->  00:02:37,710
unless we update.

40

00:02:37,710  -->  00:02:46,380
So up here we need to receive from the you are all set.

41

00:02:46,510  -->  00:02:50,900
They get requests right.

42

00:02:50,960  -->  00:02:54,890
This request is going to be added user.

43

00:02:55,440  -->  00:02:57,300
Well let's see if we can name that.

44

00:02:57,300  -->  00:02:58,120
I think that's fine.

45

00:02:58,140  -->  00:03:01,850
As a user that's a good good name for it.

46

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:07,760
And we're just going to say user ID right now.

47

00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:08,850
All right.

48

00:03:08,850  -->  00:03:15,690
Or we can say that user id the user ID just to be just to know that the data is different from the one

49

00:03:15,690  -->  00:03:16,850
that from the database.

50

00:03:17,070  -->  00:03:23,010
And lets just copy this one here put it right here

51

00:03:25,650  -->  00:03:30,800
and where we need to do is echo this out to see if we are getting something right.

52

00:03:31,680  -->  00:03:35,120
Well we also need to update a link here.

53

00:03:35,250  -->  00:03:39,040
It will go to view all uses We don't have the edit link right here that we need.

54

00:03:39,180  -->  00:03:42,920
So to send that request to that page.

55

00:03:43,020  -->  00:03:55,530
So let's go to that of your users there and get that link view of users and the link should be right

56

00:03:55,530  -->  00:03:56,300
here.

57

00:03:56,300  -->  00:04:00,500
All right so let's do the link right here before delete.

58

00:04:00,590  -->  00:04:01,260
All right.

59

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:04,560
And let's name it delete edit.

60

00:04:05,340  -->  00:04:10,630
And this one is going to go to.

61

00:04:10,960  -->  00:04:12,560
I'm trying to see what we can square.

62

00:04:12,600  -->  00:04:13,310
Where can we.

63

00:04:13,320  -->  00:04:14,790
We are sending this stuff.

64

00:04:14,910  -->  00:04:22,230
We are sending actually we're sending it to the same users that BHB will we're going to be using a parameter

65

00:04:22,820  -->  00:04:24,390
to parameters.

66

00:04:24,390  -->  00:04:29,840
All right so the first parameter that we're going to be using is source.

67

00:04:30,240  -->  00:04:39,390
Remember that source and add it user.

68

00:04:39,390  -->  00:04:44,520
That's the first parameter and then aspirin's ampersand to the VI that parameter added user is going

69

00:04:44,520  -->  00:04:45,930
to be the next one.

70

00:04:46,200  -->  00:04:52,670
And that is the key that we will be receiving in the editing user that BHB page.

71

00:04:52,680  -->  00:04:58,920
All right so once we have that then we've got the user id right here and we're good we're good.

72

00:04:59,230  -->  00:05:00,380
Let's check it out.

73

00:05:00,810  -->  00:05:04,220
So refresh edit and walk.

74

00:05:04,350  -->  00:05:07,920
And then we are echoing that idea right there.

75

00:05:07,920  -->  00:05:13,110
Now if you don't know what I did I'm just going to recap a little bit real quick.

76

00:05:13,110  -->  00:05:13,760
All right.

77

00:05:14,190  -->  00:05:22,010
So we are in the view all users and all I'm doing right here is sending that source Paramor.

78

00:05:22,020  -->  00:05:28,080
The first source parameter that we got I remember we got the source parameter because we got a switch

79

00:05:28,080  -->  00:05:30,000
statement on users.

80

00:05:30,240  -->  00:05:32,640
We did that with a pulse remember.

81

00:05:32,640  -->  00:05:37,320
So let's go to users and you see we got that first parameter says a user.

82

00:05:37,510  -->  00:05:40,880
But that first parameter has a source.

83

00:05:41,640  -->  00:05:42,150
OK.

84

00:05:42,180  -->  00:05:46,240
So he's checking if the source is equal to the user.

85

00:05:46,290  -->  00:05:46,810
Do it.

86

00:05:46,810  -->  00:05:50,590
It said that's why user if it's equal to any user send it to the user.

87

00:05:50,640  -->  00:05:54,000
And right now the source is equal to every user.

88

00:05:54,000  -->  00:06:01,160
So he sends that person to this page right here and we are catching this with they get requests.

89

00:06:01,260  -->  00:06:02,970
Of course.

90

00:06:02,970  -->  00:06:07,650
All right in the edit user page and echoing.

91

00:06:07,650  -->  00:06:11,670
Just to make sure that we are receiving the information that get requests.

92

00:06:11,670  -->  00:06:12,240
All right.

93

00:06:12,270  -->  00:06:14,180
So anyway thanks so much for watching this lecture.

94

00:06:14,180  -->  00:06:22,650
The next one we're going to be continuing to add more code and get this data display here that where

95

00:06:22,650  -->  00:06:27,030
we can see what we are going to be editing from the database from the table.

96

00:06:27,030  -->  00:06:27,780
All right.

97

00:06:27,780  -->  00:06:29,460
Take care and I'll see you the next lecture
