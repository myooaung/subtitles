00:00:00.930  -->  00:00:06.180
All right welcome back my student in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to fit a little bug

2

00:00:06.240  -->  00:00:08.060
that we have with the editor.

3

00:00:08.190  -->  00:00:12.320
So if you include it you might as well real scaped string function.

4

00:00:12.330  -->  00:00:17.310
The one that saves my school injection you might have a problem with you Ed. I'm going to show you what

5

00:00:17.310  -->  00:00:22.590
it is if I want to add it real quick and I try to update this and I make a new line for example or a

6

00:00:22.590  -->  00:00:25.290
couple different lines.

7

00:00:25.680  -->  00:00:26.880
Blank spaces of course.

8

00:00:26.880  -->  00:00:32.210
And I click Update If I go down you're going to see that we have these are an array.

9

00:00:32.250  -->  00:00:36.990
The editor is producing this next line basically.

10

00:00:37.290  -->  00:00:39.650
And we need to get rid of it.

11

00:00:39.660  -->  00:00:43.340
All right so for those of you that have this problem keep watching this video.

12

00:00:43.530  -->  00:00:45.850
If not just go to the next video.

13

00:00:46.130  -->  00:00:46.700
All right.

14

00:00:46.890  -->  00:00:50.550
So anyway to fix this is super easy.

15

00:00:50.550  -->  00:00:56.770
Let's go to our post that BHB page and let's go to where we have our tets area.

16

00:00:56.820  -->  00:00:57.560
All right.

17

00:00:57.730  -->  00:01:00.920
For the editor you see we have the post content.

18

00:01:00.960  -->  00:01:03.280
So let's go ahead and fix that.

19

00:01:04.170  -->  00:01:05.240
Well we're going to be doing it.

20

00:01:05.250  -->  00:01:10.510
We're going to be adding a function here to replace this our end.

21

00:01:10.530  -->  00:01:11.700
All right.

22

00:01:12.360  -->  00:01:18.600
So right here we're going to say are replace.

23

00:01:18.630  -->  00:01:19.120
All right.

24

00:01:19.290  -->  00:01:24.450
And as you can see when I click on tab my editor already filled this up for me.

25

00:01:24.450  -->  00:01:31.470
So basically what we're going to do is this is the only place we can search for whatever we want to

26

00:01:31.470  -->  00:01:32.500
replace.

27

00:01:32.610  -->  00:01:36.080
Then we are going to replace it with something right here and the second parameter.

28

00:01:36.330  -->  00:01:40.520
And then the third is whatever we are we play what our content.

29

00:01:40.530  -->  00:01:41.460
Right.

30

00:01:41.490  -->  00:01:47.610
So let's go and right away let's add the content.

31

00:01:47.610  -->  00:01:57.720
And here in between quotes I'm going to add we're going to replace our four slash and or you know backslash

32

00:01:57.720  -->  00:02:01.790
whatever you want to call it for our B.R. tag.

33

00:02:02.450  -->  00:02:02.970
All right.

34

00:02:03.060  -->  00:02:05.310
Because that's what it is is a break right.

35

00:02:05.590  -->  00:02:06.740
Let's go to the next line.

36

00:02:06.960  -->  00:02:14.510
And then here we're going to be searching for one for the backslash r and.

37

00:02:15.210  -->  00:02:15.880
All right.

38

00:02:15.960  -->  00:02:19.090
Remember they all have to go in quotes here.

39

00:02:19.740  -->  00:02:24.820
Well you can have variables for this but you know why.

40

00:02:25.130  -->  00:02:26.780
So save it.

41

00:02:26.790  -->  00:02:27.050
Right.

42

00:02:27.060  -->  00:02:27.930
And we should be good to go.

43

00:02:27.930  -->  00:02:35.040
So let's go to our editor now and let's go and Rachel this.

44

00:02:35.460  -->  00:02:39.630
And now let's just refresh here real quick.

45

00:02:40.590  -->  00:02:48.450
If we try to make some lines of data it goes up data and we go down there is nothing there.

46

00:02:48.450  -->  00:02:51.460
See that it's very easy to do.

47

00:02:52.170  -->  00:02:57.650
All right so if you have any problems dysfunction could save you a lot of headaches.

48

00:02:57.690  -->  00:03:02.010
We replace whatever is in diameter whatever bug we have for our content.

49

00:03:02.010  -->  00:03:02.670
All right.

50

00:03:02.670  -->  00:03:05.910
Anyway I see you in the next book I hope you're having a lot of fun or you had a lot of fun with of

51

00:03:05.910  -->  00:03:06.530
