1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,900
All righty.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,890
So we are done with you Steve are we having sort of some data.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,260
It's time for us to build the HD M-L form that is going to display that or the table.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,810
Right.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,750
So what we want to do is go to bracket's which is our editor or whatever editor you're using.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:29,790
And what we want to do is copy the comments stop BHB page right here and do a save x ray and it's called

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,830
that.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,770
Well there's users that BHP.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,360
All right.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,720
And here users.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's go ahead and direct this for the one to view our users.

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,440
This page is not built yet but we will build it in a minute.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,430
And this one to edit user and this onto our user.

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,800
Okay perfect.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,350
All right let's go ahead and build out those pages right.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,340
So the first one view or users.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,240
Let's go ahead and copy there from what we have another page here called view or comments right.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:16,030
Why not copy this one do or save us and let's call this do all users perfect.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,180
Say let's go ahead let's go back to the admin here and let's check it out.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,890
Let's check something out.

21
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,370
Posts is very similar to what we want to do with our users right.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,650
So this is not this one is coming.

23
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:39,240
Now we don't have an ad page and comments that might be an actual feature later on but right now it's

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,460
not so at.

25
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,910
Is very similar.

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,040
Let's go ahead and do a save as well not pause and call at the users right.

27
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,100
Or at user.

28
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,760
All right so outfalls should be right here.

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,810
They do a Save As and it's called this user.

30
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,480
Perfect.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,120
What is the other one added.

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,830
Post should be the same thing so they just click on it and do a Save As

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,880
edit user.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,660
Perfect.

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,510
So we got all the pages here.

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,760
Now the next thing to do is is to actually fix this link right here so when we click it it takes us

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
to that page right.

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,950
Right now if we click on it it doesn't take you take us anywhere.

39
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,800
So let's go to the admin it includes admin on the screen navigations you have that.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,820
And let's find that here somewhere.

41
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,920
There we go.

42
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,770
So we have this one here.

43
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,500
Going to.

44
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,910
So let's make this dropdown go to all users actually.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:56,340
So users Ph.D. and his job down is just going to say

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,860
you or users write

47
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,080
users.

48
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,280
There we go.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,640
This one here let's make this one go to add the user and user that pay a fee.

50
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:23,190
We might have to do something else to it like we did with the polls and just double checking something

51
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,940
real quick view of polls.

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,850
And then at the polls we might have to do the same thing here.

53
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,290
Right.

54
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,490
So you all are users.

55
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,990
And then this one is just paste that in there an AD user.

56
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,510
All right.

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,510
So that would be the source.

58
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,250
Polls actually users that BHP sors are users.

59
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,190
All right.

60
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,370
Safe.

61
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,050
Let's go back and see that.

62
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,450
All right well we need to change the name of it.

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,650
Let's use fresh it.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,700
First let's go to the original page.

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,420
Just click on the first one.

66
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,030
It's going to take us to this.

67
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,330
And the second one is going to take us to soar users.

68
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,720
All right.

69
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,630
Perfect.

70
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,870
So let's make sure that we change this drug down here that we forgot.

71
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,800
Well I forgot you probably did not.

72
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,010
So they say add the user.

73
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,950
All right.

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,800
Perfect.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,270
I think we're doing a pretty good job.

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,590
What do you think.

77
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,850
All right.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,900
We're doing good right.

79
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,210
So click on it.

80
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,660
View all users at user.

81
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,340
Perfect.

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,810
If you follow me exactly like I did it right now maybe I may if I left you behind Don't worry about

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,080
it.

84
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,500
Just rewind the video and do it again and do little by little.

85
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,280
The great thing about it is that you can follow it just by pausing the video and rewinding it right.

86
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,770
So this is something that you should know and what I see in the next lecture here if you follow me again

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,840
congratulations you're doing a pretty good job.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,930
Take care.
