1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,510
OK I hope you guys having a lot of fun.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:02,880
Right.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,910
So for those of you that have raised these course less than five stars do me a favor go over their poses

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,190
video and go and change that to five stars.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,810
I think this feature is really awesome and I organize it organize it.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,820
Very good for you guys so I receive this service for you to change your story a little bit.

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,440
Right.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,740
So let's go back here and let's create a like for this spokes.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,940
So let's do my issue because that's the API that we're using BHB API.

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,880
And let's put the connection here.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,540
And what I want to do is I want to create some type of helper function.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,440
I think I did before I thought I did where we just you know have a function that already has a connection

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,730
and you just write the query.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,520
That would be nice to have.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,240
Let's look into our you know let's do the after when we refactor code.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,210
OK.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,430
We're going to see how we can make this code our application look a little better.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,370
Every case.

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:14,160
So we going to insert into likes their user ID and the post Id want to know who y user.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,590
You know like that and which polls and then we're going to put the values here to be the user id we're

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,730
getting from.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,750
We haven't gotten that far yet.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,270
Let's use get the user id as well.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,940
Remember that we get getting this from the age request down below.

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,850
So they use are we getting that and it's Shinsho to user ID.

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:54,460
And here in the valley is all we have to do is dispatch a user ID and post ID simple as a Okkar.

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,340
All right.

28
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,790
Perfect.

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,060
Maybe that can look a little better.

30
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,660
We'll fix that code later on OK.

31
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,640
But I just want to get this over with and if we want to make sure that we exit this code let's just

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,540
put it and adds it right below here.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,560
OK.

34
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:19,740
So let's go back and let's just empty this out I'm going to double click it and enter and let's go to

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,420
like we don't have any likes.

36
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,830
As you can see it's all empty.

37
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,880
And let's go back to here let's refresh Let's make this a little smaller so you guys can see it.

38
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,370
We don't need this anymore.

39
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,470
It's just less click like go back here.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,670
Let's refresh and you can see now that we have a new like is it like table and we have ID number 26

41
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:53,010
which is the ID that I you know include it as a static value before in our code.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,320
And that pulls ID and is like number one.

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,080
OK.

44
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,460
So we successfully creator for us like we have everything we need right now.

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:10,480
Now the next step is to create their own like OWN like functionality because we want to be able to you

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,330
know detect if this post was liked by whom.

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,500
And if it was like we need to change his bun to say or like and then we need to change every quest tune

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,290
like that pose.

49
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,260
And at the same time update everything else in our database.

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,020
OK.

51
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,100
So are you guys ready.

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,100
I hope you guys are having a lot of fun and I hope this is very useful for you.

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,210
See you in the next lecture.
