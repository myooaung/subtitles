00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome back my students so I hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.200
I try to make this small as entertaining as possible.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.820
I wish I wasn't music in the entrails right.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.350
Well if any of you know about doing that like any music that you know I'd have put in videos it is like

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560
to contact me let's talk.

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
I would be interested in finding I'll give him one of my students on chances in putting some videos

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.040
for me putting up some minerals.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.700
But anyway so this is where we are right now we are creating this functionality here to detect the get

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.300
method in a forgot key.

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.140
And I think I'm missing something.

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.420
Let's see if this works like that.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.910
Think

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.430
if we get this get or for Guy one of those I don't think this is the right logic.

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.830
Let me just check this out real quick.

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.710
Sometimes I'm doing this guys I remember I do not call it any of this.

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.290
Not in that portion of the time before recording.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.210
So yeah that's not logic I don't know what I was thinking.

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.640
I think we should do the end here and the set here.

19
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.410
So yeah I like to do things naturally because you know we make a whole bunch of mistakes when we are

20
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.290
developing.

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.360
We break stuff and we fix it that's how it is.

22
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.590
So by seemy fixing stuff you learn more and you guys being with me all this time so you know.

23
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.600
But anyway so the next thing to do here we need to check the email right because we are made in this

24
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.950
email we want to make sure that the email exists in the database and I think I created in this course

25
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.610
a function fight on if I recall is call email is just there we go.

26
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:51.640
So its called Maylands is actually or email it is.

27
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.630
Yeah.

28
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.690
And we want to check the email database and the email address we just going to say well why don't you

29
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.810
tell me it does exist.

30
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.880
So let's go back and let's see

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.540
if it is just going to be copying this to my clipboard just because to been using this a lot.

32
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.360
As you can see it does exist.

33
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.640
See the echo right here.

34
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220
Great.

35
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.110
So that function is working great.

36
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.270
We love that right.

37
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.170
It does help or Funches really help us minimize all that while we have to write we would have to write

38
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.040
a query to the database if it wasn't for this function.

39
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.910
So we know that it does exist.

40
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.310
You might want to use every prosimian that function if you like.

41
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.230
So I'm not going to do that now but you could turn this into a prepared statement.

42
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.490
So that way you don't have to do my ask you lie.

43
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.910
Again super easy.

44
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.980
We actually do this in one of our sections so that section of where we create a prepared statement.

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.140
I think it was for the posts for this year.

46
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.790
You can see that we are creating a prepare semi or super easy we're going to do that.

47
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.740
We've got one now.

48
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.970
But he's also information and BHB the Web site BHB prepared statements.

49
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.650
We might do that in the future.

50
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:35.590
I know I'm misspelling that but it's going to help me this works as an information to I like BHB that

51
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.730
Net Web site.

52
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.410
But we're going to be facing those functions and making this a little bit more

53
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.010
more secure as time goes by OK.

54
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.380
Always going to keep adding new lectures just to show you new things.

55
00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:00.450
But if you go to I was just looking for a select statement so you could see as you can see this is selecting

56
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.210
the right here.

57
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.060
But anyway.

58
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.230
So let's actually create one right now.

59
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.000
So we have a function call mice you lie and this is just if we pair function is going to take that connection

60
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.650
that we have available.

61
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.890
It's going to actual variables right here under D-B that BHB remember that.

62
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.940
And then the second parameter here is going to be the query that we want.

63
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.170
We can pass a variable we can just write it here.

64
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.960
As a matter I am going to use double quotes because I'm going to put some curly brackets inside here

65
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.360
just that's just me.

66
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.560
You don't have to do that.

67
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.120
So they are users and we're going to set the code.

68
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.540
You know I can't pronounce this a lot of guys make sure that you have this column in the database.

69
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.170
OK.

70
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.940
I already added mine so you can see here.

71
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.160
Go to use a stable structure and super easy you guys know how to do that.

72
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.730
I want column soaking and make sure it is a tetes type that it's safe.

73
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.570
Super simple.

74
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.180
Anyway I think I already told you how to do that.

75
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.330
And I mean this is all you had to I tell you to add to the column not to actually create a column because

76
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.030
I've been telling you showing you how to do that well all this time.

77
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.900
Right.

78
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.830
Anyway so we're got to set this column to be

79
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:50.760
the one off they're variable and we're going to do it where it's they use their email equals what.

80
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.260
Well we prepare statements we just write that question mark there.

81
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.440
I actually put this a little bit there so you can see it better.

82
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.230
OK.

83
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.200
Let's use another function here.

84
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.180
This is my ask you a lie and we're going to bind the parameters and we're going to bind this statement

85
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.820
or whatever statement we got there.

86
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.070
Make sure that your statement actually we don't have that variable there we need to create as all we

87
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.710
can manage our connection better.

88
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.760
That's a..

89
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.940
I think it's a good name for it.

90
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.280
It's going to be a string whatever values are going to go into that question mark.

91
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.470
That's why the second parameter here is and the second parameter value which is that variable.

92
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.540
OK.

93
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.880
We are also going to execute this.

94
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.150
I think we can execute it already.

95
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.050
There's a whole bunch of functions that you can see that my idea is actually refilling for me.

96
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.780
We're going to pass the same thing every time into this function.

97
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.620
That's why we do.

98
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:59.320
And then we can of course close the connection and

99
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.560
it should be here right there.

100
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.930
And we passed the statement again.

101
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:13.440
Now you can put a statement in this to check for errors if you like.

102
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.950
Let's do it actually and

103
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.370
so if we are able to connect we're going to set these variables I don't know why I have that I'm getting

104
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.540
I'm writing a lot of a lot of code using Jason

105
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:54.880
in javascript and I'm putting semi-colons after the color brackets but anyway so let's go ahead now

106
00:07:54.970 --> 00:08:03.040
and we can find out if something went wrong with the connection and we can echo this out.

107
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.940
Something

108
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.080
let's just put something small here.

109
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.970
OK let's let's see if this works.

110
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.200
First of all OK.

111
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:31.510
Right now we don't have a code on users actually we don't is empty

112
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.570
right there.

113
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:49.380
So let's see let's refresh a little bit and let's just make sure that your email is that you have an

114
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.400
email like this in a database and we are going to create that.

115
00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:00.160
Now let's refresh and you can see that we have a code here.

116
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.300
OK so working what if something goes wrong and we have some type of errors.

117
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.030
And that table does not exist.

118
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.560
Courting

119
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.800
is that something went wrong one of these play more than that message or something.

120
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.450
You can do that.

121
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.030
You can use like see

122
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:33.400
my.

123
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:39.720
Just call my askew a lie.

124
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.600
You can.

125
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.040
I think you can do this if you like.

126
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.290
I think this will work with

127
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:54.500
because we have this connection very well somewhere connection.

128
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.900
There we go.

129
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.500
CORDONE fuckwit the it's going to copy to clipboard answer.

130
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:12.840
And as you can see we get that and I think they do have there is another I don't know.

131
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.890
This one would work.

132
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.970
Why think we need this a.p.

133
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.690
And I don't think that will be available by the time he gets down here.

134
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.750
I mean you see let's check it out.

135
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.270
Maybe that works.

136
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:27.710
There we go.

137
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.960
Issue more.

138
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:36.250
Well actually that one does not work because this very well never gets set with it right.

139
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:46.610
When you see something as well and yep so used it or the one that I showed you.

140
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.830
So anyway you could do that I feel like we already know that our queries actually updating so there

141
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.320
is no errors there.

142
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.330
OK.

143
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.460
Just to test things out.

144
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.530
So that goes right.

145
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:07.060
What else do we need to do well besides updating the database.

146
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.610
We need to actually send the e-mail right.

147
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.440
That's something that we need to do.

148
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:18.070
And for that I'm going to show you in the next elections is going to be pretty awesome so don't miss

149
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.470
it.

150
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.760
See you in the next lectures.
