00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.230
Congratulations my friends my students.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.450
You have made it to the end before you go I got very important things I want to discuss with you but

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.540
I just want to say you have done what a lot of people are not able to do finish what they start and

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.510
not only that but you're committed to this for hours four weeks even four months and you've finally

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.530
achieved it.

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.050
Now this is not the end of the course 100 percent because we're going to be adding lectures here and

7
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.960
there to improve our site.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
Maybe lectures are based on feedback and things like that but I just want to say you were done with

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.000
the course when you're done with a major thing of the course.

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.720
Now before you go I just want to say you need to practice if you want to become better.

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.750
You need to do different things all the time even do the same things in different ways.

12
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.320
Be creative.

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.630
Now if you found the scores valuable please take two minutes of your time.

14
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.090
Leave a rating in a review that will help me put discourse out there on the world so people can take

15
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.030
advantage of it.

16
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.660
Share with your friends your co-workers your family.

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.340
When you when you help other people you get the good karma so you will you help yourself and then you

18
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.560
help all the people in the Sent times really cool.

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.510

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.800
I got your back.

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.380
I got a perfect cause for you.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.510
It's called O.P..

23
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.930
BHB basically is object oriented BHB is this is the next step to procedure BHB which was what you did

24
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.170
on this course.

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460
Now let me just give you an example.

26
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.930
Now you were able to find a better job because you got some skills in your belt and your tool set.

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.610
Right.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.220
So you can make from 50 $60000 a year if you know how to use this information.

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.320
If you take this old people HP course and you can increase your skills to object oriented programming.

30
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.840
You could be making nightowl even more money.

31
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.200
You're right and this is just in the United States I don't know where you were or are you in your country

32
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.370
but I'm pretty sure that after you know you're in the program you could be making a lot more sense.

33
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.370
You will be able to make more advanced applications and your code will be a lot better a lot more organized

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280
and just going to do a lot better.

35
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.760
