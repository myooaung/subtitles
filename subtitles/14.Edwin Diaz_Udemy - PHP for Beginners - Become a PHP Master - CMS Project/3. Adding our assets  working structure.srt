1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,900
Or write so it's time for us to start working on our structure.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:16,540
So let's go to the root of our server right here and here on that zem server of course we have the Demel

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,910
directory that we were working on on the course here I want you to make another folder and this folder

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,350
will be use to place our CMOS system in.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,450
So I'm going to call the CMOS and on December make sure that you're watching right now on the right

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,860
hand side is going to be a download link just like that.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,590
Course that's the size files but this folder is going to be called.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,610
This file is going to be called CMOS template.

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,980
I have some files there for you.

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:51,490
So let me just open this up right now and let me show you inside a folder.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,640
We have a couple of files that we are going to be copying to this new CIMS folder.

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:06,570
Or as you can see this to see a mess folder and just going to go ahead and then select all and copy

13
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,020
it copies its items.

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,550
All right.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,200
Now don't concern yourself with any other fool as you see here this is on my or my personal stuff here.

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,020
This is the full design but this is a miscellaneous folder here so don't worry about any of these other

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,860
photos that you might not have.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,720
You don't have to have them or you have to have a mass for right here.

19
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,320
You just make it created you don't have to have it just create it and then place the folders that I

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,880
just placed inside.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,980
That.

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,880
Just right.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,060
So you're going to have once when you open that folder download it from the lecture open it up and put

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,190
the files in there you're going to see admin folders see SS funds in that's going to show you in a minute.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:00,180
Well those are the reason why I created this file is for this you see now we have a template here that

26
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,300
we've got we can use for our site for our CMOS system.

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,230
This template is already responsive.

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,070
We don't have to deal with that.

29
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,620
OK.

30
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,720
Is using a framework called Bootstrap which I have a course on if you want to learn some bootstrapping

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,390
how to make your applications responsive how to use this framework to do exactly this.

32
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,800
There's a phone on line if you go online and you search for maybe

33
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,930
bootstrap themes or something like that.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,770
Then you can find some themes.

35
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,770
All right.

36
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,600
And you can download administration areas you can make this I mean there are so many different things

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,040
that you can of course buy really cheaply.

38
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,340
And some of them you can get for free.

39
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:48,660
All right.

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,390
So that's how I found that.

41
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,080
I just wanted to show you that that way you can later on if you want to make another way you can.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,540
But anyway so we have this already in place.

43
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,190
We have the index of our site this is the home page right here.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,040
This is going to be the home page.

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,380
So we have that template in place.

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,180
Then we have also the poles

47
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,010
template where you know this is going to be the individual post.

48
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,420
If we go to the admin folder we have our administration right here.

49
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,030
All right.

50
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,740
So we have all these forces in place.

51
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,320
I'm not concerned too much about the science to be honest with you since this is more of a programming

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,740
course than anything else.

53
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,900
All right.

54
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,410
So we're going to be putting dynamic data inside these template from the database.

55
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,470
So now another file for you that we might need.

56
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,180
Actually we will need.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,640
Let's go to the CMOS route right here.

58
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,670
This is the as you can see here this is the root CMOS.

59
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,660
We're going to right click it and make another for the cool images.

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's just have that there let's go to admin make another folder called images.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,080
We're going to have some new images also.

62
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,690
All right.

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,890
And that's about it for this for the structure.

64
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,500
Now let's go ahead and rename this and let's open our coeditor right here

65
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:29,010
and let's draw that this is brackets I'm using brackets you can use whatever you want but this is what

66
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,880
I'm using right now.

67
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,220
Right.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:38,130
So I'm just going to take some of this and then I drop this in there as I drop and that's the whole

69
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,980
entire mess for They're in there.

70
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,320
Right.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,840
Let's drop it in there right there.

72
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,370
Now we can work with it.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,030
All right.

74
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,110
So now that we have this what we need to convert this into that BHB files are right in that stop B.

75
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,290
So let's go ahead and right click and rename it and let's just rename it to that stuff BHB

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,690
enter.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,890
Let's rename this one also.

78
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,400
Right click on it.

79
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:21,460
Rename it to be perfect right.

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
Double clicking is going to take it to the working area right here.

81
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,530
So I can work with it.

82
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,160
All right let's go to the Admin site and just open this up and also do the same thing with this and

83
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,420
that's in the admin.

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,760
Rename it to and that's that BHB enter.

85
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,060
All right.

86
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:48,750
So let's bring this up in the actually let's go to file project settings and let's make sure that we

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,530
are in the localhost.

88
00:05:51,660 --> 00:06:04,310
So we see here that we have to type in HTP local host and this would be in this mess done.

89
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,970
All right let's see this in action.

90
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm going to write.

91
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm going to click on this little arrow here on the right hand side just to display this on the browser.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,620
All right.

93
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:22,110
So it's taking us to the page that I just clicked on to just minimize this to 100.

94
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,900
So you guys can see we are in the Add me on that five right.

95
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,290
So this is score.

96
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,710
Check this out.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,280
This one here.

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,360
And let's just check it on the browser to see if that's working

99
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,680
right.

100
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,990
Perfect.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,640
All right so this is working MP HB now.

102
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,180
All right so we're set.

103
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:47,840
Perfect.

104
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:54,220
So now that we have our working structure we need to go to the next lecture.

105
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,930
Thank you so much and I'll see you.

106
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,000
See you then.
