1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,410
All right so another functionality that I want to add to our.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,490
Super simple.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,440
We want to add a drop down right here on the post status.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm tired of actually coming here and you know saying that this is going to be a draft.

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,370
All right so let's go ahead and add a functionality like this dropdown simple drop down.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,980
It's going to be a start it's not going to be pulling information from anywhere but it's needed.

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,130
So that way we don't have to be typing right.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:34,440
So we're going to go to our admin for slashing kluges and insight and underscore posts that's where

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,910
we're going to be adding that.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,950
So Paul status right here.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,470
We are going to be getting a select here.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,230
All right.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,120
So

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm just going to be changing this input for a select select is going to be like this.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,810
The first option is going to be

16
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,650
select options

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,080
options are right and the value is going to be what do we want the value.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,990
For some reason to post the value is going to be published or draft does make it draft that way if something

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,330
happens if is something that we don't want people to see it's not published.

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:19,860
All right.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:26,490
Let's take this out of here real quick and actually let's look at it because we need to send Let's get

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,400
his poll status here on this select name.

23
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:30,920
All right.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,030
Let's make sure we have that then we can just delete it.

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,830
Well we don't need it right now.

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,820
So perfect.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:52,260
So let's make a couple more options here and this option is going to be publish published if I can get

28
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,170
the name right that would be nice.

29
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,790
And next that's is going to be draft.

30
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,710
That's fine.

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,800
So published right here and draft second option.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,780
All right let's go ahead and check it out and try it on right.

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,550
We need to make sure the works.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,000
So let's make sure it's really tidy and nice.

35
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,150
There we go right there.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,780
So you can copy if you want.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,320
All right.

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,400
So let's go ahead and try it out.

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,030
All right so we have the status right here.

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,740
We could.

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:34,170
As a matter of fact just take the label out here.

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,790
Let's take the label out of there.

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,840
We don't need it.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,490
And let's just say pull status here.

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,120
Let's see how that looks.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,460
All right.

47
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,300
It's a lot better.

48
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,720
So Paul status we want to be publish.

49
00:02:51,060 --> 00:03:01,140
All right so let's make a pose and this call is something like Wow another pose polls My hands

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,770
are tired

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,250
right there.

52
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,490
Yeah right.

53
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,240
Let's make a smiley face.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,070
And I don't why not.

55
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,390
But it's not sad right.

56
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,800
I like this beautiful right.

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,050
Edwin other we're going to publish it.

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,530
And the post is actually just going to say published right here.

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,320
That's fine.

60
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,910
And we're going to choose an image and image is going to be.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,380
That's fine bootstrap.

62
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,700
Let's make this bootstrap right here.

63
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:51,580
And we're just going to say some content this is this is some content kind.

64
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,300
There we go publish post.

65
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,040
All right.

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,670
And let's check it out.

67
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,030
You will post published right here.

68
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,560
Perfect.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,180
Right.

70
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:03,990
Wow another.

71
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,980
My hands are tired of this and that.

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,080
And if we update it that we can view it right here also.

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,460
All right.

74
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,580
Perfect.

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,070
So that's one feature now looking at it.

76
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:22,090
I want to add another feature to this and I'm going to add the same feature that I did on the edit post.

77
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,710
As you remember here on these exit polls we have this feature.

78
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,650
Well I want to add that feature to our ad at polls right here.

79
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:37,080
Every time I make a post I want to have something here if you want to go ahead and do that.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,970
And a little note is that we got on the Edit pose when we update it right here if you want to add the

81
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,410
same functionality to the ad post page.

82
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,650
Go ahead and do that.

83
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,470
I'm going to do that in the next lecture Right.

84
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,620
So take care and I see you in the next one.

85
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,790
Bye bye.
