1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,570
All right perfect.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,850
So now that we know our form is sending information and we are able to catch and make sure that you

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,730
take your ECOs out of there you my house until like.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,500
Make sure you take them out because we are not testing anymore.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,470
They just take it all right.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,300
Make sure you do that.

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,200
Now the next step for this is after we know that we are receiving information and everything is working

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,570
fine is that we need to clean up the data.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,960
And I hope you remember my Eskew injection lecture that I gave you if not just go back to it.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,860
Basically you know you can send information or hackers or whatever you want to call it that people there

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:46,470
can send different values in our fields and they can delete data out of our out of our database.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,930
They can send parameters here and do harm to our site.

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,550
We don't want that we need to avoid that.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,720
So we appear to be people or developers made to a really cool function called mice you lie on the score

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,040
reel on the score scape on the score string that cleans up these data.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,690
Right.

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,510
So we're going to send that.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
It takes two parameters takes the connection and it takes whatever is cleaning.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,670
All right.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,130
So right now the screen and the user name and what we are going to be assigning it to the same variable

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,680
actually to a very local user name which is going to be equal to this new clean version of it.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,870
You can name it whatever you want.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,540
I'm just going to name it it's same.

24
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,930
So that way we are using the same variable name.

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,890
All right.

26
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,420
I think he's Make it makes more sense.

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,120
So password and let's just change and that's one password.

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,730
So I was able to do the ball for both of them real quick here as you can see.

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,780
So now that we know that our information is coming from our forms clean and these and they don't have

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,180
rescue or injection on it then we can put it into a database and we're just going to make a very simple

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,420
query here.

32
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,030
All right to check our column there in our table in our table users we're going to take a call them

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,020
and let's check some values here.

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:19,760
First let's just say select and if I can write a right that would be nice select fall from where from

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,600
users write us the table we're going to be checking when people are logging in.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,040
So we're going to say where what let's go and check we know if we find a user name that is the same

37
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,180
then we can pull all pull out all the information regarding that user.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,850
So we're going to compare that to this user name right here.

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,420
Make sure you put your two quotes here single quotes brackets and then paste that in there because it's

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,940
a stream remember that.

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:56,370
All right so we're going to pull everything out of it if we find that this user in our users table is

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,850
the same.

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,530
All right.

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,150
We're going to be pulling out a lot of information from this guy rave from this person.

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,350
It could be a woman too.

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,100
OK.

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,970
Select user Querrey.

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,790
All right.

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,900
And it's going to be equal to my secure lie we've done this before.

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,250
Right.

51
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:27,800
Many times we send it to parameters like always connection and then we send the query in perfect.

52
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,230
Then we can also test this out if we wanted to.

53
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,460
So we could say if

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,370
Slackware is not good then we can do something else with it right.

55
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:48,060
Then we can just dye everything out and admin side we're using a function that was very handy on this

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,400
side we don't have that function since we don't we don't have the same functionality that we have in

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,480
the admin here and the front side in the root directory.

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,900
Maybe later on we we would include that when we are cleaning up the site and refactoring some things

59
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,460
and maybe we will put that function in there right now like I said before I'm more concerned about you

60
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,130
learning the fundamentals getting everything down.

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,680
And then later on then once you get the knowledge then you can start being created by cleaning it up

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,810
making it more reusable and doing things like that.

63
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,310
Right.

64
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,080
Right now let's just concentrate on understanding why are we doing here right.

65
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,910
So we are going to say die.

66
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,920
We're going to say Querrey Querrey failed.

67
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:42,740
And when I say my rescue a lie we're going to concatenate here and for my ask you a lie.

68
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,670
And then these arrows are going to have a connection.

69
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,150
That's the way it's going to connect to this.

70
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,620
All right.

71
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,380
So we're going to die.

72
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,810
We're going to provide a query string right here where we failed.

73
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,050
All right so we can test this right now.

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,280
But I want to really keep going.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,530
Let's see if we get any arrows there so we can isolate them from users and we're going to send it square

76
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,340
in.

77
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,940
Let's just make sure that let's see what he does.

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,130
Samit and it looks like we don't have any errors so we are doing good.

79
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,540
Perfect.

80
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,550
All right.

81
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,820
All right so let's go ahead and do that while loop real quick and testing our real quick and then we'll

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,740
divide this court this lecture into another one right because we don't want to make it too long.

83
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,110
I don't want to get you to tie your.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,730
And then you know to bore too boring right.

85
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,560
This is exciting guys.

86
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,580
We doing something that will change your life very shortly.

87
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,430
And the more you do it the better it is.

88
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,880
All right.

89
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,650
So we using the while loop again to do the same thing with them many times by using them my obscure

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,870
life which array to pull that information out of there.

91
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,740
So we need to put the result of that worrying here.

92
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,480
Right.

93
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,540
And remember this function is going to bring those that result in.

94
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,810
And we're going to assign it to these variable and then we use that resoled to loop through it.

95
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,740
All right.

96
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,190
So right now we're looping through without resort and let's check this.

97
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:24,920
Check it out.

98
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,790
Let's see if we can pull some data out of it.

99
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,660
I did that without any errors.

100
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:40,480
So let's just say Roe Let's check out these array and I'm going to check on this one here.

101
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,260
Let's check on the roll right here and this.

102
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,150
Anyway let's check it out.

103
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:55,720
So we know that in to see a mess if we go to admin users actually we have a big thing here and this

104
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,240
use the word you're not going to have the arrow there.

105
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,580
I was just messing around with some sessions.

106
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,140
So don't worry about that.

107
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:12,420
So we're going to go here and we are going to check on Ricos right so we have a RICO user name and then

108
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,300
we need to check on his password.

109
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:14,570
Right.

110
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,610
Again don't worry about his dashboard thing here.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,270
This is something that I was testing before I made of course are you going to have that error there.

112
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,860
Right.

113
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,650
All right.

114
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:33,830
So let's check on the user user's table and we see Rico here has a user name in the past who one two

115
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,110
three.

116
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,250
So let's check on that.

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,790
Let's let's see what can we get out of that.

118
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,490
So Rico.

119
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,030
All right.

120
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,620
And one two three.

121
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,640
Submit.

122
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,760
You see that we get one there.

123
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,270
You don't need to put the past where you can use Perrigo submit.

124
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,510
And it gives you the number one I.D. So we know that we're getting some data out of that.

125
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,620
All right.

126
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,950
Perfect.

127
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,230
So he's working now I'm going to divide this lecture into another one and that's when we're going to

128
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,650
finish some of this some more pulling out some more information and doing some more processing right.

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,980
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

130
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,560
I see you the next one.
