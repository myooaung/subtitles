1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,880
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:07,310
A student in this lecture we are going to be fitting a bug in our cloning feature.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,160
All right.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,620
So what is this bug.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,260
Well as you can see something doesn't look right here.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,620
Right.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,640
It doesn't look right.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,470
Well this road right here is missing some data and because it's missing some data is missing or a row

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,460
or column it's shifted to the left so it's missing the user the data from the user column.

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,480
It's not missing the caller means your music is missing that data they are supposed to be right here

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,260
for the user.

12
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:35,840
Right.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,730
That's because I try to clone one of these guys ideas.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,730
You're going to see we're going to have a second post 1:43 and we have the same problem.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,590
We don't have a user.

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,030
So where is this coming from.

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,460
Well let me show you and we go to the old post.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,220
Right.

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,980
We got the cloning feature right here.

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,330
The cloning code we're not pulling the user out of the database to be inserted back in the polls.

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,730
All right went up putting it.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,610
So right after this.

23
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,700
The solution is pulling data from there.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,680
And it's called Pulse user.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,290
All right.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,110
So that would be the user of the admin.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,030
Now there are three which is the guy.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,810
People from outside admin.

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,820
Right.

30
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,190
So Polsce user and then all we got to do is make sure that he's right after Port Arthur right here.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,620
Put a coma so you don't get an error into the senting here you just copy this guy right here with a

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,490
coma and four or five years instead of samples.

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,300
Alter we make a pause user like this.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,690
Save it.

35
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,350
Let's go back to it and are here.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,610
Let's try to leave this to right here and let's try to cloning a couple of more now.

37
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,930
Everything is good.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,900
Right.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,570
So now in the future if you have some problems with this table shifting know that you're missing some

40
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,520
data somewhere.

41
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,350
And what you need to do is you could create an if statement right here and you could say something like

42
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,570
let's say for some reason the post tags I empty right.

43
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,380
We can say something like this if a..

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,870
And let's just say post-tax right here like this.

45
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,260
All right.

46
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:35,350
So if they empty What can we do with they empty Well we can grab full stacks and do something with it

47
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,590
right.

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,950
We can grab it and insert some type of generic code or something like that like this.

49
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,140
All right.

50
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,690
Or we can say no tags or something like that whatever you want doesn't matter.

51
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,130
But I'm just saying you can do something like that.

52
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,570
All right.

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,660
So you can put this variable in a loop or something or inside an array and then you can loop through

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:05,600
with an array separating the key and the value and put it back to value with the key.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:05,970
All right.

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,700
Hopefully some of you know what I'm talking about by now you should know that.

57
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,630
But anyway that's a little bit more advanced.

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,900
I don't want to confuse you but some of you already know what I'm talking about.

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,920
So let's say for example I tried cloning this let's go back to the here.

60
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,020
This is in the cloning section OK.

61
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,480
So let's say I'm cloning this guy right here in the tags are empty right.

62
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,270
Just clone this guy real quick let's see what happens.

63
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,250
Apply.

64
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,550
And you can see that he says no tags.

65
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,010
All right.

66
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,520
That's pretty cool stuff right.

67
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,920
So just in case you want some type of code in your empty spaces or you don't one your column your table

68
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,120
to shift to one side right.

69
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,860
Because you need some data there.

70
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,030
Most of the time.

71
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,670
All right.

72
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,260
So anyway hopefully this was a good lecture for you to understand some of these things and I'll see

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,190
you know that's Bhag right that's have some fun fits in the box.

74
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:11,390
And remember this of course is mostly to teach you how to do all this stuff that we learn in the beginning.

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,270
OK.

76
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,350
So that's why I created this project to teach you all this stuff.

77
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,740
There is a lot of things that we can use to you know make this a little better or even we are a lot

78
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,810
more features but you know I use this to teach you more and more stuff all the time.

79
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,460
But anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.
