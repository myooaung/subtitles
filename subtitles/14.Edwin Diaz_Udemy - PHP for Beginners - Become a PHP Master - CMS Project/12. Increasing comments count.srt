1

00:00:00,700  -->  00:00:05,200
All right so doing this comments section here has been pretty interesting right.

2

00:00:05,490  -->  00:00:09,570
Well we still got more a little bit more things to do with comments.

3

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:12,380
Let's go to post you will post.

4

00:00:12,400  -->  00:00:15,090
And here you can see we still got some static data here.

5

00:00:15,090  -->  00:00:18,330
We've still got the same hard coded data that we input before.

6

00:00:18,340  -->  00:00:20,250
Every time we create a comment.

7

00:00:20,520  -->  00:00:23,750
But we want to do is make this dynamic.

8

00:00:23,790  -->  00:00:25,080
Now we've got two options.

9

00:00:25,080  -->  00:00:34,410
One option is using HP all right to count the amount of comments that this specific post has.

10

00:00:35,040  -->  00:00:41,960
Or we can actually increase the number inside our database so that way we can have that data anytime

11

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:42,800
we want.

12

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:50,520
And if you recall let me open another page here and I'm going to go to

13

00:00:53,390  -->  00:00:58,840
localhost BHP my admin.

14

00:00:58,860  -->  00:01:00,530
All right.

15

00:01:01,680  -->  00:01:06,420
And here let's go to the Simmons and bolts.

16

00:01:06,730  -->  00:01:13,270
This goes to a structure and here you can see that we made an extra roll here called a column called

17

00:01:13,270  -->  00:01:15,760
The pause comment count right.

18

00:01:16,050  -->  00:01:20,920
Well here we're going to be input in the count of each of the comments.

19

00:01:21,000  -->  00:01:24,780
And the reason is because it's better to keep the count inside the database.

20

00:01:24,780  -->  00:01:30,240
That way we can add that information any time we want instead of just counting it with BHB.

21

00:01:30,450  -->  00:01:34,320
Sometimes it can be just a matter of preference but I like to do it like this.

22

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:36,900
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

23

00:01:36,900  -->  00:01:43,950
So what we want to do is we increase this right now this comment section should be 0 in every post that

24

00:01:43,950  -->  00:01:45,120
we get.

25

00:01:45,120  -->  00:01:50,400
So let's go to any specific polls and you can see well is actually four is going to be always four because

26

00:01:50,400  -->  00:01:52,380
we are how hard coding it.

27

00:01:52,440  -->  00:01:56,990
So let's go to the section on post up BHB.

28

00:01:57,030  -->  00:01:58,430
All right.

29

00:01:59,340  -->  00:02:04,560
So every time we create a post we get that data dynamically right.

30

00:02:04,620  -->  00:02:06,190
Well how could it.

31

00:02:06,210  -->  00:02:11,150
So we need to go to the post insertion.

32

00:02:11,170  -->  00:02:18,530
Right so every time we create a post let's go to the insert let me see includes

33

00:02:21,740  -->  00:02:24,530
and post and post.

34

00:02:24,540  -->  00:02:25,010
All right.

35

00:02:25,140  -->  00:02:30,170
As you can see here we are actually doing this right here right.

36

00:02:30,180  -->  00:02:34,770
We are increasing that pulse coming count we don't want to do that anymore.

37

00:02:35,020  -->  00:02:35,550
Right.

38

00:02:35,790  -->  00:02:40,410
So let's go ahead and do that let's not insert that anymore.

39

00:02:40,800  -->  00:02:46,890
Let's just come in that out there in the future if we need it we do it but we're going to take that

40

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:50,720
out and we're going to take that out here also.

41

00:02:50,730  -->  00:02:51,500
All right.

42

00:02:51,780  -->  00:02:54,540
So let's not insert that every time we do it.

43

00:02:54,660  -->  00:02:58,140
Now that's not going to be inserted dynamically now is going to be zero.

44

00:02:58,140  -->  00:02:58,810
Right.

45

00:02:59,160  -->  00:03:01,530
So we need a way to increment it.

46

00:03:01,740  -->  00:03:02,560
All right.

47

00:03:02,700  -->  00:03:08,350
So what are we going to do is we've got to go the posts now.

48

00:03:08,390  -->  00:03:09,670
Pause post.

49

00:03:09,740  -->  00:03:15,240
Actually go without the s right thing here.

50

00:03:15,240  -->  00:03:18,990
Every time we make a comment we're going to update that field.

51

00:03:19,110  -->  00:03:19,800
All right.

52

00:03:19,800  -->  00:03:23,880
So you might be wondering how in the world we're going to do that we can do that with a query for the

53

00:03:23,880  -->  00:03:25,310
comments section right.

54

00:03:25,500  -->  00:03:30,520
Well what we have to do is actually make another query and we can make as many queries as we want.

55

00:03:30,870  -->  00:03:40,650
So inside this if statement here or code right I want to do another query and the query is going to

56

00:03:40,650  -->  00:03:48,000
be for you to make a little bigger so you can see what I'm doing right there.

57

00:03:48,000  -->  00:03:49,800
So we're going to make another query in.

58

00:03:49,800  -->  00:03:53,100
Can you think about where we are we're going to be making.

59

00:03:53,610  -->  00:03:57,480
If you can you can post a video any time trying to do it yourself.

60

00:03:57,480  -->  00:03:59,920
We're going to update polls.

61

00:03:59,940  -->  00:04:01,070
All right.

62

00:04:01,090  -->  00:04:03,420
Set for us.

63

00:04:03,480  -->  00:04:09,300
See the name of the field that column Post.com and count.

64

00:04:09,300  -->  00:04:10,330
OK.

65

00:04:10,920  -->  00:04:12,320
That's what we're going to be updating.

66

00:04:12,570  -->  00:04:23,010
So we're going to set post comment count equal to what we're going to show you a little trick right

67

00:04:23,010  -->  00:04:27,860
now to increment the values because that's an integer we can do that.

68

00:04:27,960  -->  00:04:30,720
Post comment count last one.

69

00:04:30,720  -->  00:04:35,150
Every single time we make a comment.

70

00:04:35,160  -->  00:04:42,150
All right so now we need to do a where statement here because if we don't this is just going to increment

71

00:04:42,150  -->  00:04:46,100
it to all the polls and we don't want to do that.

72

00:04:46,200  -->  00:04:50,930
So let's make a where statement let's just concatenate this or that way.

73

00:04:51,030  -->  00:04:52,450
Shorter right here.

74

00:04:52,780  -->  00:04:57,570
It's better to have another line by the way to make sure we have that there.

75

00:04:57,660  -->  00:05:11,090
And let's say where false ID equals to what we have the idea here somewhere right here.

76

00:05:11,180  -->  00:05:15,810
All right there we go.

77

00:05:15,810  -->  00:05:16,290
All right.

78

00:05:16,410  -->  00:05:19,220
So we have this data here available to us.

79

00:05:19,220  -->  00:05:23,410
I'm going to show you right now that it does work and it sure work and we don't have any mistakes.

80

00:05:23,460  -->  00:05:29,910
So let's check this again of the post set post comment count does a column equal to the senting polls

81

00:05:29,910  -->  00:05:31,390
coming count plus 1.

82

00:05:31,650  -->  00:05:37,940
So this is how we are signing our value there where polls underscore ID equal to the polls.

83

00:05:37,940  -->  00:05:39,400
Id perfect.

84

00:05:39,420  -->  00:05:41,180
So that dash worked fine.

85

00:05:41,190  -->  00:05:45,900
And then the last step is to actually set send the query right.

86

00:05:45,900  -->  00:05:55,210
So let's send that must not forget to do that update comment hoops comment count.

87

00:05:55,230  -->  00:05:55,920
All right.

88

00:05:56,160  -->  00:05:58,960
So let's use a function to send it in.

89

00:05:59,160  -->  00:06:04,320
So we're going to use this function right here and we're going to be sending it in right here.

90

00:06:04,320  -->  00:06:04,580
All right.

91

00:06:04,590  -->  00:06:05,550
Perfect.

92

00:06:05,580  -->  00:06:06,920
So let's go ahead and check that out.

93

00:06:06,930  -->  00:06:09,060
Check it out and see if it works.

94

00:06:09,060  -->  00:06:16,310
So we're going to go localhost and it's going to be a mess.

95

00:06:16,310  -->  00:06:16,860
All right.

96

00:06:17,040  -->  00:06:18,930
Let's go to any common ground.

97

00:06:18,930  -->  00:06:20,760
Is there going to be three.

98

00:06:21,360  -->  00:06:24,100
And we're going to leave a comment here.

99

00:06:24,100  -->  00:06:26,800
I was just going to say my name is Juan.

100

00:06:26,920  -->  00:06:30,540
E-mail is one at 1 2 for G-mail.

101

00:06:30,560  -->  00:06:31,990
Com.

102

00:06:32,760  -->  00:06:35,880
And hey just anything there.

103

00:06:35,940  -->  00:06:36,790
That's fine.

104

00:06:37,050  -->  00:06:38,920
Let's go to our local.

105

00:06:39,820  -->  00:06:48,120
Let's check on comments Polsce and it's checking the coming count as you can see this coming kowa increase

106

00:06:48,120  -->  00:06:54,500
from four to five because he was four before remember were all will for now eight increase.

107

00:06:54,540  -->  00:06:58,160
Let's go ahead and make another comment and let's call it is.

108

00:06:58,200  -->  00:07:00,900
My name is Wollin.

109

00:07:00,960  -->  00:07:04,910
I don't know if anybody's name is Wooleen but I just came out with it.

110

00:07:04,950  -->  00:07:09,540
If nobody has a name but I'm pretty sure somebody in the world has that name.

111

00:07:09,540  -->  00:07:12,230
Hey I am waffling.

112

00:07:12,840  -->  00:07:13,520
All right.

113

00:07:13,830  -->  00:07:15,540
Let's do that.

114

00:07:16,440  -->  00:07:23,540
So Matt refresh and if we come here you see that increase to 6 right so perfect.

115

00:07:23,580  -->  00:07:30,750
So now we were able to increase that depending on you know how many comments we got for this specific

116

00:07:30,750  -->  00:07:31,150
force.

117

00:07:31,170  -->  00:07:32,170
So that's perfect.

118

00:07:32,220  -->  00:07:32,640
All right.

119

00:07:32,700  -->  00:07:34,050
So the next step is to play.

120

00:07:34,050  -->  00:07:39,000
I'm going to cut off this video here and the next video we're going to be talking about that we're going

121

00:07:39,000  -->  00:07:39,930
to be No.

122

00:07:40,000  -->  00:07:41,190
We're going to be learning how to do that.

123

00:07:41,190  -->  00:07:41,690
All right.

124

00:07:41,850  -->  00:07:43,710
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next one.

125

00:07:43,710  -->  00:07:44,480
Take care.
