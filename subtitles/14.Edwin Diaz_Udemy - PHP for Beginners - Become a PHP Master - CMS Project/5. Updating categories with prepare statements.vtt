00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.490
Welcome back my history.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.690
So we were able to do the insertion here let's go ahead and do the update so that you can see how this

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.430
is done even though you guys have this already I'm pretty sure super simple right.

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:19.910
So look if we go back here all you doing is basically the same thing over again with the update.

5
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.630
OK.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540
You were placed in this holding.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.960
OK taking that and you put it right there.

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.010
Let me just take the whole thing here.

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.140
OK.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.290
But of course we're not doing it here.

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.110
We've got to do it in the one below are here

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.270
and let's take this whole thing

13
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.700
in place right here.

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110
Now I want you to take a look at this.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
You see that what is it taking stake in a string there.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:12.030
So we replace it with this and let's look at a cat title and cat ID that's always taking so to.

17
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.420
Simple as that.

18
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.260
What's the next step.

19
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.650
Once you prepare go back you bind the program.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.160
Let's take the whole thing there

21
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.220
let's make sure we have that.

22
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.370
We have our connection.

23
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.710
Yes.

24
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.580
OK.

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.630
So we've passed a statement.

26
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.570
We know that the first one is a string because it's the cat tied All right.

27
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.330
And then the cat ID which is an integer.

28
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.410
So if what I hear got titles is first one cat ID is the second one.

29
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.800
Simple as that.

30
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.310
And then you execute it here.

31
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.320
OK.

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.310
Now we don't have to do this anymore.

33
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.030
Guys remember that because that's why we used how we send the Querrey before we're not doing that anymore.

34
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.610
And then you can take this statement here and you can put it right here.

35
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.410
You see how simple that was.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.760
And now your application is like a million times more secure.

37
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.790
You save that.

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.070
And if you one of the one of these guys

39
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:46.380
now updating the show we see that come back here let's check it out real quick.

40
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.400
So returning the same data so all they category cat set as well.

41
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.190
So we're passing in to your cat.

42
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.080
The Apache I'm pretty sure the cat title is different.

43
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.140
I wonder why you don't like that.

44
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.550
Strange.

45
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.900
There we go.

46
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.280
You might want to refresh our page as well as we see

47
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.200
the we have a function with how a redirect function here.

48
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.810
Yes we do.

49
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.170
We can use this function here.

50
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.580
We believe if this is included in the admin header I mean check these out real quick admin.

51
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.540
Header.

52
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.540
Yeah I think we can use that function there.

53
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:53.690
So let's use the redirect function and we want this to go to categories that Ph be.

54
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.190
Let's see if this works here.

55
00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.860
Real quick

56
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.940
saving this added this.

57
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.150
And let's take the s out of date and it works.

58
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.550
Any refreshes.

59
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.020
OK.

60
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.740
So there you have it.

61
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.960
Simple as that.

62
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.390
You can do this for the rest.

63
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.580
We are ready to fetch within insertion.

64
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.840
And we did update.

65
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.860
So you're good to go.

66
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.170
There's nothing else for you to know here unless you want to go into depth about prepare statements.

67
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.780
Now keep in mind that this is a procedural way we can also do this in an object oriented way but that's

68
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.410
for an object oriented course.

69
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.140
OK.

70
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.310
So I'm going to be probably updating some of my courses with prepared statements and PTO.

71
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080
So keep tuned for that.

72
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.870
I hope you guys appreciate this.

73
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.550
I hope you guys are happy.

74
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.410
And my goal here is to give you value.

75
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.240
Thank you.

76
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.580
See you in the next lectures.

77
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.030
Take care
