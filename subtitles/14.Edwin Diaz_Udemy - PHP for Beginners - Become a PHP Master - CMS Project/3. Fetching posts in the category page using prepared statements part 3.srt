00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,360
Welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:09,630
So we got all this up when we first started this application we had a lot of stuff that we had to learn

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,340
and we got very far.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,760
For some of you and you Ph.D. is very large has a lot of more things to learn but I'm hoping that with

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,820
this whatever you are launching out there is secure make sure that you know all your queries you apply

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,500
this function I know we're going to keep going and we're going to do some insertions and other things

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,810
in this application.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,940
We prepare a statement so that way you know exactly how to make it happen.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,810
But don't put your application out there if it's not a hundred percent secure if you're not using prepared

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,520
statements.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,950
It's not 100 percent secure.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,530
OK.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,550
So we're fetching here.

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,600
We've got to change this a little bit because our application works a little different now.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,400
OK.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:57,410
So we've got to come here we're not assigning a very new any more because we are fetching a statement.

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,830
Now we have a general statement now as you can see here.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,020
So we're going to use that and we don't need to get all these data out like this here.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,380
OK.

20
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:15,820
So

21
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,350
let's see if this works

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,580
data.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,770
OK let's logon.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,910
Now recoils.

25
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,060
All right.

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,580
No never.

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,200
I should have put.

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,620
Never there.

29
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,870
Anyway let's go to you post and I'm going to make this edit to publish

30
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,180
this one to publish as well.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,500
And let's go to the front of the site.

32
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,420
Let's go to javascript's says no categories there.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,730
OK let's take out this guy here which I don't like very much.

34
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,860
We should do that.

35
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,400
And what I wanted to do here is I want to take this guy out too.

36
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,400
And I want to put a shorthand here.

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,290
I want to make sure that this ends here.

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,380
And while we're here.

39
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,640
OK.

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,930
Save that and let's see

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,960
let's change this to instead of that.

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,060
Whoops what am I getting.

43
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,470
We go to zero.

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,730
Sure is correct.

45
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,630
We're going to call this out.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,190
Let's come back and try this again now.

47
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,700
Refresh 109.

48
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,200
This song spects a semicolon to end this.

49
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's go back and refresh on the five mice you fetch huh.

50
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,170
81 is undefined because we need to include this in there.

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,590
That's a different function.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,650
But what else we got.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,400
Refresh.

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,520
And now is working.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,450
OK.

56
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,120
So that's work and we can see this.

57
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,610
And let's go to admin and make sure that he works for the other side as well.

58
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,620
Let's see.

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,340
Let's make one draft.

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,390
Let's go out.

61
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,170
Of course we're going to see this because we are admin but we will all go and we go to that.

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,590
We are only able to see one guy here.

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,690
OK.

64
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,560
Pretty cool stuff.

65
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,550
I think it's working 100 percent.

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Of course it can be better.

67
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,060
Yes of course.

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,380
OK we can do that and make a couple of functions just to make those queries a lot easier to create again

69
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,670
less create and make this Polish again.

70
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,940
Let's go.

71
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,960
Let's come back here and you can see both that's working on your P.S. guys.

72
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,420
Here's the code again.

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,860
I'm going to make sure that I included in the new files.

74
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,920
Ok very easy.

75
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:36,520
Hopefully you know you guys make sure that you obey your code.

76
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,230
We're going to continue with this and we're going to do another one in the next lectures because we're

77
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,020
just fetching data here.

78
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,690
It would be good to see this in insertion and updating all that.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,780
I'll see you in the next one.

80
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,150
Take care
