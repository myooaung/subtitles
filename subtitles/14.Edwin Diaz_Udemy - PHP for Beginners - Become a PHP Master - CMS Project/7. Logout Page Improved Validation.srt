1

00:00:00,890  -->  00:00:01,540
Perfit.

2

00:00:01,590  -->  00:00:10,230
So now that we are able to log into our database and we can go ahead and log in like this and we were

3

00:00:10,230  -->  00:00:17,610
able to personalize and receive that information there we need a way for this user to log out because

4

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:19,780
this user is always going to be logging now.

5

00:00:19,950  -->  00:00:22,620
We go to admin is always going to be there.

6

00:00:22,620  -->  00:00:27,840
What about if somebody gets into their users computer and logs into their account they see him as Indos

7

00:00:27,960  -->  00:00:29,660
and does whatever they want with it right.

8

00:00:29,970  -->  00:00:33,450
So we want to be able to log all of the users so that's what we're going to be doing on this lecture

9

00:00:33,450  -->  00:00:34,000
here.

10

00:00:34,230  -->  00:00:37,680
And if you're still with me here you are doing great.

11

00:00:37,680  -->  00:00:43,500
We are almost finished with this session section of logging in and I just got to say that I'm really

12

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:48,570
proud of you that you are following through and you're going to do something great in programming or

13

00:00:48,570  -->  00:00:53,330
web development whatever your course of action is after this course.

14

00:00:53,330  -->  00:00:54,070
All right.

15

00:00:54,120  -->  00:01:00,250
So hopefully something that you will be growing with in web development.

16

00:01:00,270  -->  00:01:07,630
But anyway so what we want to do is create First of all let's create a link right here right.

17

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:10,280
When we click on it it logs everything out right.

18

00:01:10,290  -->  00:01:17,140
And then we create a log out page let's first create the link and we need to go to admin on the screen

19

00:01:17,150  -->  00:01:24,360
navigation and under profile right here we're going to be we're going to create that link and that link

20

00:01:24,360  -->  00:01:27,420
is going to go to a page that we haven't made yet.

21

00:01:28,080  -->  00:01:35,880
But we will make it is going to be insane colludes and is going to be called log out that BHB we're

22

00:01:35,880  -->  00:01:37,440
going to make up right now.

23

00:01:37,440  -->  00:01:45,030
So first let's test out the link let's refresh here let's click here and logout and then takes us to

24

00:01:45,030  -->  00:01:49,610
include that force last log out that BHB right.

25

00:01:49,620  -->  00:01:50,510
Perfect.

26

00:01:50,820  -->  00:01:52,790
So let's go ahead and make that page.

27

00:01:52,800  -->  00:02:02,610
Let's go to the root of our CMOS which in this case is going to be all the way down my case and I'm

28

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:12,130
going to go to Logan and do a Save As here and go into this log out log out.

29

00:02:12,170  -->  00:02:18,300
Up Peachtree Now this page is not going to have that much information as a matter of fact as a matter

30

00:02:18,300  -->  00:02:23,470
of fact we're not going to have all the information that we have in Logan.

31

00:02:24,080  -->  00:02:28,280
We're going to have just the session.

32

00:02:28,300  -->  00:02:29,920
Now that's it.

33

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:33,270
And then everything else you can delete.

34

00:02:33,580  -->  00:02:37,580
Now let's go to that logging page again.

35

00:02:37,860  -->  00:02:41,550
And I want to copy a couple of things from here this well.

36

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:49,380
We're going to grab these sessions here we're going to copy it to logout paste right here then we're

37

00:02:49,380  -->  00:02:51,280
going to take these values out.

38

00:02:52,110  -->  00:02:56,880
And what we're going to be doing is every time somebody a user comes into this page we're going to be

39

00:02:57,330  -->  00:02:59,560
canceling their session.

40

00:03:00,350  -->  00:03:00,830
Right.

41

00:03:01,020  -->  00:03:06,650
So we're going to cancel their session by assigning a value of a boolean value of No.

42

00:03:06,810  -->  00:03:10,010
That means that is not going to have anything.

43

00:03:10,680  -->  00:03:14,030
No means nothing is there not even a string.

44

00:03:14,550  -->  00:03:16,110
It's like nothing it's.

45

00:03:16,200  -->  00:03:19,890
There is nothing because you know this is a string.

46

00:03:20,430  -->  00:03:25,640
And you know no it's just not.

47

00:03:25,640  -->  00:03:31,230
And so we are going to cancel those sessions one day visit here and then after we cancel it we are going

48

00:03:31,230  -->  00:03:35,420
to be sending our user somewhere else right.

49

00:03:35,910  -->  00:03:41,790
So we're going to send the user to the log in to the end that's that BHB and send them back to where

50

00:03:41,790  -->  00:03:42,460
they came from.

51

00:03:42,460  -->  00:03:44,090
Right.

52

00:03:44,520  -->  00:03:51,000
Hopefully that's where they came from but anyways so now we've got these Rico here.

53

00:03:51,000  -->  00:03:51,410
Right.

54

00:03:51,420  -->  00:03:54,160
And if I go and refresh this.

55

00:03:54,390  -->  00:03:56,690
Come here and logo.

56

00:03:56,700  -->  00:04:00,150
We go to admin and the Rekos not here anymore.

57

00:04:00,150  -->  00:04:04,200
Everything is cancell what we do have a little issue here that we need to fix.

58

00:04:04,230  -->  00:04:04,900
You see right now.

59

00:04:04,920  -->  00:04:11,940
Let me go into Admin and I notice I don't have the session.

60

00:04:11,940  -->  00:04:14,250
The session is not here anymore.

61

00:04:14,280  -->  00:04:15,700
Not it's on set.

62

00:04:15,720  -->  00:04:19,430
But we are logging in so we don't want people to log in even after we leave.

63

00:04:19,430  -->  00:04:19,900
Right.

64

00:04:20,040  -->  00:04:22,730
So let's go ahead and fix that little bit.

65

00:04:22,740  -->  00:04:25,850
So let's go to the admin Hetter.

66

00:04:26,310  -->  00:04:29,220
And here we have this logic right here.

67

00:04:29,610  -->  00:04:37,680
We want to do is change his logic and make it more simple in a way that we're not checking to see if

68

00:04:37,680  -->  00:04:45,720
the role is equal to admin because what we really want to know if is the user role if he said if he's

69

00:04:45,720  -->  00:04:48,570
not set then we want to redirect the user somewhere else.

70

00:04:48,570  -->  00:04:49,090
Right.

71

00:04:49,320  -->  00:04:51,090
So I'm just going to take all this off.

72

00:04:51,090  -->  00:04:58,110
Actually not all of it just this and this and very simple.

73

00:04:58,380  -->  00:05:01,030
I think the way that we can just do it like this.

74

00:05:01,200  -->  00:05:05,120
We're going to say if it's not said then we're going to redirect it somewhere else.

75

00:05:05,130  -->  00:05:06,920
So let's let's try this one.

76

00:05:06,950  -->  00:05:08,940
Is this piece of code in C..

77

00:05:09,100  -->  00:05:13,340
Refresh takes us back to the front page.

78

00:05:13,380  -->  00:05:21,020
Now if I click on here we can't log in anymore but if I go here look Rico and then one two three.

79

00:05:21,210  -->  00:05:23,410
Now it is set.

80

00:05:23,550  -->  00:05:24,060
All right.

81

00:05:24,270  -->  00:05:27,600
So if it's not set it's going to redirect us back here.

82

00:05:27,600  -->  00:05:32,120
Now what about if it's set right.

83

00:05:32,760  -->  00:05:33,890
What about if it's set.

84

00:05:33,930  -->  00:05:40,650
We've got to do something else because if it's set we get a check if it if it's if it's admin then we

85

00:05:40,950  -->  00:05:48,700
you know we allow the user but right now we're not checking we're not doing that feature of checking

86

00:05:48,700  -->  00:05:51,030
if it's I mean we're going to let him see this page.

87

00:05:51,030  -->  00:05:53,150
If he's not I mean we're not going to let him see this page.

88

00:05:53,160  -->  00:05:56,250
We're now doing those features right now so really doesn't matter right now.

89

00:05:56,250  -->  00:06:00,340
That would be probably an extra feature that we would include late on the CMOS.

90

00:06:00,510  -->  00:06:07,570
But for now just this is how we prevent users that don't have the right credentials to get in here.

91

00:06:07,570  -->  00:06:07,990
All right.

92

00:06:08,070  -->  00:06:10,110
So we're just going to leave it for now.

93

00:06:10,110  -->  00:06:11,380
Maybe an extra feature.

94

00:06:11,410  -->  00:06:14,540
We're going to be checking what type of user it is.

95

00:06:14,540  -->  00:06:21,360
So if it's Adamy user we let him see cerned page if he's that subscriber users we let him see certain

96

00:06:21,360  -->  00:06:22,290
pages.

97

00:06:22,290  -->  00:06:23,770
Right now we're not going to bother with that.

98

00:06:23,790  -->  00:06:30,930
Right now I think you got the point and if maybe I think you have enough knowledge right now to check

99

00:06:30,930  -->  00:06:37,920
here to come here and say you know if sesshin user role he goes to admin I want you to assign this to

100

00:06:37,920  -->  00:06:38,160
it.

101

00:06:38,190  -->  00:06:40,080
You know I want you to do this do it.

102

00:06:40,260  -->  00:06:46,410
And I mean you can do those conditions yourself but later on we're going to be covering die probably

103

00:06:46,410  -->  00:06:50,030
in the extra features if I don't make another course about it.

104

00:06:50,040  -->  00:06:50,460
All right.

105

00:06:50,520  -->  00:06:54,800
So just keep that in mind that we're just checking you for user role.

106

00:06:54,810  -->  00:06:59,440
And if it's not said we're just going to you know take him somewhere else.

107

00:06:59,440  -->  00:07:03,410
All right we don't want anybody here now to rise to this.

108

00:07:03,420  -->  00:07:03,920
All right.

109

00:07:04,080  -->  00:07:05,940
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

110

00:07:05,940  -->  00:07:12,420
I think this is really good right now let's just logout Let's try it out and try to submit we can because

111

00:07:12,420  -->  00:07:15,000
we're not putting anything here.

112

00:07:15,090  -->  00:07:16,290
We try to go to the admin.

113

00:07:16,290  -->  00:07:18,480
We cannot if we put Rico.

114

00:07:18,780  -->  00:07:21,470
One two three Enter we are able to log in.

115

00:07:21,480  -->  00:07:22,250
So perfect.

116

00:07:22,250  -->  00:07:23,630
I think we're doing really good.

117

00:07:23,790  -->  00:07:27,990
I think you're doing really good if you are still following me so congratulations.

118

00:07:27,990  -->  00:07:29,100
You're awesome.

119

00:07:29,100  -->  00:07:32,370
And let's see if we can finish this CIMS successfully.

120

00:07:32,370  -->  00:07:34,410
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
