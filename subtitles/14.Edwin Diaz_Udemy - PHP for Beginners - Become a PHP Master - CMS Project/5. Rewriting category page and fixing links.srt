1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,950
Back to the students.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,420
So in this lecture we're going to be facing some links and we have a little issue in the last lecture

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,740
that we click on one of these and just because it is breaking our links of course we've got our regular

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,180
expressions working.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,410
And if you click here of course is going to be looking for pulls at me because we are creating that.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:23,780
So now all we need to do is make sure that those links are relative to our whole.

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,470
You are all right here.

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,210
Our Web site.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,060
OK.

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:36,850
So let's go and let's go to navigation real quick and all we have to do is add it for slashy amass so

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,350
that we can take this off if we want to hear.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,640
And as simple as that.

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,090
OK.

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:52,150
And everywhere you have that OK see a mass

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,230
house

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,350
carry.

17
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:09,400
Now come back here click on this while that's working.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,890
And it is working and that's working.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,810
Of course we need to take care of this bad boy right here.

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,010
And can you actually tell me how we can take care of this guy.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,170
Well guys come on we already did this super easy or we have to do is do that same thing we did to post.

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,800
Right.

23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,040
So let's come back here.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,050
Let's go to the Access file here.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,670
I'm going to actually copy this and paste it.

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,240
That's how simple it is.

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,750
And then here what are we going to be looking for Category 1 this.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,620
You are out to be category.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,010
And we're going to be looking for this guy here category.

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,040
And one thing that I have to actually make sure is that I know OK.

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
So just say Scott to go free.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,710
And

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,720
I think that's what he says there.

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,350
Yeah that's all we're looking for.

35
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,620
Let's save it.

36
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,710
Come back here.

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,220
Let's see.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,230
Let's see this ng action of course that's not going to work because that's category number wise and

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,430
52.

40
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,310
We have to fix that link.

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,350
Let's just come back here and this just right.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,200
Category 2.

43
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,870
There we go see that let's go fix the link.

44
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,440
I think that's an obligation and that's this guy right here.

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,530
Let's just remove all that

46
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,620
and

47
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,590
that's it.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,720
That's all he needs to do.

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:56,230
Actually you can use this for a quick let's see cat I d am I doing the right.

50
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,030
Let's see.

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,520
Yeah let's come back here.

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,040
Category that we go up which B category and then we go we got something there.

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,530
So as you see there this is pretty pretty pretty simple.

54
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,980
Pretty powerful too no regular expressions.

55
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,470
Again I can not recommend this enough even if you don't take my regular expression course.

56
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,240
I always get annoyed because it's super useful.

57
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:20,770
OK.
