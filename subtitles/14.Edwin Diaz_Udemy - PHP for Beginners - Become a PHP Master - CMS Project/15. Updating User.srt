1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,920
All right so we get a lot of things going on here and a lot things are working.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,440
We have all the data that we need.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,300
This plane right here on this forum.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,620
The next thing is to update this form and we need to create the update query for that.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,860
And I think we have the update query somewhere in there and let's go ahead in and see if we can get

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:35,610
it from maybe comment and say your comments right here at it.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,650
I think your comments has all of that data that we need so let's use this.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:49,170
Check it out real quick or we can check out edit post and check it out there.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,550
It pulls does not have they will go at a post that has a little bit of a better one that we need.

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,040
All right so let's go ahead and take these actually.

11
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:06,930
We're going to need this one here and perfit let's just take the whole thing take it from edit post.

12
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,720
This is the great thing about copying page right.

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,110
Can go all of that data here.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,060
All right so let's go to where we were before eddied user right here not far away.

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:19,970
All right.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:25,050
So instead of having all of this here what we need to do is have that query that we just pulled from

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,950
there right here.

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,530
And let's just paste it right here.

19
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:33,950
OK.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,500
We need to change a couple of things here though.

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,670
All right so we're going to update users.

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:41,720
All right.

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,710
And we need to change a couple of these parameters here.

24
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,880
Well not parameters variables and call them names and all of that to match our C or for the user table.

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,160
So let's change the columns first.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,440
We're going to change the user first name.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:11,680
What else is your last name user role and all that.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,040
Let's just type it in.

29
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,800
I think we're going to roll and was and that's one user name user email.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,930
It's actually right there.

31
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,680
So it shows

32
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,130
user name

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,840
user e-mail

34
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,540
the user password

35
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,860
password right there.

36
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,630
I think it means anything right now.

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,250
Perfect.

38
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,040
Well now this plane a whole bunch of things just what we need.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,860
All right.

40
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,740
And let's change the variables.

41
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,940
How about that.

42
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,630
So let's go ahead and do that right here.

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,510
Since we name it name does the same we just copy this in front of the dollar sign and we're good to

44
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,210
go right.

45
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:09,090
And we don't have that here so we need to make that call right.

46
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:17,650
Cote's brackets in that space right there make sure we put that dollar sign there.

47
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,520
All right user name

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,030
e-mail

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,030
password.

50
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:36,660
OK.

51
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,700
All right so

52
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:53,160
user id make sure you change the WHERE statement where user ID equals a user ID and is the user ID that

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,020
we are using right now.

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,610
All right.

55
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,830
Okay perfect.

56
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,970
If this is not now then I need right now.

57
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,320
So

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:15,630
then this is another terrible when Like I said we're now going to need that now we need to send this

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,940
information right.

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,930
So let's create that we can send this query down.

61
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,800
So we're going to send this.

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,440
And actually we can just say the user Kohary

63
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,600
as you lie Kohary.

64
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,290
And what are we going to send it.

65
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,980
We're going to send it in with a connection with Aquarion

66
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:59,020
and we just make sure that if this query does not work and we can sure that we can use a function.

67
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:13,400
So confirm that we have the function there available confirm Querrey.

68
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,600
If it's not available we're going out to make it available.

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,100
When me see something that's got two functions in the admin and is actually available so you're good

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,630
to go.

71
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,080
All right.

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,810
So let's let's check it out and see what what kind of errors we get if we get any.

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,250
All right.

74
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:40,790
All right.

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,660
Perfect.

76
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,110
Let's call it swabbies of the user.

77
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,410
We fill you have a narrow.

78
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,620
All right.

79
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,780
We might not be picking up this ID.

80
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,000
All right.

81
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,560
So we need to check on that.

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,100
How can we miss on that right here user id say is a mistake.

83
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,320
Let's check take this call my out of this.

84
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,870
Check it out again.

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,130
All right.

86
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,160
First of all suave is of the use.

87
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:12,690
There we go.

88
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,360
That's that's.

89
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,310
That was a problem.

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,350
All right let's go and check out other users.

91
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,500
You see that Suarez.

92
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,590
So everything is going good.

93
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,670
Great.

94
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,290
Let's change the recall to Ricos.

95
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,950
Subscribe to admin and let's check it out again.

96
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,210
Perfit Rico Suave is let's check this.

97
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,170
Change this to subscribe to see what we're getting.

98
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,970
Perfect.

99
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,350
So everything is working fine we're able to update our users and we can update it from here so we can

100
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,670
delete them if we wanted to.

101
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,910
So we are golden right now if you were able to do this with me congratulations you're doing great.

102
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,710
Do not give up.

103
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,320
Remember that the more information you get the better you become.

104
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,890
The more mistakes you make as a developer and the more practice you get so you will become better eventually.

105
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,600
Right.

106
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,440
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one don't give up.

107
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,230
Take care.
