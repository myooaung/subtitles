1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,730
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here we're finally going to see if we can add some

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,440
categories in here right.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,600
Because right now we're not getting anything.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,580
So I hope you're excited this is a good lecture and you've got to learn a lot.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,310
OK.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,970
So let's go ahead and start doing this.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,590
So I mean categories of Ph.D..

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,180
And this is the admin.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,470
Right.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,060
And all my code is around thirty eight.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,450
Right.

12
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,490
But on your side might be a little different here so I'm going to be right below this

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,060
element with a class of call hiving it's s hyphen sits right now.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,400
Make sure one thing that I want to make sure here is down this attribute here method.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,520
Make sure you have the post here because if you don't have that this is not going to work.

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,290
Right.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,080
So let's go ahead and start doing this.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,640
All right so the first thing that we need to do is actually detect to see if we are getting some data

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,680
from that form right.

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,030
So I'm going to say if we said Actually let's put a peach Picardie.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,380
Here we go.

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,200
Whoops.

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,140
Bring it down a little bit.

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,980
If it's set.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,970
All right.

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,810
And what do we want to check for.

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,170
Remember Paul Superville we're very good Jorge.

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,790
So we're checking for the cat title right.

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,220
Or we can check for the submit.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,820
Actually back at the submit.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,100
Right.

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,780
All right so if we find this with me we want to do something let's go ahead and echo something out to

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,430
see if this works.

34
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,630
I'd like to echo is a very good function and I echo something H-1 here.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,870
Hello.

36
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,740
We go.

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,510
Let's go ahead and check that out.

38
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,800
REFRESH AND HELLO.

39
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,900
It's available.

40
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,440
Perfect.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,590
Right so it's working.

42
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,260
All right so another form is working.

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Let's go ahead and keep building this up.

44
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:14,620
All right.

45
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,610
I take that out because I don't need it anymore.

46
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,900
So we're going to get something out a year.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,200
We're going to get the title right.

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,810
So let's get that out of the superglue.

49
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,070
I'm going to paste that in here because I don't like writing much.

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,880
I actually love writing but that's just me.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,730
So Kat let's just name a cat title.

52
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,400
So we got the variable here holding that super global key right here.

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,730
Of course the value of it.

54
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:44,380
All right.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,170
So now that we have that we can we can do a couple of checks here used to make sure because we want

56
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,620
to make sure that if somebody's clicking here if they don't put anything here if it is blank we want

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,550
to make sure that we display some type of feedback to the user Hey listen you need to fill this up you

58
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,290
know.

59
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,770
And if you know if it's black would you want to submit it.

60
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,620
And they if they have something then we want to submit it of course right.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,120
So let's go ahead and do that.

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,020
Let's let's just say is do a couple little validations here so you learn how you learn the hangovers.

63
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,900
If the cat title equals the string right.

64
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:27,090
We could do that or empty as you use this function empty.

65
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,720
And if the cat side is empty then we do something right.

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,610
So let's go ahead and echo some type of message say Echo.

67
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,460
This field should not be empty.

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,700
Not sure but it should not.

69
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,780
I was going to write but again can you believe it.

70
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,720
MT You know what's going on with me today.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,410
I need my coffee.

72
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,120
All right else.

73
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,400
So another thing is so if if it's not empty then.

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,470
What do we want to do.

75
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,430
Make sure curly brackets your good right there right there.

76
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,090
Perfect.

77
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:12,530
All right.

78
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,890
Every time I click on the eye you see the underline there and then are they're lying here.

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,390
So that's how I know that they are correct even though you know you just want to make sure.

80
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,070
So if everything is good right now then we want to do our Querrey.

81
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,380
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

82
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:45,810
So let's say you just put that there and they say insert into category our table or we go and we could

83
00:04:45,810 --> 00:05:00,870
say this is the column in our right here cat category is the columns inside our table database.

84
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,660
And I did a database table.

85
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,950
All right.

86
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:12,450
So let's go ahead and concatenate the rest of the query and say the values are going to be what.

87
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,190
You know remember the values

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,320
and you guess

89
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,180
that title.

90
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,440
That's what we want to put in there.

91
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,830
There we go.

92
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,960
Title.

93
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,720
All right.

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,920
For my little space right here and then.

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
All right.

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,200
So now that we have our choir we construct here for the database and the last thing is to what to sent.

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,950
Right.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,250
So we're just going to say create category and name this variable here.

99
00:05:51,250 --> 00:06:01,320
Got to go or we could go where we are right and then we're going to sign the function that is going

100
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,060
to send this to our database called Querrey.

101
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,300
Right.

102
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,330
The connection with passing the connection and then passing the query of course.

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,400
All right.

104
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,510
So after this is done we are good to go.

105
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,050
Now let's do a little.

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,510
Another little safety net here.

107
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,160
I call save net because we want to make sure that if for some reason this does not work with nobody.

108
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,500
All right.

109
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,290
So I'm just going to say if for some reason this is not happening if this is false.

110
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,760
I end up with a not here.

111
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:48,120
Operator So if not create a query if it's not true then what we want to do is make sure that we kill

112
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,420
this stripped right this function should be killed instead of die or die.

113
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,250
That's what I think.

114
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,840
I don't know.

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,470
You are welcome to your own opinion with us or I think.

116
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:10,460
All right so then we could concatenate here a error just to find out exactly what is going on right.

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,240
There we go.

118
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,990
So I'm just going to recap real quick and what I just did or when I say is a little bit.

119
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,360
So it looks better.

120
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,280
So we're getting some information we're getting the post-Super global here from the form right.

121
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,660
We are getting the cat title out of it.

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,960
We are assigning it to this variable here and they won't do so little validations here.

123
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:39,840
We're saying if the cat title is empty as an industry or if it's empty then we want to ekal this field

124
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,860
should be should not be empty should not be and this field should not be empty.

125
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,460
Ok I wrote it correctly else than we want if it's 90 then we want to insert the data into our table.

126
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,920
Right.

127
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,990
We're going to send the query right here with him.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,470
Ask you rely on the score Querrey takes two parameter connection in the query and then we are checking

129
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,410
here to see if that where we were successful.

130
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,920
All right.

131
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,540
If it wasn't successful then we are going to kill the script with a strong message where we failed and

132
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,860
we are concatenating this function here and we're passing this parameter here.

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,320
Correction just in case it doesn't work.

134
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:20,910
All right.

135
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,420
So let's go ahead and check that out real quick and see if it works.

136
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,500
And I'm just going to say test here I category.

137
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,550
Voila.

138
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,630
All right.

139
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:37,400
So this is working now let's do an empty and this fill should not be empty.

140
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,040
All right.

141
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,930
So is it works for both so we are getting something here test too.

142
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,210
And if we don't type anything we don't get it.

143
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,180
It doesn't get submitted and we get this little nice string here telling us that the fuel should not

144
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,820
be empty.

145
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,370
All right.

146
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,040
Perfect.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,790
So I think you have the hang of this and you can do this over and over again.

148
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,370
Thank you so much for watching this lecture.

149

152
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,980
Good luck with everything.

153
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,440
Bye bye.
