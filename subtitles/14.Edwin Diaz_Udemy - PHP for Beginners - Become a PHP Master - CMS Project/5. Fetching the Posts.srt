1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,540
There is one thing that we need to do before we start you know going all general crazy on this feature

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:18,410
here is that we need to add one more field to our post table so let's go to BHB admin here.

3
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:29,370
I want to add Ada likes field here just because we are we going to be updating our likes.

4
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,450
You know we want to tell how many likes a post has.

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,240
OK.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,710
So let's call this likes like that and you know of course you can do 11 or you can do more than that

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,840
if you like and you're going to do 11.

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,680
You'll be the judge of how many likes that post is going to have.

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:44,900
OK.

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,110
So make sure that couple of millions you know.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,080
But anyway let's just click save here and say that's all we need for that.

12
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,130
And let's go back to this here.

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,050
OK.

14
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,810
So now that we're sending our agents requests make sure that's working guys OK member to have your browser

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,900
console open remember that it doesn't work the first time so make sure that you look in your console

16
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,170
as you can see here that that was the area that we had before when the page was sending the wrong request

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,310
to let's fix that real quick.

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,060
There we go.

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,410
And you see now that that's not there.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,740
Make sure you check your network.

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,530
Make sure that it's sending that correctly.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,810
Once you click there you should see your headers or you preview or response.

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,370
Cookies and all that stuff.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,080
OK in your browser console.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,840
So let's go back here.

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,290
Another was sending the data.

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,620
What is it that we want to do.

28
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,090
Well let's go back to the top here since this is what we are detecting this.

29
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,110
The first thing that we want to do is write it down and come in here.

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,360
We want to select all polls.

31
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,670
Basically we one to select select the post.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
That's the first step.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,970
Let's just write it down here.

34
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:11,290
The second would be to once we select the polls we need to update the polls polls with likes OK.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,610
And then the third thing that we need is to put data inside our likes right.

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:31,320
So insert data or insert likes or or create likes like this create likes for polls OK.

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,240
So those are the three things that we need to do.

38
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:41,590
Let's go ahead and start working with selecting the polls are you know fairly enough that polls so let's

39
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:53,990
just do the search let's just create a variable here call Search post and we are going to this is going

40
00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:02,910
to be a Querrey So we're going to say select and guys you don't have to uppercase it is just good practice

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,840
to differentiate your my statement from your regular you know words.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,340
So I like to open uppercase and you don't have to say I'm going to say let all the polls from polls.

43
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,380
OK.

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,190
You don't have to do that you can just select whatever you want.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,460
Where was I.

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,830
The is equal to some ID right.

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,940
So how do we get the polls.

48
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,500
Well we have it in our you know get requests.

49
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:38,930
OK.

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,690
But we also have it in our post that we're sending So let's create this here.

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,870
And we named it false ID.

52
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,680
Remember that just like that.

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,930
And I'm just going to create a variable to hold this just because I don't want to insert this thing

54
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,660
in here.

55
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,430
I like it to be a little bit smaller.

56
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,430
Well you can go ahead you can you know minimize your code and put it here if you want.

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,410
I'm just going to play of like this in there.

58
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,340
McKay you can separate the concatenate and make it however you want.

59
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,000
This is just how I want it.

60
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,650
So now that we have that less use you get a false result.

61
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,470
Let's just get a variable here to fetch.

62
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:39,960
So I'm going to fetch the search post as a matter of fact let's just name a search post Querrey.

63
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,400
So it makes a little bit more sense.

64
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:50,060
OK once I have the post requests the post resoled I want to get it out of there.

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,620
Right.

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:04,610
So I'm just going to call this likes and going to do pose we sold right here and just get the likes

67
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:16,390
symbols that you can name a post if you like if you if you you know want to make it look a little better.

68
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:24,100
And just like that and this here is saying my school got a string.

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,880
So

70
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:37,340
OK we can come Kartini this but as a matter of fact it says he has a string select from all that's not

71
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,240
what it is.

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,260
I know that was right.

73
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,600
It's just that we forgot to upper case.

74
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,700
If you're going to uppercase something make sure if you're going to open a case.

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,960
Dean you're my askew statements make sure that you will practice everything ok.

76
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,360
I will complain.

77
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,750
And as a matter of fact as you see right here I know this is fine.

78
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,210
It's supposed to get a.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,190
Actually it's not fine.

80
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,520
It's supposed to get.

81
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,800
We're supposed to do a query sorry about that guys.

82
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,780
So this is why.

83
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,480
Yeah sorry about that.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,430
You know I don't write a lot about my askew so I don't use them much.

85
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,250
OK.

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,050
So

87
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,300
let's go back here.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,500
Sure.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,210
I know I was missing something polls.

90
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,090
I should have wrote this in another application.

91
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,730
Right.

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm just doing this improvising guys.

93
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,520
OK so give me a break.

94
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,130
OK.

95
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,070
So let's do this Kulai

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
Kohary I believe it is.

97
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,960
There we go.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,280
And we need the connection which we don't have right here let's use this connection very well should

99
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
be available to us.

100
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,770
But if it's now don't worry we're going to make it available to us right now.

101
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,300
OK.

102
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,130
So we're going to pass equerry here.

103
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,660
It's a matter of fact.

104
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
Let's go ahead.

105
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,540
If he's not available we'll make it available in a minute.

106
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,400
So if this fails we'll find out soon enough.

107
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,480
So it looks like we do have the connection here so yeah.

108
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,950
It is available to us because we have it available somewhere in there.

109
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,000
BHB functions or the head or something would be nice to have a function that will you know anyway.

110
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,970
So now that we have that let's actually make sure that it is working.

111
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,650
So

112
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:50,580
let's actually say if my ask you Ally known Rose and we pass in the connection here again that salt

113
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:08,470
ok is greater or equal than one then we are going to Eckel the same.

114
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,680
I don't know the

115
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,680
let's just echo the post ID What do you guys think

116
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,480
those ideas like that.

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,890
Let's check it out real quick.

118
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:33,090
We wrote a lot of code we don't know if it works like and we've got the polls right there and we've

119
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,660
got a preview and you can see that it is displaying 139.

120
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,620
So we are getting the polls data.

121
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,800
So that's the first step.

122
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:42,550
OK.

123
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,130
Selecting the polls we finished that on the next step.

124
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,510
We're going to be updating our polls so hopefully you did it correctly.

125
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,200
If not don't worry we'll get it right.

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,880
Just make sure that you put your questions in the discussion that will help you out.

127
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,340
Thank you so much and see you in the next lecture.
