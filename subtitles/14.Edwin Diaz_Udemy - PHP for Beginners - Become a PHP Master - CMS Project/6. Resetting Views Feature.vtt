00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.530
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.460
In the last lecture I gave a little challenge.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.950
I told you if you wanted to take the challenge of actually creating a function or a piece of code that

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.460
we actually set the views in your table in that specific column for that specific post you could you

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.960
could just make a function right.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.540
Well hopefully you took the challenge and did it if you did not pause the video and try to do it yourself.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.320
You're going to learn a lot more.

8
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.730
And right now I don't want you to get confused with my data here.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.550
I have a lot of clones right because I just don't like to create different data for every post because

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.980
you said there was a time I just come here and clone everything just like I show you how to do.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.500
But anyway here we see some views right.

12
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.390
We have some views here and we want to create a functionality that is going to delete it.

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.950
All right this is going to be pretty cool.

14
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.100
I want you to pay very close attention for some of you that already did it because you are such a professional

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.890
already.

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.580
Great.

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.070
Congratulations.

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610
I'm glad you did it when you create things like that.

19
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.910
You don't post it down on the under discussion board let people know that you did it and you don't feel

20
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.600
happy about it.

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240
You know everybody can do that.

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.990
But anyway let me show you how to do this.

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.060
So go to your posts.

24
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.330
The first thing that we need to do is actually create a link to send that get requests.

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.280
Hopefully you guys some of you already done this before.

26
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.840
So all right we got this set up already.

27
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.190
Let's go to where we are.

28
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.380
Explain it and let's create a link right here an anchor tag.

29
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.430
And I'm going to wrap this post view which is a number in that link and if I go here now you can see

30
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.550
Whoops.

31
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.330
All right.

32
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.520
Make sure that you put single quotes on this.

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.690
I'm going to show you another way of actually echoing all this information there.

34
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.410
Right.

35
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.210
Because if there is a better way and my new course which is the e-commerce for beginners is the come

36
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.160
out I still don't know the name of it but it's going to show you how to build a e-commerce system like

37
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.250
a shopping store for customers.

38
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.100
Maybe he's already out by the time you're watching this is going to show you how to do this.

39
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.530
CMOs are a lot better.

40
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.300
The code is going to be a lot cleaner and more organized and you are an experienced BHP developer now

41
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.490
you're going to get a lot more knowledge and we're going to be doing a lot of really cool things in

42
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.040
that course just to let you know.

43
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
But anyway it should be available whether it's watching this.

44
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.250
If he's not just way a little bit and will be available anyway so now what we want to do is when we

45
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.050
click on this link here we want to send a request to a piece of code and that piece of code is going

46
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.010
to make this 0 again.

47
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.030
So what is that piece of code that we're sending first let's send requests and we're going to be doing

48
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.250
the same thing we did with that with the knee right here.

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.660
So I'm just going to copy this ref from the delete button right beside it and paste it in there and

50
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.000
instead of sending the delete.

51
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.660
All right.

52
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.990
We are going to send reset.

53
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.540
All right.

54
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.830
So now we got to detect for that reset.

55
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.530
So we got to come here to the cold right Willow and win a copy this whole thing and you're going to

56
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.420
face sitting here and we are going to check for a reset.

57
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.400
So if we get in they get requests we're convert this into the idea which is that's what it is.

58
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.790
Actually that's the value of it.

59
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.170
And then instead of doing the lead we're going to do update.

60
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.650
So we're going to say update posts

61
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.660
and then we're going to set.

62
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.060
I'm trying to remember the column name polls views count.

63
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:53.480
It's right there equal to zero where polls ID right here.

64
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
Polls ID.

65
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.930
All right equal to what the polls ID.

66
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.290
And that's right.

67
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.410
We do this and the next thing is let's just say call this resets Querrey.

68
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.170
All right.

69
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.620
Beautiful.

70
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.650
We changed the name for that.

71
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.300
Here we work anyway.

72
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.240
But I'd like to change the name.

73
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.620
One thing that I wanted to show you for those of you that are always saying hey we should be scaping

74
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.200
these values yes you should be scaping these values.

75
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.020
By the time you watch this lecture I should have told you that.

76
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.180
I don't know what lecture it was.

77
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.880
I think it was 50 something I tell you that you should escape your values so let me just for now on

78
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.620
do that so that way you'll be aware of it.

79
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.330
All right.

80
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.050
So what I'm going to do is going to break out of here and I'm going to concatenate.

81
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.920
And you're going to use this function as you apply real scape string.

82
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.160
This is long.

83
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.170
All right my new course I show you how to escape a lot better than this.

84
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.720
All right.

85
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.730
So my ask you a real SKAIFE string is going to take the connection.

86
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.900
And whatever you're scaping in this case we are escaping the guy right here.

87
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.940
So we'll just put that in here.

88
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.380
All right.

89
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.760
All right.

90
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.190
Perfect.

91
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.890
So once we scaped that we're good to go.

92
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.360
And that's all we need.

93
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.750
All right.

94
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.200
Let's come back here refresh.

95
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.390
We have no errors here.

96
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.980
All right.

97
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.450
Sometimes when something's not working out a better way to actually find errors is when you right click

98
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.120
and you page source sometimes you get the arrows down here right below here you get you see arrows all

99
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.190
the way in the bottom of the screen.

100
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.180
That's just a little trick there just for those of you that are paying attention.

101
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.950
But anyway we've got this one here let's just click on it.

102
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.150
Let's go back and you see now 0 we get this pull 65 we click on it and now we go back zero.

103
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.550
And we can make all of them zero like this.

104
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.410
Look at that beautiful right.

105
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.750
Just beautiful.

106
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.860
And what you can even go further with this and you can actually put that in this boat for sure and I'll

107
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.670
let you see it like we said stat's or something like that and build a functionality there is real cool.

108
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.340
Right.

109
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.000
So I just wanted to show you that hopefully you appreciate it very much if you are in the discussion.

110
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.640
I'm going to put the discussion just to let you know.

111
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.770
But like it shared with your friends whatever you need to do at home see you in the next lecture.

112
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.400
Take care.
