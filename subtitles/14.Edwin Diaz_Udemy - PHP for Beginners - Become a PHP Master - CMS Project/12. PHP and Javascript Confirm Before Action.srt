00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,890
Welcome back my students in this lecture here we are going to be learning how to do a confirmation before

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,520
we delete any item via javascript and also BHB.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,180
All right.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,360
So some of you have e-mailed me and message me and asked me how to do this.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,820
I'm going to show you in this lecture how easy it is to do this thing I think is very useful to have

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,210
this feature in or see a mess.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,670
Right.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,110
So there we go.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:36,120
Now we are in post-up DHB and I'm just I just have one post here and the goal here is to when we click

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,050
delete.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,420
We want to have these bots here appear.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,740
Say are you sure you want to delete this message.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,630
Yes or no.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,180
Right.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,200
And if we click Cancel or no then the message doesn't get deleted.

16
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,510
But if we click OK then it gets deleted from our database.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,370
So let me show you how to do that.

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,790
Let's go I want you to go to View on the score.

19
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:07,130
All polls view on the score on the score postop BHB and for me it's going to be online 166.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,970
It might be a different line for you.

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,390
All right.

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,570
And this is insane colludes right there.

23
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,480
Right.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,260
So now what we need to do is and for those of you that don't know javascript make sure that you take

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,420
my jobs who of course is going to show you a lot of useful information with javascript.

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,460
If you are in what development you need javascript there is no way around it.

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,900
And to make it better that Jake where he course that I got will make your javascript more powerful.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,360
All right.

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,120
But anyway so what we need to do we have an anchor tag right here.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,620
This is the anchor tack that we use to send the requests.

31
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,450
Right.

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
To delete this.

33
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,990
So what we need here is to add some javascript so we can to add a function call or an event handler

34
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,750
right on click.

35
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,470
So we add its own click here so that means when we click on this link something's going to happen right.

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,480
Well what they do is escape this like this.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,610
Right.

38
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,440
And we want to escape the other.

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,560
There we go like this now between here I'm going to write my javascript so I was going to say I'm going

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,090
to say Java script right.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,010
And we could say return turn and then we're going to use a function from javascript is going to be called

42
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:39,570
to confirm this function is going to pop up a box right in the middle of your screen asking you you

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:50,000
know the questions so we can say whatever we want we could say Are you sure you want to delete.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,380
All right.

45
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,130
So let's just make sure everything is right here.

46
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,830
OK.

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,180
So once we do that that's it.

48
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,460
That's all we've got to do.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,350
There's nothing else that we've got to fix here.

50
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,640
We wrote javascript everything should be working according to plans.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,970
Let's just save it.

52
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,280
You see how easy that was.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Right.

54
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,800
So now we refresh here and we click delete.

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,800
And we're going to ask us are you sure you want to delete this message right.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,200
Well it doesn't say Massachusetts's delete right.

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,140
I'm going to cancel.

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,530
And nothing gets deleted.

59
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,360
But if I click again and I say OK then this post gets deleted.

60
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,560
All right and I just figure out your same message.

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,450
All right.

62
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,070
Don't mind me.

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,210
Disregard that message word that I just said All right.

64
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,450
But anyway here you go.

65
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,090
Now you can add this functionality to anything you want.

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,830
I see a mess.

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,700
I think it's a very useful for anality thing for those students that suggest it is and I'm you know

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,290
every time you said you're suggesting I write it down and when I have time I'll add it to the CMOS.

69
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:52,780
All right.

70
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,230
So remember we had the on click.

71
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,900
Make sure that is capital right here.

72
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,770
All right.

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,380
That's the best way of writing it.

74
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:08,340
And then escape your double quotes and then write javascript Kallen and then returned the confirmed

75
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,670
function with some strings in there.

76
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,840
All right.

77
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,220
Perfect.

78
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,580
And make sure that you scaped here also.

79
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,420
So anyway there you have it.

80
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,540
For those of you that one of these functions I think you got it.

81
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,810
Your instructor cares and I want you to learn more and more every single day.

82
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,180
So keep motivated keep doing the course you're doing a very good job if you got this far and you're

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,940
awesome.

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,770
Thank you.

85
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,490
And I see you in the next lectures
