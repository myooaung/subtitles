00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.840
I will come back to the student.

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.310
So we added a really cool functionality right.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.410
We added this forgot password feature.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.610
Now if you notice here on the sidebar that BHB This is the code for that new feature.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:24.170
Keep in mind that we are only testing for pose requests so we have a search OK that is actually requesting

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.280
at Port meant method is actually tranced communicating with a POST request right and we also have a

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.460
log in.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.130
So this if we leave it that way it is our search is not going to work on your percent.

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.400
So if we try searching for let's say bootstrap and click here that's going to redirect of course because

10
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:54.490
that's what our code is doing here for those and if this is not set OK then we are actually redirecting

11
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.700
here.

12
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.290
So for our search to actually work right we just have to create to make this a little better so we can

13
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.690
just say if we said

14
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.820
post Logan OK because we have that log in variable inside the input right the two of you need a match

15
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.770
of it without value.

16
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.080
So we put this like this we should be good to go.

17
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.800
OK.

18
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.740
That just organizes a little bit.

19
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.610
Let's go back and check it out.

20
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.480
So now if I do a booster up again Antar you can see that we are able to find that specific search which

21
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.190
is great.

22
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.040
OK.

23
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.390
So that's one way that you can refactor that.

24
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.090
And again you can take this to a whole function if you want it to.

25
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.700
But I think it's pretty good for why we need it.

26
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.370
OK.

27
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.860
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lectures.

28
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.380
Take care.
