00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.930
All right.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.940
So we built we put a link here that says a parameter that would send us to a post page.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.580
Right.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410
So we were able to do that great on this lecture here.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.980
I want to take care of the categories.

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.140
It's going to be very similar to what we did with this.

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.500
And also I want to fix this.

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.010
Let's go ahead and fix that what I mean we're fixing is that we need to have this link direct us to

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.060
the home page.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.830
So let's go ahead and do that right now is kind of bothering me there a little bit.

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.560
So navigation and this make sure that he goes to and it's right here right.

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.060
And stuff Ph be.

13
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.480
And we are already in his double checking the links right here at admin This would take me to the end

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:01.650
it's all right let's check on the hoops when he actually does it.

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.970
I'm sorry I'm putting this in the class.

16
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.110
It's like I do things sometimes and I don't even see it.

17
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.370
I just see it in my mind.

18
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.460
I don't know if they ever happened to you if you click on is going to take us to the end.

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.250
It's all right.

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.020
Perfect.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
And that's all we hear in the navigation includes.

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.730
So that would take us to when it's perfect.

23
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.200
All right so the next step is let's go to the sidebar and hear what we need to put a link under.

24
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.710
As you as you see here this is the search and this is the blog category's diff.

25
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.050
And here in the link that we got to produce this category is in the right side and the sidebar.

26
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.180
We need to put a link right here to send to you page that we will be building.

27
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.980
We don't have it yet but is going to be called category that BHB and we are going to be sending something

28
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.630
here.

29
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.050
And that's something is going to be a parameter called category equals something and this something

30
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.240
would be the idea we're going to take out from the table right now from the column Id cat ID.

31
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.450
We're going to take out the value cat for the value of the category ID.

32
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.350
So here we're going to put in that variable right here.

33
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.000
So we're going to send this parameter here.

34
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.390
Category equals whatever category ID that is.

35
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.100
All right.

36
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.240
And then we need to catch it.

37
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.270
So let's go ahead and make that page right now.

38
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.720
Let's make it on the same place as in it actually.

39
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.190
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a save as out of.

40
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.800
And it's right here.

41
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.210
I'm going to go into save us and then call this category because it's almost the same thing that BHB.

42
00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.730
All right.

43
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.460
Perfect.

44
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.450
So here what I want to do is I want to catch that value that we are sending in that sidebar with this

45
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.610
statement and this statement is going to have the function it said like we always use it.

46
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.860
We did get super global and we're going to be catching that category key for the array.

47
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.870
When we catch that when we need to convert it so that we can check against that.

48
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.520
Right.

49
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:38.490
So let's convert that category key right here into a post as my if you want to pause the video and you

50
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.120
think you know this is very similar so the polls at BHB.

51
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.310
All right so if you think you can do it go ahead and do and try right now positivity and try it.

52
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.310
It will help you.

53
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.930
All right.

54
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.270
And if you can't just hang on pause a video and I'll finish it.

55
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.930
All right.

56
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.960
So hopefully your way will to do this and you successful.

57
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.680
If not don't worry I got your back right now.

58
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.520
So post got to go see ID.

59
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.690
And that's it.

60
00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:17.320
And then here we select everything from post where you remember where we're posts.

61
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.400
Remember this column right here post got it already.

62
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.280
That's what it is for a false category Heidi.

63
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.500
This is a column in the table equals what does ID that we bring in in from there you are.

64
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.000
All right.

65
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.400
That's the category right there.

66
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.200
And let's check to see if it works.

67
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.350
See we don't have any mistakes here.

68
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.520
All right let's check it out.

69
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.690
Let's go to the front page.

70
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.060
Let's click on Java and we've got three poses and Java ninths right.

71
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.380
Let's be BHB has no.

72
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.860
All right and we could make a page here just to let the user know that there is nothing there or redirect

73
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.190
them somewhere else that we bese probably an extra features.

74
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.400
Well right now we're not concerned with that procedure APHC we have one post sample category we don't

75
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.970
have any poser's their own java we have to be perfect.

76
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.650
So anyway hopefully you were able to learn something really Avali.

77
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.740
I think you have.

78
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.230
So this is good information for you.

79
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.500
Take care and let's go ahead and do the next lecture.
