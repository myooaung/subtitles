1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,640
High on the last video we created some instances and we also created some functionalities.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,280
Now it's time for us to create some properties for functionalities for our.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,150
It's for our class.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,440
All right so the first thing that we are going to be doing is using a keyword called var right this

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,460
key is going to allow us to create properties that we can use within our class.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,050
Right.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:36,240
So this is very unique right here and we just now after the keyword var because we keep all var amines

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,680
variable we need to put just a regular variable mph p with a dollar sign.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,520
And then the name of the variable and the value if you decide to write.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,820
So we know we got four wheels in a car and I'm going to create a couple of properties here.

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,050
I'm going to show you how to use them later.

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,680
So let's create another one.

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,090
What do we know that a car has.

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,790
Hood has a hood.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,150
So we're going to do a value of one there.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,510
We have an engine of one.

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,500
We have doors.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,890
That's another important property right.

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,370
And you have a default of four doors.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,920
Right.

21
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,710
So now we added some properties to our class or should I say men object.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,260
Right.

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:43,190
Well so let's take the Mercedes-Benz out actually and just take it out completely right here.

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,770
All right.

25
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,190
So how do we use these properties here.

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,480
Right.

27
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,210
How do we use it.

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,830
Well everything here inside this class we need to actually use it with an instance.

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,950
That's the way we do it right.

30
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,840
Because this whole thing is meant to be used as an object.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,470
So we created right here right by instantiating it and then we use it.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,260
So now that we have this instance here and we put it in a variable Let's go ahead and Kreig and do something

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,540
with it.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,760
B and W and then I want to see how many wheels for us.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,320
I have to echo this.

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,940
So there we go.

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:30,210
So now we use a word echo like we usually do with the instance with a variable here that we we you know

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,960
we assign this instance to this variable.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,340
Now this whole thing is called an instance right.

40
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,330
So we use the minus and the greater than with wheels.

41
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,530
Now we don't put the dollar sign here.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,520
All right we don't put a dollar sign to call this property.

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,780
We already have the dollar sign the fine up here the way we use it out here is we don't do that we don't

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,690
put a dollar sign right here anymore.

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,510
All right.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,720
Just know that right.

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,500
So let's let's do something else.

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,390
Let's go ahead so we know we have four wheels.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,260
Not that I want to show you is that we can signed.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,950
All right so if I wanted to I can go ahead and do this.

51
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:23,670
B and W ryme then I can say you we use it we can change the value of this property right here on the

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,790
instance if we wanted to.

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,680
Right.

54
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
We could also use a method to do that.

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,220
We can also use this and now one thing that I wanted to show you is that every time we refer to this

56
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:44,030
car class inside the class every time we refer to this we refer to it with a word called does.

57
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,290
So let me just take this off and show you this.

58
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,330
This keyword here.

59
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,350
All right this is the way we reference desk this class inside the class so we can use a word does.

60
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:02,790
And we can say this wheels equal to 10.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,730
All right.

62
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,640
And if I take this off here.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,000
OK.

64
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,460
All I have to do now to use this right now is taking that for fourth right now because I'm not doing

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,540
anything with it.

66
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:15,980
All right.

67
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,160
I'm not actually calling this method.

68
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,010
I'm not calling it I need to call it right here.

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,380
So I got to do a B and B and W call the method and boom.

70
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:33,610
Now when I called and said this meant it's going to take care changing this wheel's value to 10.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,230
And when he changes to 10 degree if I call it again already change.

72
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,660
His mentor was able to do that for me.

73
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,630
Right.

74
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:49,230
So I know that inside the class we referred to each name we did he were called this.

75
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,620
So we don't have to say carping here we don't have to say BMW because we can do that.

76
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,280
We are actually creating an instance outside we create an instance outside and use it outside inside

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,130
the class.

78
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:14,290
We refer to it by Does just know that all right instead of this or this right because what we do here

79
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,230
is did we have the instance which is this here for instance.

80
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,150
Right.

81
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:26,500
We create a new instance with new car and we assign it a value we assign it we assign it to a variable

82
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,050
and then we use it.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,750
So we create this whole functionality right here inside the class we created as an instance and then

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,890
assign it to a variable and then we use this variable to do different things inside here right.

85
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:50,290
So but to refer to this because we refer to this whole thing this object outside with is we just use

86
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,110
the word key.

87
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,120
This way I know it's a little confusing but I know that we use this to to do things in the other class

88
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,860
that I referred to this object to this class.

89
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,310
All right so now we change that and we can also come back here and change it again if we wanted to.

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,670
But I'm not going to do that.

91
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,210
So for example let's create you know what I feel like creating a new instance and just let's create

92
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,020
a new instance of this card class.

93
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,380
Right.

94
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,690
And let's call a truck.

95
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,860
How about that.

96
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:25,400
And let's just take this idea here.

97
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,010
All right.

98
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:38,620
So I have this I'm echoing here wheels right for the B and W and what I want to do is I'm going to concatenate

99
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:51,470
here a b your tag used to make a lot of space and what I want to do is I want to echo the truck I want

100
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,820
to I wanted the truck to have different wheels because in the truck we have what do we have we have

101
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,010
more wheels right.

102
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,800
So what I'm going to do is as a matter of fact I think I can echo the whole thing out right here like

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,280
this eco wheels.

104
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,570
There we go.

105
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,510
We can actually even echo the whole thing without having a it for a ride.

106
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:22,360
So while we did here was we grabbed that we create a new is called Truck.

107
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:29,530
All right then we are changing the wheels value to 10 and then we are going at the same time we could

108
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,040
do that.

109
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,620
All right.

110
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,190
So keep that in mind.

111
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,630
All right so now the truck has two wheels.

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,000
We have a different instance with 10 wheels and we can also have.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,250
Of course the other properties here we can print that out.

114
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:43,940
All right.

115
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,460
Just know that we can do that.

116
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:55,450
Now we can create in another matter the here and we can call these men that create doors or something

117
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,170
like that and I say this doors

118
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,400
are no sets.

119
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,530
All right.

120
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,040
And that would change value every time I called this it would change value to set right.

121
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,390
So I can go ahead and say you know what truck.

122
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,370
Right.

123
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,300
And I can see doors and I could just echo it.

124
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:34,490
Well if I echo this like this it will give me for this put a B or tag here let's just concatenate this.

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,250
Right so we've got four here but I don't want four for my truck you know let's assign it a different

126
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,670
value.

127
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,980
Let's have some let's call that.

128
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,320
That this meant to write his own.

129
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,080
We we created it for something let's call it right.

130
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,430
So let's say you know what truck.

131
00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:01,540
So if it's your truck if I remember how to write truck and then boom.

132
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,780
So we call this matter here we change a value to and now and now.

133
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,530
Now truck has a Valeo sits.

134
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,030
Every time we call this method it would change the value of doors to 6.

135
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:20,400
Now what I'm trying to teach you here on this video here is that we can do whatever we want to do.

136
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,120
All right.

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,020
Once we create a distance we can change the properties we can have methods to change properties we can

138
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:36,510
go manually and change it we can leave it empty and then go ahead down here and start using it however

139
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,280
we want.

140
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,070
All right.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,510
I mean there are many different things that we can do here.

142
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,180
I just want you to get some practice on this so watch the video here.

143
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,580
Practice on your own create a nother class if you want.

144
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,010
Or you can create another class right below this one and call it color in car or something like that

145
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:03,100
creation colors creation properties for food or you know for your class create some mentors that would

146
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,630
do things in your class.

147
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,530
Practice practice practice makes perfection right.

148
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,420
So anyway thank you so much for watching this video.

149
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,810
Hopefully I was able to give you some knowledge here on how to use properties inside the class along

150
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,930
with methods.

151
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,460
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
