1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,690
All right so we are getting the comments and we are able to see it we're missing from the formation

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,450
of course.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,380
The only thing we're doing is displaying the comment from here and the other thing is we are able to

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,570
create it from the front of the Web site of the same as we are unable to do any Krout right now here

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,970
like delete edit or and approve approve any or anything anything like that.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,560
But what we will be doing on this lecture here is relating this comment to the post where I put the

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,220
title of the post here and when we click on it it's going to take us to that specific post.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,110
It's going to be great.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,740
All right.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,900
So let's go ahead and start doing it right fast right there.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:54,460
Let's go to at Main includes viewer comments and here where you see that you see the heading right here.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,810
All right of this table we're going to go after i status.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,390
We're going to go to in response to this song title right there.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,860
All right.

15
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,860
So that would be right here.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,620
Static songs start again.

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,140
The male there and we were going to remove that and make sure that we have a Querrey So let's send the

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,650
Querrey in.

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,450
The first is whether we're going to be writing is to select everything from posts we're going to bring

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:35,550
on data from posts where what they call them post ID Igor's we do you remember what we did with the

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,480
post ID when we submitted that comment.

22
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,200
We save it we saved it somewhere right here.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,590
This is where we say that when we submitted the form.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:57,120
All right so if you want to if you are lost make sure that you go back to the home site right here to

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,110
this lecture where we created this little forum here.

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,630
Every time we send the form we are also sending this parameter right here.

27
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,980
Right.

28
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:15,550
And then we are saving it in this common post ID that we are bringing out of the database right now.

29
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:23,160
All right so now that we have that what we need to do is send it in.

30
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:33,150
So we select false ID Kohary and are going to send it in my ass.

31
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,100
Q And may I ask you a lie.

32
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,410
Corey

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,500
Perry right.

34
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,410
Im going to send it in with a connection.

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:01,110
And we can use a while loop to loop through the resource set well to get that resource set back

36
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,140
my ask you lie.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,050
Fred you're going to use this function to bring back

38
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:24,120
on back to bring in and always have an issue with his fetch f t c h that s t c h is really hard for

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,380
me to get in in my mind anything related to DCH it's on today for some reason I guess.

40
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,190
Language barrier you know because I speak like three languages is a problem.

41
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,100
So when you see me struggling with it I know that that's what it is.

42
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:50,120
So I got some learning to write hopefully you can forgive me for that.

43
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,680
So we're going to get a post I.D. out of the database and assign it to a variable.

44
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:08,390
We're going to get a post-Idol out too and this time my hands are going faster than my mouth right there.

45
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,320
Perfect.

46
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,130
All right.

47
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,060
So hopefully we didn't make any mistakes if we did we will probably be blogging in a minute.

48
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,620
All right now let's get this going.

49
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,190
Let's echo this out here

50
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,340
and we need a link right here.

51
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,100
So first let's go ahead and see if

52
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,280
this is actually this plane so how right.

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
Let's go ahead and check it out.

54
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,340
Admen comment and is already this plane.

55
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,310
Beautiful.

56
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,790
As you can see here we go back.

57
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
We see this example three right here.

58
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,590
When you click on it.

59
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,410
So that means that this coming is related to that.

60
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,710
You see it.

61
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,590
All right.

62
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,990
Perfect So it's coming in.

63
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:11,330
Let's get a link here at Tref let's close it

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,520
and get the closing tag for that link.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Let's put that right in the middle here.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:22,970
All.

67
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:31,340
Let's make sure that we don't make a mistake here and we're going to send this outside twice because

68
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:37,910
when we got to come out of the admin and they included go to the root and that's going to be the post

69
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,000
of BHP

70
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,590
and going to BP I will be underscore ID.

71
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,410
He calls the post ID.

72
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,560
Hopefully we get it right.

73
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,200
All right.

74
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,360
So feeling understand what I did.

75
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm going to recap a little bit right now if not just forward it and you should be good.

76
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,090
All right so what we do here is that we are making a Querrey from post where post ID which is the column

77
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,330
in the database in the table.

78
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,980
All right Igor's the post ID this post ID we are getting it from this field right here.

79
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,670
And this field contains the post ID from here.

80
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,420
As you can see this coming right here has we have this you are able parameter right here.

81
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,080
Right.

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,010
And when we submit the form we're picking it up and saving it in the post composts ID field.

83
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,960
And when we save it in there so we have that value right in this case.

84
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,520
Let's say for example we have that 34 here saved there.

85
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,250
So when we are making this request right here

86
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,700
right here we are saying I want you right to select all the poles where the post the column is equal

87
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,800
to that pulse ID whatever pulse ID we pass it we are on right when the loop is going around.

88
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,780
So right now if we have 20 of them every time we click on the link right now it's going to send that

89
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,370
to that specific false ID.

90
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,570
So anyway let's go to the back here and let's refresh and you as you can see we have the link.

91
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,420
If we click it we go to that specific post.

92
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:30,730
All right.

93
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:38,920
So let's test this again and let's just actually make post make a comment on one of these polls right.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,010
Should we have some polls.

95
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,370
We just have to make comments on them.

96
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,580
This one.

97
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,790
Let's make a comment on this one here.

98
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:55,350
And then supposed to and let's send in a comment and let's call ourself Sandra Yeah we are actually

99
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:03,300
using girls names now because we have some girls or some women taking these courses and we have to use

100
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,870
them also.

101
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,760
Why not.

102
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,240
All right.

103
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,710
Ed and I are going to say anything about it right.

104
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:20,660
Ed I think I think your course is good.

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,340
All right.

106
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,590
So Mitt perfect submitted.

107
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,820
Let's go and check it out it.

108
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,680
And we could see that Sandra Sumida that post beautiful.

109
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,730
And let's go to outman and let's go to comments.

110
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,540
Let's see right here is on the proof of course it would click on they would take us to that post perfit

111
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,220
we click back.

112
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,910
Let's go to Polsce right.

113
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,600
Perfect.

114
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:57,220
So we can see that here and these IDs sets and then propose to.

115
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
In response to this polls.

116
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,670
Perfect.

117
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,510
This is looking better and better every time.

118
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,530
So we are done with this.

119
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:11,610
We laid in this table with the post table and on the next one we're going to start doing this crowd

120
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,440
right here.

121
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,030
All right.

122
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,570
Perfit thank you so much for watching.

123
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,080
And I see you on the next lecture
