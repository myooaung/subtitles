1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,730
So I wanted to actually explain to you a little bit about the project files.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:12,440
So I am currently in the lecture where the files are located where it says probably the lecture that

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,030
you're watching right now is called course exercise files or reference files.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,550
OK.

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,870
So in this current to me version I say YOU TO ME BECAUSE YOU TO ME change their interface.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:28,950
You're going to see that we have some options here automatically it's going to be on 10 80 your video

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,980
that you're watching right now.

8
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,570
If you have a good connection 720 if you are in the lower end connection or 360 depending where you

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:44,890
are so you can if you wan browse the Q&amp;A any of that specific course lecture and you can ask a question

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:49,500
right here on that specific lecture which is very good instead of going to the discussions.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,640
You can go to your dashboard right here of course you know that by now you can get a bookmark you can

12
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,150
change the speed in which I'm actually recording and here you're going to see your resources available

13
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,240
or some type of link here and video just in case maybe they change it in the future.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,190
Know that your resources are here and I'm going to download my resources.

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,080
This is where I want to get to.

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,280
OK.

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,450
So they're going to be on a zip folder like there's a zip file.

18
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,320
Make sure that you have some type of utility to download it.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,280
For those of you using Windows if you don't have a utility I think seven zip is a good web site to download

20
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,740
this program that allows you to unzip those files OK.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,180
You can download the two version of bit or 64 bit download it and you can read right click on your files

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,000
on Zais but you can also double click on them way of a Mac operating system.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,680
Now this is the two files that you're going to get.

24
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,140
You're going to get the CMOS the two folders the CMOS is going to have our application inside.

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,790
OK.

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,660
So we're going to have all those files and they're going to keep being updated as we keep growing our

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:11,230
application then we're going to have this Demel and inside them all you're going to have this practical

28
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,620
app OK.

29
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,060
Now this practical app you can open it up later on when I show you how to do that.

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,360
And you can open it up your installation in your program.

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,620
OK.

32
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,750
And if we go it if you already have installed ma'am OK.

33
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,880
You're going to be and that's not.

34
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,500
The Right here I'm using map in my case.

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,030
And of course you're going to drop of that practical map folder in the docs.

36
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:49,990
OK.

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,200
That way you can practice.

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,710
So now if you go to your browser depending on what program you're using if it's map like I'm doing right

39
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:07,830
now it's going to be this and use go to the practical and see the address of it.

40
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:17,280
Practical underscore practical app enter and that's going to basically give you the app.

41
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,760
And this is where we're going to be practicing our application as some of the sections OK.

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,320
This is just a little app that I created for you guys and that's pretty cool.

43
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,820
And then we also have enough folder.

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,770
Let's go back here.

45
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,210
We have the new lectures folder right here.

46
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,340
OK.

47
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,030
And in this lecture here folder you're going to have the references to some of the lectures that we

48
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,790
are creating in the course now.

49
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,990
Because I keep adding lectures to the course.

50
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,890
This might be out of sync.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,850
OK.

52
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,940
Meaning that this here might now be lectures sits by the time you're watching it.

53
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,820
Just make sure that you look at the name OK.

54
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,980
In this case we're learning about variables here so you go to the variables lecture or you know if you

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,270
want to go to this file and you want to look at it you can look at some of the things that we are doing

56
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,960
in that lecture.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,450
OK.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,010
This is just for reference.

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,050
Basically guys that's why I included them here and I put the number there because this is how it was.

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,140
But I keep adding things to it and they just keep changing.

61
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,490
So don't worry too much about it.

62
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,890
This is just for reference if you want to take a look at it while loops the for loop for each the math

63
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,690
functions.

64
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,200
Cookie's session and things like that.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,080
Then we have my askew L section here that's where I put this for the here to number 36 because I think

66
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:53,190
after 36 we jump into my ask as well and then you're going to have some files for the log in file create

67
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,720
of de files and then you can take a look at those references if you like.

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,430
Then we have all inclusive because we're doing some issues.

69
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,100
We're doing some something here and then we need an enclosed folder but this is just for reference.

70
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,290
Then you've got your practical app and then remember that you also have you see a mess.

71
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,790
So you can just drop your whole CMOS.

72
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,570
Now this is the CMOS project.

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,390
OK.

74
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,180
This is what we are going to be creating After you learn ph HP.

75
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,280
So I don't recommend you installing this right away out of the box.

76
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:31,020
I recommend you having this as a reference to your project that you will be creating in this course.

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,740
OK.

78
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,570
So you're going to have those two folders there.

79
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,740
Remember the CMOS which is going to have our project the demo which is going to have the lecture's references

80
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,340
that we are going to go and learn in this course.

81
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,310
Remember that they not we did not in sync and they may not be in sync.

82
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,930
So you look at the names ok if statements you want to have some information about if statements go there

83
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,890
switch statements variables if you need something to go by.

84
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,010
OK.

85
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,110
Anyway thank you.

86
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,360
Hopefully this helps you out and I'll see you in the next lecture guys.

87
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,060
Take care.
