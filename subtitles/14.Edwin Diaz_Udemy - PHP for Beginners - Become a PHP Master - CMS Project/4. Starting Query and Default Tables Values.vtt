00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.110
I will come back my student in this lecture here we are going to be creating a Querrey we are going

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.820
to be also inserting some values into the database on default values for rant sold parameters for our

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.020
crypt function.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.090
For those of you that don't know about the crypt function go back to the security section that I have

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.300
on the Ph.D. course and learn about it.

6
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.270
I have a lecture that will explain everything about the crypt function.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:36.140
Or you can go to PH BE THAT net and or you can search in google the crypt function BHB that net this

8
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.840
is that you are all right here.

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.370
All right.

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.810
And you can find out some more information.

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.930
I think this is the best option that we got is called crypto Blowfish.

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.210
I was searching online for other passwords or other functions to encrypt passwords I think Blowfish

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.800
is actually the best one for this course and the best secure one for for a while we need it for.

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.420
All right.

15
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.190
So come back here.

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.570
And very simple.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.560
Let me just give you.

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.620
This is the start of the page it would tell you that it needs two parameters a string and then of course

19
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.790
the password here would give you some more information about exactly what the correct function is.

20
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.260
Blowfish and here will give an example also on how to do that right.

21
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.250
Is the crypt Blowfish.

22
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.620
This is the password.

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.460
It has 22 parameters and cost parameter 22 characters.

24
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.960
And the cost parameter right here.

25
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.700
Now again I have a lecture on that so that's why I'm not explaining much about it right now because

26
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.630
that would be like maybe five 10 minutes to explain it.

27
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.840
So go back to work and then come back here if you don't know about it.

28
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.960
So anyway so the first thing that we are going to be doing in this lecture is going to the database

29
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.900
going to the table users.

30
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.990
And then here we are going to be sorting some of the full values into our table.

31
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.610
Let's go to a structure round solved.

32
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.100
If you remember these field probably you were wondering why in the world why do we need this field right

33
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.530
this column.

34
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.780
Well this is the moment where we are going to be using it.

35
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.820
So let's click on change.

36
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.780
Let's go to the default and as defined and here we are going to be inserting some values right.

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.560
So the first value is going to be a dollar assigned to Y dollars signed 10 and then dollars.

38
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.980
This is the cost parameter that's what is called.

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.690
And then we're going to put any 22 characters that we want.

40
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.840
I use something like this.

41
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:58.530
I use some crazy strings 22 and I know for a fact that is wordier have 22 characters because I count

42
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.280
them and you can go ahead and count it if you want.

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.060
So I use some crazy strings.

44
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.700
That's what I use roll here.

45
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.840
You can see right there.

46
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.100
I use some crazy strings 22 and then you're going to save it.

47
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.380
Now if you put too much characters or less character you will get an error.

48
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.710
So make sure that you put 22 characters there.

49
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.150
And the cost parameter.

50
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:26.370
All right so now that we've got this now let's go back here actually right here and let's start making

51
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.030
our query here because what we want to do is we want to take that value out of the database and use

52
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.270
it with a crypt function and the past with us coming from the form.

53
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.640
And then we king encrypt it.

54
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.380
All right.

55
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.340
Because we don't one uses to come here put a weak password and then would or wouldn't want the hackers

56
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.730
to come behind them and decipher the PP-ASEL real easy one encrypted you know making it secure.

57
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.330
Now that we have clean data going inside the database we also need to encrypt the password there.

58
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.830
So let's go ahead and do that.

59
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.560
So let's do a query real quick.

60
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.770
I think we got time for equerry right.

61
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:19.650
Select Rand sold is the column name they're from users at the table and then send the query query in.

62
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.050
And this call this select.

63
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.690
If I can spell it right that would be nice.

64
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.560
Brad salt.

65
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:41.340
Querrey this used in my you are like where we function connection and query we've done this many times.

66
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.960
And let's just make sure that it works.

67
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.260
All right.

68
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.160
I think I'm going to make this video really short.

69
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.210
And this is the last call that we are going to be writing in this lecture for for this video and then

70
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.940
and then that's when we're going to finish it up because I know you guys have things to do.

71
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.790
So let's check to see if the score is good if it's not good and we're just going to say we can say just

72
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.040
die.

73
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.250
Let's do the proper way.

74
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.600
That's not good or sloppy code of we fail.

75
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.160
And that's just typing error.

76
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.710
My secure line.

77
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.010
All right.

78
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.840
Let's just do it the right way.

79
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.740
Connection.

80
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.440
All right.

81
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.590
So let's go back here and see everything works fine.

82
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.990
Should give us an error.

83
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.350
All right.

84
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.590
Everything looks good.

85
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.430
OK.

86
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.970
All right.

87
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.570
So we don't we don't have an error we made the query here and we said some day some data into the database

88
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.460
table.

89
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.420
So the next lecture here we're going to complete this get some data out of the database out of the table

90
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.910
and show you how this works.

91
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.690
Thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you.

92
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.170
And that's one
