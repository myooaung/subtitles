1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:11,160
We are displaying some data from the comments page here and we took here some of the crud for now for

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,360
the acronym And you know create a read of day in the lead.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,490
So we are taking care the read part of it.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,520
All right.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,060
So what I want to do is if I go to the post right here we have a little forum here what I want to do

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,300
is add some fields like the older name maybe the email.

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,990
And when the user clicks on this form we want to submit this data to a database and then show it here

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,480
in the comments site right here perfect.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,220
Right.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,540
So let's go ahead and do that right now let's do this try to do it in this lecture and let's just copy

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,410
this.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:59,340
They've actually just copy the whole thing so that way we don't have a mistake Ray here and I'm going

13
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,950
to put a name put right here.

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:12,270
Tets and is going to have a name of author is author actually comment author G's come in Author.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,910
Perfect.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,540
Let's put another div around here and let's just say this one that would be the e-mail comment.

17
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:26,190
E-mail and this just change the type on the e-mail so we have some validation there.

18
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,810
Automatically let's add a class of that way looks pretty

19
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:43,770
and form control we make this look beautiful and it's going to make it all across this screen across

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,650
the bottom of the container which holds that comment section.

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,650
Sure you know what I mean.

22
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,060
You see that it's going to make all the way across.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,830
We can fix this later on right now.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,580
I kind of like it.

25
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,160
We've got to leave it like this for now.

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,090
All right.

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,890
So let's put a label on this thing here because right now there's no label and this is for author as

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,840
do another label for email

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,020
email and make sure that we've put this on here too.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,640
All right.

31
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,130
Perfect.

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,920
Right.

33
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,170
And let's do another level for

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,420
the tets area here and just say come here.

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
Maybe your comment is a great thing when you're building your own CIMS is that you can put whatever

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,530
you want right.

37
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,670
Comment.

38
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,920
There we go.

39
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,300
Firfir looking great.

40
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,370
Looking good.

41
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,510
All right.

42
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,220
This image here we're going to put a name actually of you.

43
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,320
We're going to get this ready for the post right.

44
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,260
Create comment.

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,800
We're going to call it underscore create on the score comment and that type is going to be a summit

46
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,820
that's fine.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,760
Let's go ahead and catch that data somewhere so that way we can test it.

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,190
All right.

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,050
Right here.

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,570
So let's open BHB attacked first.

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,620
Right.

52
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,390
Looking good.

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,500
Let's make this a little bigger so you can see just in case it's too small for you.

54
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,150
If set are right.

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,110
All right don't fall asleep on me.

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,460
All right.

57
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,590
Hopefully you're getting this.

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,560
This we have done this before so I think if you're following me you're doing great.

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,650
So create common is to not create update create comment.

60
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,980
Where are you thinking Geez I need more coffee.

61
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:04,110
If you're getting some coffee ready you a student please give me some and send it to me with our teleportation

62
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,960
software that we have in our computer.

63
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,360
I can smell it.

64
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,780
All right.

65
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,940
If I said let's echo something out while we want to echo let's echo the altar.

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,790
Why not.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
So let's echo it.

68
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,400
But first we need to put a name field here.

69
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,880
All right.

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,350
And did we put it.

71
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,180
No we didn't.

72
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,650
We just put the label.

73
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,180
All right.

74
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,140
Polls again there I go.

75
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,850
They are go.

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,810
So what is it again.

77
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,020
Comment.

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,230
ALTER I thought I did put it in there.

79
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,720
Unbelievable.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
All right.

81
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:53,040
You see what happens when you work a lot hours you and you ask yourself a question and then you answer

82
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,780
back yourself.

83
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,800
I just ask for my own question like I was talking to somebody else.

84
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,990
That's not good.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,860
We need to sleep a little more OK.

86
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,790
If you are working a lot hours make sure that you get some rest.

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
OK.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,010
All right so

89
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,050
just put a name fuel here.

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,260
All this content coming content.

91
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,390
All right.

92
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,070
Let's get to

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,380
Eckel

94
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:43,080
and let's just say Walter.

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,390
All right let's check it out.

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,080
Let's check it out.

97
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:52,070
Let's do this right.

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,430
I am the author.

99
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,100
Yes.

100
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,880
And I'm going to put an e-mail and he's going to give me some validation problem.

101
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,450
There you see that.

102
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,920
That type e-mail does this for us.

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,080
Beautiful.

104
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,240
He's going to put a example.

105
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,330
G-mail submit what.

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,140
Oh of course the bull's eye the bull's eye.

107
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,410
He can't have that.

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,840
Let didn't check that line.

109
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,970
Twenty nine what are we doing here.

110
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,220
And we didn't even check what are we checking here what what are we doing here.

111
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:36,180
We're checking the id o polls Id like 29 What are we checking.

112
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,870
Of course we are submitting somewhere else right.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,880
Whereases is this for submitting to.

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,140
Is this for submitting any.

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,890
Do we have a form.

116
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,340
Yes we do have a form but we don't have any action on it.

117
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,810
Let's put some action on it to do an action.

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,470
Let's put some method to how can we forget all this data.

119
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,840
I'm telling you I need my coffee.

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,990
All right.

121
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,110
Let's go ahead and do it again post.

122
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,140
All right let's cross our fingers guys and ladies too.

123
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,770
I know some ladies are taking this course and the male example G-mail.

124
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,880
There we go.

125
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,680
Submit Oh undefined create alter.

126
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,230
Are you kidding me.

127
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,460
Undefine

128
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,800
of course we're not creating an alter we are.

129
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,600
We have a comment there and you probably saw that you didn't even tell me.

130
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,220
All right.

131
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:43,560
After this lecture I'm taking and getting some coffee for sure and getting some comfort out of this.

132
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,640
Seriously.

133
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:50,310
But you know I like arrows anyway so I like to go and spectres and it's cool.

134
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,420
Submit and there we go.

135
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,790
We have some data coming in.

136
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,400
Perfect.

137
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,560
After like 100 tries we did it.

138
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,640
If you follow me and you didn't miss semi-state tons down on you because you are supposed to see the

139
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,650
day before I do it right.

140
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,660
My student.

141
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,720
One of the best students in the world.

142
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,680
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video here and on the next lecture we are going to be able

143
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,410
to insert some data.

144
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:15,920
All right.

145
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,720
So hopefully when we finish up on the next one.

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,230
Thank you.

147
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,820
And I'll see you in the next one.

Bye bye.
