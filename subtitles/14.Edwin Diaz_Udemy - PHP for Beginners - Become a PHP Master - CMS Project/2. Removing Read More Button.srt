00:00:00,600  -->  00:00:03,720
I Welcome back to another great lecture.

2

00:00:03,730  -->  00:00:08,730
All right now I want you to feel really grateful because you have the opportunity to be right here watching

3

00:00:08,730  -->  00:00:10,540
me teaching you this.

4

00:00:10,560  -->  00:00:13,600
Now a lot of people don't have the opportunity that they don't have computers.

5

00:00:13,620  -->  00:00:15,180
They don't even have their health.

6

00:00:15,240  -->  00:00:16,640
They can't even see.

7

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:18,600
So how in the world are they going to learn right.

8

00:00:18,600  -->  00:00:23,430
They can even hear and you can hear me and you can see right.

9

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:27,700
And you have a computer right in front of you so feel grateful right now in this lecture here.

10

00:00:27,810  -->  00:00:31,740
We're going to be removing something that's been for us give me a little bit and we're just waiting

11

00:00:31,740  -->  00:00:35,420
for this section of the course to remove it.

12

00:00:35,610  -->  00:00:37,740
And B is this button right here.

13

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:39,600
Now we are in the home page of course.

14

00:00:39,600  -->  00:00:43,160
We only got two polls here but we will have more later to show off.

15

00:00:43,170  -->  00:00:43,860
Right.

16

00:00:43,860  -->  00:00:51,030
So anyways if I click on the title to go through the content to the polls I see that born again and

17

00:00:51,030  -->  00:00:54,360
it shouldn't be here anymore because we don't want to read more everything that we want and we should

18

00:00:54,360  -->  00:00:55,450
be right here.

19

00:00:55,590  -->  00:00:57,510
We should have more content by the way.

20

00:00:57,630  -->  00:01:03,350
But anyway so let's go ahead and remove that let's go to two polls.

21

00:01:03,630  -->  00:01:04,990
Let's go to it first B.

22

00:01:05,040  -->  00:01:11,190
Make sure that you are in your CMOS folder and just and right there on the end that ph be in the same

23

00:01:11,190  -->  00:01:11,880
root directory.

24

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:13,460
Go to postop.

25

00:01:13,810  -->  00:01:14,350
All right.

26

00:01:14,550  -->  00:01:17,330
And then you're going to see this button right here.

27

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:21,420
It's got to be right below this while loop all the way down here.

28

00:01:21,450  -->  00:01:23,900
And just let's just remove it out of there.

29

00:01:23,940  -->  00:01:26,630
We don't need it anymore on this post.

30

00:01:26,640  -->  00:01:28,560
BHB.

31

00:01:28,590  -->  00:01:31,040
And let's just refresh that.

32

00:01:31,440  -->  00:01:33,770
And while Law is gone awry.

33

00:01:33,960  -->  00:01:36,500
So anyway I hope you're feeling grey like I'm feeling today.

34

00:01:36,510  -->  00:01:43,470
I woke up a little sad but then you know I started being grateful for it and look happy.

35

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:48,660
So get in the habit of waking up with motivation.

36

00:01:48,720  -->  00:01:49,080
All right.

37

00:01:49,110  -->  00:01:50,580
Right now you're doing some really good.

38

00:01:50,590  -->  00:01:53,490
A lot of people are not doing this so feel happy.

39

00:01:53,490  -->  00:01:53,910
All right.

40

00:01:53,910  -->  00:01:56,020
Feel very good about yourself.

41

00:01:56,190  -->  00:01:57,240
Anyway thank you so much.

42

00:01:57,250  -->  00:01:59,710
