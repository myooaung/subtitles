00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.500
Welcome back my students so before we create the page there's something I want to do.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.530
I want to come here and only show that page only show this if the e-mail was sent right.

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.200
So let's fix that real quick.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.320
So if the e-mail was sent instead of doing this echo here we are going to be setting some variable to

5
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.840
true.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.510
OK.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.890
We are going to be creating a variable.

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.140
Going to be called e-mails sent or something like that.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.090
And we got to said that's true.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.760
Simple as that.

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.230
So now we can create a statement here and we can show that

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.720
this little guy here.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.660
OK.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.100
So

15
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.020
we're going to show this if the e-mail was sent

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.530
and let's just come here real quick.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.130
Open up speed tags

18
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.250
and we're in a shorthand version.

19
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.500
I have one student that told me he didn't like shorthand.

20
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.140
He didn't like this format one time.

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.500
For some reason I love this for mice.

22
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.780
It's very easy to put a lot of the e-mail you don't have to put all the mail and break it where your

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.310
curly brackets or anything like that.

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.130
You can put everything inside.

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.940
Once you break it up like this I think this is a really cool way of actually using you statements.

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.160
But he didn't like it.

27
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.730
He was very upset.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.450
Maybe he's watching this right now but for some reason he didn't like it.

29
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.260
I like it.

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.990
I don't know what you think about the short versions of the statement.

31
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.970
So

32
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.000
let's And if I guess everybody has different opinions right.

33
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.270
OK.

34
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.800
So

35
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.200
let's go now that variable.

36
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.190
I'm thinking

37
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.470
All right let's just try it out and see what happens.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.770
All right.

39
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.580
That's not there.

40
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.330
Good.

41
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.730
OK.

42
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.040
So let's come back here.

43
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:53.390
Fogarty reset and OK it's working and of course we'll get this link.

44
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.790
Let's make sure that it goes to the right page.

45
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.020
So let's create that reset page.

46
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:08.650
It'll be file.

47
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.360
OK so let's think about what we want first of all this reset page.

48
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.580
I'm going to give you the code.

49
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.380
OK.

50
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.450
So don't worry about it is going to have a very simple code

51
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.430
and I'm just right now getting it for you guys.

52
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.520
Make sure you download it from either the beginning of the angel.

53
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:42.140
This section of the whole section or forgot features system or downloaded from this lecture is included.

54
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.940
OK so

55
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.590
let's see.

56
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.460
Let's just take this out real quick.

57
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.390
This is what we're going to be doing later.

58
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.680
OK

59
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.750
so code is not working correctly because this thing is

60
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.470
so that's the reset.

61
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.250
What else will we need.

62
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.060
We needed the registration we need this links for the Reset go back here.

63
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.520
And we might need the navigation

64
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.980
issue and

65
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.580
OK.

66
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.510
All right.

67
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.560
Let's try this out.

68
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.680
Whoops.

69
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.270
Michelle we have always said Peter.

70
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.920
OK we said that BHB Maybe I misspelled the name reset.

71
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.270
No I have not misspelled the name

72
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.180
o.

73
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.250
Why did it have three eights in there.

74
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.080
Anyway so as you can see we are able to get to this page OK.

75
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.860
So I don't know why I had three eights.

76
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.750
So let's let's see what we can do here.

77
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.410
Here we are going to be doing some verification on top.

78
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.770
Real quick and let's just do it right away instead of waiting for another lecture.

79
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:07.810
So we are going to check to see if we get any get requests.

80
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.470
I've got to build a function for this.

81
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.410
This is something that could be used all the time and we can build something better instead of using

82
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.660
all this messy logic.

83
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:31.560
So if we said get email and actually if I don't have that type and I don't have this on top I need both

84
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.720
parameters for this to pass.

85
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.310
OK.

86
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.750
I want to get also the

87
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:54.050
talking code to make this work so simple is that we are going to redirect where we're going to redirect

88
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.450
to.

89
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.480
And it's beautiful.

90
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.780
So now let's try to visit that page without any parameters on top.

91
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:07.630
And as you can see we have some type of error only like 7 0.

92
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.850
Got that

93
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.480
tried again.

94
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.920
As you can see if we get redirected.

95
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.960
But of course we don't want to do that now because we are going to be developing and testing to some

96
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.300
things.

97
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.120
So we're going to comment that out and we're going to continue in the next lecture.

98
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.930
See you guys.
