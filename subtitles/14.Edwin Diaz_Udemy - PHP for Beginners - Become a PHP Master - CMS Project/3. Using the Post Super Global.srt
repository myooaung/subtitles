00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,510
I will come back on this video.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,340
I'm going to show you how to extract data out of the super Global Post.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,210
Now we already went and did something very similar when we did the form but on this very I wanted to

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,530
show you an easier way to do it.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,080
Well not an easier way but a quick way of actually getting some data out of it.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,090
Now we got to go and create Let's go and do a blank that BHB.

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,340
And if I could find one to you.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,260
There we go and let's do a Save us here.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,630
Let's call this the post right.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,030
This call of the polls even though that has nothing to do.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,510
Well it does have the word post there but anyway so I'm just going to create a an input that just create

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:58,300
a form there and is going to submit to the same page the post we already did something very similar

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:58,780
to this.

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,210
I'm just kind of doing a recap here and showing you that you don't actually have to hide the whole form

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,390
in order for you to get some data out of it.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,790
All right.

17
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,490
And let's get this mad.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,660
Let's make sure that he's posed the data and I'm just going to do something very simple here.

19
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,410
All right and this is just so you can remember that you don't need

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,560
whoops

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,940
we have a whole bunch of make sure that this there is there.

22
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,650
So.

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,200
All right so let's have an input here.

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:45,920
I am going to call this as fine touch is fine and just as a matter of fact the world is going to be

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,860
named.

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,490
All right.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:57,110
And when I come here and let's do or BHB tags and you're going to do this very quickly because we already

28
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,780
did something very similar.

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:06,640
So basically what we're doing is just submitting this and getting the value all up here.

30
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,180
All right.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:18,630
So if we do this here the superpose the super variables will pro-global here get the name out of it.

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,140
All right.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,670
We can do this like this.

34
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,090
Let's just go ahead and see this in the browser here.

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,840
All right so we have this here.

36
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,350
Now we have an undefined name here because we're not getting any data from the form.

37
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,940
We need to make sure that we have we submit the form and we submit it with a submit button.

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,150
There we go.

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:58,100
So now this tests here actually we just go into this and submit it.

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,820
It was not found they requested.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,450
Oh you know what.

42
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,120
Of course is not found because this file here has Does it have the PH extension make sure that that

43
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,130
is actually working.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,740
Right.

45
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,190
So let's submit it again and see what happens.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,400
All right.

47
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,390
So we still have the same problem here.

48
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,670
Let's make sure that we put the BHB extension there.

49
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,980
And of course he's going to say this because we haven't submitted the form.

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,130
So this is why you have to write that is if set function there to make it so you don't get this error

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,640
here.

52
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:32,990
All right.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,790
And we did that in the forms so submit and now you see that you can get some data out of it.

54
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,350
All right.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,660
What if you don't do that if you don't click if you don't check if it's a med like we did in the form

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,790
of example then you get this type of warning there because right now what you're doing is you're saying

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,030
ekal this post.

58
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,540
And when you're saying ekal it doesn't find it it says what where is it.

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,350
Well it's right here what we're having.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,260
Click the submit button yet we haven't clicked that when we click it.

61
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,610
Then he goes in it goes ahead and pulls out information.

62
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,660
All right so this is a very quick way to get in the polls.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,960
Now hopefully this was you know help to kind of remember how to get data out of the polls and super

64
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,470
global here post and.

65
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,010
Well that's it that's about it.

66
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,260
That's a little bit a little recap here.

67
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,530
Hopefully you appreciate it and see you the next lesson.

68
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,460
Take care.
