00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.750
Hi welcome back to the student.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:06.000
So in this lecture what we're going to be doing is starting to build some helper functions that are

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.600
going to make our code that it'll be more nicer to read in our application more reusable code more usable.

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.130
So let's start with our redirect function here in functions right inside the admin folder.

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.520
So what I want to do here instead of redirecting here I'm going to be using this statement as it basically

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.810
we are exiting.

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.380
Whatever we are doing and we we are done with it.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.410
OK we're not going to return anything.

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.710
This is more.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.410
This is something a little bit more flexible a lot of people use this instead of the return OK.

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.760
And let me see what else do we do here.

12
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.300
We don't need to do anything else there let's just go ahead and create another function that we are

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880
going to need later on.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.360
So I'm just going to call this if it is method and of course we are going to be passing a method here

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.740
but let's just create a full parameter for it.

16
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.180
OK.

17
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.400
That way nothing coming here is No.

18
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.160
And it shows you know some best practices to do these depending on what you're using it for.

19
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.280
So I went and checked to see if this method here or this function is going to be something that's going

20
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.540
to check for 3:56 methods.

21
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.330
OK.

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.040
So our request met the like poles get.

23
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.930
So let's just say if let's just build this variable here.

24
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:49.160
And I believe his name is requests as you can see my ids already helping me feel some of this and we

25
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.580
don't know we don't want to have to typing this in uppercase all the time so I'm just going to use a

26
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.360
function SDR oper and which is going to uppercase everything that comes in our method basically.

27
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.420
OK.

28
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.250
And if we get that meant that there was going to return trousseaux there what that way we can use this

29
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.330
function in an if statement and we can say if this method is suppose we do that if it's not then we

30
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.780
return false.

31
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.170
So that's why we return false.

32
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.560
OK.

33
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.150
Just to make sure that we use that there result of this function in the IF statement in there or this

34
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.410
in the other side when we are calling the function.

35
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.280
OK let's create another method here.

36
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.790
I think it's good to have a is logged in method.

37
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:47.070
I mean function and basically we can do the same thing we did there we can use make sure that whatever's

38
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.000
coming is set actually.

39
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.480
And we've got to check on the session

40
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.940
analyst shoes check for their user role.

41
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.000
Now you can make this a little more flexible and make it so that when you pass a parameter in that way

42
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.790
you can always check whatever sesshin you won instead of making this in this way because this way we

43
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.640
only check it for use or Also every time we want to check something in the hope occasion.

44
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.350
We just change it here.

45
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.680
This is why I'm making this like this.

46
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.760
We just have to come to this function and change that user role here.

47
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.790
But if you want to make it so that way when you call the function you can use whatever you want then

48
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.410
pass a variable something there.

49
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.070
OK.

50
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.010
We're going to return true here.

51
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.120
And right below here we just just take this off.

52
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.140
We don't need it now.

53
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:55.050
Again you don't have to use that dashes and me using changing my ID a little bit just because I got

54
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.860
so used to PSP storm so let's go.

55
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.390
And if you could if you wanted you can come in this hour.

56
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.080
Is good that you come in your code.

57
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.780
OK.

58
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.010
Let's create another one.

59
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.570
See

60
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.120
let's create this one.

61
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.750
Let's just call it check if user this is going to do two things is going to check you the users logged

62
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.860
in and he's also going to redirect the user.

63
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.820
So check if user is logged in and redirect.

64
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.220
I know this is long but it's actually being very specific and that's good stuff in programming.

65
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.690
So we are going to accept some session here as a matter of fact.

66
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.170
You know what

67
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.300
we can use this function right here.

68
00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:02.450
In an if statement so we can say well if he's logged in then I want to do something and what I want

69
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.490
to do is redirect to software.

70
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.610
And as a matter of fact let's make this a little more flexible let's just pass the redirect location

71
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.430
here.

72
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.450
So we wrecked location just in case you want to use this function for something else.

73
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.300
You want to redirect it somewhere else.

74
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.380
So we just pass out there and that's it OK.

75
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.310
I think we're done with this helper functions.

76
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.510
OK.

77
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.740
You just check it out.

78
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.020
You know if anything is not working properly we will fix later on.

79
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.230
Thank you so much for watching.

80
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.570
I'll see you in the next video.
