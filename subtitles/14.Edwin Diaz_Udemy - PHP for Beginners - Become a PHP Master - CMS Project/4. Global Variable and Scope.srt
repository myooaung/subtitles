1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,690
High in this video we are going to be learning about global variables and scope.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,220
Right.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,730
And the scope when we say scope and BHB we have to scope's local scopes and global scope where we say

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,010
scope we mean the environment the context in which that specific element is available.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,820
So for example if we have a global variable that global variable is going to be available outside the

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,900
functions and inside the functions it's going to be a global variable.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,930
So if it's if it's available outside and inside the function we say that is available in a global scope

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,410
if it's available only inside a function we say that is only available inside is only available in a

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,370
local scope.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,110
So let's go ahead and find out how that works.

11
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,670
There's open on co-editors and let's do a save as on the black that BHP follow that we always use.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,540
Let's call this scope scope ph.

13
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,820
Let's close this let's open the browser.

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:04,760
All right.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,960
So let's create a variable called adds here.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,100
Let's first put a PH B tags.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,280
OK so first we create a variable called X and then we are going to set the value for this one is going

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
to say outside.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:34,340
Then we're going to create a function and we're going to call this function convert right.

20
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,500
Right.

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,630
And we are going to be using December 1 trying to change it inside its function to a value called Insight.

22
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,910
All right.

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,770
My thing is that I want to show you I want to echo these variable.

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Outside right now and then I want to call and actually call the function and try to change it with a

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,820
function and then call it here again.

26
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,090
So I wait to see if the function changes the value of it.

27
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,410
So we see that this variable here we are echoing the first ad that means this one here because it starts

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,600
from the top right.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,040
It's outside then we go inside the function we call the function right here.

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,850
And we try to change the variable to a different value but it doesn't change it.

31
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,300
So we do still get the outside again when we Agway down here.

32
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,990
OK.

33
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,630
Now remember this is the global scope right here outside.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,440
This is a local scope.

35
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:50,330
OK so now how can we make these variable here global.

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,190
Can we make it available outside any sort of function.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,840
So just in case I wanted to change the value of this variable later on INSIDE a function how can I make

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,240
it available because right now BHB is not even recognizing that this is where we try to change here.

39
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,240
It's not even taking the change.

40
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,350
Well the first thing that you need to do is actually right you use this keyword called Global and then

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,340
you put the variable here semi-colon.

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,190
So you declare this variable global throughout the whole script.

43
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,850
Now we can use a variable and change value over any way we want.

44
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,640
We can do whatever we want with this variable and watch what happens on the left side.

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:43,400
When I save my document here you see a change to inside now because now we are using the variable globally

46
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,030
this variable right here.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,620
We bring it inside a function.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,580
We change it and then we echo.

49
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,210
So first of all we echo the first one.

50
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,470
Right.

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,650
And then we go inside if we call the function right here and we go inside and change the value over

52
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,150
and then eggcorn here.

53
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,980
So if I go ahead and echo this again

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we see that we get another inside because the values already change.

55
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,740
But they I can go ahead and make another function here and change the value of it.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,550
All right.

57
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,550
So this is what we mean when a variable is global and this is what we mean when we say that is available

58
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:25,380
in a global scope meaning outside and inside.

59
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,320
All right.

60
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,640
So anyways I hope this actually gave you a the information you were looking for.

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,180
Hopefully you know you got this.

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,170
If you don't you can always ask me a question.

63
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,470
I'm always available for my students but this is what global variables and global and local schools

64
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,430
are right and local variables too.

65
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,350
So if this is in the local scope of course this is going to be a local variable.

66
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,800
Right.

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,360
But anyway thank you so much for watching this video and I see you the next one.

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,160
Take care.
