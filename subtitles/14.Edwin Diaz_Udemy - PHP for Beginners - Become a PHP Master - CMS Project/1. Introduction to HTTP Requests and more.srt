1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:06,210
High by now you should have the fundamentals of Ph.D. You should know how to use loops arrays variables

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,800
functions and many other things.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,190
Now we need to get into serious business.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,030
BHP was meant to be used for the web.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:21,600
For that reason we need to be able to collect information from users to do different things with it.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,080
Now HP has a couple ways of doing that.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,140
We have forums that users can come and go to a form with their name or subject line or message submit

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,190
the form and then we use BHP to process that right.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,950
So that's one way of getting information we're going to learn about that in the following lectures.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,820
There's another way called the euro or links Well they're not called you are links but we can get information

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,670
via you are able or right in your browser.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,040
So for example if they use clicks on the link we send some information via that you are able to the

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,470
server.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,030
And then we process that information.

15
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,000
Well I'm going to show you how to use that in a minute.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,300
We are also we also getting information via cookies.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,600
You have cookies in your browsers and those cookies get transfer into the server.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,290
And then we can do all the things with it.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,130
When you get the server right.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,960
So we can we can use that information that you guess you sent from your browser to the server to Apache

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,210
and we can do all the things with it right.

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,110
So I'm going to show you about about cookies in later lectures also.

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,140
Another way of getting information from users or using sex sessions and sessions work very close with

24
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,420
cookies as a matter of fact they work with cookies right then as a separate entity from cookies.

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,680
They work with cookies without cookies we can have sessions sessions or allow us to have a larger amount

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,720
of data than cookies cookies only limited to certain a couple of thousand characters.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,660
SESSIONS only limited to the hard drive that you have on your server so we can get more data in sessions

28
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,350
and use it relating to users.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,430
But anyway this section is going to be awesome.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,630
You I love it.

31
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,760
We've got to get into very serious business here so pay very close attention.

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,950
And again congratulation for making it this far.

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,640
You're awesome.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,410
Take care.
