00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.810
So hopefully you had a lot of fun while we were doing this lectures here we got maybe one or two lectures

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.560
to go.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.370
We done.

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.810
By the way with the pagination system the only thing that we're missing here would be probably the audience

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.930
to see assess to it right based on whatever pitch we are.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.490
So if we are on page one we apply we'll see assess whether we're we are in Page 3 or 4 and 5.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.430
So basically you know what you need to find out what current page you are on and if you are incurring

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.590
page 5 you want a place we'll see assess to that awesome styles right.

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.450
So that would be one feature that would be very nice.

11
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.340
I would do that and some other lectures.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.320
Hopefully the lectures right after this one.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.710
If not remind me.

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.760
But that's some other lectures that are going to create after this.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.930
But anyway so I just kind of recap a little bit of what we did.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.860
Right so we started by finding the count of how many records we got in pools right.

17
00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:02.960
And we find out that we have 42 so that counts 42 and we divided that count five we gave was like I

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.350
believe it was eight point four and we use the ceiling all the seal function to run that up to nine.

19
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.080
All right so we gave us nine pages basically Or you could see the nine pages right here.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.410
All right.

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.740
So now with that we've got that set all right we came down here and we create its own links and here

22
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.380
we are looping right we're assigning these I'd like this is like this is quite an initialiser.

23
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.130
So we are playing there I basically attaching it to this column right here.

24
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.860
So it's going right after a count right.

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:46.520
So in every place right count is actually in every record that it finds right it is actually planning

26
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.530
the number applying the number one to it because that's what the initializer is.

27
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.250
The initializers starting one that's we're starting in one.

28
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.720
All right.

29
00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.040
So it's getting attached to this count here which is nine right now.

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.640
All right.

31
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.140
We are displaying for each of that in for each of that spot in that array we are displaying the number.

32
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.530
That's basically what we're doing with looping with this splendid number.

33
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.160
Hopefully you understand that.

34
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.560
So here we are also sending a get request in the same page.

35
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.410
That's right called Page and we are assigning it the number.

36
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.290
All right.

37
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.610
Right here.

38
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.350
So when we click on it we're going to send up each request to you or else right here.

39
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.900
All right.

40
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.210
Now of course if we click on three that's going to sign that three of course there.

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.800
And what we're doing is we're catching I get requests on top and we are doing some processing.

42
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.650
That's all we're doing here.

43
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.550
All right.

44
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.490
We're catching it.

45
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.350
Assigning it to a variable.

46
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.360
And if we find it if we don't find that we are assigning it to an empty string that way we don't get

47
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.340
no errors.

48
00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:00.900
And if we find out that the page is empty or is equal to 1 then we are assigning page one to zero.

49
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.390
All right and this page one comes right here in the limit.

50
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.910
All right so if we don't have anything you know Eurail right here.

51
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.840
All right.

52
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.060
We'll still get that five.

53
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.840
So this is going to be equal to 5 right now.

54
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.300
All right.

55
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.620
Beautiful.

56
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.350
So we are also going.

57
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.660
And for some reason we now page one then we are on page two or three and then we are multiplying.

58
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.900
For example we are on page two we're multiplying that times 5 which equals to 10 minus 5 we get was

59
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.370
5.

60
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.900
All right.

61
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.280
So he's going to he was five on every page.

62
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.480
Now here what we can do is we can actually if you're wondering how we can have this set up from the

63
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.440
Admin Page.

64
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.090
Right.

65
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.990
How can we.

66
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.820
Well we can set up a function that displays a value or something we could say.

67
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.580
We can set up a per page variable and then we can set it to 5.

68
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.450
Let's set it to two so you can notice the difference.

69
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.430
And I'm going to replace that per page here by five by this one.

70
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.380
And by this one by this one and by this one.

71
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.880
All right.

72
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.270
And now you probably are a little confused on what I did but come here answer.

73
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.310
Whoops.

74
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.690
We need to define that.

75
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.960
That is on page 58 and that is because

76
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.100
each page would probably misspelled something

77
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.410
something

78
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.020
we made a mistake so we're there.

79
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.740
Make sure that we are getting this guy right here per page.

80
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.380
All right.

81
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.460
Else page right here improve page there.

82
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.660
Select everything from polls.

83
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.860
That's weird.

84
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.980
Let's go back here and find out why this is doing this undefined variable.

85
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.750
All right so what we can do is we can have with the full value for for that per page.

86
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.370
All right.

87
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.130
And just in case we have it right here let's just say five come here and it's right there.

88
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.880
All right.

89
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.770
So as a matter of fact let's actually have it outside right there.

90
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.080
Even if it doesn't get said we have a set for five.

91
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.910
There we go.

92
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:48.170
All right.

93
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.360
Now let's set it to two right here.

94
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.700
Safe answer.

95
00:05:53.850 --> 00:06:00.420
Now you can see that we only get to 1 and 2 and look at all the pages that we get down here.

96
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.150
Beautiful right.

97
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.730
All right so you can set something in the admin area.

98
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.800
We'll do that in the next lecture's or something like that so that way you can manage how many pools

99
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.510
you can show on your index and you can manage your navigation or something here.

100
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.140
Right.

101
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.840
So anyway thank you so much for watching these lectures and I'll see you in the next one.

102
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.470
Take care.
