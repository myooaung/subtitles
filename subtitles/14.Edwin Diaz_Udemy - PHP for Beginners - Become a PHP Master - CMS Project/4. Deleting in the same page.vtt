00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.660
Welcome back my students.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.600
So in this lecture I'm going to show you how to delete these comments and stay on the same page.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.470
If you already haven't figured it out.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.950
All right some of you already figured this out.

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.310
Some of you are having a little issues here and there.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.030
So let me show you how this works.

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.520
All right.

8
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.720
So we are in post comments here like the post ID and what we want to do is when we click on the lead

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.230
we want to stay on the same page but now I know some of you probably were right and I'm not saying all

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
of you came to the polls on the score comments here and say you know what.

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.770
All I got to do.

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.570
All right.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.560
It's on the the live link.

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:48.390
Say for comments for example right when you came here and you said All right let me just do this.

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.580
Leite alaw we go to comments now right.

16
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600
It takes us to comments that BHB right.

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.500
But we got to comment.

18
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.390
We got one comment then that was fine.

19
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.610
We got redirected and actually we got the comment deleted but we got redirected to comments that BHB

20
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.880
and then some of you were in here and say you know what.

21
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.690
All right so basically what it is is days redirect me to delete.

22
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.550
I'm just going to go and redirect to post comments.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.150
All right.

24
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.480
So you did that and now you came here.

25
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.690
You said delete and now you want to post underscore commerce APHC and you've got this era right here

26
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.900
and says undefine in that idea right.

27
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.090
Well they they.

28
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.280
Here is what is that when you get it redirect it is looking for.

29
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.920
I get requests and they cannot find it.

30
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.190
Right so.

31
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.830
So how do we fix this.

32
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.760
I mean you know it's it's a problem right.

33
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.380
Well sorry about that.

34
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.530
Just moving scream from one side to the other.

35
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.200
Give me one second.

36
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.550
This is the right way.

37
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.280
Sorry about that guys.

38
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.600
All right.

39
00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.840
So you I don't know some of you you know trying our stock here and I just want to help you out just

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.770
because I got your back on this.

41
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.340
All right.

42
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.250
So let's go ahead and let's go to this link right here.

43
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.300
All right.

44
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.310
So we delete the comment right.

45
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.930
Very simple right here that's fine.

46
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.290
Now when we get redirected we lose.

47
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:31.220
They get requests right here so they issue here would be to what we think we should do here.

48
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.750
We should get they get requests.

49
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.340
We should send a request here and that's it.

50
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.590
All right so let's concatenate this right here.

51
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.660
There we go.

52
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.980
And all we got to do is say get ID.

53
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.550
And that's a good request for the 4th I.D..

54
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.350
All right.

55
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.340
So some of you did this and let's go back and see if we got any more comments.

56
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.450
We don't have any more comments.

57
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270
We're going to have to make another comment here.

58
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.550
Let's go back here.

59
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.790
Let's just say win and support.

60
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.110
School of code comment.

61
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.580
I don't know this coming to you already but then we go to come and click on it and then we go and say

62
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:23.910
delete and now some of you got this error and you say why in the world just happened.

63
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760
All right and now you're stuck there.

64
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.680
But now you're back again.

65
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.630
So the problem here is that when you click on this delete.

66
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.320
All right.

67
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.710
You need it you also need to send because you're coming back to this page right.

68
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.900
You also need to send again requests.

69
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.960
Think about it.

70
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.010
We are looking for the good records to show the comments and we can't find it.

71
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.320
And this is on line 139 here so go to your line 1:39 you see what happens here.

72
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.480
Show you right now you see that we're looking here.

73
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.320
We're commonplace ID equals that get requests and we can't find it so we can we we find this area right

74
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.570
here with this function because we can Querrey it but then we don't get anything here.

75
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.360
All right.

76
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.330
So the trick is to fix that.

77
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.350
So let's go to that lead right here.

78
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.470
And what we're going to do is when I send a second parameter so we do ampersand and then we say ID equals

79
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.520
and then we break it out right here with a concatenation.

80
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.590
So we say that we go just to them within the bottom would say get ID.

81
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.200
All right.

82
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.520
So I'll come back here and I don't think we have any more comments because they've all been deleted.

83
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.730
Let's try one more time and let's see if this works.

84
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.370
When for comment I wish this had thorough complete but it doesn't feel right here.

85
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.050
Coming to go back to Paul's comments click on it and voila.

86
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.600
We are on the same page and we got redirected to the same page.

87
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.340
Now your next job would be and I would do this on my side.

88
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.410
I'm not going to show you how to do this because I already did it all day.

89
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.230
All this links right here to reflect our new functionality.

90
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.250
Make sure that you always you also all day your other board right here.

91
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.110
We are a new functionality.

92
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.610
All right.

93
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.910
So I leave that to you and not want to show you that in the next lecture because you should do this

94
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.680
yourself.

95
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.340
You should know this already because we just did it.

96
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.540
So thank you so much.

97
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.240
And I see you in the next lectures
