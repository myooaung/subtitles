00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,810
Hi welcome back on this video here we are going to be looking at another type of loop called the for

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,140
loop.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,730
This is a very popular loop since everything is in one line.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,280
All right.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,040
So I'm going to explain it a little bit more about loops on this video.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,150
And I'm going to give you a bit of a better picture.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,990
So if for some reason you did not understand the last video you got to understand this one.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,290
I can guarantee you that.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,820
All right if you do have any problems you can contact me anytime.

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,700
So let's go ahead and open our co-editor

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,510
and let's do a Save As like we always do on that blank that BHB

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,790
Let's call this for loop

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:52,730
safe then we are going to create some PSP tags here.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,750
Right.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,530
Bring it down.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,360
Now I'm going to be a little more specific about loops on this on here because I want you to understand

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,610
that I just gave you a little brief introduction about loops and the truth is that while loops and for

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,980
loops do the same thing they don't do anything different.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,220
Right.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,540
They just we just write them differently.

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,090
Now there are times when you want to use a while loop instead of a for loop but that is just preference.

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,450
Right.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,950
You can do the same thing with both.

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,140
Now why haven't both.

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,010
Well the for loop is actually a lot easier to write.

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,770
And I'll show you right now the syntax so we know with a while we need to we need it to create a initialiser

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,450
on top and that is called the end it's right the initialiser.

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:48,330
So with a for loop is very simple we create a with a key word called for parentheses just like all the

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,170
loops.

30
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,830
And the statement very very similar.

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,510
So but the problem the problem the way we write the for loop is very simple.

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,390
We create the very well inside the loop.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,370
All right so we instead of outside like the while we create a variable right here.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:18,630
So we say for example counter equals to zero semi-colon because what we say is we we finished this command

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,930
go to the next command.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,010
All right if you have any.

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,790
If we don't keep going.

38
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,590
So we have the initial Lizer here the end of the loop.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
All right.

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,030
The next thing we had on the wall what was it.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,140
Do you remember because this was up here before in the wild.

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,290
Now is here.

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,570
And then after that we had that little parentheses right.

44
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,630
So what we do is we test the condition here.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:55,470
So we say wow Cantor were right the very way in is less than whatever condition they could be less than

46
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:05,550
or equal that the raise inside of an array or whatever or if it's equal then any any rolls on your database

47
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,950
or tables or whatever.

48
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,930
I mean it doesn't have to be a number.

49
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,330
Right now the next step.

50
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,120
So we have three parts here we have the index where we start the loop always we start to look somewhere.

51
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,410
Then we tested for condition right the middle and then at the end we increment.

52
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,190
Are the three steps that we need to make in every loop.

53
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,300
So we grab the counter with.

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,090
We use the shorthand version there and we increment it right.

55
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,030
Very simple.

56
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,710
Now here we do the same thing.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,790
Now I'm just going to actually echo out the counter you see how easy this is all in one line.

58
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,040
A lot better down right in the while loop right.

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,400
Let's go ahead and see how this looks on the browser.

60
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,050
Perfect.

61
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,380
See the same thing as a while loop.

62
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,210
Now what I want to create is I'm going to concatenate this here.

63
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,020
We're putting a dot here that means I'm going to smash something together with this variable right.

64
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:17,120
What I want to do is I want to smash it with a B or tie action and that smash.

65
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,940
I want to create a B or tag to separate Every time I Lugo's around and print this out.

66
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,380
So the first time we went around print 0 0 0 0 then it created a B tag re medially after created 0 right

67
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,250
here.

68
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,670
And we do expect Telemann to be cards should be there.

69
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,450
See that.

70
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,610
So he created a B or B or right tag immediately.

71
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,060
This is a and then the amount Aggrey and then he went around again and print out two and then created

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,580
another attack.

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,150
That's all he's doing right.

74
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,980
See how this starts from the top and programming you a lot of people use this.

75
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,520
You know Mrs. concept the computers would never do anything unless we tell it to.

76
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,040
We need to tell the computer exactly what we want done in order for that specific function to happen

77
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,640
exactly like that if we miss a semi-colon or we do some kind of mistake.

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,790
The program would not work.

79
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,660
It will now allow us to work to do.

80
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,570
We now allow the program.

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,570
One mistake will destroy the whole function.

82
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,170
Right.

83
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:35,400
So if we don't control this the right way our would not work what I'm trying to tell you here is that

84
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,160
everything depends on you when you're writing a program.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,230
It doesn't matter what type of language you are using what programming language you're using.

86
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,670
As long as you know what you're doing.

87
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,630
My goal here with this course is to teach you the fundamentals of BHB and show you a couple of tricks

88
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,800
that I learned along the way.

89
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,460
So that way you can be better prepare.

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,710
But anyways that's a different topic.

91
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,000
Hopefully on this video here you're able to learn something valuable.

92
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,450
And so let's go ahead and let me show you.

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,270
I think I'm going to have to show you the last the last hoop that I want to show you.

94
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,940
So you can be prepared with loops before we go into the practice application on the next video.

95
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,300
All right.

96
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,520
So take care and I'll see you in the next one.
