1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,080
All right welcome back my student in this lecture here we're going to be improving our registration

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,280
system a lot more right now.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,420
The way we have a is this way if somebody registers right now with the same name as a user we already

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,070
have in the database they will be inserted in the database.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,210
So for example right now we have a user name Rekos Swaby Insan or whatever.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,030
So let's actually create another recall use user real quick.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,530
And so that you know that this works.

8
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,700
Oh sure you actually let's just make a record.

9
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,470
There we go.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,950
Register now says the registration has been submitted.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,740
All right.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,480
Does it say that it was good but he says it was submitted as you can see here we are able to put to

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,050
have the same user name in the database which that's something that we don't want.

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:09,570
Now we could however create a column here that has only only a ceps a unique ID or only sets a unique

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,490
value we could do that but we could actually write is it right this thing or BHB code so let's try it

16
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,870
in write using our BHP code and see how we can build the functionality that we allow was to check for

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,950
duplicates.

18
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,940
All right so now we have this function here is admen That's pretty cool.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,090
Really cool but this function is going to be a lot quicker than the admin.

20
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:32,540
All right.

21
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,560
So let's actually start doing this.

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:44,170
So we're just going to name it user name exists and of course it's going to take a user name.

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,120
All right.

24
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,840
And let's just create the full value for actually we don't need the full value for it.

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,000
And let's use

26
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,730
this one sure should shouldn't have the full value either.

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,240
Let's just put it like this.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,340
I wanted you just to show you that we could do that but that's fine.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,000
All right.

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,000
So how can we start this.

31
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:15,370
First of all we need our database connection right.

32
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,580
Then we need to create a query.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,160
So let's hold our query in this very well.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,290
We usually do.

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:33,990
And let's just say I want to select the user name from users where our user name is very similar to

36
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,220
this.

37
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,280
As a matter of fact we can copy this if we want to use to make it easier on us.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,580
There we go.

39
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:49,710
And instead of doing all this well we can do is we could instead of doing this that we're doing here

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,460
we're going to do something a little bit different.

41
00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,480
We're going to say I want to check I want this function my ask your line Gnome rose to let me know how

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,330
many rolls of this if we are we are able to find something like this dysfunction.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,410
He would give us the rose in our table.

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,990
How many rolls he found.

45
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,390
So we're going to pass in the resoled and if the roll in the database is bigger than zero we know we

46
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,210
found something right.

47
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,240
So we're just going to say return TRUE

48
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,660
else we know that we didn't find anything.

49
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,900
And I mean we've got to return false.

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,880
Let's just put the in force here.

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,010
There we go.

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,390
All right cool.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,440
So now this function is done.

54
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:53,220
Actually we need to change this for user name so like user name from users.

55
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,040
All right.

56
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,310
This seems about right.

57
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,770
All right.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,800
So it's time for us for us to test this before we go ahead and do this.

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:17,440
Right now we have this functionality in registration that BHB Let's take this idea here and we have

60
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,350
basically we just have this little check here.

61
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,960
But we're not really doing anything big here.

62
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,010
All right.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
Let's see if we can

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,140
let's do it up here.

65
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,010
We're using a message so we're going to use this message very well to display something I just want

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,260
to do like this just to show you that it is working or that it should work.

67
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:55,590
So I'm just going to see if we're going to use the name of that function user exists and we're going

68
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:06,360
to pass in the user name then we want to display something or we want to set a message and then I send

69
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,670
this message to this user.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,250
It's all right

71
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,260
let's try this real quick.

72
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,520
I say Rico and trying to register here.

73
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,360
It just feels can be empty.

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,720
All right.

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:48,790
That's because we have order.

76
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,120
They will have to pass for this to say to say that message.

77
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,560
All right.

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,100
That's fine.

79
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,640
So I'm going to say Rico whatever here and whatever register

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,990
this contain this should not contain a symbol.

81
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,120
Yes.

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,400
User exists as you can see here.

83
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,280
You see that.

84
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,350
So it was able to find the user.

85
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:36,050
Now if we tried another user for example our own W W W and W W W would G.M. I would try this user.

86
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,330
Well first of all has our own defined message because we took that out.

87
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,820
But I want to show you that I do that it does work refresh.

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,970
And as you can see here we were able to register the user because it's not a duplicate.

89
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,480
All right.

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,880
So in the next lecture we're going to finish this up and we're going to actually we're going to fix

91
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,940
this up a little bit a lot more.

92
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,720
And we're going to make it work with all the inputs here.

93
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,440
We're going to build a pretty nice registration system.

94
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,200
We want.

95
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,500
We want to also check for email just to see the e-mail exists so we're also going to do that.

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,990
And that's lecture's All right guys.

97
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:22,560
So this should give you a pretty good idea how to do the next one for the e-mail.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,580
All right so if you want to go ahead and do that for the e-mail you're welcome to do that.

99
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
We're going to do that in the next lecture anyways.

100
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,150
All right.

101
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,710
We're going to finish some of the modifications see and registration that BHB.

102
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,490
And we're also going to create a new function for e-mail.

103
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,240
All right.

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,430
See you in the next lecture.
