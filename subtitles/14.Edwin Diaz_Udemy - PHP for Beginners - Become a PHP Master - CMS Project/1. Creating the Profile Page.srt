1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:07,920
All right so I mean that dashboard look then there's Rico and you can go out and logging whatever uses

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,790
you got here.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,330
All right.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,320
Now what I want to do in this lecture is add a profile page to this specific user that is logged in

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,070
the ready.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,620
All right.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,320
So later on we're going to personalize this a little better.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,080
And you know being able to reuse some of these cold and other pages.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,600
But right now it is going heading added profile page.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,370
Before we go on I just want to say congratulations if you are here you are very different from a lot

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,090
of people.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,590
And I don't know if I said this before but a lot of people give up the first couple hours the first

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,950
one or two hours when people even give up the first 15 minutes because they think it's too hard.

14
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,480
But you have stuck to it.

15
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,640
You have rewind those videos a million times until you got it and you are here.

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,100
You are special.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,800
Keep going.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,390
You're going to get very far in web development or any other career path you set foot or hands into.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,250
All right.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,950
So let's go ahead and make his profile page and let's so we can add some more functionality to our CMOS.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,700
Perfect.

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,560
So what we want to do is we want to go ahead and click on users so we're going to do a Save As and users

23
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,950
says users already have these users that BHP page already has it that the header has a navigation all

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,570
that we need.

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,090
All right.

26
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,770
And the profile page only thing that we will be able to do is edit the user.

27
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,270
That's the only thing we will be able to do and his profile up each page.

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,520
And you know we don't have it yet but it's going to be very similar to the As a matter of fact we're

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,910
going to be using that same form right here.

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,960
But our CMOS is going to detect that is us is this person that is logged in and is going to be pulling

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,190
that information for this specific user into that profile that BHP so that way we can edit our own profile.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,990
Right.

33
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,370
So.

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,470
Or if we in the future we have any other users they can log in to their own profile instead of they

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,830
won't be able to see this page here.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,120
Right.

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,920
They will be able only to see their profile page because if it's a subscriber we don't want to give

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,190
them access to adding users right.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,120
So they won't be able to probably see this page.

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,020
But.

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,210
So let's go ahead and add the profile page and I already added that link.

42
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm going to show you what I did.

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,420
Go to admin and insane clues go to admin on the score navigation.

44
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:33,200
This is inside the admin folder and go to all the way down to where you see this link right here.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,500
Profile and add profile up to that link and this is just that link right here.

46
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,280
All right.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,210
That's all I did to make sure that you do that at that.

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,290
And now we're going to add the page.

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,940
So we want to do is because users already have all of that functionality uses that BHB uses it inside.

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,430
Adam the admin folder.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,050
We're going to do Aceves here and we are going to be calling this profile that BHB.

52
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,130
All right.

53
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,220
We're going to take a couple of things out of here since we don't need it we're going to take this statement

54
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,610
this statement out of here and let's just check it out.

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,250
This Cliggott And now we see these pages black.

56
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,170
All right so we created this page.

57
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,760
Now what next.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Well we have two ways of actually getting information here.

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:33,450
Either we put a get request on the link on the admin navigation right here.

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,940
We don't have any queries.

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,900
Also we will have to make a query pull out the user's ID and then pull out fill that request right here

62
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,930
that parameter on the link itself so that we can pick it up on the profile that BHB.

63
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,680
But we also have another option the other option is actually using sessions and we already have sessions

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,380
set up already in the admin header.

65
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,890
If you go to the admin header you're going to see that sessions already started and we are ready said

66
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:11,130
sending sessions from log in that BHB in their old directory in the same folder we were already setting

67
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,160
sessions right here so we got these sessions all over our site in the Admin site so we can you know

68
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,810
pull that information out.

69
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,910
We can do a query and compare it and pull information out of that.

70
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,060
So let's go in the usal sessions right there right.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:35,550
So let's go to profile BHB and I'm right on top actually before the wrapper if we want to check for

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,670
that session.

73
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:46,790
So let's say if it's set and actually this puts on BHB in there it would be nice if with all that's

74
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,470
the ending let's do the beginning BHB tagging here and right there.

75
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,770
So if it's set and we check in for session I'm just closes our little bit so you can see what I'm doing

76
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,150
better.

77
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,710
Perfect.

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,600
Hopefully that's clear for you session.

79
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,110
And what do we want to check for user name right.

80
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,110
And so each session has the value of user name.

81
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,010
I want you to echo it out right.

82
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to check it out.

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,570
I want to see if it works.

84
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,420
I want to see if if this session is actually exists.

85
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,730
If it does exist.

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,950
So we're going to echo that echo that.

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,270
So I'm going to grab this because right now we won't be able to see it.

88
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:38,400
If I come to this page and refresh you can see that something happened here but we don't see it because

89
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,960
I'm black around it.

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:46,420
So I take this whole thing there and we're going to put it somewhere that we can see.

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,050
So let's just put it right here on the right there.

92
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,220
See that.

93
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,370
So we are echoing that section.

94
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,370
So we have the session now and we can do all the things with it.

95
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,080
So let's just do on do here and have it on top here.

96
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,460
So now that we know that session works we need to start doing some inquiry right.

97
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:13,470
Well before we do that let's actually get the form out here because we need a form and I already said

98
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,470
that we're going to be using a form like this if I if you that if I did not say they I'm saying it right

99
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,190
now we're going to be using a form just like this one here.

100
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,190
So this is edit user right as a user that BHB.

101
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:37,980
So let's go ahead and get that form edit user All right which is his admin includes Let's add.

102
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,020
Get the whole form.

103
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,110
So let me make this smaller so that way I could see the form whatever I'm getting out of there.

104
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,940
So I'm just going to copy the whole form and pasted it in that profile that BGB.

105
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:01,190
Of course we're going to get some errors now because this form and I got to make sure hold on here I'm

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,580
going to make this big so you can see what I'm doing.

107
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,420
I got to make sure that this whole thing is a ball.

108
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,790
Everything.

109
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,940
All right.

110
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,410
There we go.

111
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,960
That is that makes sense and that makes sense.

112
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,490
And this is just that let's just add it right here let's see what happens.

113
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:31,080
Now let's go back and refresh now here refresh profile and then you can see the form right here.

114
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:37,470
But one of the things that you can see that is form before we you know we would do anything just know

115
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,700
that we seeing these arrows and the way the reason why is because we have we don't have these variables

116
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,330
anywhere.

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,750
We don't have these values.

118
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,110
So in the next lecture we gonna fix this we're going to make where we are going to get those those values

119
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,530
in there so that we can pool information for this specific user.

120
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,460
All right so on the next lecture we're going to be doing the Querrey.

121
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,080
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
