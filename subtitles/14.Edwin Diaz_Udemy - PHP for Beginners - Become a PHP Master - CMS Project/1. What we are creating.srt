Hey Guys welcome to this new section.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,880
This new section I'm going to show you how to create a really cool like functionality for post pages.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,590
All right.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,050
So now I'm going to go.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,010
I'm going to show you.

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,000
So I mean the front page right here I got the first folds.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,960
OK I'm going to click into it and if I go down a little bit after the content we can see that he says

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,460
that he has two likes.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,590
Awesome right.

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,310
So I'm going to go to the front page again I'm going home and going to visit the second post.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,790
And he says he has three likes.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,470
OK.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,880
So he says also that we need to log in so let's go ahead and log in to be able to like this polls and

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,870
let's do it.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,400
Let's go to the home page let's go to the first one here.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,900
And he says that he has two likes.

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,370
So he says if I pull my mouse over it is going to tell me that I like this before so that's a really

18
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,150
cool functionality there.

19
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,580
But he also gives me this thumbs up by in here that I can click to like it.

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:09,130
So now when I click on like you can see now that we have the like word here OK change I mean the only

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,390
two to like.

22
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,600
And how one likes.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,500
OK.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,060
Really cool stuff.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,790
So let's go to the second one.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,610
And on the second pause here you can see that he has three likes.

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,180
He looks like this user like this before so he says I like did this before I click on like and now we

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,010
have two likes.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,080
So let's go to the front again and we can see now that this one has one like and the other one has two

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,830
likes.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:41,220
Awesomes is keeping track of the user likes not only this but it keeps track of all the users.

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,880
So if this post gets like that thousand times he will reflect right here and he will also detect that

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,510
this specific user is logged in like tipples really awesome.

34
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,470
Now it looks very simple but I'm going to show you how to.

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,560
I'm going to make it simple for you but it's not that simple.

36
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,880
OK.

37
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,950
But once you know it of course it's going to be a breeze for you to do this in any of your projects.

38
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,400
So if you guys are up for it let's learn how to do this.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,800
And let's have some fun.
