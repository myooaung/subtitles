1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,170
I don't know about you but I'm having a lot of fun teaching you this stuff.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,740
All right.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,650
So hopefully you are really awake.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,160
If not get a cup of coffee.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,420
Pause this video right now get a cup of coffee or Red Bull or some type of energy drink.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,860
Make sure he's healthy though and get ready for this course.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,990
Get ready for the lectures.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,000
Right this is awesome.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,910
We're learning some stuff that's going to make us money that is going to advance us in your personal

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,500
life because once you have money you can actually do a lot better in your personal life too.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,430
You know you can fix problems with money you know get a new car get your girlfriend some give or even

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:40,550
your boyfriend or husband wife whatever it is you need money.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,950
Right.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,270
So anyways I don't want to sound too greedy but I'm what I'm telling you is that this is going to help

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,830
you.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,250
So we added some really cool functionalities in that last lecture when we updated everything by using

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,100
this.

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,580
Right now we need to add the rest of the functionality is right.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,970
We need to add the draft and delete.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,280
So this is going to be very similar if you haven't done so already.

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,970
I'm going to show you how to do it right now.

22
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,570
All right so let's go ahead and do this.

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,450
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and paste.

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,290
That's right.

25
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,650
I've got a copy and paste this case right here and right there.

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:29,880
And I'm just going to rename this to draft and post that is here too.

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,220
And this draft

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,810
and this draft

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,140
that said that should that should take care of it.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,950
Believe it or not that's all we need.

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,520
Can you believe that could really be that easy.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,110
Yes it can.

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,470
So we're going to just make both of them draft look at that boom and that was fast wasn't it.

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,160
Now the next one is a little bit different.

35
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,730
All right because we're going to be using a different Querrey but nevertheless it's going to be simple

36
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,650
enough again.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,150
So I'm going to do a copy and paste again.

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:13,820
Best right there the case is going to be the lead.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,730
Right.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,340
And here we're going to be actually doing a live statement delete

41
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:35,070
all from polls and we're post ID because the polls value right here.

42
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,530
That's it.

43
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,050
That's all we do we know what we need for that update to elite status.

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,580
And we're just going to go for it here of the to the leaps.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,750
Status right there.

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,900
And that's that's all we need.

47
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,140
I mean it sounds really simple to me.

48
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,410
Well is actually is right just a different statement as to a statement.

49
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's go ahead and do that.

50
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,300
And I think we did this pretty quick.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,600
And let's just click here and click delete and apply.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,300
And we've got a query.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,060
All right we got something wrong right.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,930
I knew it wasn't that easy right.

55
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,550
Well we have a little problem right here because we had to delete all.

56
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,540
Actually we can delete all from polls where polls Id close the check value.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,180
All right.

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,740
What else would you say the lead from.

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,350
How about that.

60
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,300
Is that going to help us out.

61
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,810
And all right let's go ahead and check it out.

62
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,910
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo boom the lead apply.

63
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,240
Gone.

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,650
Look at that.

65
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,820
Gone.

66
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,950
Beautiful.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,290
So now we are the only bad thing about these guys and ladies is that we need to add more pools.

68
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,210
That's right.

69
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,020
We only got one pulse here and this is actually a hassle to be adding all this stuff here.

70
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,540
Right.

71
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,480
But anyway we are done with this section here.

72
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:13,710
If you want you can go ahead if you know so she says you can work on the padding for that and just say

73
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,880
padding I think is padding left or something like that but padding is zero.

74
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,540
And you can see that it helps that out so you can target this as a matter of fact.

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,100
I'm just going to add what I did was inspect element by the way we can target this I.D. right here and

76
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,000
I copy it.

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,090
And that's what I did with my keyboard Comanche and I'm going to go and do a real quick with you guys.

78
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,790
All right.

79
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,180
So because we already have that if they all we have to do with a little padding there.

80
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,050
All right.

81
00:04:49,050 --> 00:05:00,330
So let's go to adamancy assess and we have some styles here for we don't have some styles do we have

82
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:10,290
to have some styles Bushrod men as be adamancy SS or let's just use this one as be as mean as he says

83
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,050
his goal or the way in the bottom.

84
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,550
And let's add this here.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,600
It's going to be a ball container.

86
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,970
There we go and let's just say paddings zero.

87
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,930
Let's see if that helps save.

88
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,350
Now we are going to have to target.

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,620
All right.

90
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,250
I helped that out look at that beautiful.

91
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,930
Now this is aligned properly.

92
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,820
Any look is looking really good.

93
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,530
So you can go ahead and rewind the video if it went too fast for you.

94
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,030
All I did was just find out what was affecting this by right clicking specked element on it.

95
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,990
And this is a tool for Chrome.

96
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:58,590
And I checked on that class or ID that I had contained and I just targeted using C Ss.

97
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,220
All right.

98
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,880
Perfect.

99
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,090
So hopefully you learn a lot on this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

100
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,750
Take care.

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,830
It was fun.

102
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,520
Bye bye.
