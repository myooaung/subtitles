1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,390
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:09,660
So the last lecture I told you that we need to build this page right to catch in all the requests that

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,480
we send then from any of these folks for example if we click on this we can see that we're going to

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,530
go to a page that says comment that BHP and we send in the common ID there.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,320
All right.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,310
Now think about it.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,430
I want you to think about this on that page.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,170
We need to receive these requests.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,850
So what is it that we want to actually know process.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,620
Right.

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,040
Basically we want to do a query to pool all the comments related to this post.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,570
All right.

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,240
So let's go to View or comments page right here somewhere.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,200
Includes.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,220
All right.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,900
So here we need to make a copy of this right because this is where we have all those comments.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,000
Actually yes this is a page that has all this pretty nice comments that you can do a lot of things with

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,200
it.

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,330
Let me just come back here.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,610
So if we click and comment is going to take us to the view or comments page we're going to have this.

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,480
But here we got it we want something like this that is going to have all the resources for that specific

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,890
post.

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,610
All right.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:30,690
So let's go ahead and create a Save As some of your comments and we can call this pose those comments

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,130
those comment comments plus underscore comments.

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,910
Safe.

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,900
All right.

28
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,060
So on this page here.

29
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,490
All right you can see that it's only selecting all the comments here but we don't want to do that.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,070
All right.

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,890
Well we wanted to select a comment from a specific post.

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,420
All right.

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,800
So instead of sending this common ID here.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,950
All right.

35
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,860
Instead of sending this well we need to send is the post ID.

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,830
Think about it like this.

37
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,480
We want to detect the polls.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,120
Right.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,210
And then display all the comments related to that post.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:20,580
So will say select all comments where the common pulse ID equals the false ID that was sent here.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,470
So instead of saying common pools common ID here we already have to come at the polls ID here.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:38,670
So we'll just send that all right instead let's just go with that here.

43
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,770
All right look at that.

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,600
Perfect.

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:53,250
So if we go to post comments we're going to say select all comments where right comment

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:03,260
false ID equals and we'll do the concatenation here because we've got escaped value.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,830
That said scaping now.

48
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,350
So that way we don't get on my ask you Elaine.

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:15,590
May I ask you injections real Scape is string.

50
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,870
There we go.

51
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,390
And we'll say get ready.

52
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,590
There we go like that.

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,710
All right.

54
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,110
Beautiful.

55
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,260
So now we got to figure out.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,780
All right.

57
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,490
Where are we sending this speech.

58
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,360
Think about it like this.

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,390
Now we click on this.

60
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,130
We don't we can go to comment to this comment page anymore.

61
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,590
So what we need to do is this save us here needs to go.

62
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,360
This post comments page needs to go to our to this page right here all right to this directory.

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,190
So let's go ahead and move it.

64
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,380
All right let's go.

65
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,640
Here I'm going to go to see a mass and this is insane colludes I believe.

66
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,810
No Aardman.

67
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,290
And then includes.

68
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,210
All right.

69
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,990
So we need to go to where she can find it right here.

70
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,330
So let's grab those comments right here and put it here.

71
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,210
Now let's go back to our editor right.

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,770
All right.

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,460
So you see the page right here right.

74
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,280
Beautiful.

75
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,610
Let's see if it works now.

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,280
Right.

77
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,010
First we need to go to the polls and make sure that we change that to say polls underscore comments.

78
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,350
Write or post comment.

79
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,550
We're probably going to change the S because it makes more sense without this so safe click on it.

80
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:00,380
And now she says I'm just getting a big arrow here so I'm just saying it's just saying that I ask you

81
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,740
a nice gave string is all right that's because we forgot the connection.

82
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
All right undefined connection 1 0 8.

83
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,810
All right we get a lot of things that we need to take care of.

84
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,950
That's just because these polls comments come in page dozing half just

85
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,040
make sure that we get the right one.

86
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,060
All right we don't have anything here like we do in these pages like the head or any of those things

87
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:35,430
so we need to make sure that we have all those things in there in place.

88
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,850
All right so let's do that.

89
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:44,280
Let's go to comments and here.

90
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,580
All right we need to have all this information.

91
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,700
Copy this to post comments all the way to the bottom

92
00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:07,140
it and then we need the head or write comments again and let's get all this stuff here and paste it

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,780
here.

94
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,880
All right.

95
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,900
And this you say welcome to comments.

96
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,570
Something like that.

97
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,080
All right so let's put it like this.

98
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,580
All right we just need a little little fixing up.

99
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,250
Nothing to worry about guys.

100
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,920
No right answer.

101
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,170
All right so now we got to Fitz's this connection in line 1:36.

102
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,920
All right.

103
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,090
So let's go.

104
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,870
And to Paul's comments line 1:36.

105
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,470
And once we go to Will I want thirty six right.

106
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,460
We need to pass in that connection right here.

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,500
There we go.

108
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,190
Come back enter.

109
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,780
And now you could see that specific comment for aspecific post.

110
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,350
So let's go back here and let's try this out.

111
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,350
Look at this one here.

112
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,910
Let's click on this one and look at that.

113
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,000
Isn't that beautiful right.

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,210
That's the comma for this and just kind of delete lead it.

115
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,110
And it's going to take me when I delete it it's just going to take me to comments.

116
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,490
All right.

117
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,730
Just to show me that he has another comment in there.

118
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:23,850
So if you want to just you know edit that on that page on view of Paul's comments you can it's up to

119
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,390
you.

120
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,900
All right.

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,610
The lead is right here.

122
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,490
All right.

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
So it's up to you if you want to you know when you delete a message should take it to that same page

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,640
on that.

125
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,090
Actually in the next election we'll count.

126
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,450
We'll do that.

127
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,890
All right we'll I'll show you how I do it.

128
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,080
So you see now we have zero comments here.

129
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,370
Let's go ahead and go to this pose for Edwin Diaz.

130
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,770
Let's make a comment real quick.

131
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,900
Let's just say India is the best.

132
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,390
All right.

133
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,100
Let's just do that.

134
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,660
And poor.

135
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:03,360
And this is just a test coming.

136
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,750
I to two men you pose.

137
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,170
We can see the comment right here when you click on it we see the comments for that specific post.

138
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,670
All right.

139
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,520
We can go ahead and create another comet for that specific post.

140
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,040
And there's going to be yours Mary.

141
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,290
Email Mary G.M. and jibberish stuff.

142
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,170
Go back your polls.

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,560
You can see one click on.

144
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,440
And now we have two comments for that specific post.

145
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,110
All right.

146
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,930
Beautiful.

147
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,840
So anyway thank you so much for allowing me to teach you this.

148
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,120
Hopefully you learned something really cool today and I'll see you in the next lectures.
