00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.120
All right so the time has come for us to be putting some information about the specific user you're

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.270
going to be learning a new technique.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.720
Well it's something that we're going to modify a little bit but you've seen this technique or something

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.520
similar before using sessions and using queries and all that but right now we're going to be using the

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.680
sessions to compare the values and diving into the Querrey.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.150
This is going to be a really good lecture get happy get a cup of coffee or something and is try to do

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.800
this right now.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.330
Right.

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.060
Let's actually do it not try.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.840
We're going to do it.

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.870
So I want you to be in your profile that BHB page and we already have the form there we're going to

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.130
go all the way on top where we make this set check right here right.

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.040
And we check it for user name right.

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.140
So we find the user name we find this session available that we did before we did find the right.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.070
Let's convert it let's make it a variable.

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.950
Let's assign this information to a variable.

17
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.300
So right now we are then we recall we are signing the recall value into this variable right here why

18
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.090
we want to do that is because we need to jump in to the query to do a query right.

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.000
So let's do a query real quick here before time runs out and we make these very like 20 minutes select.

20
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.500
All right.

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:24.570
The actress and we're going to say from where do best practices by doing all capitol users from users

22
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.010
right.

23
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.300
Where what they do a where statement there say where user name right without column or that right.

24
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.490
It causes value here.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.610
Let's make sure we put single cause here because this is going to be a string.

26
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.000
Now I want you to guess why we're going to be putting here.

27
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.650
You should know that by now because you are my student and you are super good at what you do.

28
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.380
Now you've got it all right.

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560
I knew you'd do it.

30
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.140
Perfect.

31
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.620
Nice job.

32
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.560
If you didn't get it don't worry.

33
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.780
Just keep practicing rewinding the videos.

34
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.310
All right.

35
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.370
So now that we have this now that we're making the square we need to send it in right.

36
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:17.810
So select user profile and this is just a really long verbal my Esky you lie.

37
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.840
Right.

38
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.370
Kohary is a function that's going to send that.

39
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.830
And then we're going to say connection.

40
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.430
All right.

41
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.460
And the query.

42
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.370
Perfect.

43
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.030
So now that we got this right we're sending that and we get this result right here with this function.

44
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.020
What are we going to do.

45
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240
We need to go and look to those values.

46
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:48.170
So let's create a while loop that would be nice for a little while loop here to do our job repeated

47
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.410
stuff over and over again.

48
00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:00.700
All right so we can assign a function that is going to look through all those values called fetcher.

49
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.570
Always have a problem with his name here.

50
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.870
But this time I was able to do it the DCH stuff I don't know if you guys related to that can relate.

51
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.740
So now let's go ahead and

52
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.620
do that right.

53
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.280
So we're going to look through that and we're going to be pulling out some values.

54
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.960
So what are the values that we're going to be pulling out.

55
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.600
Well we have those values somewhere else right.

56
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.310
Let's go ahead and check out if we can see if we can find its value somewhere else instead of copying

57
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.630
all this right.

58
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.020
Let's go to our users your users and see if we can find some of these values there.

59
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:54.840
Look at that beautiful let's copy all this into your users and go back to profile that's pasted in there.

60
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.520
And I think we're good with them here.

61
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.200
Well we don't have the image yet.

62
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.970
That would probably be in the extra features.

63
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.950
Brian now we know we don't care about that right now.

64
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.960
Well we're putting all these values out.

65
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.330
Perfect.

66
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.790
Now our form has all these values there.

67
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.670
All right

68
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.500
we got this forum right here as a matter of fact.

69
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.080
Right.

70
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.280
All right let's check it out.

71
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300
Hold on.

72
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.030
Nice.

73
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.970
Look at that.

74
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.260
We're finally pulling out all those values from there.

75
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.700
We're pulling out the use of the first name last name even if it's a subscriber or admen recall the

76
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.390
user name email and even the password you remember the password.

77
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.050
One two three.

78
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.750
So you see this little three dots right there.

79
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.530
That's what it is.

80
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.900
That's what it is.

81
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.690
Now we're going to change this link here I'm going to say update profile.

82
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.550
Right.

83
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.090
So let's go all the way down to the form.

84
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:11.910
And this shows right here say of the profile user of the user or the profile profile is fine.

85
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.950
I'm very indecisive sometimes on what I want to do accomplish right.

86
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.080
All right.

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.950
So perfect.

88
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.600
All right.

89
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.520
Now remember that we need to actually also do another function here.

90
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.860
Other piece of code is to update the user.

91
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.370
Right now we are just displaying information depending on the user.

92
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.880
So if we go to users in let me just Center this right here.

93
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.330
If we go to all users we've got another user called Reekie.

94
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.800
Let's log in as Reekie into our CMS and let's see if we can pull out that information.

95
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.870
Let's see what Rickie's password is Rick.

96
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.630
One two three.

97
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:49.010
All right.

98
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.940
Simple enough.

99
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.820
Let's go and log out.

100
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.770
All right we can log in again remember that.

101
00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.110
So let's say Rijk or Reekie rake.

102
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.740
And then the password is shreik something Rick 1 2 3 enter.

103
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.080
We are seeing that we being personalized right here and that admin cool right.

104
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.620
Let's go to our profile in our profile has die specific data from the user.

105
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.840
We have the first name Reekie and we can go to our P-H be mad men we can see that first name is Ricky

106
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.330
Ricardo and we have all of their users information.

107
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.270
We can see that a user is an admin.

108
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:36.480
So if I go here to view all users and I change this to subscriber Oh that's going to actually lugger's

109
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.050
out and I know it's not a subscriber of the user.

110
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.230
Right.

111
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.710
Dan we've got to profile and we can see that this subscriber is right there.

112
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.360
Now the value is there.

113
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.790
So let's let's go back to a again and let's change them to admen right that we continue right there

114
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.750
and let's go back to profiling you can see that that's selected already as admin perfect.

115
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:07.190
So we got that working on the next lecture here we're gonna to see how we can update this.

116
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.790
And that's it.

117
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.130
All right.

118
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.620
Perfect.

119
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:10.380
Thank you so much.

120
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.920
Good job.

121
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.010
If you were able to do it congratulate yourself.

122
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.830
Apply yourself.

123
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.010
Get a little while later a little beer or whatever that you like.

124
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.710
Take care.

125
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.010
I see you in the next lecture.

126
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.460
Good job
