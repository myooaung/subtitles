1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,550
A guy so I had to take a little break because I was so hungry I don't know if you heard me in a couple

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,360
years ago that you know I could I just couldn't do it anymore I had to do something.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,530
So anyway I found my little booboo and snide really a booboo.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,010
It's something that we forgot to update.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:26,180
So if we go to the post of BHB we can see here that we have this static ID here that we are using.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:36,310
So we need to get the ID of the post the user id here of the looking user right.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,590
So we already have a function.

8
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,130
So we need ID of the logged in user here to make this work.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,790
Thats why I left this for last because you know we didnt have that.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,950
I mean we did have a really good function to play around with.

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,660
So I'm just going to say user

12
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,510
she was what he was for that

13
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,070
low end user ID.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,890
That's why we created a function.

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,940
We go and the function is returning.

16
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,220
The idea is make sure that it is returning that well that's what he's supposed to do.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,350
We tested that.

18
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,340
So that should be the idea that should do it that should do the trick guys.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:31,390
Let's going into our database from all this stuff let's delete it ah I just deleted the user's

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,720
teleportation.

21
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,050
There we go.

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,020
We just teleported back to the past and fixed it.

23
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,690
All right.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,350
I'm joking I just I just pause the video and creating new new users.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,170
OK.

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,980
So one thing I forgot to do here was to simply make sure that this is admin.

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,610
We're going to need this later.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,750
OK.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,490
With some really cool functionality that I got coming for you guys.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,350
So we do need to with the likes.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,240
I'm pretty sure we do need to do that.

32
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,230
Let's go browse here before we make a mistake in the tables.

33
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,640
And yes and we need to update appose.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,780
Click and zero enter.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,700
There we go.

36
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,470
So now we go to pose the first one says that we have some type of error here.

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,060
OK.

38
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,500
Page source.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,830
Let's go back down.

40
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,560
It says quote If you have an error in your syntax server syntax.

41
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,020
Post the dirty nine.

42
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,260
Yeah that's another one that we are hard coding.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,470
For some reason.

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:56,750
OK maybe you're not but I am and this is in your in my Lets look for a number here.

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,840
You probably don't have that s probably Sunday.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,380
I'm testing in the in my functions file

47
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,630
this is the link pool right.

48
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,680
That is because in my logged in

49
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,930
I don't think I am logged in.

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,360
That's a good thing to because if I'm not logged in yeah that's right.

51
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,080
That's something that we have to fix now.

52
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,630
It's not showing if we are now logged in.

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,820
So that's good that we that we encounter the error here.

54
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,340
But as you can see it it will work.

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm going to do like OK when I log into I'm going to use Safari this time and I'm going to log in as

56
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,200
Maria because I'm going to dance Edwyn down actually am logging Asmara small.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,300
And you can see that we have one like here.

58
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,790
I like it and you can see now that it says on like OK now of course.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:18,530
Now if we go to add one we can see that changes to and if I go on like it from the editing site has

60
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,540
one in from memory Esai has one but she's still liking it.

61
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,410
OK so that's working.

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,290
Not that I want to face real quick here before I forget.

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,030
Is this style.

64
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,590
We also need to do whatever we did here to their own like OK

65
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:47,360
just to make sure that when we all like it that class also has the same size so refresh and you can

66
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,290
see that that goes back to that.

67
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,900
OK so another thing here that we need to address is.

68
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:04,740
If it's not load then we need to make sure that they don't see that but in OK.

69
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:14,770
So I think we have a function for that don't we loading user is loved and OK look at this function can

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,820
we use it let's try it out.

71
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:25,800
And let's go back to pose so we don't and we don't want to use it to log in.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,020
We want to see this but we don't want the user to see that like if they're not logged in.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,140
So let's open some ph VTX right here.

74
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,760
And let's close it right here.

75
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,260
Actually we were

76
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,380
let's come back here and write this stuff down and then we play around with it.

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,560
OK we could write up here and but let's just do it right here.

78
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,260
So they say if it's logged in then I want to be able to see something right.

79
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,070
So when I close I hear and I'm going to open it right here

80
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,880
and we want to see this link here.

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,620
These H1 is not part H.

82
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,990
R. is not part of that.

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,350
Let's put it right here.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,600
And then we just say els

85
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,570
we can show them another button to copy this and whoops

86
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,900
and instead of having this

87
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:01,990
long

88
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,850
you need to know again to like.

89
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:20,210
And here we can have a buy in with the Logan writing the log in page for mistaking

90
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:33,540
go and log in and we can just move this link and replace it with his right in between.

91
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,540
OK so that would be good.

92
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,370
That works right.

93
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,410
Meaning we're a lot of BHB we don't know if it works.

94
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,230
Let's look out with Maria and let's go inside one of these polls and you can see that he says you need

95
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:01,590
to log in to like click it and it gives us this Marion

96
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,520
right perfect saw.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,400
You know you can make this bigger too and you know it's a matter of fact let's do that let's just make

98
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
it a little bigger right.

99
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,710
Let's add some type of class to this here to this whole paragraph.

100
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,450
OK.

101
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:39,730
Let's make it likes just like the and that is INSIGHT.

102
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,780
A We have all of the classes here.

103
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,160
But it's inside paragraph anyway I don't want to go too deep if I don't have to.

104
00:08:51,290 --> 00:09:01,100
Declaring a class and they just make everything seem as if we can actually you know like who is here

105
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,920
and he likes there.

106
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,020
I think we can kill like three words in one shot.

107
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,620
Let's see if I.

108
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,370
There we go.

109
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,550
Perfect.

110
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,280
OK.

111
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,340
So that's looking awesome.

112
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,930
And we have some really cool functionality if we're not logged in.

113
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,000
OK.

114
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,060
We should create a that as well.

115
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,540
There you need to log in.

116
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,040
Suppose we should

117
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,880
create a class here.

118
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:57,620
Or log in to post.

119
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:05,840
I think we can even take this further and you know they are all in the same class to do something else

120
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,340
with it.

121
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,770
And the same element B in the paragraph element that we go guys.

122
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,360
This was I think a really awesome section here if you have not given me those five stars.

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,580
Go ahead and do it now.

124
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,160
That motivates me to create more lectures.

125
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,140
Hopefully you know I was able to show you some really good cool stuff in this section.

126
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,000
And that's my goal with this course.

127
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:38,430
And you're welcome to send me a private message if you need extra help or as into discussions and I'll

128
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,300
try my best.

129
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,260
To have me or somebody else help you out.

130
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,820
See you in the next lectures guys.

131
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,470
Take care and thank you for everything you guys are the best.
