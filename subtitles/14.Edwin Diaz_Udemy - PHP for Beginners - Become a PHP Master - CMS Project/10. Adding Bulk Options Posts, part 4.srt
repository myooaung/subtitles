1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,470
All right.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,250
So welcome back on the last lecture here.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:13,200
We are catching this information this data from here right from the select.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,110
Now we're going to do something with it remember this name actually with its value here is coming from

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,620
the values in each of the options.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,260
So each of these options have to have some type of value for us to catch you.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,860
Right.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,330
If not we're going to be catching this is going to be empty right here.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,700
So we need to provide a value.

10
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,310
So the first one is if it's nothing there was going to be the default for this action was going to be

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,860
there.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,950
Well I don't want nothing to be that the fault.

13
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,030
To be honest with you.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,350
All right.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,820
So we've got to leave that empty for publish.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,460
We're going to just say publish is going to be that is the value that we go draft.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,650
Of course draft without a capital D and the elite is going to be deadly.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,580
Right.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,420
So just to test this real quick we can echo this hour right here.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,400
And let's go back to it.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,720
Let's check it out.

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,400
If I click here and click apply.

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,660
All I got to click one of the options publish apply.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,900
You can see that it is saying that and if I click draft you can see that is changing.

25
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,340
All right so we are receiving those values.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,630
Perfect.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,950
So now that we got this we need to do another major thing here.

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,370
Right.

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,790
And basically it's a condition the best way to do this actually is because we only have one variable

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,030
that we've got to check.

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,070
Remember this bulk option changes every time that loops around you see every time we select that looks

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,100
around so every time we select one of these if I select publish it we have this value right here and

33
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,090
this value is being carried by book options.

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,770
All right.

35
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,450
So if I select this one on the Select right here draft it will have this value.

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,640
But remember we are receiving it with the bulk option so we can use this in a switch statement because

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,790
switch statement only they only take one condition right.

38
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,830
We are we only comparing one condition against multiple cases.

39
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,270
So the switch they may I think is a perfect candidate for why we want to do.

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,580
All right so what we want to do inside is for each loop we want to create a switch statement.

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,440
So let's to switch

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,730
here statement let's do this real quick and what we want to check is this bulk options.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,660
So we want to say this for options is has a case that is equal to something.

44
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,380
Remember the case keyword publish in this case

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,090
published.

46
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,670
Right.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,690
A does right now then we put the call in there.

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,070
We want to do something with it.

49
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,340
This put the break there so we don't forget the break key word breaks.

50
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,720
So if it finds this it doesn't continue doing anything else remember that.

51
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,990
Well we want to do is actually do a Querrey because if it's select a publish we want to be able to update

52
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,760
that post right.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,330
So if you want to do an update query here go ahead and do that.

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,890
All right.

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,650
Pozieres video into it and try to see if you can do it yourself.

56
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,310
So we got to all day posts.

57
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,120
Right.

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,990
And we're going to set what the pool status.

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:45,040
That's what we're setting right now equals to what I'm going to give you a chance so you can do it yourself.

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,060
You ready.

61
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,450
Baalke options right we already have them here.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,350
When I use it.

63
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,210
All right.

64
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,080
So and we need to make sure that it is related to that specific idea.

65
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,270
So we're going to put where post ID

66
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:15,280
equals what we are going to give another option what what is it.

67
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,440
Check of value.

68
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,250
Remember that.

69
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,540
Right.

70
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,350
And of course we don't need.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,380
Remember this is always carrying the ID already.

72
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,660
All right.

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,470
And we can name it differently if you want.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,290
We can name it check but false ID value if you want.

75
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,050
Just so it doesn't confuse you.

76
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,800
Remember that's what is bottes.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,540
That's what we're sending in this box and we are sending it right here right here on this.

78
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,050
Here you see the post ID right here.

79
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:55,620
That's why we're sending in disarray every time we click on this select every time we click on it and

80
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,380
we submit the form we are sending that ID there on that Ira.

81
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,040
So if you want to name it like that that is fine.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,740
That's as a matter of fact let's do that.

83
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,200
All right so let's say polls.

84
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,430
Let's check these polls I.D. polls.

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,750
Value I.D..

86
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
All right.

87
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,820
So that way

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,220
right.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,060
So I think it's better like this.

90
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,280
Right.

91
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,050
All right old value ID.

92
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,860
Or you can say post ID if you want.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,310
It's up to you.

94
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,150
I just wanted to name it differently there.

95
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:43,090
All right so once we have that then we need to send a query in.

96
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,700
Right.

97
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,970
And just organizing my query and my query a little bit there making sure that everything is fine.

98
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,480
Book options where.

99
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,280
All right.

100
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,870
So it's looking good.

101
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,230
Let's just make it bigger so you can see it again below here.

102
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,130
I'm going to send the query update publish

103
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,380
the Post publish status of day to publish

104
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,240
status.

105
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,930
All right.

106
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,300
And my ask you lie.

107
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,900
We're got to do the same thing to the rest of them.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,760
So if you want to go ahead in and start doing that you can basically we are going to be making cases

109
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:42,840
comparing it to publish draft delete and do end queries depending on what is needed connection and then

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,240
Kohary.

111
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,460
All right so let's go ahead and try this out.

112
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,320
I think we're ready to go.

113
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,090
Let's just put a dollar sign there.

114
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:00,210
I mean in mind is a little bit of data published status and then break.

115
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:00,860
All right.

116
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,570
So let's go ahead and check this out.

117
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,590
Let's make one of these draft.

118
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,240
I should I think we could have done it from there.

119
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,450
Whoops.

120
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,590
Right.

121
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,780
We can do it from there.

122
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,980
Let's just make a draft of the post and it more post.

123
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,870
Let's click here and less click on draft.

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,200
Actually we don't have the draft we only have publish it.

125
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,200
We can make it public.

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,620
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,900
Right there publish apply and it's not doing anything right.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,810
Publish apply.

129
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:48,930
We need to make sure that we have this spelled correctly.

130
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,240
We want to make mistakes.

131
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,160
So and then we want to also make sure that the square is being submitted because what if the square

132
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,160
is failing right now we don't know that it is failing.

133
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,900
We don't have any mistake right here.

134
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,760
So we want to use that confirmed Querrey function.

135
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,120
All right.

136
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Just to make sure that we are not missing this query up.

137
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,370
All right.

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,740
All right let's check it out.

139
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,420
We might have a Kohary mistake somewhere publish apply.

140
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:31,090
You see that you have an arrow in your syntax neir line this one that wasn't too much help was it.

141
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:35,580
All right so we're at least we know we have a problem right here somewhere.

142
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,730
So let's check it out.

143
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,050
Buzz value.

144
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,400
All right.

145
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,070
So we have all day polls.

146
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,470
We have that good here then full status.

147
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,640
This is right then bulk options.

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,020
And this is correct.

149
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:03,150
Actually there were posts ID and that looks good to me equals

150
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,500
right here.

151
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,350
We need a dollar sign right there.

152
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,970
All right.

153
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,820
Perfect.

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,130
That's what we're messing up.

155
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,620
See that.

156
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,740
That's why he's always good to put that function there that we made of the custom function.

157
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,230
So let's try right now and let's click on publish apply.

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,470
As you can see is working.

159
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,650
Apply yourself.

160
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,220
You were able to do it with me.

161
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,740
Great job.

I think we are doing something really nice right so we can also let's do this real quick and let's make

163
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,140
this draft we make a draft.

164
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:44,930
OK.

165
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:56,130
At it more post made this one draft to at least try both of them at the same time write and publish.

166
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,230
Boone look at that.

167
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,850
Beautiful.

168
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,490
All right.

169
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,460
So next we're going to be adding some more functionality some more queries and then I think at the end

170
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,450
we're going to add the functionality that some javascript's here so you can select everything at the

171
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,610
same time.

172
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,300
Anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture was a pleasure like always and I see you on the next

173
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,540
one.

174
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,450
Take care.
