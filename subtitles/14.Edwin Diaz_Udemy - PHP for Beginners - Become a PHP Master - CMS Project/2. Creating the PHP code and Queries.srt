1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,180
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,900
So I want you to go to your admin in the HP file right.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,390
This is what we're going to be actually writing this and we can write this here and wrap it up and put

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,890
it in a function right and which I suggest you do that so that you can keep this clean.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,700
All right.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,270
So the first thing is we're going to open up the tags.

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,640
All right we're going to create a variable and then we're going to catch a session here like this with

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,060
a function called session ID.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,090
Basically this function here is just going to have the ID of any users any user that looks into the

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,530
our admin area or index.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,030
Right.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,590
Basically we already have a session started right.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,980
I don't believe using admin or something like that.

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:52,110
So every time we start session right now this function is going to catch the idea of that session right.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,760
So if I open chrome I'm going to have a unique session id if I open fire fighting and have another session

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,430
ID.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,830
All right.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,780
And if you don't remember how sessions work you need to go back to the foundations on discourse where

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,960
I talk about sessions.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,810
All right.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,860
Super simple.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,540
But anyway.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,570
So we're going to have a variable that holds that information then we're going to have a variable that

24
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:30,730
holds that time like this and we're going to create another variable here that says time out in seconds.

25
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,210
All right.

26
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:39,040
And this is just the man of time that you want the user to be marked off line.

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,110
All right.

28
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,160
So in our case we want to set it to say let's have a simple 300 is going to be equal to five minutes

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,170
and I'll show you in a minute how we do that.

30
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,990
So I'm going to make it equal to 60.

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,950
All right that's going to be 60 seconds.

32
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,240
So that when we do that is let's create another variable here and we're going to do some math.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,690
We're going to call this time out.

34
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,650
All right.

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:16,250
And all we gotta do is mine is that with this time on insects and that's just going to give us that

36
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,680
timeout variable that we need.

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,240
All right calculation.

38
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,810
So now the next step is is that we need to actually count.

39
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,450
All right.

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,970
The users we're going to need to make equerry So let's go ahead and make equerry and let's say selects

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,010
0 from users on line.

42
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,810
Right.

43
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:50,560
So our table where session equals session.

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,140
All right want to make sure that that's the correct user.

45
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,050
All right so once we have that then we say you know what send the Kohary

46
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:14,000
might ask you a line where we put a connection right here of course always and then we send in the query.

47
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,910
All right.

48
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,160
And then we say you know what.

49
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
Just count it.

50
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,200
And this use a function as your line rules for that there we go.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,190
So now we have the count right.

52
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,640
How many users right.

53
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:39,660
So now we say if the count is equal to no which means nothing is there now even an industry and just

54
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,700
nothing.

55
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,660
My ask you a lie will go here and we say and we can make the inquiry right here.

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,180
We want it to.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,180
So I'm just going to make it right away.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,970
I'm going to say you know what connection just to make a short and then we say insert into users on

59
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,040
line.

60
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,980
The Apprentice is here and the values are and this is again I will say I want to answer this.

61
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:20,850
In the session field and the time I went in search for those things the time

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:36,190
and the session that we go I actually had to make sure that you got it in the correct field OK.

63
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:44,170
Session and then time there on the line you're going to put the wrong information in the wrong fields.

64
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,600
Right

65
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,880
else.

66
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,320
All right.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,710
That means that we already have a user logged in.

68
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,730
Right.

69
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,600
Right here let me explain this a little bit.

70
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,820
Actually limitedly this will do this in the next lecture.

71
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,480
Let me explain what we're doing here.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,020
So basically we are counting.

73
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,440
See if anybody's on line right.

74
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,720
If nobody's on line then we're going to insert that time.

75
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,290
That means I mean it all on.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,070
All right.

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,430
Sorry about that.

78
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,300
If for some reason we find out that my issue live known Rose is equal to none.

79
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,840
Right.

80
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,040
That means is a new use a slogan.

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,960
We are going to be inserting the time and the session to that table so that what we're going to keep

82
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,530
track of the user with the time in the session.

83
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,190
All right.

84
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,970
So in the next lecture We'll continue with the statement.

85
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,280
But make sure that you understand this.

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,490
All right.

87
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,850
Very simple.

88
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,020
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
