1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,500
All right so how are these nice really cool functionalities here.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,190
All right we are echoing back the name of the user we are auto completing and I mean we're doing really

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,160
cool stuff here.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,040
So what's next.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,270
Well what's next is that we need to actually display the errors right.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,060
We don't know anything yet.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,240
We don't know what's going on.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,420
If we did something wrong here that this form keeps refreshing going back we do not know so let's actually

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,680
start with that.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:39,890
So what we need to do is take this all the way to the top here and just close it out there.

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:51,870
This one and right here in say this form group def which is this guy here we need to create a paragraph

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,470
where you can do whatever you want really doesn't matter.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,520
And we're going to do something very similar to what we did here with this one so you're going to copy

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,020
this whole thing and put it right here.

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,550
But this one is going to be a little different because what we want to check here is the errors array

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,230
or error array.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,840
I've got a problem saying to our guys if you haven't noticed you're going to notice any it more now

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,800
that I tell you so anyway.

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,880
So this error array.

20
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,070
There we go see that.

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,460
So if it's set we're going to show if it's now we're going to show this empty string here so let's hope

22
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,600
hopefully it works.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Let's see.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,340
All right.

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,100
So we go and register.

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,670
There we go user name cannot be empty.

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,000
There we go.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,520
User name needs to be needs to be longer.

29
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,650
Geez I just noticed my typo guys you guys on let me know anything user needs to be longer

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,730
user.

31
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,050
All right.

32
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,270
So that's the only one I guess.

33
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,860
All right.

34
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,320
Come on guy it really doesn't matter much here.

35
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,220
What matters is the functionality.

36
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,680
All right.

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,820
So that's working.

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,050
Let's go back down to just copy this whole thing here.

39
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,770
Let's go down to this one here.

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:35,060
Now you can of course fix this forum however you want to you make it tidy and nice.

41
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,360
There we go.

42
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,980
All right.

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,340
Of course mine looks like that because I have to make it bigger here.

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:58,390
All right so the e-mail we need it password as well.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,440
Now if we go back here see that e-mail cannot be empty.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,640
All right.

47
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm being a little picky here.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:13,800
I forgot my cup at all uppercase E..

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,070
All right.

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,290
So now let's do the password as well.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,560
Inside the form group def or the deaf with a Class A form group

52
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,630
and password

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,350
password.

54
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,160
All right

55
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,730
let's see how this looks beautiful guys look at that.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,870
That's right Don.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,530
And let's just put something here.

58
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,330
As you can see beautiful

59
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,970
see that it's working nicely.

60
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,930
All right.

61
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,550
So what else do we need.

62
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,140
Well we need to make the registry user function work.

63
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,710
All right.

64
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,340
So we're going to do that on the net lecture.

65
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,930
We're going to try to do that.

66
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,530
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture
