00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.280
All right so we know that our form is actually receiving the raise is able to receive data right.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.830
We are able to submit it to.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.560
But let's go ahead and do some things to it.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.030
Now we will probably be adding and this is actually very sure that we will be adding a picture feature

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500
but we will do that in the in the extra features sense.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.410
I'm more concerned about just finishing this and then later on we're going to have really cool features

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.780
right.

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.430
Well right now let's go ahead and finish it.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.750
So let's make sure that we don't comment this out right now here.

10
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:46.770
Let's live this overloaded date and the function for moving files.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.790
All right you can go ahead and if you want to try you can go ahead and try this right now.

12
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.890
King uncle is now.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.770
And I comment.

14
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.670
This issue work fine.

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.610
You probably will have a permissions problem.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.750
So make sure that you right click on that folder on the images folder and give it permission 7 5 5 or

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.970
7 7 7 to read and write right to the images for this so that beacon can work.

18
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.100
So the server can work with that folder right.

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.060
If you want to go ahead and do it now but I'm not going to do that right now I'm going to do the images

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.420
and the extra features so that what we can do something nice.

21
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.500
So.

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.100
So we were sending some data here let's make sure that we get inserted into the users table.

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.990
Right.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.640
And we want to say user ID here

25
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.740
user I think is first name we got over there for is name

26
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.260
user or last name should be copy and paste.

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.450
And by the way.

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.930
But actually this is the columns in the table.

29
00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.430
All right.

30
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.630
So use your last name.

31
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.580
What is in that stain that we are use or roll.

32
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.240
All right.

33
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.670
What else are we this here.

34
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.610
This comment is going to be used in there right now.

35
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.470
User name

36
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.830
what else.

37
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.320
Actually user name goes together.

38
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:36.640
These are e-mail and user password user e-mail user passwords almost the same amount of feels right.

39
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.630
User password.

40
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.740
All right.

41
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:52.430
Let's make sure that this is good.

42
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.520
All right.

43
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.930
There we go.

44
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.580
And here we're going to be answering those like this user ID.

45
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.470
That's the reason why I named the same so that way I don't have that confusion here.

46
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.110
User

47
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.470
first name we should be copy and pasting from the top.

48
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.310
OK.

49
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.190
Because if now you're going to get some errors especially when you're first starting out even I guess

50
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.470
some marrows last name we're not going to be using this function now that now function

51
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.910
was in its own user role.

52
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.470
We're not going to be using the idea or work putting it right here.

53
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.180
Let's just take that out real quick.

54
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.520
All right.

55
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.200
So use user road user name

56
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.910
user email

57
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.660
over here

58
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.990
or email.

59
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:23.730
And the last one the user password used for us.

60
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.260
All right.

61
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.760
Perfect.

62
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.630
Let's change the name of this create user Querrey right here.

63
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.030
Corey.

64
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.220
All right.

65
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.740
Perfect answer to users.

66
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.920
User name right here.

67
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:52.500
User first name they use or last name user role user name user email user password.

68
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.860
What else we need to change here.

69
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.880
Meant to post.

70
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.730
Everything's looking good right here and user roll.

71
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:11.010
Just make sure that this is the same on top here looks the same to me here also.

72
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.730
All right.

73
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.320
So in the next lecture we're going to be testing this and making sure it works correctly.

74
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.840
And so you then take your
