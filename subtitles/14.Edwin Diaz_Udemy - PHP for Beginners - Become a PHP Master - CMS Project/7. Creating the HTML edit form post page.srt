1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,580
All right so we are able to read the data for our database.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,180
We're able to add some pools.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,630
Right.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,170
And we are able to delete them.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,140
We are missing though the part of the crowd which is at it.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,260
So we're going to be doing that doing this and this tutorial will first let's just take this off here

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,610
this is on static content that we got in the view all polls are right.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,320
And actually I think there's gold down all the way and we can see right here you probably saw that and

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,990
took it off already but I have not.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,990
So sorry about that.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,570
Let's go ahead and refresh year and wish you have it good.

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:46,170
So let's go ahead and what we're going to do for the edit is that we're going to be creating a new page.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,230
We have to we don't want to do everything on the same page as it gets too cluttered.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,100
All right.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:03,190
So let's go to admin and we are going to create a edit page edit that the HP

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:16,050
post actually edit post APHC edit underscore it pours post-up BHB enter.

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,500
All right.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,320
So we already have a forum here that we can include in the ad on the score post that BHB So let's do

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,270
that let's use our form and this just use their words.

20
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,480
What do you think.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,510
I think we are good if we use it.

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,160
Perfect.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:48,270
And the next thing to do is go to View polls actually you will post post PH BE IN HERE WE GOING include

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,300
a form depending on the condition.

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,310
So the case that we are going to be using for this is going to be and it underscore what polls say is

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,190
actually you did it right.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,050
You did a great not.

28
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,520
Great.

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,740
So now we won't include that let's copy this one here you said this is getting more is getting better

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,890
because we just copy and pasting stuff now.

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,740
It is going to get to a point that we're just going to copy and paste most of the queries and functions.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,630
So it's going to be great.

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,150
And this just change the polls there.

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,820
All right.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,250
So we want Pat when we pass that we get to that we go to that page let's just pass it source.

36
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,970
He calls it post.

37
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,090
So you see that.

38
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,100
All right.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,060
Perfect.

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,590
So I'm going to leave it at this here.

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,980
I want to make this tutorial Swedens.

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,120
It's short and sweet and I'll see you in the next one.

43
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,020
And that's when we're going to be doing some more great stuff.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,250
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next video.
