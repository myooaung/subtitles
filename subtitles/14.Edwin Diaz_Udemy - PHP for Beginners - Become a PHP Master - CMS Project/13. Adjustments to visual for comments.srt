1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,640
All right so we were able to update this field here every time we go and make a comment right on this

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,180
specific post.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,470
Now there is no need to do anything else here.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,050
A few refresh.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,170
You see that this is going to change to a different number now.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,620
We are already displaying using that data that function in the view old posts.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,610
So let's go ahead and check on that right now.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,920
So we go to View Post.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:29,870
All right.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:37,830
We can see that we are already right have to pull the data coming out.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,510
We are already echoing that data both coming count and that's the same color that we have in our database.

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,040
All right.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,310
So we don't have to worry about that anymore.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,960
Now what I will do on this video here is we're going to be adding two more columns right here.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,640
Well two more Littlefield's says this doesn't look right.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,730
So let's fill it up a little bit and add those two.

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,850
So let's go to the top here and we really have come in St. Louis add edit and delete.

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,410
All right.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,580
I think we're doing really good progress on this.

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,290
See a mess.

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,070
All right.

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,800
So let's go back and we have the edit and delete right there.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,030
All right so perfect.

24
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,930
I think we're doing a pretty good job like I said before we are all dating all this automatically.

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,140
And if you wanted you can just delete it and you can start from scratch about this and he will do it.

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,470
Now if you have this problem that you have to click twice here to actually update these posts.

27
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,100
Right.

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,810
The reason is because we need to refresh this page.

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,920
So that's another thing that I want to do right now.

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,010
Let's go to your post and cussing out meaning includes.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,080
All right so let's let's go ahead and fix that little little bit of piece of coal that we need to fix.

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,960
Let's go to the delete.

33
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,390
We should have the lead right here from this is the lead.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:15,010
And all we have to do is do the header and let's send the page again to the same you or else so he does

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,570
so he refreshes right.

36
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,690
So every time you have a problem there you're not seeing the change automatically in the page just refresh

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,870
it just do this function here and refresh it.

38
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,930
All right.

39
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,390
So now if we add another pulse they just delete this one.

40
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,970
Let's just refresh it here.

41
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,370
Whoops

42
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,670
sorry

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,110
it's actually pose to go to post again.

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,630
Who's right there.

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,100
Location pulse.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,530
All right.

47
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,030
So with the leader here you see that that change happening automatically.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,250
Now of course we're going to have to have some more polls and get it done and practice some more right.

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,950
But anyway I think you had enough of this lecture here and hopefully you're enjoying the course and

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,210
if you have any questions I'm here 24/7.

51
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:08,560
All right.

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,240
Thank you.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,700
And I see you the next election.
