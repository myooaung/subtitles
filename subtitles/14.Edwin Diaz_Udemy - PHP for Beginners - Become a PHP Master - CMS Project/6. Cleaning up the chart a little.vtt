00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.940
All right so we are at our see a mess right here and I took a break of one hour I think and I deleted

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.720
some cookies in my other desktop window and I do a couple of things and it just log me out.

3
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.290
All right.

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.580
Well that's normal.

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.800
All right so if you find yourself that you turn on your computer you can come back and you are logged

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.460
now.

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.880
That's normal.

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.940
Use your session just ended.

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.850
All right so make sure you go and log in again.

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.770
All right.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.610
Perfect.

12
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.020
Now we are here the ad men but this looks too small right here to fix this.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.660
All right.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.400
So what is going on in our coeditor.

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.650
And let's go to admin for Slash in this.

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.930
And here are the when at bottom.

17
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.480
In this day right here we need to fix this with right here of 900 page sales too.

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.940
And you're going to put two cords there single quotes and you're going to say all right that's you fix

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.880
it up.

20
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.470
Let's check it out.

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.380
And as you can see here a fixed it up a little bit.

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.550
All right let's also take of this company performance and all of that out there since we don't know

23
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.930
that information there.

24
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350
And this information should be right here.

25
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.450
I'm just going to leave it blank.

26
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:34.120
Let the subtitle blank also and anything else that we need to just go ahead and check it out now refresh.

27
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.780
We don't have any other information there right.

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.720
We're going to keep cleaning up this as we go.

29
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.640
Well right now we need to take up some of these data and convert it into a dynamic data.

30
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.340
Right.

31
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:57.420
So let's go here and what we're going to do is when I take all this out here or this way I leave this

32
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.430
column right here this one.

33
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.480
And let's take all these values out of there.

34
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.290
We've got to leave two values.

35
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.210
Let's take all these values there and we lived two values here.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.390
Also let me make this bigger so you can see what I'm doing right here.

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.820
All right.

38
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.420
All we're doing is cleaning up a little bit here and here I just come.

39
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.940
There it is blank and I'm just going to call this counter here count and we can just put data right

40
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.210
here.

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.100
This is just a column right.

42
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.810
And

43
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.600
there we go.

44
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.060
And this all we can use called Polk's just to pass a placeholder so you can see what we are doing.

45
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.000
Let's go here and refresh.

46
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.040
And as you can see right now if I pull my mouse over he says polls and he says count one thousand one

47
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.170
K..

48
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.750
All right.

49
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.520
So we're going to be using this but we've got to run this through loop so that when we get many of these

50
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.120
charts right here right when we need to start our query so that we can loop through an array and display

51
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.060
all these data right here.

52
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.880
All right.

53
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.070
So we need to also clean this hour right here actually.

54
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.370
I think that's fine we just have count right here that's good.

55
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.900
Let's check it out a little bit and see if we can find something else wrong with it.

56
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.740
And then we can go ahead and take it out again remember this is javascript right.

57
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.320
Most everything here is javascript.

58
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.040
I have a course in javascript so you're welcome to check that out.

59
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.750
All right.

60
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.950
I have good prices sometimes I have the courses free so you can also check that out.

61
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.570
If it's not free it is in good price.

62
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.550
All right so our data looks good here.

63
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.610
And I'm just organizing a little bit here.

64
00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:04.920
Moved this one here and I'm doing this by selecting it and pressing command in my right bracket close

65
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.160
to the enter key.

66
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.780
And if you are in Windows you can use press control and then select the everything press control and

67
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.920
then the right Bracher left bracket to move it.

68
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.760
All right.

69
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.050
So all I'm doing is cleaning up a little bit here.

70
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:29.230
Want to make sure that this is a little organized there right.

71
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.190
Right.

72
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.860
So I think this looks good.

73
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.810
All right we're ready to be doing some BHB and we're going to be doing a feature right here.

74
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.400
All right.

75
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:51.640
All right so let's open our tags.

76
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.500
And we're going to be doing some ph be right here if I can get this.

77
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.850
There we go.

78
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.540
It looks a lot better now.

79
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.900
OK.

80
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.100
So we are ready to go.

81
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.890
All right Peach for you right here.

82
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.310
Anyway I'm going to leave this for the next lecture because I think we already ran a four or five minutes

83
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.950
here.

84
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:18.010
Well the next lecture we're going to write PH BE we're going to make this dynamic the is dynamic and

85
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.650
they count the counts of the pulls dynamics all right because we have to play we have to do to race.

86
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.230
All right and well anyway you're going to see what I'm doing in the next lecture is going to be awesome
