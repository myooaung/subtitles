00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.640
All right on the last video we saw that we were able to take some data out of the form when we click

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.050
Submit right.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.190
We check for this submit attribute value here up here.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.840
And when the form was submitted we echo this.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.190
Right.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.840
So we were able to check on that.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.270
So now what we need to do is check on the rest.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.150
We need to actually pull this information from the rest of the document here from the that form and

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.880
do something with it.

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.420
So if you didn't get it right last time if you for some reason could not do it you are going to be able

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.360
to do it now.

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.430
So all we got to do is add the same name attribute here to this form to these inputs.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.210
And I'm just going to call this username.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.870
We're going to pull in the user name ID here.

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.860
And you don't have to name a user name.

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260
That's what I'm using.

17
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.680
You can name and name you can name and whatever you want.

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.630
It's up to you.

19
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.060
I got to name this password.

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.630
I just want to be descriptive.

21
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.270
Whoops.

22
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.670
All right so now that we got that said we've got a receiver up here.

23
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.560
So if the if the post if the phone was submitted Why do I want to do.

24
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.460
I want to go ahead and grab this here and we're going to get something called a user name right.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.500
User name because we're going to get that from the form data and we are going to be getting

26
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.410
it.

27
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.060
We're going to be getting this one also so we can actually turn these values.

28
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.900
We can play around with his values the way they are but what we want to do that let's make this a little

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.170
bit more friendly right let's make this user and let's make this into a variable username so that way

30
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.660
we can play around with it like this it's a lot better than than having the whole thing there like this.

31
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
So when these values come in we'll find out what the form was submitted.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.930
Remember that every time we click on submit all these values get sent in in the form.

33
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.420
All of them they all get sent.

34
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.090
All we are doing right here is checking if the form was set then we want to do some things with it because

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.550
the form was not set and we started doing things with it.

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.530
PH We were going to say wait wait wait.

37
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.430
What are you doing.

38
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.650
I don't have the user name.

39
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270
I don't have this value.

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.720
He's going to give us an error.

41
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.360
OK.

42
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320
So right now the phone was submitted.

43
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.820
We're playing it safe.

44
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.730
We pull the data from here from the user name we pull the data from the password Actually we got it

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.690
changed the value here.

46
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.600
Right.

47
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.630
And then we turn it into variables.

48
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.720
Perfect right.

49
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.100
So we can go heading equil this if we wanted to right now we can go ahead and Eckl password used to

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.630
find though.

51
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
And we can go ahead and call username.

52
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.780
Right.

53
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.380
So let's check on that list.

54
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.460
Let's see how that works.

55
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.980
And we get some arrows right here and that's the whole reason why.

56
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.130
Well I'll explain about that later about.

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.360
Not said it not checking for the values or we don't check.

58
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.970
We get an error.

59
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.320
But anyway.

60
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.990
So let's go ahead and add one.

61
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:23.270
And I'm just going to type some password.

62
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.700
All right.

63
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.350
Submit

64
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.090
you see that we get the helo's Durant we get a pass we're first and then we get to use and then we should

65
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.290
actually argue they use them first right.

66
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.010
They do it right here.

67
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.850
And this is and we can concatenate this with a string.

68
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.250
They say low.

69
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.560
And then we can say your password

70
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.470
is.

71
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.330
Is that would be we are if we do that in a real life situation.

72
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.870
Right.

73
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:04.620
That would give.

74
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.040
They freaked out that we know the password.

75
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.990
We do that an application in a application so doing.

76
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.390
And then we say

77
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.040
see I going to have my password.

78
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.650
Hello.

79
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.150
Your password is Superman.

80
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.560
Oh man they know my password.

81
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.410
Geez.

82
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.900
All right so we wait to do that you see how beautiful that is we can find the data here and do things

83
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.440
with it.

84
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.520
It is not the only thing with it.

85
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.670
Usually what we do is we use this user name and place it inside a database check it to see if it's there

86
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.350
if there were log in the user sometimes we create users actually creating this field in the database.

87
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.710
Right.

88
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.050
So most of the time that's why we we do this for.

89
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.780
So I'm just right now whether this will give you gives you an example on how we can extract data from

90
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.490
the form.

91
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.720
How can we do all the things with it right here like we're doing right here all we doing right now is

92
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.200
echoing the information.

93
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.590
But like I said we can do many things with it.

94
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.480
All right.

95
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.320
So all this video you learn how to extract the rest the remaining data of the form and how to do a couple

96
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.980
of things with it on the next video.

97
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.630
I want to show you how we can validate some of these data how we can find out if Did you know if they

98
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.970
typed something here.

99
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.070
And for some reason it didn't match up.

100
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.320
You're going to see the next video is going to be fun if you like this one the next video you like a

101
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.940
lot more.

102
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.330
So anyway I'm just going to you know I'm not even going to tell you anymore because I want it to become

103
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.190
a small price.

104
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.270
But anyway standby.

105
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.250
Let's go ahead and jump into the next lecture.

106
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.730
Take care
