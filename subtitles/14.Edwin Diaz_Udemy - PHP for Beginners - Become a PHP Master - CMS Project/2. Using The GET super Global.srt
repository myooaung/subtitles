1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,720
I will come back and this video here we are going to be learning how to pull information from you or

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,370
else and processing it using BHB.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,650
Right.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,570
So I'm going to show you right now a couple of searches here on Google a couple of examples.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,650
So I'm going to show you an example of where you are able when Google actually sends parameters via

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,140
your URL.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,950
All right so let's say for example high typing cars here you see the parameters right here.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,620
They're very simple to to recognize once you know how they are how they work.

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,890
So we see a question mark here and we see source I.D. equals chrome high for an instant and then stops

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,480
here.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,650
We have Ampere's symbol right this ampersand here divides each of these parameters.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,150
So we see here it stops again and stops here again and we're going to be learning how to do that right

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,540
now.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,220
All right.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,890
So and how we do that is by using a super global called get this open our coeditor here.

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,010
Let's do a Save pass on this document here blank up here.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,050
Let's call this.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,230
Get that BHB.

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,290
All right.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,650
And if I can go ahead and find out get right here.

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,250
All right there we go.

22
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,950
All right so we got this.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,450
Get that BHB.

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,740
And what I want to do and how I want to show you is that we're going to go to you or else we're going

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,420
to pass some parameters and then we're going to catch you here and display it and show you how it works.

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,530
So for that we need to catch that value of those we need to catch up parameter.

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,390
All right so we are going to open BHB attacks here and we're going to use the variable super global

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,510
call yet and this is actually underscore right there.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,290
So dollar sign on this score get this is a super global variable and meaning that is available anyway

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,610
in our document here.

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,080
We don't need to.

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,610
Is this available inside functions outside functions anywhere.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,580
We declare this is available as long as we pass parameters on you r l.

34
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,270
So how we are going to display is very simple.

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,330
So when we pass a parameter that you are we going to catch it here and we're going to display with this

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,660
function print are the reason why we have to use print are printing this place was inside arrays.

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,170
Now you heard me saying that this is super global super variable global right is it has a dollar sign

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:39,060
right here that underscore this super global variable converts the data gets converts this data.

39
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,910
This BHB has this done in the background there.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
They know the functions they have in the BHB language.

41
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,180
Convert them into an associate of Array.

42
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,870
All right I want to show you in a minute how that works.

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:03:00,150
So let's just go ahead and go to the browser and now you can see here that we have an array and that's

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,750
the print or that's the get super global right there it's empty right now.

45
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,790
But when we pass it a parameter is going to display right there.

46
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:16,580
So all we have to do is actually go here and pass it a parameter like ID equals 10 enter.

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,390
And as you can see convert it the ID part of it for the key and then the 10 for the value.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,400
And if I divide is what it would and am Procyon right here.

49
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,010
And I say source like I googled it and with the example that I show you a Google search equals I don't

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,270
know true reports enter.

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,790
You see it created another key.

52
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,950
And set said value for reports.

53
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,170
We divide each of these values by an ampersand right there.

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,490
So keep that in mind.

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,280
Now we can send this information directly when the user types it in.

56
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,410
Or we can send it via links right.

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,620
So let's go down here and create a link and I want to send that information via links.

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,380
So let's create this link here.

59
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,850
And we're going to set it to go to the same page and we are on.

60
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,910
And here with a question mark we're going to set that information ID equals 200.

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,070
When they when the user clicks here we are going to send that I.D. of 200 you're going to send this

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,640
parameter there.

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,730
Right and we're going to display right here.

64
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,760
So let's go ahead and do that let's do this.

65
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,530
All right.

66
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,180
So when the user clicks we get we send that I.D. to get super global.

67
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,710
As you can see their marae perfect.

68
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,580
Now we can make this dynamic also.

69
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,750
All right keep that in mind we can put BHB right here and this is the way is usually done.

70
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,940
These IDs usually set dynamically this is not set.

71
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,630
You don't see users go into the browser and type in is this idea now.

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,130
Right.

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,470
When the user clicks on something this idea gets set dynamically.

74
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:11,580
So if the user goes on Google for example and searches for cars right that's get sent dynamically right.

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,590
That or that parameter was sent automatically.

76
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,790
I didn't go physically there and put a question mark to Hanjour.

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,910
I didn't do that.

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,430
So keep that in mind so we can send this like this open APHC and tag and close one and let's make a

79
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,380
variable.

80
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,420
It's called his I.D. let's put it equal to 10.

81
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,900
All right.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,780
We're going to do something very simple here I'm going to take of this idea here I'm going to replace

83
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,660
it with BHB

84
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,430
and I'm going to echo out make sure that you Agway because if you don't like it it won't work.

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,610
So what I'm doing right now is I replace the idea that I set it that I set manually here with this dynamic

86
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,910
I.D. and it's going to be equal to 10.

87
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,180
So I was going to do basically the same thing which is going to have a different value.

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,430
All right so let's just take this out here and I click on it.

89
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,340
You get this idea set to attend there.

90
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,450
All right.

91
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,500
So we're missing something here because we're missing that I.D. equals.

92
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:14,970
There we go.

93
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,530
We need to have that I.D. equal we need to have the key right there we go.

94
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,220
So let's do it again click.

95
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,270
So we have that now the I.D. and the value is 10.

96
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,700
You see this is and then we can test for things like this.

97
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,410
Right.

98
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,630
We say it for a reason.

99
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:42,970
If get is equal to I.D. these I.D. which is equal to 10 then we can send a user to another page.

100
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,980
We can do things like this we can actually do multiple things with loops or I mean we can we can do

101
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,940
it there's a lot of things we can do right.

102
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,500
We can even change this.

103
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,430
This here is a ref and make it dynamically.

104
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,050
All right we can even change just click here dynamically if we want to be.

105
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,240
All right.

106
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:15,550
We can say something like button and then we can set the value of there to click here.

107
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,340
We can set that string here right.

108
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,950
We can make applications however we want and then we insert some BHB right here right.

109
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,540
Just grab it from here.

110
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,500
There we go.

111
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,130
And that's just a cool button here

112
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,910
as you can see the same thing right here.

113
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,510
All right.

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,880
But we can change the value here whenever we want.

115
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,520
Call this a minute now and you can see changing on top right.

116
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,470
Click.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,820
Look at that.

118
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,040
See that change.

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,590
Click here now.

120
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,980
So there are many things that we can do with BHP but the best part is that we can get information from

121
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,810
there you are able and we can do things with it depending on whether user clicks we can send the user

122
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,510
to a different page and say OK the user click here.

123
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,310
All right.

124
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,430
If they if the ID was 10 if the value was 10 I want you to send the user to this and I want you to get

125
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,280
this information from the database and display to the user.

126
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,550
All right so hopefully this was clear to you.

127
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,000
If not don't worry about it you can ask me questions and discussions and we're going to be playing around

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,170
more with getting information from users.

129
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,460
After this lecture Right.

130
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,790
So take care and I'll see you in the next lecture
