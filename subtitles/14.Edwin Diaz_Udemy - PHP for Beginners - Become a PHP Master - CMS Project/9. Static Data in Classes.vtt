00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.810
All right so in this video we're going to be learning about static modifiers.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.730
Now what are static modifiers.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.000
Well starting Monday if I could be any data that is static in the class and when that data is static

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.470
in the class it means the only belongs to that class.

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.590
It does have nothing to do with instances.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.690
Now it's actually better for me to show you visually so I'm going to go and do that.

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.780
Let's go to the coeditor here.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.300
Let's create a save as from class on the scored 3 on the score card 3 that BHB array class on the scorecard

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:42.520
3 that BHB and let's make this static class underscore static that BHB or I am going to delete a couple

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.570
of things out of here.

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.910
One of the leaders first two properties there and go into the lead.

12
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.610
The second method I'm going to delete all this instances here and let's just see what we got here.

13
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110
Should it have anything.

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.700
All right.

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.900
So the first thing that you should learn is how we define a static property.

16
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.480
Well static property very simple.

17
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.550
You use the word keyword.

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.220
The key word static.

19
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.370
And now this property is static meaning that this is attached to the class.

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.660
Now not attached to the instance.

21
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.990
So we can use that any more we can come here and say BMW like we used to do before and say wheels we

22
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.890
can do that because it's going to give us a undefine property hero here right.

23
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.500
We can't refer to it like this anymore.

24
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.310
Right.

25
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.560
So we have to use something in order for us to use this we need to use a different different notations

26
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.320
and the notation that we use is something like this.

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.180
We need to first let's say we're going to Let's first do this up here and this comment is because it's

28
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050
not working eventually right.

29
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.660
So let's say we want to echo this.

30
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.780
Right.

31
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.960
And even if I echoed here I just wanted to show you that it doesn't work it's the same thing OK.

32
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.290
Adding Ikoyi But just because I wanted to I went ahead of myself in my head and did it.

33
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.660
But anyway let's just ekal.

34
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.750
And then the way we refer to this static property now is because that's actually the class we need to

35
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.200
tell BHP Where is this property at right.

36
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.780
These property there's are of the class to what class is this attached to.

37
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.230
So we know that is attached to a car which is that's the car the class right there and then the way

38
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.920
we refer it instead of using the arrow here we used to.

39
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.410
That's right.

40
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.920
Kallen used to Courtland's here and then we write in name what we first need to put the dollar sign

41
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.270
because now this is a variable arised not an instance property.

42
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.770
All right.

43
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.870
And that's it right there.

44
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.920
All right.

45
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.870
So I know it looks pretty weird but that's the way it is.

46
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.010
So now this is just a static property we can use it anywhere we want as long as we refer to the class

47
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.380
where it's located.

48
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.110
We can also have static functions methods within the class.

49
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.800
All right.

50
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.850
So that's not only data we can have static methods that are only attached to the class instead of being

51
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.010
attached to the instance.

52
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.390
All right.

53
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.170
So because well you know that in order for us to use these properties here in their normal sense right

54
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.740
here like this we need to create an instance.

55
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.290
There's no other way of using it unless we create an instance.

56
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.080
Right but not any more if we use static we can use that in instances we can use it any way we want but

57
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.930
we have to use it like this.

58
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.670
Right.

59
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.180
No doubt about that.

60
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.390
We can also lead.

61
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.860
Now another thing that I want to discuss about let's say for example now you can use a regular method

62
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.180
then call a static property that's not a problem.

63
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.940
But we need we need to refer it differently.

64
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.880
So the way we refer to this class instead of using this does variable that we use with instance right.

65
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:16.650
What we do is we refer to this is very simple we use the name of the class to coolants and the variable

66
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.300
there.

67
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.780
All right the very dollar sign or symbol whatever you want to call it.

68
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.220
And then we can invoke this and then where we invoke is very similar to how we invoke.

69
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.660
So now that this wheel's here is has a different value that we can go ahead and echo that.

70
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:46.890
So but we first to do that let's go ahead and car two dots and then the name of the method always use

71
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.790
the two dots first.

72
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.350
And now we can see the value change to 10 right.

73
00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.150
So to call any static data inside the class we use the two dots right here like this.

74
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.240
So we change this arrow for two dots and instead of having the instance name we have the class name.

75
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.350
So that's the difference there.

76
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.730
Don't let that trip you off.

77
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.420
There he would trip a lot of programmers as a matter of fact when they first starting.

78
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.520
But no that this is the way it is.

79
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.740
So if you have any errors or something like that look for dollar signs that you're missing because if

80
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.110
you now you see in the instance we don't use dollar signs.

81
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.830
So that could trip you up there make sure that you use the name Misha using the class name.

82
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.380
All right.

83
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.890
So anyway thank you so much for watching this video I hope you learn some valuable information.

84
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.200
And I see you on the next lesson.

85
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.860
Take care.
