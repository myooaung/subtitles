00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.910
Walk them back to the student so on this lecture what I want to show you is a couple of things.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.920
First of all I want to show you how to send different characters over e-mails I know some of you a percentage

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.330
of you are from different countries and you're going to be using different characters.

4
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.190
So when we are sending like different characters or non English characters we need to set our document

5
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.180
type to something that our programs can understand.

6
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:42.210
So for example there is many different types of document but one of the most common one is call you

7
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.360
t f hyphen 8.

8
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.470
Are you seeing many skeleton H.T. of male documents with that OK on top in the metta field.

9
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.490
As a matter of fact let me see if our bootstrap not this one but

10
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.900
our header has it.

11
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.990
So you can see that it says the character set is UTF 8.

12
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.840
So this lets the browser know this and I want you to use this character said there are many different

13
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.520
character sets but this one is a most common one he has a bunch of characters.

14
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.340
When we are sending data to our database we want to be able to insert UTF 8 character sets in there

15
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.960
because there is this character say has a bunch of their friend characters that are in English if you

16
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.450
speak another language or want other languages to be included in your database.

17
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.810
As a matter of fact I think we already have that here somewhere.

18
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:54.100
As you can see we are setting the this UTF 8 Cather I believe there is another function to do this but

19
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.480
we are doing this before we are actually connected to the database so we are setting that we put inside

20
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.920
the Querrey.

21
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.210
OK we can believe there is set char set or something like that.

22
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.930
But there are different ways of doing it that's one way of doing it.

23
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:23.610
Let's actually come back here and we can just google a real quick set char set my SU Well BHP and is

24
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.220
going to give you information how to do that it is even a function to do that OK.

25
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.340
So you can see right here OK

26
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.520
and you can just type in my ask your lie and that's going to show you how to do it with that API character

27
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.570
set.

28
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.720
OK as you can see you can use a function or you can even include an inside your query somehow way of

29
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:07.350
typing in the inside the my my s u l k

30
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.020
UTF 8.

31
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.220
See that so set names UTSA default Carter's set as you can see there are a couple of ways of doing it.

32
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.160
But anyway.

33
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.680
So while we are going to be doing it here let's go down here.

34
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.710
When we sent an email this e-mail is not going to have by default this character set of UTF is not going

35
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.180
to.

36
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.140
So for example if I sent something in a body that is in Spanish and I thought I had something in spanish

37
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.770
somewhere let me you might be thinking don't you write Spanish Hadwin.

38
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.590
All right so as you can see we get some character sets here.

39
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.600
Little things on top of the words.

40
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.860
So let's go to send that and see how it looks.

41
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.220
Our application refresh this

42
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:16.620
Corteen Foxwoods the and enter and let's go to our

43
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.330
mailbox here.

44
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.730
Click here.

45
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.460
And as you can see that looks pretty bad right.

46
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.050
And that's something very similar to what you want to get in your database.

47
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.900
OK.

48
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.280
So how we can solve that.

49
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.680
Super simple we need to set up this property.

50
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.570
Let's call this mail.

51
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.370
Well actually that's the name of a charset.

52
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.650
And now pass this string here to say UTF 8 and that's it.

53
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.980
Now when we send an e-mail and if I can get my document back that would be very helpful actually get

54
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.660
that here.

55
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.050
And we go so at times I get carried away guys.

56
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.600
OK.

57
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.410
Coding faculty

58
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.800
as you can see we've got the email here.

59
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.010
Now everything works correctly.

60
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.050
So that's one thing that I wanted to show you in this video another thing that I wanted to show you

61
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:32.550
is that to include classes automatically composer OK composer has an auto loader app function that will

62
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.340
oh I don't know.

63
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:40.560
Oh this all the classes in your application instead of you know every time we go to one of our files

64
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.950
we need to come manually here and require it.

65
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.640
Right.

66
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.100
What are you what if we can just require one function here and if we require all our classes automatically

67
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.530
that would be awesome right.

68
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.100
So that's what composer does.

69
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.030
But we have to actually go to the composer that Jason.

70
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.040
Now let me tell you something about this.

71
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:11.390
And let's say I approach a project like this like A.J. is in the application like no J.S. we have a

72
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.720
package that Jason File and this is every time you see a dot J some file is to set up configurations

73
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.950
for that program.

74
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:28.070
So the Bakhash Jason in the case of no J S is for package management just like compose a composite package

75
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.730
management.

76
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.710
So you find you give some information on the recommendation and then you define your dependencies.

77
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:42.020
This weather that Jason does majority of Jason follows are when it comes to javascript or BHB or any

78
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.820
other application we use.

79
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.380
Jason Jason is a really good format to do that.

80
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:55.140
But anyway so what we need to do here is we need to set up another part here where we use that.

81
00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.670
So I'm going to come down here as a matter of fact I'll do it below authors.

82
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.750
I think that should be on top right.

83
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:11.840
And we are going to this is a object here actually.

84
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.730
Let's set it up here.

85
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.350
It doesn't matter.

86
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.010
This is going to be called Oh Lord.

87
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.230
And this is something I'm not creating that this is already created.

88
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.630
This is something that's already defined in the application.

89
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.510
James adding it.

90
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.330
So Glass map.

91
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:39.440
That's what is called and this is just going to be an array where the class the classes that we want

92
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.730
to include in this case I want to include my classes folder.

93
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.130
OK.

94
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.630
Now when we go

95
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.170
when we do this.

96
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.330
OK.

97
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:00.200
Composer is going to automatically add anything that's inside here.

98
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.760
So if we create another class and let's just create a simple class

99
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.480
ok and

100
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:14.990
simple

101
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.040
OK and let's use.

102
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.090
I don't know this is let's just leave it like that.

103
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.040
That's fine.

104
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:32.180
So we have that class and it's a matter of fact let's just create a function here

105
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.660
is playing and

106
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.360
now all we have to do is we need to dump all that data.

107
00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:03.470
Basically refresh composer have to go to our termine or whatever terminal you're using open your terminal.

108
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:16.170
Either the windows or the Mac or the Linux dump or load and optimize it enter.

109
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:23.580
And now if we go to our forgot we don't have to actually use this anymore.

110
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.220
Let's see if everything works.

111
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.020
They actually come here and remember the function that

112
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.590
is

113
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:50.500
come back here and test is real quick I'm going to delete all that stuff.

114
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.740
Make sure that you can get it back OK.

115
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.680
So class mail.

116
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.930
Let's see if we can get that class

117
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:03.710
let's go here.

118
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.820
Back

119
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.920
we are actually oh we're missing this.

120
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:27.450
We don't do this because we're not using this anymore we're using everything from composers so composers

121
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.330
is function call autoload.

122
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.410
That just makes everything work.

123
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.800
So now enter here.

124
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:34.690
Whoops.

125
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.240
Let's go back require a vendor order.

126
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.380
This should work.

127
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.280
Let's dump autoload again.

128
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.320
As refresh.

129
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:53.810
I don't know where I'm getting that

130
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.880
hopes Whoops.

131
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.240
Whoops Whoops there we go.

132
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.670
OK.

133
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.240
So as you can see it is working.

134
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:19.650
Now if I want to get the other class and I can check that out too and sample and new words all we can

135
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.750
come back here.

136
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.190
I know I misspelled the guys.

137
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.180
I know that.

138
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.430
Let's come back here and less.

139
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.690
And you can see that I get that class as well.

140
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.460
So no more requiring because composers doing everything for us.

141
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.160
Super cool stuff.

142
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.120
So I'm just going to do all this.

143
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.920
Oops.

144
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.460
You know what

145
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.310
dangerous dangerous.

146
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.290
Let's make sure everything works.

147
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:53.870
OK.

148
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.360
So I'm.

149
00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.450
Let's go to the home page

150
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.230
here.

151
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.100
Of course

152
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:10.960
I would go

153
00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:28.800
really looks like he was like he worked as you can see everything is working perfectly.

154
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.960
Now you learn something really valuable OK.

155
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:36.610
Now every time you put a class inside these classes for their composers is going to map it.

156
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.950
It's going to require that class or that way every time you want to use any classes that you have in

157
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.340
this folder or you have to those include this file right here.

158
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.750
This cloud is function or this file or a node anywhere require you class.

159
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.910
Pretty cool stuff.

160
00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.310
And remember that we also learned how to set this character set.

161
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.120
I think it was a very good lesson for you guys.

162
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.580
I hope you appreciate it don't fall asleep on the classes.

163
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.130
Right.

164
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.110
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
