00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:01.750
Hi welcome back my students.

2

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:07.310
This is Ed from the future and I know many of you are not going to go and finishes Hoek course you're

3

00:00:07.340  -->  00:00:10.710
just going to learn what you need to learn and then you're going to go ahead and try to launch this

4

00:00:10.710  -->  00:00:11.740
project online.

5

00:00:11.880  -->  00:00:15.070
I want you to know something before you launch this project on line.

6

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:17.070
You need to scape your data.

7

00:00:17.280  -->  00:00:23.850
You need to test against my SU oil injection and we talk about this I believe right now on lecture 235

8

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:28.520
in the course is called more security you are able micro injection protection.

9

00:00:28.530  -->  00:00:33.180
All right that's a lecture and it might be a little bit more further if I keep adding lectures but just

10

00:00:33.180  -->  00:00:37.530
look for more security section and you're going to find that I talk about you all injection in this

11

00:00:37.530  -->  00:00:38.190
course.

12

00:00:38.190  -->  00:00:44.640
Now when I first build this course this course this course was very small so we didn't we didn't discuss

13

00:00:44.640  -->  00:00:50.980
too much about scaping every value what I wanted to do was show you everything about BHB and then applied

14

00:00:51.000  -->  00:00:52.290
to a practical project.

15

00:00:52.290  -->  00:00:53.210
So we did that.

16

00:00:53.400  -->  00:00:59.790
But now because it probably got so huge and we didn't talk about injection there's a lot of people launching

17

00:00:59.790  -->  00:01:02.970
this project online when this probably was not meant to be online.

18

00:01:02.970  -->  00:01:07.800
All right so before you go online we're going to build this function that is going to scale all the

19

00:01:07.800  -->  00:01:09.360
data in our project.

20

00:01:09.450  -->  00:01:14.660
That way we are safe from a secure injection from people trying to hack into our application and we

21

00:01:14.670  -->  00:01:16.310
raised our information right.

22

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:17.650
So let's go ahead and do that.

23

00:01:17.670  -->  00:01:20.260
It's got to be a very simple function.

24

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:25.330
You're going to see we're going to call it escape.

25

00:01:25.350  -->  00:01:28.800
All right.

26

00:01:28.800  -->  00:01:36.390
So let's do that and we're going to pass in a string like this and we're going to use a built in predefined

27

00:01:36.390  -->  00:01:48.720
function from BHB my Eskew a live real escape string and we're going to use this so that way we can

28

00:01:48.720  -->  00:01:50.930
scale the data.

29

00:01:51.130  -->  00:01:51.990
All right.

30

00:01:52.500  -->  00:01:55.330
And then we can pass in the string here.

31

00:01:55.350  -->  00:02:00.900
But what we're going to do with this is that we can trim the string and use this function treatment

32

00:02:02.760  -->  00:02:10.190
or we can strip the tax out of it if you have some type of mail.

33

00:02:10.200  -->  00:02:11.920
But we've got to leave it like this trim it.

34

00:02:12.030  -->  00:02:12.300
All right.

35

00:02:12.300  -->  00:02:13.920
That should be enough.

36

00:02:13.920  -->  00:02:17.890
You can of course do this trip tax.

37

00:02:17.900  -->  00:02:18.870
All right.

38

00:02:19.290  -->  00:02:24.600
If you won if that doesn't work out for you just try the trim.

39

00:02:24.650  -->  00:02:25.390
All right.

40

00:02:25.500  -->  00:02:31.120
So it should be something like this and then we're just going to return it like this.

41

00:02:31.120  -->  00:02:31.470
All right.

42

00:02:31.470  -->  00:02:35.790
And then of course we need a global connection there to get access to our

43

00:02:40.620  -->  00:02:43.680
easy access to our connection.

44

00:02:44.670  -->  00:02:45.790
That's what we need right here.

45

00:02:45.900  -->  00:02:51.340
So now every time we need to put a we need to answer a query or go into the database.

46

00:02:51.360  -->  00:02:58.280
Let's for example let's say right here where I used this function like this.

47

00:02:58.280  -->  00:03:02.100
All right and you scape your title and as a matter of fact I'm going to do this.

48

00:03:02.130  -->  00:03:05.020
So that way doesn't mess around with the e-mail tags.

49

00:03:05.070  -->  00:03:07.380
I'm going to take this trip out.

50

00:03:07.940  -->  00:03:10.240
Oh I was just going to trim the data too.

51

00:03:10.630  -->  00:03:11.680
All right.

52

00:03:11.860  -->  00:03:18.290
So every time you want to clean this before it goes into the database you add this functionality there

53

00:03:18.330  -->  00:03:24.500
scape this function that we go and you escape all your data down here.

54

00:03:24.510  -->  00:03:28.980
That's coming from the form and you do this to your user.

55

00:03:28.980  -->  00:03:29.580
All right.

56

00:03:29.580  -->  00:03:35.390
Any way you have a database even right here.

57

00:03:35.460  -->  00:03:38.360
Are you scaped this.

58

00:03:39.330  -->  00:03:39.850
All right.

59

00:03:39.870  -->  00:03:46.170
Make sure that everywhere you have information that is going inside the database that you gave your

60

00:03:46.170  -->  00:03:52.470
data without function that way you are safe from my secure injection you see that everywhere we have

61

00:03:52.790  -->  00:03:57.460
where is your right.

62

00:03:58.050  -->  00:04:01.430
Specially right here and you will post.

63

00:04:01.440  -->  00:04:02.550
All right.

64

00:04:03.300  -->  00:04:07.760
We go into the database many times make sure those boxes are clean.

65

00:04:07.830  -->  00:04:08.380
All right.

66

00:04:08.430  -->  00:04:09.950
Right here pulls data.

67

00:04:09.960  -->  00:04:13.380
Clean them up and you should be good to go.

68

00:04:13.380  -->  00:04:14.160
To go on line.

69

00:04:14.160  -->  00:04:14.550
Right

70

00:04:17.940  -->  00:04:19.090
right here as well.

71

00:04:19.250  -->  00:04:19.670
OK.

72

00:04:19.680  -->  00:04:23.520
I'm going to be doing this to the final project files.

73

00:04:23.520  -->  00:04:26.330
Boy you should be taking care of this yourself before you go online.

74

00:04:26.360  -->  00:04:26.910
Right.

75

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:31.950
So that way you hackers can get into your account and delete the data.

76

00:04:31.950  -->  00:04:34.070
All right thank you so much for watching this.

77

00:04:34.080  -->  00:04:37.650
Hopefully this will help some of you out there before launching this thing online.

78

00:04:37.650  -->  00:04:38.100
Take care
