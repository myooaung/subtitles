1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,430
All right so we got a lot of functionality here already we can add categories.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,840
We are reading it and we can delete them.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,720
Now let's go ahead and of functionality to edit the categories right.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,480
So what we want to do is add another form.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,340
Let's copy this form right here.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,530
All right.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,500
Once we copy it then we go here and see it in action right there.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,870
Well actually it's not in action yet but he will be so high.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,340
So this is a couple of things here.

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,850
First let's change it edit this name the value name let's change this name also here.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,230
And it actually let's call this update.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,980
Why not.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,760
Because that's what we're going to be doing updating right.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,310
All right.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,710
So I think we're good here and the next thing is just to create a BHB.

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,030
All right.

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,260
So just to let you know what we will be doing right now is adding a link right here on the right hand

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,590
side.

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,320
So if you want to post a video try that on your own you can.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,460
We're going to add a Edit link and when we click it we're going to be able to echo the values from this

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,870
site here.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,910
And then when we click here it's going to update it.

23
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,580
All right.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,970
All right so let's do that.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:25,450
So let's open a BHB tag and of course it's going to take me all the way to the right.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,870
Love that right.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,150
Love that.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,040
Let's make a.

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,580
As a matter of fact we do have this square down here when I use that instead.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,440
There's this whole thing here.

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,050
Why are we writing stuff down again.

32
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,820
When we have it here.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
Perfect.

34
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,010
Great thing about copy and pasting right.

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,130
So we're going to edit a couple of things here so we're going to select categories where why ID.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,520
It's a matter of fact before we do that before we get we getting ahead of ourselves we need to add the

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,650
little link right.

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,270
So let's copy this and paste it like to do a lot of copy and paste.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,170
It says a lot of time don't you think.

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:12,900
I know you think so let's change the parameter that we're sending the key of D get super global which

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,690
is going to be added now and that change the link right here at it.

42
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,440
Right.

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,510
So we're going to have to catch it here right.

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:32,810
So we're going to say if it's set and what it is is set get what.

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,330
What was the name of it again.

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,430
The key at it.

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,980
That's right.

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,240
You got it right.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,290
All right.

50
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:46,570
So I said we want to do all these squaring all this great stuff that we're doing right here right.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,890
All right perfect.

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,670
So we want to catch up make sure you catch it right here cat and name it something else right.

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,160
Put the variable to get a value.

54
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,230
So that way we can see the value in a more flexible way I think a variable would do fine for us.

55
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:14,490
So we're going to say where can idea which is a column in the database in the Categories table equals

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,580
what can you post a video and guess and think a little bit.

57
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,380
Got ID right here.

58
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:21,710
All right.

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,790
Just to get requests variable there.

60
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,420
Perfect.

61
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:33,410
So let's change this a little bit and let's call this what you want to call it select categories or

62
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,160
no ID that's fine.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,760
We want to make a little different right because we already had these very well down there and we don't

64
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,830
want it to conflict with anything.

65
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,940
All right so this resoled is going to come here.

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,040
And once we have this what do we want to do we need to echo something out but we need to break out of

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,320
this loop here so we can put some mail.

68
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:04,430
We need to make sure that we catch that right here before we have some arrows here.

69
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,120
Right.

70
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,770
Make sure you catch that BHP opening right here just to get this BHB curly bracket.

71
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:17,770
The reason we did that is because we wanted this whole piece inside the loop of the amount right.

72
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,990
And here we're going to have to make a.

73
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,580
This is where this value here is where we're going to put the we're going to be echoing the value from

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,930
the table right right here on this value at you.

75
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,040
So what we want to do is if set actually.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,590
Let's do some PSP here.

77
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,950
We're not in ph period.

78
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,030
I forgot.

79
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,560
So BHB let's close it down and we are ready to raise one pitch.

80
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,130
So if it's set

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,100
we want to get actually the cat title.

82
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,800
That's what we want to check for.

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,290
If it's then we want it if it's set we want to echo title.

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,020
All right.

85
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,950
Hopefully we get some arrows and this time I don't want to get it perfect all the time is fun right.

86
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,160
All right.

87
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,860
So if you think having errors in your code is fun make a discussion and let me know right.

88
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,990
I think it's fun but that's just my opinion.

89
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,640
You have your own opinion.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,260
All right so let's see.

91
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,710
Let's check this one more time here.

92
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,620
Make sure that I think we're good.

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,470
I think we're good.

94
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,390
What do you think.

95
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,810
Right we might have a mistake or two out of I not even want.

96
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,330
I don't even want to check right now because I want to have some type of mistake in our code.

97
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:45,380
Guess we're missing something all right so why can we possibly be missing.

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,680
And it isn't.

99
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,880
All right so we have we are missing.

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,450
Unexpected.

101
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,020
You and line a 7.

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,370
What could that be.

103
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:58,920
All right.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
Real mistake really well right.

105
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,590
So the reason how come my can't be that easy can be that easy.

106
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,730
Now we go and the file on my 98.

107
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,370
Yes.

108
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,710
So we are now close in something great.

109
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,880
So bump bump.

110
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:31,280
If this set AGCO this and it can be that easy either I might make a little harder make a little right.

111
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,860
So anyways if we click on edit then we get the added value right here.

112
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,450
We click on edit again we get the bootstrap but we king of data right now we can do that because we

113
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,290
haven't actually made the query for that yet.

114
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,460
I know I know I know we have to make the query lead for another Viti What do you think.

115
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,130
I think this is we are already getting too long for this.

116
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,190
So anyways I'll see your next lecture.

117
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,250
And it was a pleasure like always.

118
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,220
And we're going to be doing some other techniques because I don't want this bunch there to be on this

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,900
forum like this.

120
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,190
I don't want to be there.

121
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,880
So we're going to be exploring.

122
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,260
We're going to be importing this form or another place in our CMF system.

123
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,850
So that way every time we click it it appears here we will not see anything in the beginning just like

124
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,470
we did in the Demel demonstration.

125
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,180
Right so I'll see your next lecture and take care
