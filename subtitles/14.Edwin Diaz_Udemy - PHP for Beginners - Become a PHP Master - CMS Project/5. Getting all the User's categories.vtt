00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.760
Hey guys I hope you guys are really enjoying the course.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.050
And you know if you like what you see here that I keep adding material and you know keep learning you

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.540
know don't forget to go and make a review for the course that will help me lie motivate me even more

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240
to make more features for you guys.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.050
Remember these are requests from users.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.660
So you made a request and now I'm doing it.

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.060
So it's worth it guys.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.320
It takes work.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.750
So let's get going here.

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.210
One of the things that I want to do is go go back to the next spots that we're working on users now

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.660
for you know our personal data for a regular subscriber we don't use this box here.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.920
We don't have that.

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
So let's take it off.

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.190
OK.

15
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.520
So ongoing two way says users I'm going to take that off completely now but when I do that if I refresh

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.560
it's going to break my stuff is going to break my chart.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.950
And the reason why he's going to do that is because now this number's very we'll see are not available.

18
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.910
So going to take this subscriber in the user count variables and going to take their names out.

19
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.340
And I'm going to make sure that I did my loop because now we are showing 6 instead of 8.

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.320
And that shoe fits it yeah.

21
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.280
There we go.

22
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:38.160
And those boxes are kind of small it's making bigger So let's go in history here let's make it for let's

23
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.960
make this four and let's make this four for now we will back and we refresh.

24
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.850
That should be better.

25
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.510
Now four categories.

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.070
We don't have some type we don't have an ID for categories.

27
00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:00.170
If I go back here and I click on categories we can see that categories don't have anything that we can

28
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.660
you know the tech that they belong to the user.

29
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.150
Why don't we add something to it.

30
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.980
Let's add another table called Let's make it after the card ID and you are going to make this bigger

31
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.050
so you can see what I'm doing.

32
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.320
So that's going to be after that I'm going to call this user id just like that.

33
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.670
And that's it not the big now.

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.720
If I go back to those those categories I can insert a user id I'm going to say twenty eight and one

35
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.930
is going to belong to a different user Maria.

36
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.920
And they're doing OK.

37
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.800
OK.

38
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.790
So now let's graph this.

39
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.780
From here let's plug it in.

40
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.720
Right here and it's safe function.

41
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.840
I was going to say funky

42
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:09.690
get all ears or categories to ragwort go

43
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.030
and we're going to be doing something very similar.

44
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.960
This right here so from category's it's just simpler to like that.

45
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.200
And

46
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.350
we don't even need to copy that right.

47
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.560
Let's go back here and let's just say I think I think it was called category count

48
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.910
down the records on

49
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.180
this like that.

50
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.160
Hopefully that's what it is.

51
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.090
We come back here we're fresh.

52
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.600
Let's make this smaller.

53
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.830
You can see that I use as one category.

54
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.110
OK.

55
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.660
Because that's what we did here.

56
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:17.210
If that's the uses the slogan is if I give him another one I should say so now.

57
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.380
I would go to guys every time you see the page refresh on do with my keyboard just think as you think

58
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.450
this is like a live refresh.

59
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.620
You know it's not as command our control.

60
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.340
OK.

61
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.820
Now we need to jump to the next charts right here OK.

62
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.410
So we they're going to do that and that's lecture's try to do it yourself.

63
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.420
Guys try to do what I'm doing and see if you can do a couple yourself.

64
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.610
So you in the next lecture.
