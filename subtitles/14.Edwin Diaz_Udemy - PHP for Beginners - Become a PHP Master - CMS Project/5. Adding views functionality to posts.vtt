00:00:00.480  -->  00:00:05.940
Hi welcome back my students in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to keep track of the views

2

00:00:05.940  -->  00:00:08.720
that each of your posts is getting.

3

00:00:08.720  -->  00:00:09.170
All right.

4

00:00:09.270  -->  00:00:13.370
So we're going to be able to keep track of that by doing so and ask you all statements.

5

00:00:13.380  -->  00:00:16.990
Now some of you already figure out a way of doing this some of you have not.

6

00:00:17.010  -->  00:00:21.840
And I'm doing this because somebody requested this and I figure it was a good idea to do so I'm going

7

00:00:21.840  -->  00:00:23.350
to show you a way of doing it.

8

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:27.120
Even though there are many different ways you could actually do it right.

9

00:00:27.210  -->  00:00:30.910
It's just going to give you more knowledge on what to do and how to be more creative.

10

00:00:30.930  -->  00:00:33.550
And and you know how to actually make it better.

11

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:34.200
All right.

12

00:00:34.200  -->  00:00:35.250
Make everything better.

13

00:00:35.460  -->  00:00:40.960
So the first thing that we need to actually do is create a column inside our database.

14

00:00:41.410  -->  00:00:43.110
All right our table.

15

00:00:43.110  -->  00:00:44.490
So let's go to our table.

16

00:00:44.500  -->  00:00:47.570
Let's go to puls All right.

17

00:00:47.940  -->  00:00:53.640
And it is going to structure and right after poll status or whatever you got on the last column here

18

00:00:53.790  -->  00:00:58.740
just create another column and just call it polls.

19

00:00:58.740  -->  00:01:00.530
I don't know whatever you want to call it for you.

20

00:01:00.540  -->  00:01:07.680
I'm going to call it pulls you accounts or post views count.

21

00:01:07.920  -->  00:01:10.930
I'm going to set it to an integer of 11 there.

22

00:01:10.950  -->  00:01:12.340
All right so now we're done with that.

23

00:01:12.410  -->  00:01:19.020
The next step is open your posts that PH BE IN HERE.

24

00:01:19.020  -->  00:01:22.000
One thing that I won't actually do here just to make this a little better.

25

00:01:22.110  -->  00:01:27.930
I got to take this curly brackets that close to this set right here and you're going to take it out

26

00:01:27.930  -->  00:01:28.260
of here.

27

00:01:28.280  -->  00:01:34.170
Command and control it depending on the operating system you are going all the way down and put it together

28

00:01:34.170  -->  00:01:36.480
where this ends right here.

29

00:01:36.500  -->  00:01:36.810
Right.

30

00:01:36.810  -->  00:01:42.240
And what I'm going to do is that we don't want to receive anybody here that is not support that doesn't

31

00:01:42.240  -->  00:01:44.590
have a port ID right.

32

00:01:44.880  -->  00:01:52.950
So we'll create a statement here and just redirect whoever comes here to the end if they don't have

33

00:01:53.520  -->  00:01:57.110
a false ID.

34

00:01:57.120  -->  00:02:00.000
All right that's what this little piece of code is going to do.

35

00:02:00.470  -->  00:02:00.870
All right.

36

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:05.060
And of course we're not going to ask you anything unless we have a pulse ID.

37

00:02:05.070  -->  00:02:05.430
Right.

38

00:02:05.430  -->  00:02:07.400
So that's a very good thing to do.

39

00:02:07.410  -->  00:02:10.570
Make sure that you wrap everything around this if set anyway.

40

00:02:10.620  -->  00:02:17.550
So the next step is what we want to do and I already wrote this code and I'm just going to copy paste

41

00:02:17.550  -->  00:02:18.630
it here and splain it to you.

42

00:02:18.630  -->  00:02:25.290
We're creating another day a statement and we are updating the polls view counts and I think you actually

43

00:02:25.620  -->  00:02:27.120
put another name on it.

44

00:02:27.270  -->  00:02:32.370
I think I put a nest right here supposed views count within a set.

45

00:02:32.370  -->  00:02:38.250
So we're going to set this post view counts to the simple counts plus one.

46

00:02:38.410  -->  00:02:38.790
Right.

47

00:02:38.880  -->  00:02:46.260
So basically what this is going to do is actually increment this column here every time we execute the

48

00:02:46.260  -->  00:02:46.970
code.

49

00:02:47.070  -->  00:02:53.700
Every time we find this right every time we have an idea every time we visit or visit the page or anything

50

00:02:53.940  -->  00:02:59.190
and we get to increment that where the post ID equals a post ID of course because we want to do it specifically

51

00:02:59.190  -->  00:03:04.710
for this for this specific post right then we'll send them the information with the query and we can

52

00:03:04.710  -->  00:03:08.970
even do a check just to make sure that everything is working right.

53

00:03:09.030  -->  00:03:15.040
We could just go ahead and do a check right here make sure that this query works right.

54

00:03:15.180  -->  00:03:20.190
And then we'll come here we'll check that column right now and we see that everything is zero right

55

00:03:20.190  -->  00:03:21.080
now.

56

00:03:21.570  -->  00:03:28.050
So we're going to try first post with the 64 act and that's the first one in my side.

57

00:03:28.050  -->  00:03:32.610
All right so let's go to this visit that's the I'm sorry about that.

58

00:03:32.850  -->  00:03:35.920
Let's go to local host for a slushy mess.

59

00:03:35.940  -->  00:03:36.940
In my case.

60

00:03:37.190  -->  00:03:37.660
OK.

61

00:03:37.680  -->  00:03:39.550
I went to 65 by mistake.

62

00:03:39.540  -->  00:03:40.810
All right let's check on that.

63

00:03:41.460  -->  00:03:48.850
And let's refresh and see here that incremented to one.

64

00:03:48.870  -->  00:03:50.580
So let's go ahead and try a couple more times.

65

00:03:50.580  -->  00:03:54.240
Let's try some other polls are going to try.

66

00:03:54.240  -->  00:03:55.290
Sixty four.

67

00:03:55.290  -->  00:04:00.990
I'm going to refresh for a couple of times a couple of times a couple of times and then I go back I'm

68

00:04:00.980  -->  00:04:07.160
going to try both 67 and a fresh one time and that's it.

69

00:04:07.180  -->  00:04:12.120
Now I'm going to come here refresh and I'm going to go and show you what happened.

70

00:04:12.300  -->  00:04:19.400
So here you could see that I visited that four times four times one time and twice here.

71

00:04:19.410  -->  00:04:19.770
All right.

72

00:04:19.770  -->  00:04:21.340
So he's working he's incrementing.

73

00:04:21.360  -->  00:04:26.960
Now one thing that I want to warn you about is that you also might want to build functionality.

74

00:04:26.970  -->  00:04:30.900
We can do it right now but I'm going to show you how to display this first.

75

00:04:30.950  -->  00:04:32.170
And you should know how to do that.

76

00:04:32.410  -->  00:04:38.010
But one of my one to Bill of functionality here in the edit polls so that well you can just set that

77

00:04:38.040  -->  00:04:39.120
count every time.

78

00:04:39.120  -->  00:04:45.090
Basically you build a function where you can just click a button and died and you were reset that specific

79

00:04:45.090  -->  00:04:47.330
column in that specific table.

80

00:04:47.340  -->  00:04:52.500
Right now I want to use display here just because because it looks nice.

81

00:04:52.560  -->  00:05:01.080
So let's go to you on the score all polls and let's go to where we are using this table headings this

82

00:05:01.080  -->  00:05:02.580
table right here right.

83

00:05:02.610  -->  00:05:08.610
We're going to pull that specific let's put that aside.

84

00:05:08.760  -->  00:05:13.490
When I pull that specific column pause views count.

85

00:05:13.870  -->  00:05:17.080
If you don't spell it correctly of course it's not going to work.

86

00:05:17.080  -->  00:05:19.910
Know right because we are referring to the column right.

87

00:05:19.950  -->  00:05:27.550
So let's just play this down here by doing another ekal.

88

00:05:27.790  -->  00:05:28.760
All right.

89

00:05:29.640  -->  00:05:40.030
So see the face that variable and A.D again to close it I just pull my curly brackets around the like

90

00:05:40.060  -->  00:05:45.910
it differentiates the variable from the string right from the extreme elements.

91

00:05:45.960  -->  00:05:49.090
We'll come here refresh and we have an arrow you see that.

92

00:05:49.150  -->  00:05:51.910
That's because I enclose it here semi-colon.

93

00:05:51.930  -->  00:05:54.440
There we go.

94

00:05:54.480  -->  00:05:56.690
All right so now we see everything is zero here.

95

00:05:56.690  -->  00:06:03.220
But if we go all the way down you see the post count right here are 1 and 4 right.

96

00:06:03.240  -->  00:06:08.810
So that's an easy way of actually keeping track of whatever polls he's getting visiter on.

97

00:06:08.850  -->  00:06:10.410
If you put this on line or something.

98

00:06:10.410  -->  00:06:10.970
All right.

99

00:06:11.130  -->  00:06:13.350
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

100

00:06:13.350  -->  00:06:18.210
And we might Bill another function where we can delete it and make a bun right.

101

00:06:18.510  -->  00:06:22.440
And just like I was telling you right here to delete if you want to take that as a challenge go ahead

102

00:06:22.440  -->  00:06:23.770
and try to do that.

103

00:06:23.820  -->  00:06:24.400
All right.

104

00:06:24.570  -->  00:06:26.380
I think it's going to be pretty fun to do.

105

00:06:26.580  -->  00:06:28.990
Take care and I'll see you in the next lecture.
