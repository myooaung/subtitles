00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.740
All right so we got our contact page almost done.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.900
We need to clean it up a little bit and make sure that all the information there is good before we upload

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.680
it to the server.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.170
Right.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.040
So I hope that you are having some fun because this is some fun stuff that we're learning.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.850
All right.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.860
So on the subject line here I notice that I've put a left email there and I pasted it.

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.870
Let me change it to tÃªtes.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.250
Let's make sure they actually is empty.

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.220
What else will we need.

11
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.390
Let's say all we need to clean this up a little bit so let's just take all this out of all these code.

12
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.860
Whoops.

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.760
Leave some of those variables there.

14
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.660
All right.

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.160
So got to leave it like this here.

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.040
All right.

17
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.850
We're going to have the two variable we are going to have a subject variable and we are also going to

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.270
have a body variable.

19
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.210
All right.

20
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.100
Let me just put this here.

21
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.810
We are also so we have to this.

22
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.150
This is where we're going to be putting Actually our e-mail address in the mail function.

23
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.790
So we had it.

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.780
We're going to have a string.

25
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.450
We our e-mail address here support that when ideas come and I'm just going to put this here for now

26
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.010
and later on.

27
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.970
I'm going explain to you to you some more about a malfunction how it works and the subject we're going

28
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.100
to bring the subject from the forum and we're also going to be in the body.

29
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.990
All right.

30
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.430
So you got to leave it like this.

31
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.160
And the rest.

32
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.470
And we're going to do it on line.

33
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.960
So right now let's see this.

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.790
Let's go to our server on line and let's go to our root directory whatever you have your application.

35
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.560
I have it on this folder.

36
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:54.180
I'm gonna overload that contact page so I'm going to choose the dugs mass and the contact page should

37
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.290
be around here somewhere.

38
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.950
There we go.

39
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.320
Perfect.

40
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.830
That should be there somewhere if we refresh your mess.

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.410
Now the contact page is here.

42
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.700
Now let's check to see if it is working on our site.

43
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.900
So I'm going to see gold actually doing cold's not called school.

44
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:32.200
That's my other web site called College com right and see a mass contact center.

45
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.200
Whoops.

46
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.270
See a miss contact that BHP.

47
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.380
Oops there we go.

48
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.700
All right.

49
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.390
That's some other Web site that I'm building there and another project I got for people that want to

50
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.220
learn how to make dynamic web sites with no coding.

51
00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.240
So that's a war press corps that I got but anyway so now we got a form that is working here the next

52
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.160
step would be to add in the

53
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.110
navigation right here right.

54
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.800
So let's go into that.

55
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:16.590
Let's go to our panel right now and let's go to our navigation right.

56
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.250
So this is in let's go back.

57
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.670
Should be actually in the room there or somewhere here includes a navigation.

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.250
So here let's call this one here if I remember correctly.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.340
Should be here somewhere and registration and admin perfit So right after this.

60
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.030

All right.

66
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.160
Now you can see that in this context.

67
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.890
I'm going to go to the BHB category here but if I go to contact.

68
