00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,900
Hi welcome back my dear students.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:09,680
So in this lecture I'm going to show you what we need in order for us to run GHB in our computer.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,030
Now we can.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,320
I'm using a Mac right here.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,080
But this is going to apply to Windows users or Linux users.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,760
OK.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,380
So this is a Mac computer right now.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,800
And I'm going to go to Google and I'm going to type in zap.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:25,630
OK.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,250
Zap.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:35,140
Is this tool OK this software that has a stack a stack is a program that has or some type of package

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,850
that has different technologies include it that work together to accomplish something.

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:50,140
In this case Zeb has Apache Maria DP for databases BHP and pro this are that stack for them.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,480
And this is what we need in order for us to run BHP successfully in our computer.

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,160
So this is going to mimic OK a server in as you know in the clouds.

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,220
For example if you're going to go or go Daddy dot com or any other hosting provider they will have a

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,850
hosting servers that allows you to run BHP applications.

18
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,690
So these zap here is going to be that software behind the scenes in our computers that is going to allow

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:25,750
us to have the technologies that are that allows us to use BHP.

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,770
OK.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,380
So we download it but I don't want you to just go here to any of these links and download it like a

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,390
few using windows here.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,920
This is the right link for you if you're using limits.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,690
This is the right link for you and if using OS This is not the right link for you if you use a Mac OS.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,420
The reason is because you have this VM here virtual machine you don't want to download anything like

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:54,070
that so click on download and then look for you the latest version of Zap.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:01,450
In my case a seven point three but you might have a point to nine depending on the year and the time

28
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,450
you might have a later version than what I have here.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,040
But download the latest version for Windows they only have 32 bit so download that off limits.

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:19,260
They have the same point three download the 64 bit if you have a 64 bit machine right and you should.

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:29,520
And for Mac OS they have two versions the regular versions without the VM OK right here on top and the

32
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,060
virtual machine versions you need to download the regular ones.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,830
This is the latest right here seven point three.

34
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,680
In my case just click on Download OK and you got to see this is going to start downloading down here.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,110
Now while this is downloading let me show you another tool just in case you run into program problems

36
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,720
with zap because not everybody gets a smooth installation.

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,280
If you run into any problems there is another tool called map.

38
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,640
OK.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,130
And it's basically the same thing as a stack as a package as a stack to run PSP on your computer and

40
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,380
he's going to detect if you have a Windows or Mac computer or limits and then going to give you the

41
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,210
link.

42
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,520
OK.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,100
This this one's a little different when downloading because we don't deal too much with virtual machines

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,790
but if we click on free download here he's gonna take you to this speech and you have a couple options

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,490
download map a man pro 5.2 or download man a month a man pro four point one this is for Windows.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,900
This is for Mac OS.

47
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:35,270
Now in the future all these pages are going to be different.

48
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:35,630
OK.

49
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,740
The main concept here is that you're downloading the regular versions of any of these tools just to

50
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,940
run PSP depending on the system that you're using.

51
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:52,790
Now my installation just finished downloading and that would be nice to know where he went.

52
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,080
I guess it was somewhere down there.

53
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:04,820
I'm just gonna go to my download downloads place where I download everything goes in there I'm just

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,930
gonna click on this

55
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,870
OK and once I have it I just double click it and he's going to ask me or this stuff and he's gonna open

56
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,910
it up and make sure that I put my password.

57
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,740
This is for Mac users for Windows using when I have this.

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,700
You might have to allow it through your firewall or anything like that because these systems they do

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,740
control your computer just a little bit.

60
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,350
Welcome to the set of wizard.

61
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:41,070
I'm just gonna click nets and nets and nets OK and learn more about bitten a bit Nami.

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,770
I don't think so that I don't want and I'm just gonna click nets and nets and that's going to install

63
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,040
it.

64
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,370
OK.

65
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,970
And it's just like any other program on your computer is going to install and then is going to be available

66
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,000
to you in your programs area or like.

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:05,890
Right now let's say you're using a Mac that program is going to be available to me in the applications

68
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,790
area.

69
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:15,140
So if I go all the way down to that sample folder that's where that program is all the files are here.

70
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,850
The manager control panel is here.

71
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,960
So if I double click on this is going to open it up for me OK.

72
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,550
As you can see is on here and I don't use campus as much as I used to.

73
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
But in this cause I am using it.

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,660
And if I click on manage servers this this is where all my servers are right now says that Apache web

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,090
server is running I can stop it.

76
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,920
OK.

77
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:46,290
And all you need is to service to be running to services you need may as well make sure that you click

78
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,370
Start an Apache start.

79
00:05:50,870 --> 00:06:00,040
OK now for map this example gay and this is a very similar.

80
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,950
They're all going to be located in a Mac computer in the Applications folder.

81
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,370
So map would be in the same applications for that bullet we know for the code map and then you have

82
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,380
these HD docs folder.

83
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,250
This is where our projects are going to be located inside there are going to show you that later on.

84
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,600
OK something was EMP HD docs.

85
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,520
OK.

86
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:32,660
So e in the windows computer your map and your zap folders are going to be in your C drive.

87
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
OK.

88
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:42,030
So go to your computer go to your control panel or the file manager wherever you have your you can see

89
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,170
the your computer C drive click on it and you're going to see these folders here.

90
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,240
Zap a map OK.

91
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,520
And inside HD docs is where we are going to be working on make sure.

92
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:02,640
And these programs usually install a icon in here in your desktop so you can double click it and use

93
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,560
your control panel right here.

94
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,240
This.

95
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,800
Ok.

96
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,140
Where's your control panel.

97
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,300
This is for map.

98
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,510
And this is for zap.

99
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,720
Very similar programs.

100
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,150
OK.

101
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,080
The concept here is that you're going to have an Apache server and you got it.

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Just turn it on and you're going to see this light up in here.

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,720
Now this might look different depending on the version that you're downloading.

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:36,010
But the concept is all the same is a program map or zap or programs that allows us to run P.H. being

105
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:43,300
our computers we download them we install them like any program and then we turn on our Apache server

106
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,920
service and it might as well server you see that patch you right here.

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,590
You see my askew out you turn him on start and start for some users.

108
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,580
You're going to have some issues with them because they use port 80 which Skype uses.

109
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,330
OK.

110
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:08,100
So if your your Apache server is not working is because he's using the is using port 80 right here.

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,220
So you might want to change that poor to something else maybe like just put any numbers here.

112
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,480
You can do board 8 8 8 or something like that.

113
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,930
Or maybe 80 80.

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,410
OK.

115
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,670
And then just click it.

116
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,590
And that would change that port for Apache and then you can restart it started again and then that would

117
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:36,580
work that could work for zap if it doesn't work if that gives you a lot of problems.

118
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,860
Just go ahead and use map map is going to take care of that problem for you guys because it's super

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,340
simple to install it but I'm using zap in this course.

120
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,760
So if you want to follow me to the letter you can use AMP and make it work.

121
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,210
OK.

122
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,810
But again just do a word of advice don't download the VM don't do it because it's just it's a little

123
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,700
different.

124
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,270
And he's going to give you issues is more events OK.

125
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,200
Virtual Machine here.

126
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,230
Don't download it for zap or don't download it for any of these programs if they offer it just download

127
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,820
the regular versions.

128
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,800
Zap is what we're using for this course but you are welcome to download map which sometimes is easier

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,540
for some users.

130
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,180
So that's Hey guys thank you so much.

131
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,940
Remember that we are.

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:37,760
We have everything on HD docs folder and in the Zap or map folders and that's where we are going to

133
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,660
be working on.

134
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,290
Now this program's just a word of advice.

135
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:42,860
Let me show you.

136
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,940
These programs have a U or L that we can use to see our applications.

137
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,260
Okay.

138
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,430
Remember that this is acting like a server.

139
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,020
So that dress here for some people is local host.

140
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:02,300
If you're downloading map like that local shows and this is where all your projects are going to be

141
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,870
located and you're not going to see them like this because this is going to redirect you to the opening

142
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,150
page of The Star page right here of map.

143
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,800
Don't worry about it.

144
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,820
That means that you installation went through successfully the same thing with zap.

145
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,210
OK.

146
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,690
ZAM has its own pages in say Europe computer locally.

147
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,730
So way you know that it is working.

148
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,400
So they offer a page are you URL that you can you know access other tools that we're gonna be using

149
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,080
later as you can see this is it says local hosts this is inside your computer.

150
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,180
This is not outside on the Internet.

151
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,940
OK Zam has a very similar approach.

152
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:55,220
If I turn on Apache and I started on and was in screen here I mean she's working right now he's running

153
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:02,240
so if I want to welcome page and I click visit go to application you can see that that's going to open

154
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,450
for me the Zap installation here local host.

155
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:16,420
So this idea is a little different than the map because map for me is local shows 8 8 8 8 and this one

156
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,180
is local host.

157
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,760
OK now remember that this is gone.

158
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,260
I got it.

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
I've got a different setup because I deleted mine.

160
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,270
That's for the applications.

161
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:33,520
So yours is going to redirect you to the start page OK of your program minds is not doing that.

162
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,420
So don't worry about as long as you see something like this like a welcome map has been stored successfully

163
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,860
or zap has been stored successfully once you go to local holes.

164
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,690
You should be good.

165
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,410
Don't worry about it too much here.

166
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,380
We are going to I'm going to go through this later on.

167
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,540
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

168
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,680
Guys take care.

169
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,580
Bye bye.
