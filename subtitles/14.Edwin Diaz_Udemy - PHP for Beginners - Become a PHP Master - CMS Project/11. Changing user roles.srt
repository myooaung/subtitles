1

00:00:01,020  -->  00:00:03,400
All right so I thought about it at home.

2

00:00:03,570  -->  00:00:06,240
We're not going to be doing something too fancy right here.

3

00:00:06,240  -->  00:00:11,300
Basically we're going to do some of the queries and we're going to update the rolls right maybe later

4

00:00:11,300  -->  00:00:16,830
on an extra feature will do something a little faster than this but just for demonstration purposes

5

00:00:16,830  -->  00:00:19,110
and you know we're going to be doing it simple.

6

00:00:19,110  -->  00:00:19,950
All right.

7

00:00:19,950  -->  00:00:26,550
So let's go ahead and pass some parameters to this on a proof and let's change actually and say something

8

00:00:26,550  -->  00:00:33,960
like maybe change me chance to admen.

9

00:00:34,560  -->  00:00:35,200
I don't know.

10

00:00:35,290  -->  00:00:39,720
Something like that's fine and changed to subscriber or something

11

00:00:42,750  -->  00:00:49,330
changed to subscriber stop right.

12

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:50,130
So

13

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:55,730
let's go ahead and name this link.

14

00:00:55,740  -->  00:01:00,580
Actually name it.

15

00:01:01,220  -->  00:01:04,510
It's admen and this describer

16

00:01:07,760  -->  00:01:09,320
subscriber.

17

00:01:09,990  -->  00:01:10,290
All right.

18

00:01:10,320  -->  00:01:13,180
So let's go.

19

00:01:13,800  -->  00:01:19,210
And the first one is this one so let's put that key right here.

20

00:01:19,500  -->  00:01:22,590
Let's put it right here and

21

00:01:25,350  -->  00:01:26,100
just say

22

00:01:32,340  -->  00:01:38,770
what we're going to be passing here is that link right there admin ID or link.

23

00:01:38,790  -->  00:01:42,570
Well is actually the user's ID right.

24

00:01:42,600  -->  00:01:48,560
The user ID that's fine let's just pass the user id here too.

25

00:01:48,690  -->  00:01:50,550
Doesn't really matter.

26

00:01:50,550  -->  00:01:52,200
And of the users

27

00:01:55,080  -->  00:02:02,070
groups set users user what we name that user role

28

00:02:06,660  -->  00:02:14,700
to admin right where user id he calls that Id

29

00:02:19,800  -->  00:02:20,730
user ID.

30

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:21,990
There we go.

31

00:02:21,990  -->  00:02:25,620
I think this should be good admen comment.

32

00:02:25,660  -->  00:02:26,360
Admen

33

00:02:30,120  -->  00:02:41,730
let's just call this change admin Querrey to admin Kohary location users up here should be all right

34

00:02:41,730  -->  00:02:43,140
you should know how to use that.

35

00:02:43,350  -->  00:02:44,100
Do this already.

36

00:02:44,100  -->  00:02:47,210
Since we have done this before.

37

00:02:47,650  -->  00:02:48,060
All right.

38

00:02:48,080  -->  00:02:55,210
I think it is good news or good to me list this first get the idea of a user a here.

39

00:02:55,210  -->  00:03:01,120
All right so lets get to here and possibly get it here too.

40

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:02,810
All right and we can do the other one too.

41

00:03:02,880  -->  00:03:05,570
Since we already did this too fast.

42

00:03:06,300  -->  00:03:12,790
Let's go ahead and change this to what admin Hoopes is directing us to another page.

43

00:03:12,810  -->  00:03:24,450
I think of course its got to be changed to users to now forget that users.

44

00:03:24,510  -->  00:03:34,650
All right so the first one that is working is the admin one and this go to users again and this changes

45

00:03:34,690  -->  00:03:37,750
when you see the changes to admin.

46

00:03:37,770  -->  00:03:38,660
All right.

47

00:03:38,760  -->  00:03:42,360
So let's go into the next one since we did it so fast.

48

00:03:42,360  -->  00:03:42,920
Right.

49

00:03:43,170  -->  00:03:43,840
So that's.

50

00:03:43,890  -->  00:03:54,210
The key for us change to sub and let's right here right.

51

00:03:54,450  -->  00:03:59,220
Right here and the user id has changed.

52

00:03:59,370  -->  00:04:01,700
Its a matter of fact which you get all this right here

53

00:04:04,260  -->  00:04:04,750
is

54

00:04:08,040  -->  00:04:09,530
actually just a query

55

00:04:14,070  -->  00:04:18,350
and change this to subscriber.

56

00:04:20,160  -->  00:04:30,000
I think that it was a rule that said that right there and changed to the sub query right here.

57

00:04:30,000  -->  00:04:30,900
Perfect.

58

00:04:31,060  -->  00:04:32,920
Let's let's check that out now.

59

00:04:32,930  -->  00:04:33,490
All right.

60

00:04:33,720  -->  00:04:38,580
So let's go and refresh this subscriber.

61

00:04:39,060  -->  00:04:45,600
Whoops I misspelled something lets you make sure that these IDs is being sent right is being sent to

62

00:04:45,600  -->  00:04:54,690
the left and the left side and let's check it out that she was wrong where user id Eco's the user id

63

00:04:54,750  -->  00:04:55,140
right here.

64

00:04:55,140  -->  00:04:57,650
This is what happened.

65

00:04:57,930  -->  00:04:59,750
Comment Id put in there.

66

00:04:59,790  -->  00:05:01,500
We left it there.

67

00:05:01,650  -->  00:05:02,780
Make sure you change that.

68

00:05:02,790  -->  00:05:06,240
I should just copy everything I refresh.

69

00:05:06,480  -->  00:05:07,470
Subscriber.

70

00:05:07,470  -->  00:05:08,020
There we go.

71

00:05:08,070  -->  00:05:08,890
Subscriber.

72

00:05:08,950  -->  00:05:12,000
Well we don't want to may recall suave.

73

00:05:12,240  -->  00:05:12,800
This was great.

74

00:05:12,800  -->  00:05:13,410
All right.

75

00:05:13,740  -->  00:05:15,660
So perfect.

76

00:05:15,660  -->  00:05:18,270
All right so we kill two birds in one shot.

77

00:05:18,720  -->  00:05:19,860
Thank you so much for watching.

78

00:05:19,860  -->  00:05:24,330
