00:00:00,580  -->  00:00:02,150
Hi welcome back on this video here.

2

00:00:02,220  -->  00:00:06,930
We are going to be learning about constructor's and you might be asking what is constructed what is

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:07,430
that word.

4

00:00:07,430  -->  00:00:11,050
And when I heard it before I maybe you probably never heard it before right.

5

00:00:11,160  -->  00:00:17,100
But well constructors are just methods and methods that would do something when we create an instance

6

00:00:17,190  -->  00:00:18,050
of a class.

7

00:00:18,180  -->  00:00:22,450
As long as we as soon as we create an instance it would do something for us.

8

00:00:22,530  -->  00:00:24,840
Now it's actually easier for me to show you.

9

00:00:24,840  -->  00:00:30,940
So let's go ahead and open our coeditor and let's create a save as this will save us from class on the

10

00:00:31,320  -->  00:00:34,190
scorecard 3 that BHB.

11

00:00:34,250  -->  00:00:34,530
All right.

12

00:00:34,530  -->  00:00:44,140
So right here let's make this constructor class on the score constructor for that we go now and you

13

00:00:44,150  -->  00:00:46,000
can delete a couple things out of here.

14

00:00:46,000  -->  00:00:53,210
This method right here actually I leave that one and only the one underneath and then I delete all this

15

00:00:53,210  -->  00:00:55,780
is does is it calls.

16

00:00:55,870  -->  00:00:56,500
All right.

17

00:00:56,700  -->  00:00:58,950
So what I want to do is I'm going to take this off.

18

00:00:58,980  -->  00:01:06,050
I'm going to actually comment this out and I'm going to show you on the screen here on the browser there

19

00:01:06,050  -->  00:01:07,990
is nothing there showing for this.

20

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:11,200
Now how do I make a constructor.

21

00:01:11,430  -->  00:01:12,870
Well very simple.

22

00:01:12,990  -->  00:01:16,980
Let's just take this out there underscore twice.

23

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:19,960
And the keyword construct.

24

00:01:19,990  -->  00:01:20,640
All right.

25

00:01:20,640  -->  00:01:27,840
This is going to make a constructor anes going to execute this every time we create a new instance.

26

00:01:27,840  -->  00:01:34,320
Now I just want to echo so you can see it now and going to as you can see there's nothing here even

27

00:01:34,320  -->  00:01:40,280
if I say refresh but once I create a new instance which is going to be this one I save the file.

28

00:01:40,290  -->  00:01:45,170
You can see that that created executed is automatically.

29

00:01:45,170  -->  00:01:47,310
All right equity's automatically on the screen.

30

00:01:47,310  -->  00:01:49,040
So look what's happening now.

31

00:01:49,050  -->  00:01:56,260
If I go ahead and create another instance and it's called this truck we get another one.

32

00:01:56,640  -->  00:01:57,740
Let's create another one.

33

00:01:57,780  -->  00:01:59,460
Just keep doing it.

34

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:03,270
And it's called it's mine.

35

00:02:04,320  -->  00:02:09,120
Every time we create a new instance this construct gets executed.

36

00:02:09,120  -->  00:02:12,300
Now you might be asking so why in the world do I need this.

37

00:02:12,300  -->  00:02:12,700
Why.

38

00:02:12,720  -->  00:02:16,880
Well sometimes we need to do certain functions before we execute a program.

39

00:02:16,890  -->  00:02:22,650
For example we can go to the database and check if the user did something in the program or if the user

40

00:02:22,650  -->  00:02:30,210
exists then we want to create some default values or for this specific object or maybe we want to go

41

00:02:30,210  -->  00:02:37,550
inside the special program when we let's say for example just to give you a quick example.

42

00:02:37,650  -->  00:02:43,710
We create the new instance right of car and we have some of the full values we wanted the card to do

43

00:02:44,130  -->  00:02:50,910
automatically we wanted the cart wheels to move we want to be to have gas or I don't know if we have

44

00:02:51,060  -->  00:02:56,540
one the cars to have four doors one the specific values already in there.

45

00:02:56,550  -->  00:02:56,850
All right.

46

00:02:56,860  -->  00:02:58,690
And we want these methods working.

47

00:02:58,770  -->  00:03:03,490
We create a car construct and we pool all this functionality all this in here.

48

00:03:03,490  -->  00:03:04,530
This is the full values.

49

00:03:04,550  -->  00:03:10,440
And every time we create a new instance of a car it could be a BMW it could be a Mercedes or a Ferrari

50

00:03:10,440  -->  00:03:11,320
or porch.

51

00:03:11,460  -->  00:03:15,630
Then we have all these functionalities already or our cars are running automatically wouldn't have to

52

00:03:15,990  -->  00:03:19,600
be calling methods and doing anything else with it right.

53

00:03:19,620  -->  00:03:25,850
We have all this working automatically we can do so housekeeping stuff to making sure that we check

54

00:03:25,860  -->  00:03:27,830
there are programs are actually working right.

55

00:03:27,990  -->  00:03:33,570
By using a constructor and doing some validations on something I mean a construct is very useful if

56

00:03:33,570  -->  00:03:34,870
you learn how to use it.

57

00:03:35,100  -->  00:03:36,300
You're going to thank me for it.

58

00:03:36,300  -->  00:03:37,100
All right.

59

00:03:37,440  -->  00:03:40,280
So anyways I hope you got the concept here of this.

60

00:03:40,310  -->  00:03:42,180
This is a very easy concept.

61

00:03:42,180  -->  00:03:46,420
Very powerful functionality if you learn how to use it.

62

00:03:46,430  -->  00:03:51,410
Anyway thank you so much for watching this video here and I hope you like the information and I'll see

63

00:03:51,410  -->  00:03:52,160
you in the next one.

64

00:03:52,170  -->  00:03:52,780
Take care.
