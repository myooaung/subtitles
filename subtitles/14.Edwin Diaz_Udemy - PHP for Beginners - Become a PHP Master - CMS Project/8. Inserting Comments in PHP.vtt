00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.030
Or writes on this video we are going to be talking about comments what are comments and how do we make

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.690
them on HBO.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:18.220
Now let's go ahead and open our co-editor and I'm going to use a this file called Blank Bijou's have

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.950
it there.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.800
If not just make it let's do a Save As and this call these comments.

6
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.100
All right.

7
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.800
Safe.

8
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.540
All right.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.610
Perfect.

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.050
So why are comments on page.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.280
Very simple.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.190
We have comments.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.470
If you don't the mail and I'm you know I am assuming that you have because you are watching this course.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:56.340
So we're going to open up a BHB tag and do some comments comments or use are very useful because when

15
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.880
we write code especially when our code starts getting big and you might not see this right now because

16
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.760
you don't know much about BHP Well once you start coding a lot more you're going to notice that it's

17
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.450
going to be very easy for you to write a hundred lines of code without you even realizing that you did.

18
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.140
And sometimes we write functions we make functions we make programs little programs that do things.

19
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.620
And you know later on then two or three months you might forget what they do.

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.230
And you might forget why you created that.

21
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.200
We need to document that we need to actually write it down somewhere and comments helps us keep that

22
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.430
you know that reference to that specific function there on that file even though you need to document

23
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.550
your stuff outside the program but if you don't if you comment if you make some comments it gives you

24
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.640
a better idea on what you did a couple of months back and it gives the next developer or the programmer

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.670
a better idea on why the function does right.

26
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.230
So for example let's say I create a I don't know let's say an echo I'm not going to go and create a

27
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.830
function here because we're not there yet.

28
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.260
But for example or create an echo that says Hello student and this is a stream by the way.

29
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.110
All right.

30
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
So this says hello student very easy.

31
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.930
Now I want to write something here for example.

32
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.500
Just imagine this is like on your lies there and just going in full force last for Slash and say this

33
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.850
function below

34
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.580
this place

35
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.950
tetes and just just to give an example.

36
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.280
Right.

37
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.620
So this is a comment here and we do this.

38
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.660
And of course in the mail we do like this which is greater than less than and then greater than right

39
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.340
here.

40
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.370
And this will be a comment very similar to the e-mail that we use of forward slash.

41
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.110
Right.

42
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.970
That's This is one single line come in with a four slash four slash.

43
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.250
You can make.

44
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:14.070
And if I write some words here this is the second line you see that is writing way and my code is actually

45
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.820
making this y.

46
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.570
The reason is because it's not commented.

47
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.740
You see this only does one line here.

48
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.870
So in order for me to comment this we have to put the forward slash in there also again.

49
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.550
All right so if you have more than one line of code you need to do is put a forward slash in that in

50
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.700
the number 8 you got the asterisk symbol there is Gein.

51
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.780
If you don't close it and leave it open this is opening for slashing dashers is going to comment everything

52
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.700
below.

53
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.930
You need to close it before we get to the code to the core that we want to see.

54
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.590
So we've put Astro's again and for Slash and that's just going to turn it off is going to turn off that

55
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.230
comment.

56
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.620
And right now we can play our functions.

57
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.530
So this is a multi-line comment.

58
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.240
This little four slash in the little Asherah symbol there and then they asked for it.

59
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.930
And the four slash we close in there.

60
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.580
That's a motel line.

61
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.840
This is a one line one line and just going to leave here so you can reference to a comment

62
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.760
and

63
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.470
more to line and leave it like this.

64
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.640
And this is where your exercise files are right.

65
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.060
So very very useful to do to do this you can come in cold also.

66
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.580
All right.

67
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.710
As you can see for less force less cold that you don't want to execute on this browser.

68
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.390
So if we go to the browser right now

69
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.050
the only thing you can say is Hello stood and you're not going to see this call.

70
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.040
Just like the mail.

71
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:09.560
All right once you come in something the browser those and even see reichlich going to inspect element.

72
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.690
We don't even see the comments in there you see on the right side here.

73
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.290
Nothing.

74
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.740
All right.

75
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.720
So anyway that's how we create a single line comments and multi-line comments in BHB hopefully you show

76
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.360
you a couple of things here.

77
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.180
Right so let's continue with the next election.

78
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.000
Thank you and I'll see you on the next one
