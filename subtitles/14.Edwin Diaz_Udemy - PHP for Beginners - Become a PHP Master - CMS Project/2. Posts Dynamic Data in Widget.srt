00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,380
All right so the last lecture we copy this file here into the index I mean admin in this that BHB.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,350
So we got all of this markup right here we need to add some dynamic data.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,140
Let's go ahead and start doing that right now.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:18,840
So let me just make this a little bigger so you can see what I'm doing.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,280
Actually that's too big because then I can see what I'm doing that just pull these data a little bit

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,330
this way.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,040
All right.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,070
And then I can make it bigger so that where you can see.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,780
All right.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:41,350
So this number right here 20 is where we want to display dynamically we see here right now is counting.

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,770
It just has a static value of 20 that we wanted actually to count how many posts we got.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,180
And right now we only got one post.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,070
So I should say only one.

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,100
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,000
So I'm just going to make a open APHC tag right here

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,850
and we're going to be doing something like this.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,460
It's a matter of fact just going to put it all the way here and they are organized right.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,670
So let's do a Querrey and what we want to check is very simple.

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,800
We're going to select everything from polls.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,270
All right.

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,690
And that's it.

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,760
That's what I really want to check on this one to be honest with you.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,430
And then we want to send it in right.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,880
So this one is going to say select or post.

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,310
And we already have this.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,970
But for me to go and copy this is just going to take me longer to do.

27
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,390
Copy from another file right.

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,110
It's going to take me a lot longer than doing it myself right here.

29
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,380
So we can do this like this connection and then query we've done this many times so you should be getting

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,640
very used to this.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,490
Now what we want to do with this result because we've got this information we're sending the square

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:07,710
we there we select everything from polls and this function is going to send that information get it

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,020
into assigned to this.

34
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,030
We want to make sure that when I use another function to count this and we're going to sign it to a

35
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,550
value for a variable.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,610
So it's in my view as a lie.

37
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,620
No Rose I don't know if I show you this before but I think I have.

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,580
And we are going to count all the rules for this resultset right here.

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,130
I was going to say post counts I sign it to this very well right.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
Here we go.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,480
All right.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
So post counts has the value of those rolls has a number.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,570
So what we're going to do is we're going to be echoing that right here.

44
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:58,140
So let's just move that this has moved this whole thing up here and say it go.

45
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,050
And he's going to put this in the records right here

46
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,420
and right here pull some brackets and.

47
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,080
All right.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,180
I think that's shoe work fine for us.

49
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's refresh our let's go to dashboard.

50
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,740
As you can see we have one post now if I go ahead and make another pause for example let's go to another

51
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,550
polls and let's just say this is another polls.

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,010
Yeah.

53
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:48,960
The School for example and so I don't know the HP guy is the author and on BHB that's fine status.

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:57,000
We're going to say draft and Paul's image is going to be

55
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:09,260
just pictures image whatever it doesn't have to be anything and anything special.

56
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,300
Scrooge just to for illustration purposes right.

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,640
Polish post.

58
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,260
We go to dashboard and we can see that number just increased.

59
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,760
Perfect.

60
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,970
All right I think we're doing a really good job here.

61
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,520
And on the next lecture we're going to continue in the next one.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,130
All right.

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,830
So if you already know what to do.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,060
Basically we're going to be doing the same thing.

65
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,110
We're going to be doing the same Querrey to checking for the next one checking for comments checking

66
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,580
for users checking categories putting it into a contact with its function.

67
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,050
And echoing those values there and I leave that to you for now.

68
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,010
But on the next lectures I will be doing it so if you want to go ahead and do it before me you are welcome

69
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,130
to do that so you can get some practice on it.

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,810
All right.

71
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,820
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you.

72
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,310
And that's one
