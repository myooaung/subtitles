1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,370
All right welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,620
So hopefully you got your files in your server and you overcompressed them.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,490
Hopefully you also export to your database and put that in the desktop.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,290
Perfect.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,800
All right.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:21,140
So remember she amass at sport and go here and you got a file and they just drop in here.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,850
All right.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,050
Just very fine with you that everything is done correctly.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,660
Now let's go to a panel here.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,900
All right this is our main window seat panel and we're got to go to our database wizard.

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,990
This is we're going to where we're going to be creating a database so we click on it.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,270
And now we type in a name for a database.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,230
I'm going to type in.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,850
And I don't know.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,960
See him see him them all on the score.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,600
See a mess on the score D-B.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm going to grab the name if it if it works.

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,550
And then I click next step.

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:53,890
All right.

20
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,880
So he was able to create that.

21
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,710
I'm going to put this in a text it because we are going to be needing this information soon.

22
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,470
So database name right.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,510
And you're going to put it like that database name.

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,060
All right.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,970
All right.

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,300
Put this to the site.

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,130
Now we're going to put a user name right.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,390
I'm going to call it underscores a mess on the school user password.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,240
One two three.

30
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,070
Now don't use this passwords.

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,560
All right don't do that.

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,450
Don't use them.

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,810
One two three or eight till I die use something hard to track or hard to crack.

34
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,270
All right.

35
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,900
I'm going to use them a 2:59 as a matter of fact you know what let's just use a password generator right

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,370
here and I click on it and now I'm going to copy this.

37
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,310
All right.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,920
And as a password password and or copy this year paste it.

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,400
All right so now we use a password generator and that's cool.

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,270
So I'm going to say use password.

41
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,570
I checked his bots and then we're going to use that password right.

42
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,900
Make sure that you also copy the user user.

43
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,830
All right.

44
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,730
Perfect.

45
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,400
So now we got the database name the user and the password that's all we need.

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,070
And now with click click click create user.

47
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,460
All right.

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,920
Perfect and now we're going to click on all privileges right here.

49
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,280
We're going to allow these user to take over everything.

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,000
Next step.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,730
Perfect.

52
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,650
So that's being added there.

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,250
Now what we need to do is configure this.

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,600
So let's go to our panel to a file manager or see panel.

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,500
Right.

56
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,000
And let's go to our See umask Let's get in there and let's go to include something that's where we have

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,990
our database right here.

58
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:05,920
Select this and right click and say Cool Edit edit right now choose me.

59
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,020
Look we're going to leave it the same because that's what go daddy uses.

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,690
And some other hosting providers don't use something else so if it's not working with local holes for

61
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:20,640
you verify where your hosting provider but we go that is localhost.

62
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,210
So for the user we have this one I'm going to paste it right here and paste and copying it from my all

63
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,800
their monitor.

64
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,490
Right.

65
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,280
For the past what we got I encrypt that crazy password.

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,820
We just we just copied and pasted in there.

67
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,290
And now for the name of the database we also have that right.

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,170
And we are sitting here all right and we clicked safe and now we go to that folder.

69
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:59,010
And for me it's going to be the name of my domain for you if you are creating a need what you would

70
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,340
call it

71
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,310
if you're creating a brand new domain is going to be in the route of course.

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,200
Now let me give you an advice before you do that.

73
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,040
Let's go back here real quick.

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm going to go back to the root.

75
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,000
All right.

76
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,010
Right now if you know what is.

77
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,480
Let me just go back.

78
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:23,090
Sorry about that.

79
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,340
All right.

80
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,000
Right now this is my root directory.

81
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,710
How do I know because I have public underscore the e-mail I downloaded the whole folder in here.

82
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,330
All right.

83
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,020
So now if you are doing this if you have a new domain make sure right that the contents if you go back

84
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,990
here the contents of this folders in your root directory.

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:54,030
So admin says fonts and even you end up BHB should be right here in the root directory not there.

86
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,230
Let's go to the director sorry about that it should be right here in the root directory not CMOS.

87
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,460
This is the Forder.

88
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,810
This is your equivalent to your root directory.

89
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,940
Remember we did it in local localhost so we needed a folder.

90
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,640
This is going to be the domain in local's basically right.

91
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,080
So the contents of this folder should be right here.

92
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,070
I see a mess.

93
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,620
You need to delete the folder.

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,380
Make sure that you copy all the contents first and paste it in that in the root of your server.

95
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,320
Right.

96
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,530
So this is where you're going to have all the contents.

97
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,540
But anyway I just wanted to make that clear.

98
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,250
Anyway let's go back and let's go here.

99
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,910
Let's go to includes.

100
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,420
Let's go to a database.

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,710
I think we already have that open somewhere here.

102
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,210
All right.

103
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,960
So we got all of the information right here in our database right in the database file.

104
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,010
We're going to save it.

105
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:55,920
Let's go to our to the Web site name so whatever domain name you got typing here I'm going to say cold

106
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,790
I think it was Edwin something Edwin cold school not called college.

107
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,610
I think it was.

108
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,490
Does it mean that I that I've bought I go daddy before and then enter now.

109
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:16,050
This is just going to show me some other project that I'm actually that I have in my root directory

110
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,280
which is a WordPress site.

111
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,310
All right that's another course.

112
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,420
But I have it in a folder called See a mess.

113
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,700
So this is how we are going to be actually creating multiple sites.

114
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,330
Right.

115
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,780
Remember that this account would go daddy is only available for one site but we can store multiple publications

116
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,450
and we make different folders.

117
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,150
So in this folder we just might and this one here we just have this one.

118
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,240
So now I can see that my database is not connecting because I'm not getting any information.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
All right.

120
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,240
So we need to find that out.

121
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,830
We need to find out why.

122
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:02,980
Let's go back to here and let's uncomment this and we're going to verify that our database is not connected.

123
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,990
How well we have a little a little condition here.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,020
But I'm also going to put else in here.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,670
If you're not seeing that.

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,490
I know that they are.

127
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,880
So you can see if not we're just going to copy this and put it right here and we're going to say not

128
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,830
connect save changes.

129
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,220
Let's go back here and enter now as you can see here.

130
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,840
He says very clear that he's not connected or something is wrong.

131
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,500
All right.

132
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,710
On the next lecture we got to actually debug this a little bit and find out why he's wrong and fix it.

133
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,350
All right.

134
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,370
Thank you so much.

135
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,020
And I see you in the next lecture
