Welcome back my student from the future again on this lecture I'm going to show you how to lead a file.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.330
And it's going to be probably one of the most simplest simplest lectures of all time.

3
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.930
All right.

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.170
So I'm going to actually come to them here and create a file I'm going to call this test the lead.

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.390
Actually the lead on this chord is because this is the file that we are going to be the leading.

6
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.660
All right so I'm going to make it up BHB that's OK.

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.670
Right.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.910
And then if we go Here we see that it is here somewhere.

9
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.500
All right does it have anything just there.

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
Now let's actually create a file that is going to delete this stuff.

11
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.220
So file the leading

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.470
on the leading score files should be.

13
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.420
All right.

14
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.230
Just me.

15
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.490
All right so how we delete a file.

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.210
Super simple answers.

17
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.370
Actually I put it with that BHB extension there because I want you to know that we're not limited to

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.990
THC files while we can delete BHB files as well.

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.030
So the way that we do this is by saying OK I want you to only link.

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.180
All right.

21
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.840
And you put the name of the file.

22
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.750
So we're going to say the least.

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.140
Geez the lead on this gorgeous stuff BHB.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.680
All right but make sure that you put some cords around.

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.250
There we go.

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.470
That's it.

27
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.320
That's all you got to do.

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.360
And if you come back to your browser here and you find your file and you refresh

29
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.980
this is gone.

30
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.030
Right.

31
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.750
It was gone immediately.

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.760
So that's it.

33
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.290
That's how you delete a file using BHB very simple right.

34
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.720
Thank you so much for allowing me to teach this in this course.

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.440
And I look forward to seeing you in new and new lectures and having the project take care and have fun.
