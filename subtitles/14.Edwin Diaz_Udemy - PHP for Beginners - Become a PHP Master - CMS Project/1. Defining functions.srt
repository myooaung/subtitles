1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,890
All righty to they were going to be doing something really awesome.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,780
It's called functions right.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,970
Functions are actually one of the most important things in programming right.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,980
Because functions helps us organize our code into pieces of code like a block of code and then we use

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,000
that code over and over again just by naming it and referring to it by the name just like variables

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,870
we use a name and then we enclose values into it.

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,870
And when we when we refer to those values we use the name right.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,910
So functions work very similar but they are more powerful than arrays them more power more powerful

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,540
than variables and anything else you can think of.

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,240
Let me show you exactly the syntax of a function and then show you how we use them.

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:59,490
So let's go ahead and let's do a save as on this blank that BHB Let's call these functions.

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,930
All right.

13
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,250
Perfit and going to make this tutorial.

14
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,460
This video here.

15
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,150
Short and sweet informative for right ph.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,960
B.

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,790
We got the tax right here and you should already got used to that.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,130
So how in the world we define a function.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,880
Age actually what is it.

20
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,370
All right.

21
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,460
So let me just give you an example.

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,810
If I have all this code here that is printing also an array functions that with not array function array

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:38,170
values right that we did in resections if we want to use this code over in another page right we want

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,500
to do the same thing on another page.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,300
We have to copy this right click it and copy it into another page right.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,570
We want to reuse it.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,490
And then let's say for example have 10 pages I want to use the same code and 10 pages I would have to

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,810
go physically and copy these 10 times while functions allow us to actually wrap all this in a block

29
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,560
in a block and then we can just name it.

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,900
Let's say for example block one.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,600
Right.

32
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,060
And all we have to do if we want to use this over and over again in each of those 10 pages which is

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,820
used to block one name and all this code we get execute every time we use that name.

34
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,550
Right so we can wrap a lot of information in block NSEC in this in a function and we can refer to it

35
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,910
by its name.

36
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,280
Right.

37
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,330
It is really all some functions are really awesome.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,210
So I'm going to go to functions that BHB back again there.

39
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,920
And let's use this to learn how to define it.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,470
So the first thing that we have to type in here is a function name actually function keyword.

41
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,080
So we say function and you see my code that already highlighted this in blue because it already knows

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,250
that function this is reserved word word in PH BE in many programming languages use this too.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,820
So function and then type the name of the function.

44
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,260
This function is going to say something and I just can't name it say something because that's what he's

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,800
going to do.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,510
You've got to be very descriptive when you're writing functions if not when you write your code is not

47
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,030
going to be understood.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,240
You're not going to understand your code very much and other people were not either.

49
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,610
So at the end of the name of the function you put the parentheses and the curly brackets just like we

50
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,570
do if statements are right.

51
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,020
Very similar to if statements and we put it down.

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,510
And they said this curly brackets you know what's going to happen.

53
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,810
We're going to have all the code that we want to run every time we use this name.

54
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,630
This is a name that we are going to use every time we want to refer to everything in sight here and

55
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,290
this could be three thousand lines of code.

56
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,210
All right well everything we enclose here is not going to work until we use this name here.

57
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,480
All right I am going to show you right now exactly what that means.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
Let let's just do something very simple.

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:59,180
I'm going to say hello student.

60
00:03:59,180 --> 00:03:59,840
All right.

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,300
Do you like like the class.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,140
Yes.

63
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,860
OK great.

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,170
All right.

65
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,330
So we're just going to say that now if I go ahead and open this in the browser.

66
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,180
If we do this right we're going to get an error because I didn't put my semi-colon right here.

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,780
All right.

68
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,960
And by the way I found out really quick about the mistake because I've been writing code for a long

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,380
time.

70
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,550
So if you for some reason you get stuck here just make sure that you read your error right here with

71
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,940
BHB and make sure that you read the line here.

72
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,230
Syntax error they will tell you very clearly that you made a mistake in your sentence sometimes your

73
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,670
syntax error could be hundred lines above.

74
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,130
All right.

75
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,510
So make sure that you know that.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,860
So now you see that this is not executed right here and I say to you until we use the name.

77
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:06,600
So I'm going to copy the name and I'm going to put it right below that curly bracket outside the function.

78
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,820
Don't put it inside because it's not going to work.

79
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,340
Then make sure you put a semi-colon there and save it.

80
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,230
Done.

81
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:13,850
See that.

82
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:21,100
Now every time we use this anywhere in our document this name here say something here I can put in 10

83
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,070
different pages.

84
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,890
All this coding here could be running in right now.

85
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,970
We've just got one line of code here.

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,580
But imagine we have a thousand lines of code that say we have a program that calculates the temperature

87
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:41,290
calculates gives us a message on the screen with the calendar on how the temperature is going to be

88
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,370
all week gives us the time for the browser that we are.

89
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,230
I mean this is a whole bunch of information you know gives us information about a user logging into

90
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,480
our Web site application whatever.

91
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,710
And we just say we just call the function call initialize or something like that.

92
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,530
So some function you know we just call some crazy function initialiser and it would initialize a whole

93
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,910
bunch of code for us so this is the way this is how we use functions or write to do a lot of things.

94
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,170
Sometimes we have very very small functions.

95
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,920
And each of those functions could be doing one thing at a time.

96
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,340
We have a big function and wrap many different functions inside and do something else like we can just

97
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:28,030
called let's say for example we have a function here call init and this is very common in BHB in many

98
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,780
different programming languages.

99
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,310
We have a function like this and then we have the little different functions inside we can call different

100
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,920
functions that we can call this.

101
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,080
All right.

102
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,210
So when we started this function it would echo this and they would call another function from outside

103
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,060
for example.

104
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:57,190
Let's just make another function here just create this and let's call this Calculate the.

105
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,970
Right.

106
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,020
Right.

107
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,500
And just not going to do that.

108
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,820
And I'm just going to echo out maybe some numbers.

109
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,510
I'm going to add some numbers here.

110
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,130
So every time I call this function here cockily is going to add some numbers for me.

111
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,830
All right.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,990
So we have the neat function there.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
And I want to call the cockily.

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,750
So what I do is I put the disfunctions here and I use and need to call cockily.

115
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,660
Right.

116
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,130
So every time I call in need is going to call calculate and then I'm going to make another function

117
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:45,970
here I'm going to say I'm going to call this say something say something 1 and I'm going to take this

118
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:53,820
echo out of there I'm not going to use it for that and just say something is going to be like this.

119
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,390
Right.

120
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,120
So I've got three functions here this function going I use it to code both of these functions here.

121
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,700
I just want to show you an example how powerful functions can be how we can use and to do other things.

122
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,570
All right we have a narrow somewhere right there.

123
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,660
All right.

124
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,070
So I hope you see what I'm doing here.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,840
I have two functions here that are right.

126
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,260
This one is going to calculate some numbers is going to do an addition.

127
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,960
And this is just going to say something.

128
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,610
So I've got this a function that I'm going to call right now.

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,100
And when I call these functions this function is going to call this function here and is going to call

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,390
this function.

131
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,210
All right.

132
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,710
And I want to put a echo in between there because I want to send space into the data that is going to

133
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,220
come out on the screen.

134
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,350
And I'm going to call in there right here.

135
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,010
Boom.

136
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,810
Beautiful isn't it.

137
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,060
So we call it the first thing that it needs.

138
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,960
That was call that say something function and say hello right here.

139
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,220
This is the function.

140
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,800
And then the second thing that I did is that it has two numbers together and this is what it is.

141
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,990
So you see how we can use functions to do a lot of things.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,460
All right I hope you see how powerful this can be.

143
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,980
All right.

144
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,670
And I'm going to leave this cold here for you cause of course exercise files and you can use it.

145
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,290
All right but if you did it with me you have it with you.

146
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,180
And great.

147
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,180
So I hope you were able to learn something valuable in this lesson.

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,230
See you in the next one.

149
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,670
Take care
