00:00:00.630  -->  00:00:07.470
Or write so the time has come for us to start playing around with a dash for it make it look like our

2

00:00:07.870  -->  00:00:13.410
demo and let me just show you are there more right now real quick the demo that I first show you in

3

00:00:13.410  -->  00:00:20.000
the beginning blog and let's go to admen as you can see are there more.

4

00:00:20.030  -->  00:00:21.360
Looks like this.

5

00:00:21.370  -->  00:00:29.340
So is the time has come for us to start playing around with this all right and add some more functionality

6

00:00:29.720  -->  00:00:37.200
and function ideas like this to our current one right here as you can see here we have some dynamic

7

00:00:37.200  -->  00:00:41.620
data and we're going to be adding this when I'll be learning how to do that right now.

8

00:00:41.910  -->  00:00:48.850
So let's go ahead and do that first and then I want you to do is to the right of your.

9

00:00:49.140  -->  00:00:53.910
This lecture right now you're going to have a file and have a zip file called admin widgets.

10

00:00:53.960  -->  00:01:03.730
Download it because all these admin widgets I already create assume markup for you right.

11

00:01:05.010  -->  00:01:11.430
If you know I don't want to spend 20 minutes doing this with you they are on the screen on on the computer

12

00:01:11.490  -->  00:01:14.760
because this class is about BHB not about the.

13

00:01:14.760  -->  00:01:15.390
All right.

14

00:01:15.570  -->  00:01:22.560
So what I want you to do is grab the admin widgets whatever's in that and copy it to your end it's

15

00:01:25.170  -->  00:01:27.210
inside your admin.

16

00:01:27.210  -->  00:01:35.640
So inside you and four you're going to have unended that BHB right here and I want you to grab every

17

00:01:35.640  -->  00:01:43.890
content of that admin widgets Deitsch the mail file that I use told you to download and I want you to

18

00:01:43.890  -->  00:01:46.230
add it to this page right here.

19

00:01:46.230  -->  00:01:52.550
So this first make sure that this page is formatted correctly before we do that.

20

00:01:53.220  -->  00:01:57.460
We want to put this all the way on top here.

21

00:01:58.560  -->  00:02:03.890
Make sure that this is running on each individual row.

22

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:04.790
All right.

23

00:02:05.400  -->  00:02:07.660
And right below this row right here

24

00:02:11.340  -->  00:02:16.460
right below this one on should have pasted.

25

00:02:16.530  -->  00:02:20.060
All right.

26

00:02:20.610  -->  00:02:26.040
Now we go back to it and if we can't find this somewhere.

27

00:02:26.060  -->  00:02:27.240
Whoops.

28

00:02:27.650  -->  00:02:29.070
Let's go back to it right here.

29

00:02:29.070  -->  00:02:30.090
Refresh.

30

00:02:30.090  -->  00:02:31.980
And as you can see that will just look like this.

31

00:02:31.980  -->  00:02:34.330
We going to work on this which is right now.

32

00:02:34.350  -->  00:02:34.710
All right.

33

00:02:34.740  -->  00:02:37.960
We're going to be installing dynamic data from our database.

34

00:02:38.070  -->  00:02:44.790
So first know that again this takes a lot of coding and this is a framework that I use.

35

00:02:45.030  -->  00:02:49.120
And if you want to see the cold you can go ahead and see it.

36

00:02:49.690  -->  00:02:50.890
Amusing also fun.

37

00:02:50.900  -->  00:02:52.310
Awesome.

38

00:02:52.410  -->  00:02:59.630
Which is a library of icons and most That's what I'm what I'm using right now together with some Bootstrap

39

00:02:59.700  -->  00:03:02.330
which I have a course on it by the way.

40

00:03:02.360  -->  00:03:07.410
And you know that I do have a course and bootstrap just to make our applications look like this and

41

00:03:07.470  -->  00:03:08.720
a lot nicer right.

42

00:03:08.970  -->  00:03:13.080
But anyway I think it's enough of the lecture here on the next lecture.

43

00:03:13.090  -->  00:03:16.860
And remember this is on the right hand side of your lecture right now on the next lecture we're going

44

00:03:16.860  -->  00:03:19.510
to start adding some dynamic data to this.

45

00:03:20.140  -->  00:03:20.890
Widgets right here.

46

00:03:20.920  -->  00:03:21.440
Right.

47

00:03:21.450  -->  00:03:23.070
So thank you so much for watching.

48

00:03:23.070  -->  00:03:23.640
Keep it up.

49

00:03:23.640  -->  00:03:24.660
You're doing great.

50

00:03:24.660  -->  00:03:26.280
This is going to be awesome.

51

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:28.610
See you in the next lecture.
