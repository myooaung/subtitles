00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.630
All right so let's continue.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:09.750
We are refactoring we already refactor creating this one inserted categories into functions.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.840
Let's go ahead and refer to some of it some other stuff right here.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.880
This is the update and include code.

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.470
I don't think we should refactor this.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.570
This is actually very simple is probably going to take the same amount of code to refactor almost so

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.080
just just leave it like this.

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.620
That's fine and we're just going to say something like Update and include

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.060
and include Kohary.

10
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.180
All right we just kind of say it like.

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.250
And then they see this on this long is to find old categories and this will be refactoring right.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.240
So let's go ahead to functions and refactor function actually right here all capitals for some reason

13
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.230
function fine or categories.

14
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.970
All right.

15
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.090
We're going to find all categories I think that's a good name.

16
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.090
Let's bring our bill over let's not forget that we can use it here just do it ahead of time.

17
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.370
There's gold backed categories and it's take all these out of here.

18
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.910
Boom done.

19
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Let's go back to this.

20
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.180
Here

21
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.650
we go.

22
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.830
Looks a little neater there.

23
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.080
Perfect.

24
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.730
Go back here.

25
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.540
All right.

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.610
So let's just take the name of this

27
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.330
and let's call it from here.

28
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.570
All right.

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.050
I think this looks a lot better.

30
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.340
We should actually have a comment somewhere right.

31
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.900
Well we can that's fine.

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.750
I think he says it already we don't need to put a comma in there.

33
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.770
He says what he will do.

34
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.110
Let's see if that works.

35
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.970
We don't get any arrows.

36
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.590
All right looks like he's working.

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.790
All right.

38
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.120
We're finding all the categories and we click on it.

39
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.100
Everything is working.

40
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.640
All right.

41
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.730
Let's see if we can do one more.

42
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.590
We have the lead right here.

43
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.260
So let's do it.

44
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.230
The lead also.

45
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.560
So that's cold here.

46
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.350
And you can see and do and do this function if you want to puzzle video and try to do it yourself you

47
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.060
can.

48
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.240
All right.

49
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.830
So that way we can get some practice categories categories.

50
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.740
All right

51
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:58.530
folks while I was writing as is there and this just gets caught out of here we are right we are forgetting

52
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.600
the global right.

53
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:10.990
Let's get to global bring it down as the global connection for effect.

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.550
Right.

55
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.430
That is good.

56
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.860
Good.

57
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.550
Very good.

58
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.070
Right.

59
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.440
Let's come back here and that shows right here what it should do what is right here.

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.250
And this I think is a lot better to do.

61
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.640
Yes.

62
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.870
All right.

63
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.890
It's looking good.

64
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.660
Looking a lot better right.

65
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.700
And it looks beautiful.

66
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.440
All right.

67
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.210
So let's go ahead and check it out.

68
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.150
Check it out.

69
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.830
That's the D-1.

70
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.430
Oops.

71
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.450
All right delete functions.

72
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.040
Perfect is working beautifully.

73
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.850
I think we are done.

74
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.960
I think we're done with this section here for now.

75
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.680
All right.

76
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.080
You can go ahead and keep fixing things out now if you want you can convert this into a function I'm

77
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.830
just going to leave it the same.

78
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:15.060
And since it's not really taking a lot of cold out it's not being it's not clear doing anything there.

79
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.930
All right.

80
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.360
So try if you want to try this and convert it into a function that's up to you.

81
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.020
But I think we're done with this page for now and we will continue with our lectures.

82
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.250
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you on the next lectures.

83
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.640
Take care
