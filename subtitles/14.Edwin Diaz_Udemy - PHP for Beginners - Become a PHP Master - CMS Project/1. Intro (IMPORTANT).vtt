00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome back my students in this new section I'm going to show you how to make pretty Your else how

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:17.420
to take this ugly BHB extension inquiry string and make something like this see Boll's 1:13 that looks

3
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.440
a lot nicer.

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.470
And we can even go here.

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.330
We don't have that ugly that BHP standing at the end even though some users would not notice it.

6
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.330
OK what is actually a lot better to have something like that.

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.990
Right.

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.550
So I'm going to show you how to do that.

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.010
Now how are we going to do this.

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.270
Well we're going to be using regular expressions.

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.330
We're going to be mapping this to that that BHB one.

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.920
Now I'm not going to be creating 100 lectures about it.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.440
OK.

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.070
Just a couple lectures enough to give you an idea how this is done.

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.770
And just to show you by doing a couple example how it's done now I understand that some of you do not

16
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.600
know regular expression that's OK but I think every developer out there should know regular expressions.

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.330
I want you guys to know regular expressions if you don't.

18
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.390
I created a course that's super easy to understand and I'm going to give you a coupon right here.

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.090
School Ratchet's Oprah case high Fintain and 10.

20
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.780
This is going to allow you to take the regular expression course for 10 bucks.

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.420
OK.

22
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.210
And this is just because you are my student that courses over a hundred bucks I believe right now and

23
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.820
you can just take it for 10 bucks.

24
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.940
Again this is just in case you want to understand how this precious work which I recommend.

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.940
OK.

26
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.440
You're going to need regular expressions one way or the other in your program in Korea Miles.

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.000
Well you learn it and learn from your instructor right.

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.300
So thank you so much for watching.

29
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.290
I hope that by me adding value to the scores you gave a good rating because he helped me get motivated

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.210
to keep making more lectures for this course and it gets me motivated to keep making more lectures from

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.120
all the courses even making more courses.

32
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.270
I always look at my feedback and always look at how students are commenting about my course and about

33
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.970
myself.

34
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.960
And I always try to improve and I appreciate those students out there who are super loyal to my courses

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.930
they give me motivation everyday and it just wakes me up.

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.140
Thank you.

37
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.760
And I'll see you in the next lectures.
