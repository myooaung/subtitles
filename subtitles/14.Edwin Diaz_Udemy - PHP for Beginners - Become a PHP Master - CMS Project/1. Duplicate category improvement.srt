00:00:00,480  -->  00:00:05,760
Welcome back your students this is Edwin from the future so I'm already done with the Course but I come

2

00:00:05,760  -->  00:00:07,650
back just to fix a couple of issues.

3

00:00:07,740  -->  00:00:14,710
Now if you have notice if you go to your post page try and then you click Edit.

4

00:00:14,790  -->  00:00:16,960
You're going to have a duplicate category right here.

5

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:21,290
I'll show you in a minute why that is right and your files are.

6

00:00:21,470  -->  00:00:21,920
I see a mess.

7

00:00:21,930  -->  00:00:26,460
My look a little different from me because I already I'm already done with the course.

8

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:33,420
Just to let you know but this is being produced because we are making two queries here and I show you

9

00:00:33,420  -->  00:00:38,970
in a minute how that looks so I'm going to go and show you first.

10

00:00:38,970  -->  00:00:43,500
We are making a query and this is the edit on the score pulls up BHB page by the way.

11

00:00:43,500  -->  00:00:45,560
First I'm making a Querrey.

12

00:00:45,600  -->  00:00:52,500
We are making inquiry to show all the categories right and then if the cat ID in the first category

13

00:00:52,500  -->  00:00:58,530
ID are the same then we were making another query and we are echoing something else we need to modify

14

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:01,310
this a little bit just to make it better.

15

00:01:01,320  -->  00:01:01,840
All right.

16

00:01:02,010  -->  00:01:06,690
So this is going to be pretty simple right.

17

00:01:06,750  -->  00:01:09,840
First of all we have to make another query for this.

18

00:01:09,840  -->  00:01:14,680
All right so we know if the post category in the code ID is the same.

19

00:01:14,850  -->  00:01:17,540
This is going to be the default.

20

00:01:17,540  -->  00:01:25,560
All right that's good but then let's make an else statement here and let's just say that if it's not

21

00:01:25,650  -->  00:01:30,260
then we just echo the regular categories which is pretty cool isn't it.

22

00:01:30,260  -->  00:01:31,710
It is.

23

00:01:31,840  -->  00:01:34,040
How about that.

24

00:01:34,210  -->  00:01:37,810
You think that's going to work.

25

00:01:39,300  -->  00:01:48,000
Let me show you save it and let's look at it let's test it real quick and then refresh it.

26

00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:52,780
And now we go back we can see that is on the javascript BHB ambusher.

27

00:01:52,800  -->  00:01:55,560
So there is no other duplicate here.

28

00:01:55,940  -->  00:01:58,320
But we're still showing that the full category for this.

29

00:01:58,320  -->  00:01:59,270
For that one.

30

00:01:59,280  -->  00:02:03,350
So let's go back in trying to change this to something else let's change this Senko one one.

31

00:02:03,510  -->  00:02:08,040
I would add the 1:53 to another category.

32

00:02:08,070  -->  00:02:12,990
Let's change it to bootstrap and it looks different than any other page and the reason why is because

33

00:02:13,020  -->  00:02:18,780
I was I had a whole bunch of duplicate called here duplicate.

34

00:02:18,960  -->  00:02:22,510
A lot of clothes and you know it was something that I did manually.

35

00:02:22,650  -->  00:02:23,400
But anyway.

36

00:02:23,580  -->  00:02:25,780
So you can see now the category change to bootstrap.

37

00:02:25,800  -->  00:02:32,400
And if I go any of this you can see that we still get the Bushrod category right here.

38

00:02:32,400  -->  00:02:33,540
All right.

39

00:02:34,260  -->  00:02:37,400
Let's actually update that.

40

00:02:37,440  -->  00:02:39,110
So let's go back and look at it.

41

00:02:39,120  -->  00:02:41,580
So we got it BUSCHER category right here.

42

00:02:41,580  -->  00:02:45,560
Of course we got some crazy title like javascript which makes no sense right.

43

00:02:45,570  -->  00:02:48,400
But again these are clones.

44

00:02:48,420  -->  00:02:54,030
Now let's go into another one let's change the following one which is a javascript also let's change

45

00:02:54,030  -->  00:02:59,580
that to I don't know BHB the nice BHB.

46

00:02:59,850  -->  00:03:06,180
If we go back we can see that as BHB right now you see that.

47

00:03:07,770  -->  00:03:09,380
And let's just edit that.

48

00:03:09,450  -->  00:03:11,870
And you can see that speech.

49

00:03:13,110  -->  00:03:13,860
All right.

50

00:03:14,250  -->  00:03:19,360
So let's actually change the first one here just to make sure that it is working is BHB right now.

51

00:03:19,590  -->  00:03:25,150
We edited it full BHB change changed to javascript update it.

52

00:03:25,170  -->  00:03:33,260
Let's go back and then we can see that it says javascript edit javascript so this fits all right.

53

00:03:33,390  -->  00:03:36,340
Beautiful so that we don't have to make all the queries there right.

54

00:03:36,660  -->  00:03:37,970
Thank you so much for watching.

55

00:03:38,040  -->  00:03:40,290
And I hope that helps some of you out there.

56

00:03:40,290  -->  00:03:41,840
We saw that situation.

57

00:03:41,850  -->  00:03:44,000
Take care and I see you featured lessons.

58

00:03:44,070  -->  00:03:44,670
Bye bye.
