1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,290
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,650
We are going to be logging in our user.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,080
All right.

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,400
So in the last lecture we looked at how we implemented what.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:11,890
Right.

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:17,910
We actually we implemented the new password system that we're going to be using right with the password

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,070
on the score hash function right there.

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,420
And we provided a cost.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,930
Right.

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,910
So let's go to a log and THP which is in the front page and the front end and we got I don't know what

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,570
you got here by now.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,080
Some of you are having issues with the crypt functions and some of you are not having issues and you

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,310
already got it down some of you have tried something else.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,810
All right but we're going to be implementing our new functionality here which is going to be a lot easier

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,250
guys.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:45,870
All right.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:54,130
So let's go out here let's go to home site and create a new user I'm going to create a new user call.

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,480
I don't know.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,600
Peter you already have a user named Peter sense is an easy name.

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,620
Peter G-mail dot com.

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,200
And one two and three.

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,490
The password register.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:14,020
All right so now let's go to admen checked the user Peter.

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,470
All right is it user name subscriber going to make him an admin.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,450
All right.

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,960
So let's go now and implement this.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,710
So the first thing that we're going to be doing here is that we don't need to know this stuff here.

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,020
All right we're not we don't want to compare on this stuff but we want to do is actually this is going

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,270
to take me to end it.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,520
So if it's not this is going to take me to end and.

31
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,570
That's OK.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,080
All right.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:57,350
This is OK right now if user name not the user name and password now that is going to take me to it

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,800
and it's you know what.

35
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:12,060
Let's just take all this out of here and just make this if you now take this out of here.

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,550
Also what I want to do is use a function called Password

37
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,830
verify.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,230
All right.

39
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,950
And basically this is going to take two parameters.

40
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,320
The first line is going to take the original passwords is coming in here.

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,780
Right.

42
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,150
And it's going to take the D-B password right here.

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,760
He's going to compare it.

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,520
Right.

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,970
And I think yes that's where it is.

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,620
That's what it is.

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:05,580
So if we are in if we were able to verify this and everything is working then we can log in the user

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,810
right.

49
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,340
So

50
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,880
here let's look at what we are actually selecting from the users.

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Right now we are selecting the user name.

52
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,650
All right.

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,050
So we are selecting all users where username is this user name here.

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,870
All right.

55
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,020
So he's going to bring back the record with with the name of the user and in that we type in box.

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:38,700
And then there we check for the user's name password to see if if it is true.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,870
So this function is going to return true or false if it's true we're going to run all this script and

58
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,140
if it's not then we run this script.

59
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,480
All right so let's save it.

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,450
Let's go and try it out log out.

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,160
We created you new user.

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:02,860
His name was Peter and his password was 1 2 and 3 enter.

63
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,650
And there we go.

64
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,490
Beautiful right.

65
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:15,780
So let's go here and refresh and let's see that new Peter person right has a encrypted password.

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,440
All right.

67
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,490
So we can also create new users.

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,330
So now every time we create a new user we want to pass will also be encrypted.

69
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,180
So we want to include that in the User page also.

70
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,520
All right so make sure that you put that functionality there.

71
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,560
We're going to do then and that's Letcher and if I don't do it you already know how to do it.

72
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,050
All right.

73
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,400
So don't be lazy and do it anyway.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,670
Thank you so much for watching.

75
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,920
Hopefully this system is a lot better than what you learned before.

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,980
And if you were having issues without one now you are not going to have any issues again.

77
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,190
You are awesome.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,820
See you in that net.

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,110
