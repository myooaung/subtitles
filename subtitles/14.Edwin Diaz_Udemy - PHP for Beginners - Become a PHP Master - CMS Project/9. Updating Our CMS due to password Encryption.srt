00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,100
Hi welcome back my students.

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,890
In the last lecture we improve our your registration page by encrypting the passwords that are coming

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:09,830
from this field to the database.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,780
Now we need to update some of those.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,680
I see him as a little bit to actually handle this change.

6
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,360
You see now that we can make users encrypt passwords I'm going to show you an example right now.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,670
It creates a little issue if we don't they are a mess.

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,300
You see if you go to see the front of the see a mess and you try a little game with a new user that

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,870
you make.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,720
For example you make him a admin and you try to log in.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,150
It will now allow you to do that because now is encrypting the password and he has different fields

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,250
in the database.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,900
So we need to adjust it a little bit.

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,630
All right.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:48,150
So first let's go ahead and make our user year just to show you exactly what he's doing.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,380
So are you going to make a simple user here and just kind of call him them all and them all at G-mail.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,470
Well let's just say yeah.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:03,630
All right let's just for just changing things you know and you've going to make the passwords super

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,530
simple one two and three I'm going to show you right now what happens.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,380
I'm going to register that and they use is submit it.

21
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,880
Let's go to admin.

22
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,790
Let's check it out.

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,100
Now we can see that demo has been created right here.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,580
Right.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,760
It's going to delete this tool here.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,040
So it's being created now when I click Edit we can see that the password has been cryptic and showing

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,160
right here.

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,240
All right.

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:35,170
Now let's go and log out and type in the same user name right here.

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,070
And then one two and three submit and those that allow me to get in there right now.

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,890
That's because the password and I'm just going to refresh just a little bit.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,560
The password is a different one now because it's being encrypted so we need to adjust it.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,470
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,640
So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the let's actually take this idea here.

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,800
Let's go to the log in page and right after.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,130
All right.

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,650
Right after that we are going to be using the crypt function again.

38
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,090
All right.

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,150
And we are going to be passing some parameters and just going to change this salt because if you remember

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:27,090
our encrypt the past where has the salt has our random salt column value default value that we put in

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,690
the database.

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,430
I'll show you right now what it is.

43
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:37,810
You see he has this default value so on going to do is just use that default value with a password and

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,330
going to pass it in descript function here to reverse what we did.

45
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,640
So now when the script function finishes converting this again is going to turn the password to that

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,560
first pass without we first had there.

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:50,960
Right.

48
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,680
And understand the value here.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,420
If you don't understand much about what's really going on here by the crypt function I got a lecture

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:05,010
on security on the security section of this course and I explain a little bit more about the function

51
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,330
here.

52
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,260
But you can always get more information on the BHB that Net Web site.

53
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,060
All right.

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,320
Just to know exactly how this works because you know it would take me a lecture or two to explain it.

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,420
They go deep into it you know.

56
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:24,120
But anyways so now that I have this here now it will be able to compare both passwords and he will allow

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,910
me to log in show you right now.

58
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,690
All right.

59
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,520
So I'm just going to refresh my cursor there enter.

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,270
Am going to say them all.

61
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,760
And then one two or three after and now is going to allow me to go in.

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,220
Right.

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,480
So this descript function will convert the password encrypted password.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,990
Right it was a name put and they were output the same.

65
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,370
If you just provide the hash with a password again.

66
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,780
All right.

67
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,620
So and remember that hash is just that.

68
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,440
This train the 22 characters and that then the hash format.

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,010
I'll show you right now this is this is the hash for my right here.

70
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,760
That's the cost.

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,520
Right.

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,840
You can get up and BHB that on that Web site and that use some crazy strings 22.

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,840
Now we're going to correct one of these here because we need to actually make this 22 characters.

74
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,110
And I think he only has 21.

75
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,050
A good way of finding out is when you do you use a function call as to or lenth.

76
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,730
All right.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,160
So we want to make sure that that's 22 characters I believe is you I believe is 22.

78
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,110
But just to make sure let's go ahead and try it out.

79
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,580
I'm going to do a little simple try here.

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,540
So are you just going to comment is out here.

81
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,100
Actually I'm going to comment all this out.

82
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,380
I'll show you right now how two we can test this out.

83
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,820
All right.

84
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:09,570
And we can just come in everything that's fine let's just comment is holding just a simple test to show

85
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,260
you right.

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,190
This is going to actually take us to the logon page.

87
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,850
All right.

88
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,010
So let's just test it out real quick and then just say test this just to make sure that it does take

89
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,780
us there.

90
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,610
Right.

91
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,740
And then lo again it takes us to the page.

92
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,060
All right so now we can test is going to show you real quick exactly what I'm talking about.

93
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,520
So

94
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,540
this is Zed's right here.

95
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,090
So let's say you have a password right and the password is secret.

96
00:05:49,710 --> 00:06:00,210
And this is the hash format and just going to show you this real quick hash format in the hash format

97
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,610
is in the HP that Net Web sites a special form.

98
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:10,140
Is there anything you wanna write to Y and I think 700 ph be there on that Web site and you're going

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,600
to make it.

100
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:17,050
And this is how many times it is going to fliped is going to do the conversion is going to try is going

101
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,470
to do it 10 times.

102
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,610
All right.

103
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,320
And let's do that salt.

104
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,350
The salt is the strings.

105
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,560
And again this lecture is on the security section by the way.

106
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:40,150
And I just use whatever random character I want and I'm just going to use I use some crazy string.

107
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,120
You see I'm forgetting and there's there.

108
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,230
I have a feeling that this is only 21 characters.

109
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,240
When you make sure that it is 22 characters.

110
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:02,540
So I'm just going to echo this out and let let's try and let's see I'm going to submit here is 21 characters.

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,090
Let's make sure is 22 characters and I use some crazy strings with and this is the one that I were looking

112
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:09,410
for.

113
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,550
All right.

114
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,710
So what we need to do is let's go back so 22 characters.

115
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,470
Let's make sure that this is 22 characters in our database.

116
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,190
All right so it's going to go to a structure change of field and that's going to add right here strings.

117
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,970
There we go.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,330
Safe.

119
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,170
All right.

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,040
So now we are good to go and I just wanted to show you that this is how he goes.

121
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,220
Let's say this is just a static password that I'm using here.

122
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,300
This is why you are going to get from the form usually something like that right whatever you set it

123
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,020
to be.

124
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,230
This is going to be the hash format.

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,000
And this is the salt and remember the crypt function goes like this.

126
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,570
Right.

127
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,740
It takes the password right and it takes a hash for me and the song together.

128
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,930
So that's what we did in the database.

129
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,350
All right we put both of them together.

130
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:04,890
All right.

131
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,590
So that way we can just save it in one field in the database because that's what it takes right here.

132
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,160
But I mean we can just do it like this

133
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,500
and this one right here.

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,600
And that's what we got in the database.

135
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,980
All right.

136
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,820
As you know you can pause this video and watch it again.

137
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,120
But anyway it's just going to comment this out.

138
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,340
I just wanted to give a little detail about how that works.

139
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,560
And now we are good to go right.

140
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,230
We can logon to our site any time we want to make sure that this works here.

141
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,750
Let's just say them all.

142
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,330
And one two three.

143
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,070
All right so we are good to go.

144
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,900
All right.

145
00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:00,360
So anyway in the next lecture we're going to be helping her user page here not display them let just

146
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,620
go back here.

147
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,960
Now let's play these long password here.

148
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,900
All right we want it to display whatever PP-ASEL we set it to.

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,170
Right now we go ahead and do this.

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,790
It doesn't actually even encrypt the password so we need to make sure that encrypts the password and

151
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,530
shows only this here.

152
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:16,810
OK.

153
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,110
We're going to do the next lecture take here
