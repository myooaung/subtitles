00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.730
All right guys and ladies of course and when I say guys I mean ladies too.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.360
Right.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.520
So don't get upset with me ladies.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.950
Anyway so we need a contact page right.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.260
We need a link right here.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.860
So it's a lot of work to actually do this on.

7
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.620
What is not a lot of work I just don't like to work online and do things like this.

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.960
Let's go and do it locally.

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.740
So let's go to our local host and let's go to or see a mass of course.

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.380
And now we have this page open going to close the online version.

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.050
All right.

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.710
And there are some plug ins out there that you can use a fuse and so blind what you can.

13
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.400
Every time you save the page you can actually upload it to your server so you can look that up online

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.750
is so easy to do.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.920
There are other tools out there that you can use.

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.140
I'm using this way because some of you out there don't have those stores yet but I might make a lecture

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410
or two to make it easy for you.

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.430
All right.

19
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.010
So but right now we just want to know how this is done.

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.290
All right.

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.950
So let's go.

22
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.820
I'm going to open up my editor

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.880
and I am going to open on my local copy of the project which is a mess and I'm put in writing here.

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.900
All righty then.

25
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.200
We still need to make a couple of modifications to our project since we are on line and we want to make

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.880
our site a lot more secure.

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.290
So keep in mind are we always going to be making modifications specially to some of the daily functions

28
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.360
and updating things like that.

29
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.150
All right.

30
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.590
But that's later right now.

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.370
Let's make this contact page just because I like to help you guys get out there and say messages and

32
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.630
things like I'll get messages from people.

33
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.400
I think that's a priority right.

34
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:58.860
So right now let's go and it's a matter of fact let's take registration do a save as well registration

35
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.190
and let's make it a contact contact and then save.

36
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.600
Now let's go down here and instead of raising We're going to say contact

37
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.030
save.

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.570
Now let's go here and let's check it out real quick.

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.440
Contact be perfect.

40
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.310
So we've got a contact there and now we need to change a couple of things right.

41
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.470
So in the Contact page we get to the

42
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440
subject and the body right.

43
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.270
So let's use this as the subject.

44
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.160
Right.

45
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.070
So let's take the e-mail address.

46
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.340
As a matter of fact you know what we should leave the e-mail and we can have that in their e-mail address

47
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.730
which is coming from the subject and the body.

48
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.640
Right.

49
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.370
So let's just take these user here.

50
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.830
Right.

51
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.670
So the e-mail This copy is this would be the subject

52
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.250
and of course we changed to subject to subject

53
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.520
by subject.

54
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:55.050
Perfect and placeholder we can put a placeholder saying something like enter enter

55
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.530
your subject or something like that.

56
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.360
Let's see this here real quick.

57
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.080
And to use it well you know what we could have a label there I actually thought Id have a label there.

58
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.810
But anyway what else.

59
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.160
So let's take this out a year and let's make this a tetes area

60
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.670
to its area

61
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.100
and it's going to be the body

62
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.380
the body.

63
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.400
Let's see how big this is.

64
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.110
Enter.

65
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.700
All right.

66
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.610
I don't like the way that looks.

67
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:57.160
And also I don't like the e-mail placeholder so I'm just going to say enter into your e-mail.

68
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.970
All right.

69
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:09.600
This one here I'm going to put a class of form control in that will help.

70
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:20.180
So instead of having all these styles here answer.

71
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.850
Made a little better because now they can go ahead and do this.

72
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.530
All right.

73
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.690
Perfect.

74
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.930
Now let's change the submit button.

75
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.040
This is just going to say

76
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.580
it.

77
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.710
All right.

78
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.700
We can make this bigger if you like

79
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.770
actually.

80
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.250
Let's create a couple more columns.

81
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.100
Let's just make it 50 and you'll see what I mean.

82
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.950
Quick.

83
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.420
Here we go.

84
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.790
You see that I have 50 columns that make made a bigger and this would be

85
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.890
against Mitt.

86
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.040
So I'm just going to live with the way it is because we just want to know how this works right.

87
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.410
All right.

88
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.010
Perfect.

89
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.160
So in the next lecture I'm going to show you how this works.

90
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.400
And so you then take care
