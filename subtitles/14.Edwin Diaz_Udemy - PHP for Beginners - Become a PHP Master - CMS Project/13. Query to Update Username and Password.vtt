WEBVTT
1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.570
I will come back and the last video will learn how to pull some information from that database and how

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:12.370
to refactor some of the code that we had into a function right like this.

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.930
And we put it we made a new database file and functions and all that.

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.540
Right.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.960
If you haven't done if you haven't watched the last video make sure you do.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.340
But anyway on this one here we're going to continue and we are going to be making the Querrey so that

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.430
when we go to the databasing of day this field in this field relating to whatever ID we have on the

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.240
database.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.930
So for example if I target if I click on ID number one and I put a user name here and a password of

10
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.470
the ID number one here which in this case would be my name right.

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440
So let's go ahead and jump into that cold and start doing this.

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.680
I'm going to take a couple of things.

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.400
As a matter of fact let's just make it right here real quick I think we can make it fast and then we

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.830
can copy it.

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930
This is Dornier set.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.210
Make sure that first.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.870
Let's just put this here the famous BHB B.Tech.

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.410
I always think I have it because just because.

19
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.420
Yes because.

20
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.190
Right.

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.730
All right.

22
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.000
So we've got to do on this say a set function here and just to check for the pole super global.

23
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.630
All right.

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.890
I'm going to try to do this a little faster since this would be a little longer than usual but hopefully

25
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.550
it's not longer than five or six minutes.

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.820
Right.

27
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.540
So keep tuned for that.

28
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.310
You don't like you are.

29
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.840
All right so as a matter of fact I will not know I cannot do it from scratch.

30
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.410
Why not.

31
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.510
I should not do that.

32
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.750
I should be copying code that we already have from the last videos.

33
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.460
But I just like making mistakes that way I can fix them up.

34
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.670
All right.

35
00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:03.000
If you like to be 100 percent sure of things and when you are starting just make sure that you copy

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230
the stuff from the other files because we already have this from the file.

37
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.940
I just like writing this stuff down because I like making mistakes it makes me a better programmer.

38
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.770
For some reason I'm just strange Don't worry.

39
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.130
Don't mind me OK.

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.780
So anyway we're going to be picking these fields from the form.

41
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.900
Right so every time we submit the form we are going to be pulling this information from there.

42
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.350
All right.

43
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.020
And we're going to be putting it in the post associated re.

44
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.400
And we're going to do the ideals.

45
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.440
All right we're going to be pulling down.

46
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.820
You see that we are sending the ID right here with a name matching you we're sending the password was

47
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.490
and the user name.

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.470
All right so if all this is said then what do I want to do with this information.

49
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.460
I think as a matter of ologist created I was going to copy a book that's fine let's just create this

50
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.450
query here real quick and the court is going to be update.

51
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.690
And this is just as well OK.

52
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.430
So we're going to update the user table that we've been working up.

53
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.890
We're working on and we're going to set a value a couple of values and we're going to set a user name

54
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.620
and this key word here I'm picking it up.

55
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.260
This is not the name of the column in the database.

56
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.970
So if I edit this you see this column name.

57
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.440
That's the that's what I'm using there and going to be used in the password column.

58
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.740
Also.

59
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.460
All right.

60
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.680
So just for you to know that this is in the user stable if you click on the users you can see that table.

61
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.140
This is the rolls but you can edit that and you can look at that if you want to just look at it real

62
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.150
quick.

63
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.490
All right.

64
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.480
As a matter of fact I'm going to break this down this line would be too long so I'm just going to break

65
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.320
that down.

66
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.420
I'm going to concatenate it into another Kohary variable and this would be the same variable basically

67
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.310
and just concatenating it.

68
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.410
This is what these dot means.

69
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.280
It will be the same as this but in reality they BHB will will actually think is a really long string

70
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.800
if I do it with the dot right here I just don't want to do that.

71
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.350
That is a lot better because when I make mistakes I can just go to each line and check to see if each

72
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.340
line is good instead of checking his long string here.

73
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:33.730
OK so I'm just going to close that and the user name column is here now then with Wadlow want to update

74
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.350
this column with the username that's coming from the form right.

75
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.340
So I'm just going to copy this here and make sure that you have single chords there because this is

76
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.740
going to be a string from the form right.

77
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.540
I'm going to copy this whole thing here and then paste it and gonna put the name of the other column

78
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.950
in the database password and I'm going to copy this and paste it right here.

79
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.600
Right now when I have the data right in front of me I don't mind pasting it right.

80
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.230
So don't get me wrong.

81
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:11.670
So now the next thing right here is I'm going to use another command ask you a command code where they're

82
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:20.400
just going to give me like selection where I can select where what I want to do with this data to where

83
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.180
I can getting it from.

84
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.820
Right.

85
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:32.480
So we're going to say something like Where re here where ID equals the ID data is coming from the form.

86
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.890
Make sure that you don't put any quotes around that idea because it's not a string is an integer.

87
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.290
Remember that data from the database and into your.

88
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.800
Right.

89
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.590
So that's about it.

90
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.890
Here now what I want to do is actually I want to check for resaw if I have a problem because I don't

91
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.070
know if I have a problem here.

92
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.080
So we haven't made the query yet so we need to make the query first.

93
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.670
So let's go ahead and make the queries.

94
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.560
I'm going to call this query the result.

95
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.090
Again we we still we have these file files already where you can do is copy it if you want.

96
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.550
Or you can just write it down with me all right my ass.

97
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.640
Q Well I and this is called Kohary.

98
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:26.410
And then here we're going to pass it to parameters the connection and the query again.

99
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:33.430
This way the way I'm doing it is prone to you know for any programmer to make mistakes because I'm writing

100
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.530
everything down from scratch.

101
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.180
And you can just copy it here right.

102
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.460
This stuff is already here.

103
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.310
You got it Querrey and you got it resoled you might be asking yourself why is he writing it down.

104
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.280
Well one of the things is that I enjoy it.

105
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.530
I enjoy making mistakes because the fun of actually finding out what's wrong with something is something

106
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.140
that that I like and I think this way if you follow me you can learn a lot more just by typing things

107
00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.690
down.

108
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.740
If I start copying and pasting you're going to be doing the same thing and you learn less.

109
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.170
So if you don't appreciate that then I don't know why you will appreciate.

110
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.700
All right.

111
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:17.530
So anyway if I say if here and I say if not three so because I'm going to find out if this is not going

112
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.370
to go through.

113
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.600
So remember this is going to be mutual for so if the resaw doesn't come back strong from the Querrey

114
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.020
the meaning if the query did not go through.

115
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.810
They aren't going to get an error.

116
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.600
Right.

117
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.120
So I'm going to say die.

118
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:37.380
This is the command that is going to stop all executions after this is going to give the user a message.

119
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.060
In this case the user is me and he's going to say where he failed.

120
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.950
Man it just failed.

121
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.400
And of course we need the courts there.

122
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.890
All right.

123
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.790
So let's get you ready to see the mistakes we made.

124
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.020
All right let's go ahead and check it out.

125
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.810
Pretty sure I did a super fast and I'm pretty sure there's a mistake somewhere.

126
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.330
So logging update perfect line 8.

127
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.060
So we have unexpected passwords there.

128
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.890
Hmm.

129
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.090
In line 8 in Logan page.

130
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.480
All right lane eight Let's see we probably forgot to send in something.

131
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.590
There we go.

132
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.800
Forgot several of them with the cup in place so fast we didn't even put semi-colons.

133
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.310
Boom a hole.

134
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.070
Wasn't that nice.

135
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.960
Look at that.

136
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:22.510
Perfect.

137
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.570
So it looks like he's working.

138
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.960
I'm concerned.

139
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.090
I don't like this.

140
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:37.960
But anyway let's go ahead and create another record in the database and let's find out if this is working.

141
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.020
All right.

142
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.350
So let's create this here.

143
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.530
It's just create another one to say something like wow.

144
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.350
No no.

145
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.100
The

146
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.160
cold man.

147
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.320
I like that name called man.

148
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.050
And just going to type in a h h h h.

149
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.340
And submit.

150
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.920
All right.

151
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.750
We're going to take this connect out of there.

152
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.130
I just don't like I just don't the ball right now we're not going to do that of course.

153
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.820
Let's just refresh here and the cold man.

154
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.360
Perfect.

155
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.260
Let's go to our update.

156
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.490
Found just going to go from up here.

157
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.360
Update right here.

158
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.490
What's going on Edwin.

159
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.430
There we go.

160
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.370
Let's click here.

161
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.180
And now we get a record so let's select the same one the called man and let's name it.

162
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.750
The called Woman Right because men are not the only one calling.

163
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.290
Right.

164
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.190
I'm just letting you know.

165
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.720
All right.

166
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.820
So let's pull some crazy password.

167
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.780
An update oh yes we have a mistake.

168
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.560
Use undefined constant resource.

169
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.460
That means we forgot as the dollar symbol somewhere like 17.

170
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.900
It could mean that it could mean something else.

171
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.680
I'm just.

172
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.340
Actually this is not.

173
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.420
Let's go to the files somewhere here.

174
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.690
Bottom line 17 haha.

175
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.290
Look at that.

176
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.730
You see that how beautiful that is when you started reading this.

177
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.350
This is their Querrey fail.

178
00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.940
And now they're perfect.

179
00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.530
So where we fell what can we do when the query fails like this.

180
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.230
All right well I'm going to show you a way that you can actually get some more information right.

181
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.950
This is not enough information as well.

182
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:27.430
Error which is in my ask where I error because this is a new API.

183
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.660
You should know that.

184
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.210
And let's just put the connection here.

185
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.250
I think that's the parameter takes where you think.

186
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:35.970
Right.

187
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.220
Let's go ahead and check it out.

188
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.680
Well you see that this is nice.

189
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.410
Now now we got a lot more information with this function right here.

190
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.500
All right.

191
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.440
So make sure you put this in your tool box.

192
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:52.420
My excuse ally underscore error is going to give a lot more information that this just little quirky

193
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.230
felt function there right.

194
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.240
All right.

195
00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:00.720
So you have an error in your SU was sent to check the manufacturer's phones or didn't turn the call

196
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.280
woman where Id calls seven.

197
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.590
Oh I got a feeling it's somewhere here.

198
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.850
Line 1 right.

199
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.150
So let's see if we can find this fast.

200
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.610
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.

201
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.050
All right so let's check this the way we can check this.

202
00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.380
Easy is actually by putting a coma here.

203
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.760
I just figure it out.

204
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.290
But anyway I think that's the problem.

205
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.410
So let's we to a coal mine between these values and it wasn't there.

206
00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:35.460
So make sure I hope these mistakes will help you fix yours just in case and say some shine some light.

207
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.420
You know we as programmers spend more time fixing things than actually making them.

208
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.810
So keep that in mind.

209
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.580
Just click.

210
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.120
They're perfect.

211
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:51.720
The called Woman and it's just some crazy call here and 7 update.

212
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.250
Perfect.

213
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.210
We have a problem.

214
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:59.260
Something is going on here now that is not that coma there.

215
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.980
So it's called and check it out.

216
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.200
All right perfect.

217
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.580
So let's we have this Colmar here is not Dyce's lame one.

218
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.990
But remember this whole thing is concatenating on one line.

219
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.110
So but it still helps me figure out what's going on.

220
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.940
All they use is that's fine.

221
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.330
They just put a space there and just check it out.

222
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:28.880
They called Woman 7 update.

223
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.310
That was the problem.

224
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.480
You saw that something as simple as not putting up space.

225
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:42.580
The problem is if you don't put a space here when you remember this is only one line so users are going

226
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.400
to just copy here use is going to be like this to this set.

227
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.940
So he's going to say user is not going to say it in one word like this.

228
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.370
Make sure you put a space there right.

229
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.430
And I always try to put spaces all around there just in case.

230
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.840
So make sure you put spaces there.

231
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.560
That was a problem.

232
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.320
All right.

233
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:08.360
So hopefully this little things will help you out and make you think OK the cold woman.

234
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.090
Yes.

235
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.350
Let's update that file again.

236
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.280
Let's do that.

237
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.560
This create something like this the cold boy.

238
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.030
And let's just say

239
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.000
all right.

240
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:33.350
You don't know what I said but you're going to see an out of date perfect and fresh haha.

241
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.160
They called boy look what he says here.

242
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.000
Hey student yes is working.

243
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.190
We finally made this work.

244
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:44.470
Right now this video got kind of long on the next lecture I'm going to show you how to lead all these

245
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.590
data from here right.

246
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.950
So hopefully you learn a lot on this one.

247
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.460
Thank you.

248
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.700
And I'll see you in the next lecture
