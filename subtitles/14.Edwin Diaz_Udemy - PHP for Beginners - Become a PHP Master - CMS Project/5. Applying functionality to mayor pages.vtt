00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.250
All right on the last lecture we are only seeing results if we are lower than we are.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.980
We are seeing all that we sort of we are lower than any we're not.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.910
We only see was published.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.460
All right.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.060
So that's why we implement it in the individual post page.

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.840
And I told you that you should be implementing this in all your pages in that category and the home

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.450
page.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.280
Right.

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.820
So real quick I'm going to do that.

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.080
So that way you can see I'm not going to explain it because I'm all right.

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.320
I already did.

12
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.800
So look it is super simple to implement in the rest of the pages.

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.840
Right there we go.

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.280
And for this one I just do another Querrey and this one will not be like that.

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.760
All right.

16
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.620
So that's category.

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.780
Let's go to this copy this same one too in there.

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.410
This is in the tray here.

19
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.020
All right.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.170
Super simple to do.

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.780
Right.

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.310
And

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:34.510
basically I mean this was just display everything right.

24
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.630
Sure.

25
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.510
Right now it's a home page.

26
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.240
We explain everything but explain everything here.

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.650
And of course with this play written here.

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.570
Well that's weird because we are logged in.

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.110
Actually we're not logged in.

30
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.170
Let's actually

31
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.900
right now we are logged in but everything is Polish.

32
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.870
So let's make everything on draft.

33
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.740
And now if we go to our home page we don't see anything

34
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.840
see anything there.

35
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.880
And that means it's not working.

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.600
That's just because we have this right here.

37
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.700
All right let's take that out of there let's go to category and also take this out of there.

38
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.380
Whoops forgot the most important thing right.

39
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.240
No worries beautiful.

40
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.350
So as you can see now we are able to see everything even though they are still in draft categories and

41
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.080
even each individual post.

42
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.160
Let's go back to ad.

43
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.750
All right.

44
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.690
And let's look out.

45
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.800
And we are look now.

46
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.870
Immediately you don't see anything in there in that speech.

47
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:12.710
You don't see anything in the category page and you can tell the individual page individual post.

48
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.910
There will be nothing as well.

49
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.710
All right.

50
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.230
Beautiful.

51
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.950
So I just wanted to walk you right through it.

52
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.190
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.870
And hopefully you enjoy this lectures.

54
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.610
See you in the next lecture.

55
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.360
Have fun.

56
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.000
Take care.
