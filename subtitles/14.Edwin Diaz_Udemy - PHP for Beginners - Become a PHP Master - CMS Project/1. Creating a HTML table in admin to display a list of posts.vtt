00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.000
All right so what are we going to be doing in this section here is we are going to be creating the Post's

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.350
page here in the navigation that where we can display some of the polls and edit them into the crowd

3
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.270
basically create read all day delete functions here but links are not working.

4
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.030
We are actually click on it.

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.050
They're not working so let's go ahead and make it work making work.

6
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.050
And let's do that right now actually.

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.300
Let's see categories is actually not working either.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.550
So let's go to navigation real quick and edit that.

9
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:49.930
So here know the navigation we want to view all polls is going to go to polls.

10
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.250
All right.

11
00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:01.010
Postop the HP and the categories is actually going to somewhere else right now.

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:10.980
They need to go to categories and we are in includes folders so we don't need to go anywhere else.

13
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.310
Actually the categories is in the root actually.

14
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.240
All right we are in the room for that category so we need to go a little bit up for polls.

15
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.640
We will be actually in the also in the root.

16
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
So let's do that let's create that right here where can I find it.

17
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.730
All right.

18
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.310
Let's create.

19
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.280
We need to create a fire actually.

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.700
So right now we see this.

21
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.870
And two polls is going to take those two polls up.

22
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.390
People don't have that yet.

23
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.640
This is going to take us to our categories.

24
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.390
All right.

25
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.290
So let's go ahead and build this page right here.

26
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
So we are going to be using a kind of template type of thing because we're going to be doing or save

27
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.110
us from the categories one.

28
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.310
All right.

29
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430
This one has everything we need.

30
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:19.080
All we have to do is just do a Save As polls BHB and delete some of the stuff here.

31
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.580
This here is the.

32
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.420
If I put my cursor there and I go all the way up you can see that this is the division right here for

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.870
that.

34
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.810
All right.

35
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.770
So we're just going to take everything out.

36
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:45.590
It's not part of what we want save it and if we go to it now refresh we see that it's empty.

37
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.540
You have a heading there right.

38
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.050
Yes.

39
00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:00.420
Get the heading from categories right here.

40
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.050
Let's get the heading for now later on that we probably will replace it.

41
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840
Let's go to the polls and get a little heading there so we have a little bit to see something here.

42
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.870
All right.

43
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.090
So how are we going to do this.

44
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.380
First we create a table.

45
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.790
All right.

46
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.000
So this is the first thing created that's polls because we wanted this play everything.

47
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.160
I just like you saw in the demo you can refer to the introduction I'll see a mess.

48
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.730
So let's build a table.

49
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.200
Right.

50
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.460
And inside this table just the table inside the table.

51
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.980
We get t head.

52
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.250
We also inside the city where we get our insides.

53
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.180
TR We get some T-H elements and we're going to have I think it's like around seven I believe.

54
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.600
I'm not 100 percent sure.

55
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.970
Maybe seven or nine but we'll find out pretty soon.

56
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.530
So on this here we're going to have the post ID and I just got a caller ID.

57
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.830
What is really post ID.

58
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:13.680
And here we're going to have the altar here we have the title of the post Category 3 belongs to

59
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.220
status

60
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.220
image.

61
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.640
And I think we're going to need more fields tags.

62
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.950
Yes we need a couple more we need for the comments and

63
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.090
the end date.

64
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.030
We've got a date right.

65
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.400
We need to put dates in the comments on that.

66
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.900
And the date in the last day for last is fine.

67
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.980
All right.

68
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.620
So date let's see how that looks right now.

69
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.480
We'll have no style on this form right here.

70
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.660
So yeah everything is stripped down we know.

71
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.360
So let's ask styles here real quick just to make this look a little better.

72
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.510
There's a class of table and let's see how that looks.

73
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.810
All right.

74
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.360
Looking a little better right.

75
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.910
All right.

76
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.920
And is that another class of table.

77
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.310
As a matter of fact we can't copy all the styles from categories instead of writing them down right

78
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.220
here.

79
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:34.210
I'd say let's just copy the whole thing and just do it right here let's make our tables look the same.

80
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.750
Perfect.

81
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.540
All right.

82
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.790
So what else do we need we need after the T here.

83
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.660
We need a t body.

84
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.510
And actually we need a TR.

85
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:51.780
There were some elements and these elements are going to be one two three four five six seven eight

86
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.790
nine elements size nine tab.

87
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.070
And what are we of these elements.

88
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.570
We won the title and just for placeholder information we just copy everything down.

89
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.980
They just put 10 here put who strive for something I don't know.

90
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.420
And why do I keep naming bootstrap.

91
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.890
I think the framework or some sense you can make everything really cool like we are doing right now.

92
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.990
I want to know how that works.

93
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.910
I have a course.

94
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:32.070
Actually that's the altar that we need to put there the side or we'd be bootstrap framework

95
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.240
and all or we be me

96
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.630
category bootstrap just for placeholders.

97
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.460
We can copy and paste it but I think by the time I put my mouse over and copy and paste thing we can

98
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.290
write a little faster tacts comments

99
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.350
and

100
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.920
see how that looks right now.

101
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.180
Of course no styles

102
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.760
right.

103
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.400
It's a t t body t head.

104
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.380
And the reason why hasn't styles is because I under the table here.

105
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:29.040
Before I even put it in say we need to put inside the T here after the T head.

106
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.710
All right.

107
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.960
Now after the table and tag refresh now is working so that the other bootstrap.

108
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.290
All right.

109
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.790
So that's how I would say it was going to look and we're going to have some data coming down.

110
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.900
And I think it's going to be pretty cool.

111
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.610
The section here you don't love it.

112
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.010
And we're going to be doing some awesome work.

113
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.460
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

114
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.850
Take your
