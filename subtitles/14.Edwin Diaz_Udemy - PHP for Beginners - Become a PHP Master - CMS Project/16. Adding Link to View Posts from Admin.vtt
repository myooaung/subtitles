00:00:00.510  -->  00:00:06.330
Harm these students in this lecture here we are going to be adding a link somewhere here so that we

2

00:00:06.330  -->  00:00:09.720
can see each of these pools individually.

3

00:00:09.720  -->  00:00:10.040
All right.

4

00:00:10.050  -->  00:00:13.110
I think it's a really issue right now.

5

00:00:13.140  -->  00:00:17.850
If we wanted to see this because we will have to go to the front of the page and click on this link

6

00:00:17.850  -->  00:00:18.770
right here.

7

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:21.570
And that way we can see that Beauce right.

8

00:00:21.630  -->  00:00:28.680
If you want to go back to the to to admin We just click edit post and then view all polls.

9

00:00:28.770  -->  00:00:30.720
I think we need to make a little shorter right.

10

00:00:30.960  -->  00:00:35.750
So let's add a link here that we go and we can see each individual page.

11

00:00:35.750  -->  00:00:36.180
All right.

12

00:00:36.180  -->  00:00:40.370
So now for those of you are wondering where this court is going to win.

13

00:00:40.380  -->  00:00:44.970
Well this course has ended the minute that you learn how to build this system.

14

00:00:45.060  -->  00:00:53.040
Now what actually is going on right now is that I'm trying to make you be creative and make you think

15

00:00:53.040  -->  00:00:55.760
outside the box by creating new features to see a mess.

16

00:00:55.770  -->  00:01:03.510
Right now I want you to also take time to think what can you add to our seat to see a mass to make it

17

00:01:03.510  -->  00:01:04.350
better.

18

00:01:04.350  -->  00:01:09.860
Don't just wait for me to make any lecture for you to think be creative think that way you can become

19

00:01:09.860  -->  00:01:12.830
better play around with it don't be scared to mess it up.

20

00:01:12.840  -->  00:01:17.870
This is the way that we learn by making mistakes and you know it doesn't matter if you make a thousand

21

00:01:17.880  -->  00:01:19.940
mistakes that's what makes you better.

22

00:01:20.190  -->  00:01:21.900
All right so keep that in mind.

23

00:01:21.930  -->  00:01:25.860
Let's go ahead and add this new link.

24

00:01:25.890  -->  00:01:33.130
So right now I mean admin on the score navigation inside the includes folder in admin in the admin.

25

00:01:33.660  -->  00:01:38.660
But I want to go to and actually I have it right here my working files.

26

00:01:38.880  -->  00:01:41.850
So if you have a lot of files here just click on these ads and take them off.

27

00:01:41.850  -->  00:01:44.280
That's not going to delete anything.

28

00:01:44.280  -->  00:01:52.850
I'm going to go to View old posts and what I want to do is right be right here before edit.

29

00:01:52.860  -->  00:01:54.880
I want to add a few posts.

30

00:01:54.950  -->  00:01:57.570
Bache I don't want to put it right.

31

00:01:57.930  -->  00:02:02.490
Besides did the leave because I don't want to make a mistake and delete the post right when I click

32

00:02:02.490  -->  00:02:03.940
on that link.

33

00:02:04.080  -->  00:02:05.960
So I want to make it easy for that.

34

00:02:06.360  -->  00:02:11.260
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab one of these and this is the edit by the way.

35

00:02:11.520  -->  00:02:15.470
Make a little bigger so you can see I'm going to make this.

36

00:02:15.690  -->  00:02:20.610
So this is the edit and I want to make it right before that one is going to copy this whole thing here

37

00:02:21.360  -->  00:02:23.340
and then paste it right here.

38

00:02:23.460  -->  00:02:27.390
I'm going to rename it to view puls view post.

39

00:02:27.390  -->  00:02:34.280
Actually we won t s because it's going to be that individual post and this looks a lot better if I minimize

40

00:02:34.280  -->  00:02:34.680
it right.

41

00:02:34.680  -->  00:02:39.520
I'm just basically zooming this way you can see better.

42

00:02:39.630  -->  00:02:40.070
All right.

43

00:02:40.080  -->  00:02:43.820
Just know that this is not it looks like a mess right now but is not.

44

00:02:43.830  -->  00:02:44.460
Look at this.

45

00:02:44.550  -->  00:02:46.990
It looks a lot better light is right.

46

00:02:47.820  -->  00:02:49.330
All right.

47

00:02:49.810  -->  00:02:51.310
Just wanted to show you that.

48

00:02:51.450  -->  00:02:53.490
I think I have showed you that before.

49

00:02:53.490  -->  00:02:58.260
So if we go back I'm going to say we couldn't control asked for Windows in command.

50

00:02:58.260  -->  00:03:03.970
As for Mac users let's refresh and as you can see the link is right here.

51

00:03:03.970  -->  00:03:08.280
All right if I click on it of course it's going to take me to the edit because we did a copy there paste

52

00:03:08.610  -->  00:03:09.650
copy and paste.

53

00:03:10.050  -->  00:03:16.140
But we need to add another heading right here for it because it's out of place.

54

00:03:16.260  -->  00:03:25.800
So let's go back to let me make sure that I remember my number here where I am I am and the 163 line

55

00:03:25.800  -->  00:03:27.240
163.

56

00:03:27.240  -->  00:03:33.510
So let's go all the way up because we're getting a lot of cold here and actually now the way to the

57

00:03:33.510  -->  00:03:42.880
top right here and right here after date when they add another the head cold.

58

00:03:42.930  -->  00:03:43.660
You post

59

00:03:47.130  -->  00:03:52.500
safe come back here and refresh.

60

00:03:52.500  -->  00:03:58.500
Now we have this going on and this looks a lot better too if I mean a smaller solution.

61

00:03:58.560  -->  00:04:02.910
You see that actually a bigger solution.

62

00:04:02.910  -->  00:04:09.900
So just in case you think this looks that bad it's just that right now I'm just trying to help you see

63

00:04:09.900  -->  00:04:10.370
a better.

64

00:04:10.410  -->  00:04:12.060
Maybe you are in a phone device or something.

65

00:04:12.060  -->  00:04:12.620
I don't know.

66

00:04:12.840  -->  00:04:16.090
So anyway let's go back and ask some functionality today.

67

00:04:16.100  -->  00:04:16.880
All right.

68

00:04:17.400  -->  00:04:20.090
So I'm going to go to 163 again.

69

00:04:20.250  -->  00:04:26.570
This is where I am and here what we want to do is we don't want to go to pulls up BHB anymore.

70

00:04:26.850  -->  00:04:34.110
We want to go outside at the men to our route to dots forward slash and they are going to take this

71

00:04:34.110  -->  00:04:41.020
s out of this post-speech right there and want to take the source tool because I don't need that.

72

00:04:41.820  -->  00:04:48.720
And the ampersand in now is just going to leave the underscore ID and then post identical leave everything

73

00:04:48.720  -->  00:04:52.020
else the same safe.

74

00:04:52.020  -->  00:04:53.340
Come back here refresh.

75

00:04:53.370  -->  00:04:56.840
And if I click on this ID 37 posts.

76

00:04:57.210  -->  00:04:58.340
Actually that was added.

77

00:04:58.350  -->  00:05:01.820
Sorry about that post.

78

00:05:01.830  -->  00:05:04.020
Now we go to the individual post.

79

00:05:04.020  -->  00:05:05.770
Let's go back.

80

00:05:06.090  -->  00:05:09.930
We go see that it's working right.

81

00:05:09.930  -->  00:05:10.770
Perfect.

82

00:05:10.770  -->  00:05:16.830
So I think we're done adding this functionality here and that's going to help you a lot when you want

83

00:05:16.830  -->  00:05:21.080
to go and see what is going on on this specific post.

84

00:05:21.090  -->  00:05:26.250

85

00:05:26.250  -->  00:05:27.040

86
