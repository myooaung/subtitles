00:00:00.660  -->  00:00:01.600
Or write.

2

00:00:01.670  -->  00:00:11.190
So we are here in the index that BHP homepage and I noticed this when I was on one of the lectures and

3

00:00:11.190  -->  00:00:17.580
this is something that we placed there just in case we were from ad man and we click on View Post it

4

00:00:17.580  -->  00:00:20.750
would give us a page like this but we don't need that anymore.

5

00:00:20.760  -->  00:00:26.850
We don't need to check to see if the pulse is available or not and display something right.

6

00:00:26.850  -->  00:00:28.330
We don't need to display anything.

7

00:00:28.410  -->  00:00:29.930
We just don't display the post.

8

00:00:29.950  -->  00:00:30.670
Right.

9

00:00:30.690  -->  00:00:35.910
So again if you don't know what I'm talking about don't worry about it let's just go ahead and delete

10

00:00:35.910  -->  00:00:36.570
it right now.

11

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:43.270
If you have this so I'm going to go to the end it's that's where it is.

12

00:00:43.290  -->  00:00:48.680
And this is on the home page and that's that BHB and I just to take all this off.

13

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:55.810
I'm just going to take all that off and I'm going to make this right there.

14

00:00:55.890  -->  00:00:59.680
If they were to publish then we wanted this play everything.

15

00:00:59.710  -->  00:01:00.190
All right.

16

00:01:00.300  -->  00:01:01.320
And refresh.

17

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:06.270
Actually we made a mistake there let's just put curly bracket there.

18

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:06.840
Refresh.

19

00:01:06.840  -->  00:01:07.410
There we go.

20

00:01:07.410  -->  00:01:08.530
Now that's off.

21

00:01:08.540  -->  00:01:08.940
All right.

22

00:01:08.940  -->  00:01:11.710
Very simple to do.

23

00:01:11.730  -->  00:01:12.380
All right.

24

00:01:12.570  -->  00:01:19.770
So that's just the issue there and it's not out of this world it's just a little thin there but we got

25

00:01:19.770  -->  00:01:21.230
it taken care of anyways.

26

00:01:21.240  -->  00:01:21.700
I'll see you.

27

00:01:21.720  -->  00:01:24.560
And that's fixing a box or issue lecture.

28

00:01:24.570  -->  00:01:25.740
Take care.
