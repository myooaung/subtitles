00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.100
High before we keep going.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:07.320
I want a couple of you to actually know what is a database.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.200
A database is just simply a collection of related data in an organized fashion.

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.360
Now we will be talking about databases a lot in this section so I need you to understand what it is.

5
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.280
Let me just give you a scenario here.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.160
You hoping it sell and you have a spreadsheet ready in front of you.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.430
You have columns and you have rows.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.840
We actually organize data the same way as with spreadsheets we have columns in a database right.

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.460
Well we use tables for that but we have columns and we have rows and we can organize data depending

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.810
on what column it is.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.390
For example first column we can put names in there and then inside those columns inside those little

12
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.650
fields we put the data well a database works just like that.

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.850
And we also have tables inside the database where we use to further organize our data inside those tables

14
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.880
there are going to be very similar to the columns and rows and you can compare tables to worksheets

15
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.440
inside the database.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.350
All right.

17
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.100
Anyways we will be using my rescue l database system.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.740
You can look it up online is very popular is actually one of the most popular database systems in the

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.700
world.

20
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.140
It is actually stands for structure query language.

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.400
The first word m y stands for the daughters name of the Creator.

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.220
Now it's open source.

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.010
I already said that is the most popular out there and it's great for the command station to keep that

24
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.250
in mind let me give you an example of a table inside the database.

25
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.230
Here we have a table called customers.

26
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.380
We have columns as you can see that in a vertical fashion there we have everything in yellow could be

27
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.960
a column.

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.510
And that first column is name.

29
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.620
Well actually the second column is actually name defined as first name and they inside the column we

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.270
have many different data of course of names.

31
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.620
Now rows are the vertical actually the horizontal line across.

32
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.870
That would be a road.

33
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.790
And as you can see they're highlighting their row second row with ID number two that green part.

34
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.810
There you see there is a field that would be the intersection between that column and the row.

35
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.750
Now that you will know and have an example of the table there inside the database is going to be easier

36
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.260
for you to understand everything we do.

37
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.470
When it comes to tables and databases inside our programs this session is going to give you some basic

38
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.580
understanding of databases and tables.

39
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.500
And again to jump.

40
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.520
Your level of understanding to another level is going to jump your understanding to another level.

41
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.650
Anyways I hope my illustration here will help you understand a little bit about databases and tables

42
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.320
and hopefully you will understand more when you see the demonstration on the lectures.

43
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.280
Thank you so much for watching this presentation and I see you on the lectures
