1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,250
Or write perfect we have gone very far and we have added a lot of functionalities to our see a mess.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,350
Now we are here and the profile that BHP and the admin and what we want to do is we want to be able

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,410
to know where we click on this button here and all day to profile we want to be able to update the user

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,330
depending on what values we change right.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,460
So for that we need to go ahead and first detect that we're getting some information from here and then

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,370
we need to run the update query right.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,420
So let's go to that page profile that p.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
And now we need to make a nother check.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,380
Right.

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,810
So let's open another tack here and you can wrap up this into functions if you like you already should

11
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,490
know how to do that.

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,220
All right.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,770
And then we probably will be doing that refactoring all of this in future lectures.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,510
Right now I'm more concerned about you learning how this works.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,780
Like always.

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,980
So right now we want to do is want to check if this function is working.

17
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:10,860
So let's go down and check on the button that is sending this information.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,840
So we see that is very similar to something that we did we did before we users.

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,810
So I'm going to go let's go to that as a user of page actually and check them out real quick.

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,130
We have the same functionality right here why not pull that out.

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,060
Right.

22
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,580
So I'm going to pull this out

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:44,300
and on it added on this core user and it's got to profile and let's just drop it right here.

24
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,760
Perfect.

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,200
Now of course I got to leave this like this for now.

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,280
This would be an extra features.

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,320
What we're going to be adding a really cool picture there and we're going to ask some stars to all of

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:55,600
that.

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,290
But right now I want to finish this.

30
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,930
So we're getting the same functionality here.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,100
I don't think we need to update anything.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,630
I think the only thing that we need to update right here is this user name

33
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:18,480
because we are getting this from here.

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,660
All right.

35
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,250
So if that said were getting that session there.

36
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,180
So make sure that you do that.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,390
So we're going to pull some quotes around here too.

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,830
So right there right there.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,900
Everything else should be the same.

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,210
All right

41
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,670
let's check it out.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,580
So if we get any errors it doesn't seem that we have any errors yet.

43
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,710
Let's call this guy Rickie's of the profile.

44
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,080
Let's check on you you all users and we see that we say Rickie's and he worked.

45
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:06,550
Let's go ahead and go to profiler again they say keys and some crazy name of the profile go back to

46
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,770
all users and we can see that we are all dating that information.

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,810
We didn't really need it to do anything else as we already did all that work before.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,990
So let's go ahead and and just make sure that we fix that guy again.

49
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,410
Right.

50
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:27,400
Reekie whoever that person is and I'm sure he's adamant into the profile view of users.

51
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,820
He's a profile now admin again and he's good.

52
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,110
Right.

53
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,740
Perfect.

54
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,040
Now in the future Les's We also will be adding some functionality as well we know every time we update

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,230
it we need to know if everything went good.

56
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,800
Right.

57
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,060
So those are function of that are extra and they will be covered.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,260
And just letting you know right now so perfect.

59
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,930
We did this very successfully if you were able to do it with me.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,110
Congratulations.

61
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,020
You can see that we have added.

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:07,080
We have done a lot of things to see a mess and I mean all the function ideas here can be very well improved.

63
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,200
And you probably are working on that right now.

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,330
We will be working on the ACM asked for.

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,220
I don't I'm not going to say a long time but we will be adding features all the time there.

66
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,250
I think it is a good system.

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,490
It could be very well improved and it could be something that you could use for your own projects or

68
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,770
even your business making business well that people make you see a message for other people.

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,820
All right.

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,920
If you make something like this for somebody this will be this will be very valuable.

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,600
They will have to pay you a lot of money just to let you know.

72
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,520
But anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

73
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,970
Take care
