00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.270
All right so we know that our form is working because we tested this out on The Last Lecture right.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.920
So now it's time for us to start extracting some of the other fields here.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.470
E-mail the username email and password and convert them into variables and then cleaning them up before

4
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.460
they go into the database.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.110
Right.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.840
So let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.370
This create this user name

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.190
and email and you can create in the variables right now password.

9
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.320
Let's put this here.

10
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.290
All of them.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.780
And if you want to make this nice.

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.040
There you go.

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.280
You're going to copy this right here and put the semi-colon.

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.790
Don't forget that.

15
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.520
Go and just change the keys right.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:10.990
So Matt leave your email and password.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.280
Perfect.

18
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.950
All right.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.460
Now let's clean them up.

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.910
And I'm just going to copy this whole thing again here.

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.970
I'm going to take this more for this off and I get this back here and get this back in now use a function

22
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.490
my ask you apply real escape

23
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.650
if I can spell it correctly that would be nice right.

24
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.650
And this copy this thing all of them would go nice.

25
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.620
Right.

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's use that one there.

27
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.960
So here now forgetting something.

28
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.320
Hopefully you were able to catch me to notice what I'm forgetting here.

29
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.940
All right.

30
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.430
You can post a video and think about it but I'm missing something right here.

31
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.650
And if missing this will this whole thing would not work.

32
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.120
All right.

33
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.500
So if you post a video maybe you usually have to pause a video to know that missing a parameter here

34
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.590
for this function.

35
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.360
Remember that parameter Well misconnection.

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.470
Right.

37
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.780
So make sure that you got that parameter there.

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.580
Now you're going to get an error in saying that you need two parameters.

39
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.440
There we go.

40
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.940
Now we can test this out right here and let's try it.

41
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:54.010
And he's going to write as a user name and then add one for it and when does come and password are used.

42
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.220
And now you can see my user name right here.

43
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.940
All right.

44
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.760
That data is cleaned up he's escaped when he goes to the database.

45
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.340
He's not going to corrupt our database just in case we have some of those hackers entering our Web site

46
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.790
and ARCI a mess trying to find out the groups trying to find our passwords and things like that and

47
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.870
try to inject as you statements.

48
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.110
They don't begin to encrypt the password so that way we prevent those hackers from doing that too.

49
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.440
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see you in the next one.

50
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.220
Take care.
