00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.070
Welcome back my students always said for us to start putting this actually in production.

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.240
Why not production but making sure this works 100 percent for us so I'm going to go ahead and move my

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.420
one of these to here because it's better.

4
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.460
OK.

5
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.590
OK.

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.140
So I'm

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.150
While we want to do if these roles were affected.

8
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.720
Let's go ahead and redirect somewhere right because once we make sure that our hash bash or something

9
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.250
was changed in the database

10
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.110
we can go ahead and redirect.

11
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.050
OK.

12
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.870
So I mean we could if we wanted to

13
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.740
I think we could load the user in by using the logging function if we want to do that right after the

14
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.560
day everything goes good because we have the user name right.

15
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.310
We're pulling the user name somewhere right here.

16
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.270
It's one of the reasons why I was thinking about pulling that but you know we don't have to waste time.

17
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.010
I want to actually redirect the user to the logon page just because I won a massive cheer saying something

18
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.390
like this and you can now log in go ahead and put your username and your password and log in.

19
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.570
I wanted to manually come and do it.

20
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.560
I think it's better than just having them are automatically logged in.

21
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.950
I don't know.

22
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.150
It's just my opinion.

23
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:51.330
So once something is affected there let's just redirect the user to the logon page.

24
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.270
Simple as that.

25
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.230
Log into the HP something.

26
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.220
OK.

27
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900
If it's not effective and

28
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.860
we don't have I think it's going to stay on the same page.

29
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.350
This is back where this is just for us.

30
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.260
You can remove that if you want.

31
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.680
OK.

32
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.040
And you can just remove that.

33
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.240
That's for development purposes.

34
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.030
Now one thing that I want to do is I want to be able to I don't want to allow people to be here in this

35
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.150
form.

36
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.300
In the reset form just because they want to I want them to.

37
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:47.750
If they try to come here and they are now verify then to me get redirect to somewhere else.

38
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.160
So let's actually do that by blessing placing one of these variables on top here.

39
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.220
We're almost ready to take that out.

40
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.720
As a matter of fact we might do it in this lecture ballocks created verified very and said this too

41
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:08.890
falls

42
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:21.230
in let's go down all the way and let's create some type of a statement to.

43
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.740
We don't need this.

44
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.240
Something I was using to show this form or redirect somewhere else.

45
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.070
Let's just see what can we do about it.

46
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.830
All right.

47
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.600
I'm already recreating BHB taxing at it from way guys.

48
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.210
So if it's not verified.

49
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.270
OK.

50
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.530
Then I don't want to show that.

51
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.490
So where were we.

52
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.040
They just put that all the way down here somewhere.

53
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.650
We want to show any of these.

54
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.640
It's going to be and if and if

55
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.200
and if that's OK we're just missing this little semicolon here.

56
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.530
And let's just put an else statement here as well.

57
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.120
Just copying is BHB tax because my editor is not helping me with the autocomplete with the BHB tags.

58
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.360
I haven't set it up yet.

59
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.140
I think I had it one time and I took it off.

60
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:38.210
So let's just redirect Let's use a function here.

61
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.860
I love helper functions because they really allow us to write better code are they more organized so

62
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:56.180
logging that BHP great let's see if this works OK.

63
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.190
That variable right now is supposed to be full.

64
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:08.630
And it's supposed to be taking off somewhere else and it's not OK.

65
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.590
So let's check it out real quick if varify is false

66
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.590
show me to verify this.

67
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.980
I've not read that recked.

68
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.170
What am I missing here.

69
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.770
Let's go up here.

70
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.940
And these are code running.

71
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.760
That is the first question

72
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.450
OK.

73
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.720
Well we have to be fresh.

74
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.000
I think that's fresh here.

75
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.060
And in there.

76
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.110
Let's come back here.

77
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.310
Let's go here.

78
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.060
That's OK.

79
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.450
Let's are called completely.

80
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.570
And there's something I have to face here which is this guy here

81
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.300
hopes and this would be coming from the you or El.

82
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.650
And let's just put this before anything else here verified.

83
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.910
Oh you know what I'm forgetting and that's exactly what I was forgetting.

84
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:31.380
This verify when he just said it's a true song where we're not saying this to troll so it's not working.

85
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.510
So where are we going to be sending this.

86
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:48.940
Well it's it right here my ass you lie as an t close.

87
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.210
OK and verify.

88
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.720
OK.

89
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.510
And it would never it will never get to true.

90
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.180
Let's see.

91
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.430
Let's check it out real quick.

92
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.660
Let's see if it works.

93
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.660
So we set.

94
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.100
Now what I want.

95
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.980
And that's because the other one it's working

96
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.800
this so things here.

97
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.340
We need to change the e-mail

98
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:37.780
right here.

99
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.870
To reflect and get requests OK.

100
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.990
Let's see.

101
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.710
Good.

102
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.970
OK.

103
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.810
Oh another thing that I think I forgot to do is when we are in the forgot

104
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:10.380
when we are seeing this link here we've got three eights so that should be good now.

105
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.560
So let's actually try to application and see if we can make this work.

106
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.110
So courting faculty

107
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.630
ter

108
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.200
we've got the test e-mail when we click on it it's going to take it to take us to that page and we can

109
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.330
see that it's working when we reset the password.

110
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:45.130
Let's just put my name Antar and it's going to take us to log in as you can see.

111
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.540
So

112
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.980
that's fine.

113
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.340
We're redirecting to log in this very well here and then I was thinking about it's not it's getting

114
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.810
lost when something is change here.

115
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.720
OK.

116
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.770
When I mean when something is redirecting we are going to be losing this guy here.

117
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.290
This is not going to even get

118
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.280
get there OK.

119
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.660
So

120
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.040
in reality

121
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:25.900
let's do it again.

122
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.040
And you see come here

123
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.730
on faculty go check the e-mail come back here take on it.

124
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.520
We change our passwords.

125
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.940
Maria.

126
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.080
Maria Antar and we will get redirector here.

127
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.920
So I was not really doing much because we lose it there.

128
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.590
So I mean we can come up with something else but we really don't need it.

129
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.620
If we have this or can we really don't need this guy here OK.

130
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.630
So let's just take that state me out.

131
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.560
It's extra cold.

132
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:09.610
That's not really doing much.

133
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.390
It would be nice.

134
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:12.320
We will be.

135
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:17.560
We will be able to use it if we were actually logging in the user here.

136
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:24.840
And with some of the functionality that I had in my head but we're not doing that.

137
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.710
So let's finish this recording faculty.

138
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.360
And Maria was whoops and this is not working.

139
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.510
So we need to fix this

140
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:56.180
this and see what's going on in that logging page page ok and redirecting back here user name and password.

141
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:56.930
All

142
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:07.930
OK.

143
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.830
We should be logging the user Let's see if now that's supposed to be working right.

144
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.240
Works.

145
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.220
Debug this a little bit and see what what's going on here.

146
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.130
It works.

147
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.290
So we're getting value there.

148
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.480
It's just our log in function that it's

149
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.130
maybe I have the wrong user name.

150
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.630
So I'm going to try.

151
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.330
My name Edwin and that and work on Born to try.

152
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.790
Maria.

153
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.110
And that works ok.

154
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.780
I was just typing in the wrong name.

155
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.730
Sorry about that guys.

156
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.940
As you can see everything is working now.

157
00:11:52.600 --> 00:12:03.580
And from everywhere you can think of we have a double admin area there that we need to fix so let's

158
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:04.570
get going.

159
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.610
Let's go to our navigation

160
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:15.160
and that's in the phone actually.

161
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.410
So we got to navigations here for some reason.

162
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.250
If it's low then we are going to see this.

163
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.880
Else we are going to see this guy

164
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.610
look at this guy here logo.

165
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.390
Oh we haven't checked our logo there on the top.

166
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.380
So let's check it out right now logout and he looks out.

167
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.590
That's cool isn't it.

168
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.960
So it looks like our application is finally working we can add more features and we will be adding more

169
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.460
features so stay tuned for that.

170
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:58.360
Guys I hope you enjoy this section where we are with our forgot password functionality.

171
00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.340
Hope you learned a lot and we're going to be key.

172
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.820
We're going to keep adding more features and we're going to be creating more courses.

173
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.110
And thank you so much for those.

174
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.270
Those of you that support me all the time and write nice reviews and comments.

175
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.790
