Hi welcome back my student.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,510
This is Edwin from the future.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,170
That's right.

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,990
Our already completed the course.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,550
I already finished that project but I come sometimes to help you guys I'll avoid problems in the future.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,010
All right.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,830
Just because I know everything is going to happen in the future because I'm from the future I'm going

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,850
to help you right now.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,770
So I want you to go to your admin underscore Hetter that BHB file and right above here.

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,000
And if you don't you should have this includes function here already but if you don't don't worry about

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,020
it but this should be there of course.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,200
This is our database.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,270
I want you to actually create these BHB tag in these and open it and close it.

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,170
And then in between I want you to write this function down which is called Olby underscore start.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,380
This is output both free and we're going to need this when we are redirecting users are redirecting

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,150
pieces of coding or application later on.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,710
All right.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,920
So make sure that you put it all the way in line with one of your editor again is called Olby underscore

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,970
start.

20
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,990
All right.

21
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:12,300
So when we use a function called Hetter like this later on to redirect that's when we need to turn this

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,690
on.

23
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,450
All right.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,330
So this functions is in charge of sending a request actually buffering our requests in the headers of

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,060
the scripts.

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,560
So that way when we are done with the script it was send everything at the same time.

27
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,820
Right now BHB is sending each requests one by one.

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,460
So if later on we use this function header in the body it would give you an error if you don't have

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,900
this function here because it would try to send out requests in the body when all of the headers are

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,820
already being sent.

31
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,400
All right.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,980
So just remember that we need this right on top of the file.

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,710
All right.

34
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,810
And if your father's and look exactly I don't worry all you have to have is this all the underscores

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,510
start function right here and the admin on the squarehead in the first line.

36
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,030
Right.

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,830
So anyway thank you so much and I'll see you in some next lectures
