1

00:00:00,850  -->  00:00:06,780
All right so we have created a common stable and in of some data in there what we need to do is actually

2

00:00:06,780  -->  00:00:08,190
display that data in the admin.

3

00:00:08,190  -->  00:00:09,660
So let's go to the admin.

4

00:00:09,720  -->  00:00:12,620
If you click on the comments we're not going to see anything.

5

00:00:12,660  -->  00:00:17,610
So what we want to do is we want to have the same amount of information we got here want to have a similar

6

00:00:17,610  -->  00:00:22,890
table like this and we want to be able to do the similar things like we do with this view ports

7

00:00:25,860  -->  00:00:26,700
table.

8

00:00:26,700  -->  00:00:27,470
All right.

9

00:00:27,600  -->  00:00:38,190
So let's go here and what we want to do is copy the page proofs that BHB because this post table has

10

00:00:38,190  -->  00:00:44,110
some other functionality that we care about we like this we need to remove this nice 200 there but any

11

00:00:44,180  -->  00:00:48,330
place we want to copy this and make it come and start BHB right.

12

00:00:48,360  -->  00:00:54,750
Let's do a save as on this page let's call it comments because we want to do some some of the same functionalities

13

00:00:55,260  -->  00:01:02,700
comments that BHB and the default is of course going to be View or comments.

14

00:01:02,720  -->  00:01:03,050
All right.

15

00:01:03,060  -->  00:01:07,590
Instead of your polls of course we're going to make that page right now as a matter of fact let's just

16

00:01:07,590  -->  00:01:10,030
copy this right here.

17

00:01:10,650  -->  00:01:15,080
But let's save this document right here.

18

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:18,130
And all right.

19

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:19,020
That's about it.

20

00:01:19,060  -->  00:01:23,250
That's right now we laid on we we're going to start adding some more cases here.

21

00:01:23,330  -->  00:01:26,340
But let's go ahead and create that in the includes.

22

00:01:26,370  -->  00:01:27,540
Right click on it.

23

00:01:27,580  -->  00:01:35,030
This create a page called view from your comments that BHB you see me creating here in the left say

24

00:01:35,530  -->  00:01:37,520
enter.

25

00:01:37,650  -->  00:01:38,320
All right.

26

00:01:38,580  -->  00:01:44,040
So let's have all the view of polls information there.

27

00:01:44,050  -->  00:01:47,560
So they do control or command a copy.

28

00:01:47,760  -->  00:01:50,510
Let's go to viewer comments and Bastet.

29

00:01:50,880  -->  00:01:54,570
Let's see what we get when we go here to comment.

30

00:01:54,570  -->  00:01:55,730
There we go.

31

00:01:55,770  -->  00:01:58,060
We got some information as we get from all post.

32

00:01:58,080  -->  00:02:00,970
That's a good sign or a very good sign.

33

00:02:00,990  -->  00:02:02,250
That means it working.

34

00:02:02,610  -->  00:02:08,850
All right so I'm going to actually cut this video off here and on the next video we're going to start

35

00:02:08,850  -->  00:02:13,620
building this forum especially for comments right.

36

00:02:13,770  -->  00:02:17,220
This table or the querying everything.

37

00:02:17,220  -->  00:02:21,750
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

38

00:02:21,750  -->  00:02:22,460
Take care.
