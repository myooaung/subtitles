00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.240
Hi welcome back to this student I am from the future I came back to a couple of more lectures because

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
you know I love what I do and I love teaching guys more stuff every single day.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.590
So that way you can gain more knowledge in that big brain of yours.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.340
All right.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.220
Why am I telling you that because you're going to see this and the left side empty.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.060
But don't worry about that.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.960
Just keep following the same pattern that we have been following all along and keep adding files so

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.650
that them for you that you got.

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.560
That's OK.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.030
All right.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.880
Just learn what I'm teaching you right here.

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.590
And then you can do whatever you want with the structure but just keep adding files to that folder.

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.070
Right.

14
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.050
So that's in the lecture today.

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.050
We're going to learn how to actually open a file.

16
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.380
And if we don't have that file we are going to create a file.

17
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.070
All right.

18
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:53.020
So let's work with files let's right click on this and create a new file called Writing opening opening

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440
files that should.

20
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.640
All right let's say it.

21
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.430
There we go.

22
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.310
Now saved.

23
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.850
We got it right here on the left side.

24
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.920
It's actually opened some BHB tags.

25
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.310
All right.

26
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.900
And I realize that some of you might be using a different editor.

27
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.740
That's OK.

28
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.370
All right.

29
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.200
I started.

30
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.090
You can use this is very similar to the brackets editor or two other editors out there.

31
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.920
It doesn't matter what type two you use as long as you can follow along with the code and write BHB.

32
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.650
All right.

33
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.010
So the first thing that we are going to be doing is writing creating a variable because we're going

34
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.800
to save the name of the file that we want.

35
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.110
For example is going to be example t t.

36
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.220
Colin.

37
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.800
All right.

38
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.230
So we're going to use a function call f open and this function we're going to pass two parameters.

39
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.470
First the name of the file and what we want to do with it.

40
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.650
In this case W stands for writing.

41
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.520
So we're going to open the file with intention to write it.

42
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.790
That's what it means.

43
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.800
This function is going to return a handle for us is going to return if we was able to write to the file

44
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.640
or if it was not.

45
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.760
And we going to save that information in a variable call handle.

46
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.510
Then after we open the file it's actually very good to actually close it because that could create problems

47
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.930
if you don't make your application little bit slower.

48
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.790
There we go and we close it right now.

49
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.940
This might work out of the box for Windows users right away.

50
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.370
You might not have a problem but if you are a Mac user like I am or a Linux user and this is this is

51
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.510
a go for your Windows uses to actually listen to what I'm saying because you would probably have this

52
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.240
problem when you go on line in production.

53
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.390
So make sure that your server has rights to write to the file you are pacis server.

54
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.370
So I'm going to go here to Demel.

55
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.410
I'm going to refresh and you can see the file right here.

56
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.040
If I click on it it's going to say permission denied.

57
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.480
That's because Apache those have permission.

58
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.500
So if you have Linux or you in a Mac I yes.

59
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:15.890
For you to actually give you permission so you can look on Google right now is one of my best friends.

60
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:26.450
You can say gif Apache permission to write BHB something like that.

61
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.010
And then you go to this Web site very famous here Apache stock stack overflow.

62
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.940
And it would tell you how to do it.

63
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.510
All right.

64
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.330
Right here is one easy way of doing doing it.

65
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.090
You use a command called C H O W N for change ownership.

66
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.190
All right.

67
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:57.260
And basically it's saying give ownership to this which is Apache and and in the group and a user group

68
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.620
and the user right give permission.

69
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.220
All right so basically you're giving ownership to Apache to this file right here at the end.

70
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.470
And then you're changing permission to 0 7 4 4 OK basically this permission allows you to have access

71
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.170
to that which is 7 7 7 right.

72
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.740
But there is also another way let me also give you another link here let me show you

73
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.320
find a better way.

74
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.560
OK this is one way of doing it.

75
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.850
We can see change ownership Dasch are.

76
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.080
All right.

77
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.560
Oh this is for Apache for Linux users and Mac users for Windows users.

78
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.160
I just watch it because you might need to use that on your production environment.

79
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.520
Right.

80
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.570
But this is how you look for information and you play around with it.

81
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.340
But so we have this problem now right that we can.

82
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.180
I'm going to show you how I'm going to solve it in my computer.

83
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.620
I'm just going to go to the file I'm going to go to them all.

84
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.960
I'm going to right click on them all and get info.

85
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.830
And as you can see right here the permissions only edit has permission to write and read and write and

86
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.940
nobody else.

87
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.820
So I'm going to solve it by giving everybody reading write permission.

88
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.540
You don't want to do that.

89
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.140
All right.

90
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.500
In a production environment just want to get permission to that up to Apache.

91
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.920
So let's refresh here.

92
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.770
But this time I want to show you what it's going to do.

93
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.780
So let me just put this here so you can see so if I refresh it you're going to see the file being created

94
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.640
because right now we don't have the file.

95
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.320
So let's refresh and you can see the example that the HD was created.

96
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.570
Pretty cool stuff right.

97
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.110
So in the next election going to show you some more tricks.

98
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.370
So that way you can learn more about working with files with BHB.

99
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.680
Thank you so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
