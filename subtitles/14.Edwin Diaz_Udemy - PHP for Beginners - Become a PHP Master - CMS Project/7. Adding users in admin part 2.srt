1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,840
All right so we are continuing here.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:10,710
And they add the user that BHB and I just notice that we are not going to be needing this quavery right

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,450
here since we're going to be adding a user Let's go and check it out and see how it looks first.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,230
So I'm going to refresh on this user and we can see that we can add the first name last name admin here

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,360
we don't need this to be doing a query since we are not going to be pulling information we're going

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,790
to be putting in the information.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,290
So we have a user name email and password and user.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,230
Let's go ahead and I'm going to do a couple of things here.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,470
I'm going to take that off first and then we're going to start working with the insert in getting data

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,250
from the form.

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,880
All right.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,490
So let's go ahead and take that.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,290
But what I really want to do I don't want to actually throw this away since we're going to be needing

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,610
this as a matter of fact and we're going to need this you know where in the end user page because we're

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,020
going to be putting information there.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,410
So let's go to the edit underscore user.

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,550
And we're going to put this somewhere here so that where we can use it later right.

18
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,710
So I'm just going to put it here right here.

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,220
You can put it anywhere you want later on we were just going to.

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,560
All right.

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,120
You can even comment it out if you want.

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,210
It's up to you.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,900
I'm just going to put it there for now.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,810
Let's go back to user to the user right here.

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,140
And I tried I took on from here.

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,060
Let me just take it off now.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,710
All right.

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:48,990
But as a matter of fact let me I need this to select and take all the ph out and lead to select because

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,290
we're going to be making some static values here.

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,620
So this one is going to be admin.

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,340
And the other one is going to be subscriber.

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,810
As a matter of fact we're just going to have one option here.

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,240
Well it's have two options for now.

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,430
We will probably activate it later on.

35
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:22,450
But actually now user subscriber I'm sorry subscriber write ups driver and an admin.

36
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,930
All right.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,250
Use a row and ID nothing there let's just see how that looks.

38
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,880
Perfect.

39
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:44,130
But let's just put it another option be above this and just put it to say select options select options

40
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,280
and of the four is going to be subscriber just in case.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,080
Reiver just in case we forget.

42
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,580
All right.

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,530
So let options.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,310
There we go.

45
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,760
All right so let's make sure that we get some data on this forum where we submit it.

46
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,820
We click on it.

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,100
Right now we get no data right.

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,590
So let's go ahead and make sure that we get some data here.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,770
This is a postpaid we might use a lead but we don't know yet.

50
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:24,960
So all right create user that is what we got to check here 3:08 user and I'm going to play some of this

51
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,060
and I'm not even going to take it out.

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:41,040
So let's just for the user id first second list to the first name and you can always put this in the

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,860
site here and that way you can know where you're pulling out.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,540
But we're going to be putting a lot of information out actually from all this information that we've

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,170
got in our form right here.

56
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,670
So let's put this to this side right here.

57
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:01,000
That way we can have a little reference on why we are pulling out right there.

58
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,770
Right.

59
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:10,310
And let's go here make these in a smaller way.

60
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,390
There we go.

61
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,260
All right so we got the first name.

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,240
We've got ID that is not visible there but we are pulling the first name out.

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,840
So we get a user first name the name user last name

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,020
what else use or roll

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,980
this we are going to comment this all right now.

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,820
We just want some basic information for now and later on we're going to be adding some stuff.

67
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,750
All right now let's just concentrate on the big picture here.

68
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,510
Right.

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,940
Big picture.

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,990
Get that big picture e-mail.

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,580
I was just trying to be funny there but if you didn't laugh I failed.

72
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,500
All right so user password.

73
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:12,830
All right.

74
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,190
Perfect user password.

75
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,950
Here we go.

76
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,360
And the date I'm still debating on that.

77
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
But let's just come in that out for now.

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
One two three.

79
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,700
All right so let's we got four and three seven.

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:47,910
Let's go ahead and do some copy and paste here real quick.

81
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,510
This dollar sign right here is a.

82
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:09,020
I think we're doing pretty good progress.

83
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,840
All right.

84
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,640
Save it.

85
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,630
Make sure you save it.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,550
Let's go down.

87
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,850
See we're not missing anything.

88
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,670
That's name for his name.

89
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,190
All right.

90
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,150
Perfect.

91
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,180
All right so let's cut this off right here and the next one let's check it out.

92
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,700
As a matter of fact this let's just check it out right now real quick and let's just see something Eckel.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,940
We're going to equil the first name.

94
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,380
Let's just go ahead and comment on this because we're going to get a narrow if we don't.

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
So this is Square-D right here.

96
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:56,250
So let's come comment all that out and let's see if we can get some information out of it.

97
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,240
All right.

98
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,550
Let's just play whatever here in the user.

99
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:12,700
Was it a user name that we're checking going first name and when and then create an undefined user ID.

100
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,280
All right.

101
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,730
It's sending everything here is user ID is

102
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,140
actually now getting the user ID so we don't need it in the on the form actually.

103
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,720
My bad on that please.

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,100
All right.

105
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,740
So they're doing an echo right there.

106
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:39,630
We getting some information on the next one we're going to be finishing this form and hopefully able

107
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,360
we are able to insert some data in the database.

108
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,350
All right so thank you so much for watching.

109
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,690
And I see your next lecture
