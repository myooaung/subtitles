1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,280
Or write.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,450
So welcome back.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:08,730
Well the last video we did a really cool thing and we started playing some dynamic categories from my

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,520
database for my table right here on the categories right this information with splaying and dynamically.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,300
Pretty cool.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,990
So now the next step is we could actually do different things.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,010
But I want to be able to take it to the meat of the project.

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:31,680
Of course I want to be able to start displaying some of this content here dynamically.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,620
So for us we could do the search engine later and we can do.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,870
We can do this later.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,160
All right.

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,490
We don't need to worry about that now.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,470
Let's do the meat right now.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,740
Call me because he's actually like really important.

15
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,090
So we need to make a table for this first.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,810
All right so let's go to our peach be my admin Let's create another table.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,280
All right.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:03,360
And then just click on CMOS and click create another table called Polsce be all s d s not actually be

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,170
all s ts posts so you can see right there last year is created with seven rows.

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,520
I think we need columns and on this we are going to be saying we need a post ID.

21
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,920
It's going to be an integer and it just makes this a little less where we don't need to see that right

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:30,030
now it's a matter of writing we can click there and you take the whole stream that we go with and it's

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,230
too big here.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,740
All right.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,570
So plus ID is going to be an integer.

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,930
That's why I N T means it's going to be three characters it could go to 9 9 9.

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,510
That's what he means let's make it in that primary and order increment.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,530
Let's create another one.

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,690
Let's call this post Id actually pulls category ID.

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,010
It's fine.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,720
This is going gonna be using this to relate related data.

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,380
This table with another one right.

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,350
So we're going to create relational data relational tables.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,750
All right.

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,390
You can look it up on Google but that's when we relay data to other tables with one table.

36
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:17,130
All right so category ID what else we need we need a post title.

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,540
I think we should put that tile title.

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,400
There we go.

39
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,800
And I wrote it again.

40
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,990
Here we go.

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,750
Let's we're forgetting that we need to put this out of our cars for tets to files to do the math on

42
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,700
this for car.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,740
Actually that's an idea and I'm sorry.

44
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,120
There are cars and that's one of them make it three.

45
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,170
There's a make of our car 55.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,860
And what can we put in that's after the title.

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,650
So we got that.

48
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,090
Actually the author is the first thing on our site right here.

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,870
We don't need to going order by the way we can organize it laid on with BHB.

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,110
But I'd like to do it like this.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,950
I think it's nice to do that.

52
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:05,210
So we have the post title and then we have the author and the date post title plus alter

53
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,990

54
2:55.

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,350
I think Postie was and that's we don't need to do it like that like I said but we're going to use a

56
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,040
date field in that one.

57
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,540
We don't need to provide that.

58
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,790
And what else can we do here.

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:42,120
Post I think let's go back with this post picture and content is the next so Paul's image pulls content.

60
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,150
All right.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,480
Let's make sure that the images are têtes.

62
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,890
Just in case.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,310
And post content is têtes.

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,350
All right.

65
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,390
And I think we're good here and this just clicked safe.

66
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,620
As a matter of fact I forgot something.

67
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:07,240
Let's go back and let's create this post.

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,390
Let's go back to this.

69
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
Check this out.

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,200
Another idea actually let's add two more.

71
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,150
You're going to hear three more actually.

72
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,660
All right.

73
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,950
Because we want to add post tags here so that way we can use the word search engine for keyword look

74
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,750
up and we want to add common council that where we can count to comment for this specific post and status.

75
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,230
All right so we're going to be doing this in order post and we say that the posting the first thing

76
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:48,900
that we need is Polls come and count it no poll tax I'm sorry and I'm asking you and you all the way

77
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,390
over there.

78
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,970
Can you answer me right.

79
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,930
That was not nice right.

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,190
Post comment count and spell status.

81
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,520
All right.

82
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,530
Status.

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:15,230
All right so far card 255 on all of this post tax could be pretty long.

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,940
I don't think we all read 255.

85
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,350
That's fine.

86
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,920
You can make it touch if you want.

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,540
Both status.

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,130
We are going to be using tax.

89
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,180
We could use zeros and ones just to say that I oppose is zero we can deny it.

90
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,540
Well why not.

91
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:38,790
But I got to say if our car to 55 and I'm going to set up the fall for this fall for the polls are going

92
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,800
to be denied.

93
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,420
Right.

94
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,420
Or actually draft draft.

95
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,580
All right.

96
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,610
Actually you know what.

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,270
I'm not going to even do that right now.

98
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,030
We can do that later.

99
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,320
We can said this later like this.

100
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,870
Actually let's do it right now I'm sorry let's do it right now.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,420
Lol you can see how this works.

102
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,780
All right.

103
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,710
So folks that is come and count both stocks were good to go and let's just click safe.

104
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,070
All right.

105
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,850
Perfect.

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,160
Let's go back to our structure and we have everything here is to make sure that everything is spelled

107
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
correctly.

108
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,360
Content posts.

109
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,420
Come and count.

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,050
All right.

111
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,920
I think I do.

112
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,470
Good.

113
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,210
No grammar problems right.

114
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,700
So I think this video is long enough for this lecture here so I'm going to see in the next lecture what

115
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,090
we're going to be doing some more work.

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:35,760
But we on this one here we created the pool table and we added some some of these fields in here some

117
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,370
of these roles.

118
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,750
Right so I think in the next lecture.

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,430
Take care.

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Thank you
