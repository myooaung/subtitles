00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.000
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.670
I want to introduce you to a string functions in HP and I'm not just talking about custom mainspring

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.570
functions I'm talking about predefined string functions.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.110
All right.

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.260
This is the Web site here BHP dot net.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:23.370
As for Slash ref that strings here you will find all the string functions related to HP as you can see

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.700
here there are many and they all do different things.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.910
Some of them do similar things.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.020
Now I want to just give you a couple just show you how to use a couple here so that when you have an

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.420
idea how this works I'm going to use a function to calculate the length of characters in a string.

11
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.860
All right so I'm going to name this string or strings to string actually because we're now going to

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.160
have strings when I have the string with many different characters and you're going to say hello students.

13
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.480
Do you like the class.

14
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.680
Now keep in mind that this file here you will find that when you exercise files 27 on the score string

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.940
underscore a function that BHB.

16
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.390
Now if you have a separate folder and you're doing this in a separate folder on your desktop.

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.100
Just name these strings underscore functions.

18
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.050
OK.

19
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.540
So then you can actually take this template from blank that BHP as we've been doing so far.

20
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.640
So keep that in mind.

21
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.800
So I'm going to use a function here called and that means.

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.890
I can actually use it in the Echo as a matter of fact that you can use the whole thing is going to call

23
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.850
SDR Len and I just put the whole day in that function right here also and just display everything on

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.360
the screen.

25
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.640
If I wanted to I'm just going to go ahead and show you down the browser.

26
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.820
So you are number 35.

27
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.440
All right.

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.280
So as if I cared to see including the spaces.

29
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.720
All right.

30
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.340
That's one.

31
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.090
This is a built in function as you can see is not something that we made.

32
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.660
It's something that BHP already did for us.

33
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.760
And there are many of them are just going to show you a couple here and send you on your way to actually

34
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.990
finding out some more and not another one that I want to show you is go.

35
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.650
Let's just echo it.

36
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.670
It's called SDR are to upper.

37
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.780
This is this mean string to uppercase array.

38
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.020
And grab this and you can have any variable name you want to of course.

39
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.860
And if we can get this that would be nice as you can see everything is in uppercase and right like this.

40
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.570
Perfect right.

41
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750
I mean they are very useful functions that we can use to do different things.

42
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.500
I'm going to copy and paste actually this little piece right here if I can get it done.

43
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.090
And I'm just going to say it's SDR to lower.

44
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.070
That's another one that's just going to lowercase everything.

45
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.370
All right.

46
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.700
So those are a couple of functions there.

47
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.840
There will be a lot more that you can use if you go to the Web site here.

48
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.540
Like I said you can use another functions that of echo called print.

49
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.040
I'm going to show it to you right now.

50
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.360
There are many of them.

51
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.400
I'm just going to look here.

52
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.770
Print.

53
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.500
Print.

54
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.750
Also.

55
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.440
Right here we click on it.

56
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.430
It's going to give us.

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.050
Going to say something here about what it does is actually a real function it is a language control

58
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.390
so you are now required to use parental weights argument.

59
00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.300
And these these are the uses of it just like Echo right.

60
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.420
Nice.

61
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.870
So you can come here like I said this is your L BHB that Neph or slash ref that strings and you're going

62
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.300
to find a lot of them and you can find many example just in case you need to do something with some

63
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.270
strings.

64
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.040
You can come back here and do it.

65
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.740
All right.

66
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.910
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you the next one.

67
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.510
Take care.
