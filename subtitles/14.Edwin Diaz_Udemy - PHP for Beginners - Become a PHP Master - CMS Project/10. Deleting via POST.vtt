00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome back my students on this lecture I want to go over the delete functionality that we have in

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.230
the application to see a mess.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.350
Now as all of you know and if you got to this section here you know this already that we are sending

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.200
a get requests to delete our posts.

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.560
Right.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.440
So when we click here we're going to send a delete with the ID of the posts.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.770
Now if you want to take this live online I suggest to actually changes to post tonight said there's

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.750
a couple of times in the in the course it's safer to have this functionality of the Leidy or editing

9
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.180
or anything like Dabi sent via post.

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.240
Now when I started this course I started this course very it was very small course and I started adding

11
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.420
lectures just to show you everything that we went over in the beginning of the course and just wanted

12
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.340
to show you a bunch of different things.

13
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.510
But as you get further in this course you are going to notice that you don't want to take to make things

14
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.670
more secure.

15
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.050
OK so before you take this on line let's let's look at this functionality now.

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.990
Like I said we're sending this Wii U R L and that's not a very good idea.

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.950
We have the link right here.

18
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.140
OK.

19
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.470
See the link right here.

20
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.870
We send in the police I.D. and all that.

21
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.660
That's beautiful.

22
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.970
I mean we are able to create this beautiful CIMS and we can be creative with it.

23
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.770
But let's make a little bit more secure.

24
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.660
OK guys.

25
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:45.330
So what I'm going to do is right here in this delete button in my view all post page I'm going to create

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.810
a form so we can submit this via post.

27
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.620
All right.

28
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:59.310
So let's break or BHP and well let's open it up here so we can have some functionality below as you

29
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.380
can see there.

30
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.530
OK.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.140
So let's go.

32
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.290
So Phocion I got there.

33
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.270
Let's create a form and this form is just going to have metal post.

34
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.390
OK.

35
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.600
It's going to be a very simple form and then we are going to have an input.

36
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.490
This input is going to be.

37
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.340
Well we need to find a way to send the posts ID to our via post right.

38
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.900
We get to have a button type submit and this really is just going to say delete.

39
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.460
Good.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.630
Now this input here I'm going to use it is going to be a heating input.

41
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.570
I'm going to use it to send the post ID so I'm going to open some BHB tax write in between here

42
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.610
and then I echo out that false ID because we need that in the other side.

43
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.570
OK.

44
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.950
Actually sorry about that.

45
00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.550
We need this in the value.

46
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
So this would be the post ID and here the value is where we get it.

47
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.870
We want one that pulls ID.

48
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.220
OK.

49
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.640
The dynamic one.

50
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.730
Good.

51
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.410
And then we have this input here but we also need to wrap this in a TV because this is inside a table

52
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.190
right like this.

53
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.670
Now we also need to kind of break this here and it really depends how you want this structure.

54
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.210
I'm just structuring like this because I'm showing you about this specific thing but you can structure

55
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.880
your application however you want just to make it look nicer.

56
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.900
And we're just going to stick with the whole thing out.

57
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.740
OK.

58
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.120
Now of course where we want to come in this out now let's see how this looks on the browser.

59
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.860
Make sure you save your document and we have this submit here.

60
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910
OK those are looked up 3D now.

61
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.370
Let's make it so it looks OK.

62
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.150
OK.

63
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.010
So we wanted this to have a value at least of the lead.

64
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.830
And we wanted this to look a little better.

65
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:33.360
So let's add a class let's call it B team in between primary actually let's make it danger so that way

66
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.510
just read.

67
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.880
OK.

68
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.830
So at least we have that.

69
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.980
And now you can style this however you want.

70
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.750
Like I said you're welcome to store this as those bonds have swelled to like the edit.

71
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.820
OK.

72
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.750
So you can style.

73
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:58.290
Let me just show you real quick was at it that it should be right here.

74
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.290
So we can just make the error real quick.

75
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.830
Joe's

76
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.730
Vittie and

77
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.200
did I break the line.

78
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.150
Yes I broke it.

79
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:21.780
I need single quotes between what was on in full or something like that.

80
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.590
Just to make these bones a little nicer.

81
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.920
OK.

82
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.900
OK.

83
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.230
So let's go.

84
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.860
And

85
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.570
now that we have this function idea we're going to be sending this we need to catch it in the Where

86
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.550
we going to catch is right here.

87
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.810
So instead of doing the lead good we're doing the post.

88
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.670
We're also receiving the false ID here.

89
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.440
So in this case we're just going to see posts ID.

90
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.700
OK.

91
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.700
And that should be it.

92
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:04.570
We don't need to scape anything because this is coming from inside our application.

93
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.840
I mean if you have somebody inside your application already sending you stuff.

94
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.130
I mean they they can leave whatever they won here.

95
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.820
But you know what let's just leave it there.

96
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.690
Who knows right.

97
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.970
Maybe you have somebody inside your application that want to draw up a database or something but that's

98
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.550
fine.

99
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.720
Let's see how this works with click delete and you can see that this works OK.

100
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.260
So just there you see here we don't have any.

101
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.410
We're not sending any get requests.

102
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.180
So everything is very safe.

103
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.690
Nobody can come from outside these application and delete your items here.

104
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.880
Even though we're still doing a lot of checking before that happens.

105
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.440
But you know just to be safe is better to do it via post.

106
00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:02.680
And while I'm here I might as well use fits the other bun that we that we have which is this guy here.

107
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:14.770
And I'm just going to make this guy close the team and you know what this one could be primary.

108
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.610
This one could be blue.

109
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.460
Save it and refresh.

110
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.470
Now they look a lot better and you king.

111
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:29.970
He also changes numbers here too to be like some type of icon or some type of you know just style the

112
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.730
way you want.

113
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.040
But this looks a lot better.

114
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.240
We can view our polls.

115
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.320
We can edit and then we can delete them now via polls.

116
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.590
Now I suggest you could do that to the rest of your application.

117
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:50.100
You can do that to categories you can do that to users make sure that your application is secure he

118
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:55.940
has all the polls has all the really important functionality via post.

119
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.910
Anyway thank you so much.

120
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.860
I hope you enjoyed it and I see you in the next lectures.

121
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.290
Take care
