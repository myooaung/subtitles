00:00:00,310  -->  00:00:03,000
All welcome back my students.

2

00:00:03,030  -->  00:00:09,390
So if you're here is because you won one of the reasons could be because you want to learn how to you

3

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:15,570
know display this up here and other racing is you already know how to do this but you just like to listen

4

00:00:15,570  -->  00:00:16,240
to me.

5

00:00:16,410  -->  00:00:17,560
And that's pretty cool.

6

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:20,250
And I you know I agree with you.

7

00:00:20,260  -->  00:00:21,990
I like to hear myself sometimes.

8

00:00:21,990  -->  00:00:22,630
All right.

9

00:00:22,920  -->  00:00:27,160
Another reason could be just because you are curious to see how I do it.

10

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:28,670
Whatever you're missing is.

11

00:00:28,950  -->  00:00:30,220
Let's do it.

12

00:00:30,360  -->  00:00:30,950
All right.

13

00:00:31,050  -->  00:00:33,090
So let's go ahead.

14

00:00:33,090  -->  00:00:35,480
All right so I told you that you can put this in a session here.

15

00:00:35,490  -->  00:00:37,710
This is the way I would do it right.

16

00:00:37,770  -->  00:00:41,550
So I would grab all this cold right here and just I would just cut it out of here.

17

00:00:41,550  -->  00:00:43,120
We don't need a year right.

18

00:00:43,590  -->  00:00:47,690
So we can just go to functions if I can remember where I put it.

19

00:00:47,730  -->  00:00:48,180
Right here.

20

00:00:48,180  -->  00:00:49,330
That would be nice.

21

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:51,690
And we could say we can just put a function here.

22

00:00:51,690  -->  00:00:55,810
CALL IT users on line.

23

00:00:56,070  -->  00:00:58,330
That's a cool name for a function which you think.

24

00:00:59,330  -->  00:01:05,330
And we just put all that code in there like that perfit right.

25

00:01:05,930  -->  00:01:14,270
And here we don't have to set any sessions or anything we can just return.

26

00:01:14,490  -->  00:01:14,970
All right.

27

00:01:15,030  -->  00:01:17,910
Like this return the kÃ¼ng user.

28

00:01:17,910  -->  00:01:19,210
All right.

29

00:01:19,240  -->  00:01:20,180
Beautiful.

30

00:01:20,220  -->  00:01:28,450
So now everywhere you want to use a search function here you can go let's say Adamy navigation and Redhill

31

00:01:28,460  -->  00:01:34,010
Homeside right below right before Homeside right here.

32

00:01:34,680  -->  00:01:43,770
We can call a function so I'm just going to put a lie here whoops like that and I'm just going to say

33

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:45,630
users on line.

34

00:01:46,270  -->  00:02:01,030
Knishes do it with a lowercase users on line that would go Kallen BHP or call you on line.

35

00:02:01,040  -->  00:02:01,730
All right.

36

00:02:01,900  -->  00:02:08,860
And now if we go back here and we say Enter Well it's all Caraquet I see what it is.

37

00:02:08,940  -->  00:02:12,820
I forgot to get my connection there.

38

00:02:13,050  -->  00:02:17,620
All right don't forget that no connection.

39

00:02:17,960  -->  00:02:19,830
We go Antar

40

00:02:22,440  -->  00:02:28,220
Now you can see that my function is working really cool right now.

41

00:02:28,260  -->  00:02:29,310
Let's go back to that.

42

00:02:29,310  -->  00:02:34,610
And let's just make sure that we take that out of there and save it and come back here

43

00:02:37,620  -->  00:02:41,700
and also take this out of your head we go on.

44

00:02:41,790  -->  00:02:47,010
And that's let's come back here after.

45

00:02:47,180  -->  00:02:47,700
All right.

46

00:02:47,700  -->  00:02:48,540
Perfect.

47

00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:53,660
So now let's go back to the fire fight I'm going to refresh and firefights.

48

00:02:54,150  -->  00:02:57,630
And now you could see that this counting number is counting.

49

00:02:57,630  -->  00:03:03,320
All right let's go to safari in mind and to refresh safari.

50

00:03:03,390  -->  00:03:04,540
I'm going to refresh your.

51

00:03:04,540  -->  00:03:07,470
Now you can see that he's actually counting the users.

52

00:03:07,470  -->  00:03:10,590
This is a pretty cool function don't you think.

53

00:03:10,710  -->  00:03:16,080
And one of the best thing is that you can actually change the color of this link here and just you know

54

00:03:16,320  -->  00:03:18,700
just me know how many users are on line.

55

00:03:18,730  -->  00:03:20,400
At one point of time.

56

00:03:20,520  -->  00:03:27,960
Another great thing about this is is that you can come here to your users online and look at your structure

57

00:03:27,960  -->  00:03:33,530
here and you can do all the modifications or make this a lot better than what it is right now.

58

00:03:33,780  -->  00:03:34,440
All right.

59

00:03:34,830  -->  00:03:38,490
You are keeping track of the users that you have.

60

00:03:38,490  -->  00:03:39,190
All right.

61

00:03:39,480  -->  00:03:45,150
And this time you are you know the amount of users that you got the number of users in the time you

62

00:03:45,150  -->  00:03:47,610
are in your system.

63

00:03:47,610  -->  00:03:50,870
So now you can be creative here and do other things with it.

64

00:03:50,880  -->  00:03:52,660
All right with this information.

65

00:03:52,680  -->  00:03:57,870
So anyway hopefully this information will help you create better applications.

66

00:03:57,990  -->  00:04:03,220
And it was a really good pleasure for me to create it for you and show you how to do this.

67

00:04:03,570  -->  00:04:10,940
Thank you so much for all your reviews and all your great messages that you send me over e-mails and

68

00:04:10,980  -->  00:04:12,230
discussion boards.

69

00:04:12,240  -->  00:04:15,270
You are awesome and I'll see you in the next lectures
