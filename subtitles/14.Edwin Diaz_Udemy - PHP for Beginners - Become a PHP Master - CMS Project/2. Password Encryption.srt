1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,510
I will come back on this video.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,990
We're going to be concentrating on making our application a little bit more secure by encrypting the

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,890
passwords the users type in this field.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,480
Now if you think about it we're already making these secure here.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,000
We're making this feel secure against database statements ex-U.S. statements.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,010
So if for some reason the user can't see here and say you know I don't want to insert anything into

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,320
his database I want to find out the username and password of the users.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,790
I want to find other information they're going to come here put a software to scan this page and put

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,700
thousands and thousands of usernames and passwords every second.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,110
Right.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,850
They will find out your password even if it's something that has a couple of characters and if it's

12
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,690
not a password like this the hacker will find out your password.

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
So now we know that users are not going to type these passwords this long right with all the different

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,970
characters.

15
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,540
It's almost impossible to do that unless you have a password management software.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,730
So we are going to make the password this long and we're going to make that possible with numbers and

17
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,320
symbols for the user.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,060
Now we are not going to change their password they'll give me wrong.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,020
They will still have a password like this but when he goes into our system is going to be really long

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,210
POS was going to be a really long password is going to be longer than this with numbers and symbols.

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:20,970
Right.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,150
It's not going to change there.

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,790
It's just going to reference that file.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,880
Now that that well that record.

25
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,600
Now if you see here we have a problem at passwords when we encrypt is going to be longer than this.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,350
As a matter of fact right now we cannot go over certain characters he believes 32 characters we need

27
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,300
to change his field to go to over twenty two characters or thirty two characters.

28
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,210
So let's go ahead and go and click on structure.

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,170
We are in the user stable right here in the logging app database uses table structure.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,400
Then we're going to change this by clicking here.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,910
Change when it changes to 200 white to run.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,640
And that's just a number that I wanted you know want to use you can use 100 if you want but I want I

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,110
think is a good number.

34
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,300
You just click safe.

35
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,400
And now we are good to go.

36
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,850
So why do we want to do so.

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,320
The first thing that you should know is that we will be using a function called crypt.

38
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,790
This is the page right here the manual so you can come and read it.

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:31,080
Now using crypt the crypt function along with just a password will create a combination of characters

40
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,540
so he will encrypt it.

41
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,360
But then he would create something really weak.

42
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,700
All right.

43
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,990
And we don't want to do that.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,270
So we want to create something actually stronger so we need to use another parameter called assault.

45
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,270
Now this would be any type of string that equals to a certain amount of characters and we will see that

46
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,670
when we're building it but know that the major function that we will be using script.

47
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,260
And you can pass it a different parameters just to make it stronger.

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,850
Now they have different terms here for this type of format.

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,890
We're going to be using this here called Blowfish and this is the format right.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,470
This is a hash format that we will be using.

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:18,290
And they change right and you will see that if you go down here a little bit you'll see that these four

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,840
men understand the s right has r r l hash for me.

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Here if you use that then you will create a different result and if you use this format and this format

54
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,830
here which is dollar sign one and Dollar say we will be using this one here a dollar sign to a dollar

55
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,070
sign 0 7 dollar sign.

56
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,510
All right.

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,690
Just know that and this will be the result as you can see here.

58
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:55,500
This study will produce a pass with this short here with different numbers and dots and letters and

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,940
this one would produce this.

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,060
And then the five is the one that is very common commonly used.

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:07,810
Now we're now that we are in a different version Asmat Let me show you how to look into that right now.

62
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,000
This video here localhost.

63
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,230
Click on that.

64
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,700
Go to PH be in full and you can see that we are in five point 6.3 version of BHB that's where we are

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,450
using the newer version by it's on your watch and is you probably using another version but we are using

66
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,630
a new way in you API than the the one from before.

67
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,420
An empty file was very commonly used to commonly use and a lot of Warper sites.

68
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,750
Now we will be using Blowfish which is a lot longer than that as you can say you can tell.

69
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,580
All right.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,660
The government I believe the government is using this all right now and this look at this one this is

71
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,990
crazy.

72
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,450
This will extend the screen shot 512.

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,900
Right.

74
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,850
So let's go ahead and start using this right away.

75
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:03,150
So let's go to our function that my ask you under remember that we are on their my school directory

76
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,680
and their functions.

77
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,540
All right.

78
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,480
So this first thing that we will create is the hash format.

79
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,820
Let's do that just create this hash and this call that format

80
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,460
right.

81
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,870
And it has a format that we will be using is the

82
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,800
show you right here

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,460
too why Actually this is the more secure right now right here.

84
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,830
Five point three point seven and later you use it to why.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,510
So let's use that instead of the two.

86
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,120
A.

87
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,900
All right.

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:49,010
And I just know this because I read somewhere that this documentation and we've got to use it with numbers

89
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,010
after it.

90
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,980
And just to tell how many times it will run.

91
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,780
All right.

92
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,790
So let's go ahead and use that and then just put what we're supposed to put 7.

93
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,780
But I know that we need to put 10 because or more says this will tell.

94
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,760
This hash format many times tell the crypt function many times it will run the hash.

95
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:18,850
So this will change this would be like a lottery type of system where you will put a number and all

96
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,300
the balls we go around certain times right for a certain amount of minutes and then you will get a different

97
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,110
result every time you get a ball.

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,900
Well this would be very similar to that.

99
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,480
This was run every time he runs it would create a different result for the hash.

100
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,090
And right now Ades going to run 10 times right.

101
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,910
And let's go ahead and create the salt and this could be any amount any amount of strings you want.

102
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,510
Right so you can create as a matter of fact there has to be at least 22 characters.

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,030
Right.

104
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,620
So the salt is a string it could be anything you want but it has to be at least 22 characters.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,230
I'm going to use something that I know that will work.

106
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,520
So I use some crazy strings.

107
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,870
This is something I made up twenty two.

108
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,290
I think this is 22 characters.

109
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:12,820
One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22.

110
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,570
All right.

111
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,190
Now we will need.

112
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,070
We need to put both of these together to pass it into the crypt function and she's going to say hash

113
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,770
and salt and actually hash four sold.

114
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,900
But then she's going to put a little effort there.

115
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:43,530
I don't want to make this too big and it's going to put us in a cutting navel for them together.

116
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,780
Right.

117
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,360
This is just going to make it really extra secure when we pass it into the crypt function.

118
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:58,520
And now we will pass it in and we will say something like encrypt and you can put whatever you want.

119
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:08,550
I'm just making this up this very well here because I'm going to use it with the function correct.

120
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:08,900
Right.

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,080
And then we pass it in the password.

122
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,260
This is a password that they use is going to be typing so we pass it in.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,660
But this is first this is the first parameter.

124
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,710
This function is going to take.

125
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,250
And then we pass in the hash.

126
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,220
And salt here.

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,510
Right.

128
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,770
Perfect thing we're done with this.

129
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,400
All right.

130
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,590
So this would do that.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,620
Now this.

132
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,070
OK.

133
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,970
So let's just go ahead and rename this to password because we will be using it right here so we don't

134
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,680
have this user name when it comes down.

135
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,990
It's now going to find his password.

136
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,120
There's just going to type.

137
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,420
It's going to keep going with this.

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,250
We need to rename And remember this goes from the top to bottom so when he finds his variable He is

139
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,770
going to put it in here.

140
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,610
OK.

141
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,940
So this I think we're done here.

142
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,360
We don't need to do anything else.

143
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,020
We are scaping as well.

144
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,420
And then we are encrypting that password with icons from there and later putting it in here.

145
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,360
So that's going to work really good.

146
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,340
So now I think we're good to go.

147
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,810
Let's go to our create so we make sure that we have the right so we are good here in the database with

148
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,470
two on your characters here.

149
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,960
Let's just refresh this a little bit.

150
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,340
All right.

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,920
And let's just type in.

152
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:39,100
I don't know my user name Edwin D.S. and I'm just going to type 1 2 and 3 create record create it let's

153
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,000
go and look in the database and see what happens.

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,140
Actually we need to go to the user's look at this.

155
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,590
I just typed one two and three and look at the type of possible we got the other side.

156
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,690
Isn't that beautiful.

157
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,210
This is beautiful isn't it.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,210
So we did go over the characters here.

159
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,020
All right.

160
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,380
As you can see here we made this possible oblong that we can use more characters if we go here and we

161
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,940
use the Shah.

162
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,770
I think it was all the way down was it.

163
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,090
We in the right place.

164
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,590
Yes we are the one second right here.

165
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,950
We could use the shower if we wanted to.

166
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,270
We can use it just doesn't make short steps here.

167
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,580
But I'm not going to use in this one here I think we're good with this one.

168
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,250
This is actually the best one says it's really slow.

169
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,460
So it's going to take us.

170
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,780
So we're have to wait until we start the process of this pass or here.

171
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,020
So you see that 10 times that we run it through it.

172
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,300
That's why he's low because he has to go and run it 10 times to change I want two and three.

173
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:54,830
And that software if we do this one time that would be very quickly for the hacker software to to check

174
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,990
on this field.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,320
But we make it 10 times harder for them.

176
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,270
Basically we make it impossible with this format here.

177
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,580
All right.

178
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,010
So anyway I hope you learn how to encrypt passwords.

179
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,390
If you did not for some reason get this Misha we want the video watch or a couple of times I'm pretty

180
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,650
sure you would get it right.

181
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,350
So anyway thank you so much for watching.

182
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,210
Hopefully this will make your application.

183
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,630
And I know it will make your application a lot more secure.

184
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,210
Again I'll see you in the next lecture.

185
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,890
Take care.
