00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.790
Guys so we got to start getting a little creative with our functionalities because if we go back here

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.260
we don't want to buy NCEA.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.570
We want this to be dynamically generated painting of if dispose was liked.

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.250
OK.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.410
So we're going to create a couple of helper functions that are going to help us do that.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.230
You guys ready.

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.830
OK let's do it.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:32.660
So the first function that I want to create is maybe the logged in user ID that would be very useful

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.460
to have because of want the tech they use or that's actually logged in OK and maybe a function also

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.250
called something like the function that the text they use or like the Poles.

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.280
So what I want to do is I want to go to functions if I remember where I put that thing.

12
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.390
The admin I put in an admin.

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.170
OK.

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.030
Whew.

15
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.990
OK what I'm going to do is I'm going to put it all the way up here and it's nice to know that we have

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.160
some some function that I created there.

17
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.640
Ok just making sure.

18
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.500
OK.

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.040
You know it's very useful to actually organize these files to make sure that you you know clean the

20
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.380
spaces and make this a little better if it's like this just checking to see what functions I have.

21
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.310
I have to remember you know not to write something that I already have logged in user.

22
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.520
If you already have a function that will help you with this.

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.120
Don't bother too much.

24
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.050
So right here on top I'm going to start creating these functions.

25
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.020
And maybe after they're logged in here it makes a lot of sense.

26
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.760
OK so let's create this.

27
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:55.790
And let's see how we are going to attack this so I'm going to call this logged in user id just like

28
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.080
to OK.

29
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.860
So how can we detect the user.

30
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.930
Well we have a session right.

31
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.740
So you can see right here.

32
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.160
So I can just copy this and I can tell if this is set right there we are.

33
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.840
Well first of all we need to make sure that it is set before we even play around with anything.

34
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.490
OK.

35
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:27.960
So what we could do is instead of using this whole thing here make sure that you know that let's just

36
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.480
use a function like this.

37
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.680
If it's locked then.

38
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.480
OK.

39
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.180
Because this function is checking if he says so mousehole just use a function and you will find out

40
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.950
later if it works right for us.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.340
If he doesn't then you know we do something else.

42
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.820
One function that I really want to create guys is want to make the Kohary that I don't see here

43
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.930
to make that query instead of making a query and put it in the connection all the time and include in

44
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.850
doing this global thing here which is should have just a function to to help us with that.

45
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:16.260
And I told I did have one maybe I didn't have in another course Mexi Querrey and I don't have that.

46
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.640
Let me check confirm Querrey we have that we don't have that.

47
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.800
So let's let's actually create one here before we go any further because I really don't want the hassle

48
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.500
of writing a whole bunch of things just to make a connection to our database.

49
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.910
So let's use Querrey and disfunctions is going to return.

50
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.280
It's going to have the global

51
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.510
connection

52
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:59.800
OK and all we got to do here is return the my ask you Ally Querrey with the connection and is going

53
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.790
to have some type of query.

54
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.390
So make sure that you give it a query there OK.

55
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.640
That's all this this is doing here.

56
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.180
Here helps us make sure that this is tight OK.

57
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.710
You can put your comments there.

58
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.280
Two guys.

59
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.680
All right.

60
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:30.680
So let me just put this I like to put my Like core functions on top by the really important ones.

61
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.480
OK.

62
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.810
So look the user ID.

63
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.780
How are we going to do this.

64
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.070
Well the first thing we need to make a Querrey right.

65
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.080
So I'm just going to save this in every so variable and I'm going to use my function that I use created

66
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.330
which is going to be make things a lot easier.

67
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.960
Right.

68
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.820
And now the query is going to be select

69
00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:02.280
all or we can just select a user name we want to from users so we're going to select the users.

70
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.260
Where I can with the tactics the user name is equal to something

71
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.700
and we have another function a text a user

72
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.150
user name but that's OK.

73
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.400
We need it in you right here.

74
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:37.160
So we can concatenate it right here and we need a single called there because it's going to be a string.

75
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:49.670
Let's end it with another single call here like the OK and now here which is say session and the session

76
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.300
is going to be user name because remember that every time I use it it gets logged in.

77
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.880
We do that.

78
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.750
OK.

79
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.620
So in the next lecture we'll finish this off.

80
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:08.880
But what I want to do what I want you guys to do is I want you to remember how we do a query right.

81
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.580
Fetch you know fetch an array get the result.

82
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:19.510
Make sure that it resoled the number of rows is bigger than one or equal then one and returned a user

83
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.120
id do that and I'll see you in the next lecture because that's what we're going to do in the next one.
