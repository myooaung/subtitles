1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,170
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,550
We are going to be learning about as an injection and you might be asking yourself why in the world

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,970
is Escuela injection as well.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:19,140
Well it's a technique basically that people use attackers to attack our applications on the Web for

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,640
example.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,210
They can come here and put a statement here for example something like this and they say drop table

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,930
and something like this.

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:37,820
Right.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,310
So they use a statement like this and they can go ahead and when they submit that that can go into our

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,510
database and it can actually delete the database you know.

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,060
Now there are many of these techniques out there they can do a lot more than this.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,680
This is just a little stretch on the surface these people.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,380
That's what they do every single day.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,450
They look for techniques to attack on your web sites and they will destroy you.

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,260
They will show you applications.

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,680
Now this really here is just to help you clean out some of these data.

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:20,430
Sanitising And how are we going to do that will BHB actually made a function for us called my ask well

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,160
I underscore real scale the string.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,520
And what a Funches going to do is going to just going to clean things up.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,700
Right now if you go to this little application that we made here and you say something like Edwins courses

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,840
are great for example right.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,540
And you put this little Komer right there right.

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,210
And you put some tatts and you you're trying to create that director is not going to allow us.

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,560
And that's because we're not scaping this you see.

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,830
So right here this application right now is very proem for that for people to attack.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,730
They can come here and put in an Easter statement and they could delete all databases right in tables.

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,190
So to prevent it let's go ahead and do something.

28
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:22,230
So I'm going to go and let's go to functions on under my S Q L directory under that directory go there.

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,750
You show out of my school folder and go there and go to functions.

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,220
All right.

31
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,020
So what we want to do is we want to clean up the data before we go to the database.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,430
So we want to clean up the user name because that's what we're using in the create application we've

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,450
got there right is user name field and it's PP-ASEL field other two stream fields.

34
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,090
We got we need to clean them up.

35
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,010
We need to sanitize them scapes some strings before it gets to the database.

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:59,100
So how we do that is by going to go to that function right here.

37
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,280
So the way we do that is by cleaning this up and the way we do that it's actually used a function that

38
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:12,810
BHP offers us and we are going to be using the same user name I said my if I let me just type the function

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,220
first.

40
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,820
So you could see my Eskew L..

41
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,750
I remember this is there is a mass my.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Q Well out there but that's the old version or I were using the new version just to.

43
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:34,210
This is what we've been using all this time all righteous for your information scape and string.

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,390
There we go.

45
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,850
So this is a function here that is going to help us out.

46
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,710
And I'm just going to type it again.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,230
You will copy and paste it there and it's got to take two parameters.

48
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,640
First it's going to take our connection variable right here.

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,910
OK.

50
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,730
And we don't need this.

51
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,420
Actually I was just going to show you that in these two parameters.

52
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,210
And the second parameter would be where you want to clean where you want escape right there.

53
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,820
So then I'd do two for the user name one for the boss or another one coma and then put the password

54
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,010
there.

55
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,720
OK.

56
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:23,200
And I'm also going to assign it to a to this variable here so like that and the user name also.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,170
So that way we can use that variable right here for when he goes he is already sanitiser right.

58
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,250
So

59
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,540
let me just make it bigger so you can see what I'm doing.

60
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,310
All right.

61
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
So we got everything going here which is good.

62
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,790
You see what I did.

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:50,010
So I use this function here to escape all the data inside that field.

64
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,500
So when we have coal miners or any type of other parentheses or any type of data they're going to clean

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,190
it up for us and we're going to make a nice need to go in here.

66
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:05,680
So once we clean it up here with this function then I must sign in the same function back to the user

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,270
name so that where we can put it inside the database to here and using the same thing for the password.

68
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,980
All right so now we should be good.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:22,200
Now if I try to do that create that Colma that I did with Edwins great coarse string which should work

70
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,500
now.

71
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:29,070
So let's try Edwins great courses are great right.

72
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:36,470
Some pass where you're going to click Create and you see how it works.

73
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,430
Now I can go to the database should be there.

74
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,920
Let's go to the database.

75
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,770
Should be I'm a Ph.D. my admin right there.

76
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,120
All right.

77
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,570
So as you can see here says those courses are great.

78
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,380
All right.

79
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,900
We can check.

80
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,750
You can check that it is working by just going back to the functions and

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:20,610
we can come and go and you can see that we can try to again just to make sure and just try something

82
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:20,920
else.

83
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,000
Peters we go create when we get this error.

84
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,380
All right.

85
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:37,110
And this comment is I like to try things a couple times just to make sure and then just go to that far

86
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:45,320
again and try Peeters create recreate it refresh.

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,740
We gather record here clean up.

88
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,420
All right.

89
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:59,530
So all of this stuff is going to affect or as Cuil our database and tables inside as my eyes.

90
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,050
All right.

91
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,900
So anyway thank you so much for watching this.

92
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,740
Hopefully this will help you make your application a little bit more secure.

93
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,880
And thank you.

94
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,020
I'll see you the next lecture
