00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,040
Welcome back my students I hope you guys are having a really good day today.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,680
OK.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,300
So if you have never checked my announcements in the courses make sure that you read them sometimes

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,110
I really give really useful tips about your career life and etc..

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,770
OK.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,190
So let's go ahead and continue on what I want to fix something real quick right now since we moved the

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,510
logon page which was in site includes show you right now where it was.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,660
It was inside this includes folder says we move here.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:38,160
Remember there are sidebars actually our form values are going to form that path right here and now

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,060
it's not there so what can we do about it.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,760
But this is the thing since this is here.

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,090
OK.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,730
We need the functionality in the in that space something that gets the value there because every time

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,440
this refreshes it is going to take value from where he's actually included.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,320
So we can just take this action.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:09,660
I took you out with our values and make a redirect to the same page which is in it's and let's actually

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:17,940
call this here and we can just write some PH BE code here and use a couple of our functions like if

18
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,260
it is method post then we can do something right.

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,170
Well

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,070
let's actually check to see what functions we have to help us out a little bit more.

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,590
We have another function here.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,630
We have this go up if it is Mentha if he's logged in.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:49,150
And that's that's going to help us natural certain things natural that form so we're going to use that

24
00:01:49,180 --> 00:02:00,100
and in a minute and let's go and let's see OK let's go back.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,610
So what I want to do is I want to check if it's set.

26
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,650
Let me just check for the log page.

27
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,100
I think we have that code there.

28
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,220
There we go.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,430
Let's go to that here.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,280
Let's just base that in there and then we're going to be using that code as you can see.

31
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,140
And if you want to go further you can go ahead and make this more reusable by you know including this

32
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,850
you know and the whole function.

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,650
That way you don't have to do this.

34
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,440
You can just put a function here and we'll do it for you and you call this a little cleaner.

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,460
OK.

36
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,650
So that's up to you.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,440
So this of course is going to redirect to this page.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
OK.

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,350
And we could just say in here.

40
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,860
I think these would do the trick.

41
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,690
Let's go back

42
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,630
go.

43
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,130
And if it's something gone wrong here it goes back to that page.

44
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,420
Great.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,010
So that's working there.

46
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,230
What else do we need to do.

47
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:16,390
Let's actually make sure that it is working let's make this Logan right.

48
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,540
We go slow then let's logout.

49
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:29,570
So we need a buy in here or some type of link that would take us to another page where the user can

50
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,010
you know we said their password.

51
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,280
So we need to build that page from scratch and what I'm going to do is I'm going to include that code

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,100
here.

53
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,370
OK.

54
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,210
In this lecture.

55
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:48,990
So let's go and build that page right now and then you can just copy or download the code from this

56
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,370
lecture

57
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:00,900
I'm going to make create this in the front on it and see a mess in the main directory.

58
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,090
And I got to call this Forgot

59
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:14,130
forgot I just forgot you can name and whatever you want you can name it forgot password just to make

60
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,460
you a little bit more meaningful.

61
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,800
If you guys know how to use good already go ahead and start using it.

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:31,590
OK make sure that you're saving whatever you are creating get it's just version control is just a software

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,420
that allows you to save every version of your application.

64
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,430
OK.

65
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,000
And I have done some of my courses.

66
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,650
So anyway I'm going to copy a page that I got

67
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,010
which I'm going to provide to you in this lecture.

68
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,500
So make sure that you download it and we're going to be writing a lot of code in this

69
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,680
in this couple of lectures because we need to set a lot of things.

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,210
I'm just going to take this off

71
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,940
OK.

72
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm going to include this on top.

73
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,390
And let's check out to see how this page looks.

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,340
Come back here.

75
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,130
Got BHP.

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,930
And as you can see it looks like this right now.

77
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,550
Gates go ahead and download it.

78
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,540
Make sure that you have it working OK.

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:47,390
So one thing that we don't want to do here is let anybody come in here just for the heck of it.

80
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:55,230
So let's create a link inside includes real quick somewhere here where the form is.

81
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,310
And let's find a good place for this.

82
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:25,920
This stiff form they form groovey here.

83
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,620
Let's just do it right below here.

84
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,460
Let's create another day of form.

85
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:41,670
Group class.

86
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,700
Let's make sure that this is cesse forgot boss where we get we can study later on you know and show

87
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,810
us something that we are not going to do.

88
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,040
Now we just want to build the functionality.

89
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,700
And what I want to do here is of course this is going to forgot that BHB

90
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:10,630
and specif parameter here and this parameter will be anything anything you want let's just make this

91
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,030
like a little bit more dynamic right.

92
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:22,080
I was going to put some crazy characters there that we can detect later on by writing it manually board.

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:32,810
I think if we use a function like Unique ID like this is going to create some random links for us.

94
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,780
So let's just see that

95
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,000
click here.

96
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:50,680
And as you can see those two forgot got Let's go back here and Ensco BHP.

97
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,040
OK and we go and we got some random characters here.

98
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,330
That's cool.

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,330
All right so we have that link there.

100
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,130
Now we we have to do is build the functionality and forgot that BHB.

101
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:05,910
OK.

102
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:13,100
So let me go ahead and drink my coffee because I'm kind of falling asleep and a little tired and I'll

103
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,950
be right back for you is going to take a second for me maybe an hour or two.

104
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,230
See you in the nads lecture guys.
