00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.580
I will come back on this video here.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.840
I want to do some more refactoring.

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.260
We had our little applications here.

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.380
I think we should include many of these things the head or the food or in other parts of our file structure.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.980
Right.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.510
So here on my SU Eskew what I want to do is I'm going to click on it and I'm going to create a new folder

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.040
called includes enter and then in includes I'm going to create two files and then right click on it

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.000
and I'm going to create create one file call header that BHB.

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.780
So we're going to be putting our head they are going to reichlich again and create another one called

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.930
footer that BHB.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.490
All right.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.330
And what I want to do I want to start with the first function here.

13
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.870
All right.

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.350
So the first function is to create because we are doing the crowd and I want to take all this everything

15
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.740
that has to do with the head of the document.

16
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.910
And that starts with the body right here.

17
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.250
So everything that has to do with the head.

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.180
I want to take it off and going to put what I did I took it off with the with ADD.

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.890
So right so make sure you cut it off.

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.040
So command or controls is NOT see.

21
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.170
Command Control see copy command c command or control at the right.

22
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.680
Just make sure you do that.

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.750
So that way we can have her here and we're going to include it.

24
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.930
We're going to use a function includes and include actually and if I can get this here.

25
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.020
That would be nice.

26
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.360
And we say the father called includes and is called Head or that BHB.

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.750
All right.

28
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.080
So we are going to be included in this Hetter.

29
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.000
We're going to do it right now right here.

30
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.880
Paste that information in there and let's go check that read to see if this file create.

31
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.110
I'm sorry it's working right.

32
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.180
We do that.

33
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
Go check it out to see if he's still there.

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.010
There we go so it's working now.

35
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.560
Let's go and grab the Forder.

36
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.110
All right let's grab the footer from here.

37
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.990
So make sure this Dave here OK so we don't have anything on the footer we just have this little three

38
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.040
divs here.

39
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.910
It's going to take it off this puzzle ph BTX.

40
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.020
And remember what I do command X or control edge to cut it.

41
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.280
So that way you can still have those in your when you paste it with your mouse.

42
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.850
All right.

43
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.220
So includes footer.

44
00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.780
Right let's go to the actually footer that BHP and we have that up here also had that Ph.

45
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.470
OK.

46
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.110
So let's go to footer and paste it here.

47
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.530
Perfect.

48
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.490
All right.

49
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.180
So let's make sure that it works.

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.590
All right.

51
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.910
We're working we right we checked source we can see that here and our head is here too.

52
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.600
All right.

53
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.670
All right perfect.

54
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:30.000
So what I want to do is I want to copy this let's copy this includes into the files right and take it

55
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.630
off and just copy this.

56
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.500
So the next one is Cruthers update.

57
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.670
I'm going by the acronym crowd.

58
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.620
C R U D.

59
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.780
All right.

60
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.520
So update let's take the head out and let's include it.

61
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.780
Let's do that.

62
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.250
And the next one they are going include the footer after I finish including the header.

63
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.840
Right.

64
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.030
So the next one is D.

65
00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.610
Delete.

66
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.300
Right.

67
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.900
All right we've got create update actually update we've got the update and it actually was read create

68
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.020
a read was and that's one.

69
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.420
Sorry guys.

70
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.330
Right let's do read.

71
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.710
We've got a mess here we need to fix this one too here.

72
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.840
But let's just take this out.

73
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.550
This one now we need to fit Reed into a function.

74
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.920
Let's just make sure we do that right.

75
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.330
We need to read is creating a function so let's get it out of here.

76
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.360
And this is a mess.

77
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.020
We need a connection too.

78
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.520
So let's let's go ahead and do all that.

79
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.170
So let's just include the connection here.

80
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.540
This one eats everything.

81
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.910
The B that B.

82
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.700
Right.

83
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.600
So we got the connection here let's call it a couple of them functions.

84
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.190
That's the read right here.

85
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.140
Write functions is something that we need to include there too.

86
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.410
All right.

87
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.970
Now let's take this idea here.

88
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.780
This connection we don't need this connection.

89
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:34.140
Let's just take everything out here and just take this equerry out of here let's make it into a function.

90
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.070
How about that.

91
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.220
I think if we take it into a function would be a lot better than just leaving a here.

92
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:53.290
Let's just take this out and make sure we close that ticket into functions and this call is read.

93
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.980
So we have create then we shall have show or data right here.

94
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.750
As a matter of fact we had a here.

95
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.060
Right.

96
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.230
So we have to do this.

97
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.920
Let me check something out for us.

98
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.430
Let's go back to it.

99
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.820
Are we doing here is actually showing all the data so we can call the same function right here.

100
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.710
Perfect.

101
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.590
So let's do that.

102
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.860
That's called a function right there.

103
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:29.880
First let's just put these files in two different BHB tags.

104
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.150
Let's call that function right here.

105
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.490
Let's go back to it.

106
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.970
Let's call it and it's called show or data

107
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:53.600
and this go to logon and right here show data.

108
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:54.450
So hold on.

109
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.810
That function was actually showing showing all data has this

110
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.260
is showing all this right here.

111
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:10.050
So we called our phones is going to go and call all this and we don't want that because if we go back

112
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.520
we have this my Escorial showing something else here.

113
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.620
All right so we're just going to call this function something else let's just make it something else.

114
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.510
All right so let's go back and undo.

115
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.290
By pressing command Z.

116
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.020
All right.

117
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:40.880
And let's just take this and just leave it that way it is there and we going to put it into the functions.

118
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.800
All right so be careful with that and just to BHB taxing here.

119
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.980
Be careful with that with what I was about to do there.

120
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.400
And this is another Funk's you see this function is different because it's already pulling some other

121
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.000
data.

122
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.120
We don't want that this function is going to be specific to read data.

123
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.390
Right.

124
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.950
Because they were displaying something right here.

125
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.230
We need to actually include this into our function to into the function.

126
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.660
That's what we're going to be calling it.

127
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:19.040
So we've got the cross you create the next functions should be read the rows all right.

128
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.590
And this go here and you're going to see in a minute what I mean.

129
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.900
If you don't understand it this function is totally different from the one from the show data in the

130
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.160
bottom so the show data is going to be echoing the ID right.

131
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.340
That's what this function is doing.

132
00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.720
The other one is going to be echoing all the rows.

133
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.450
All right.

134
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.600
So let's go back to the file and just take this out of here.

135
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.320
Let's just take the whole thing out even though we have to fix it

136
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.560
and we need to call that function right here by the way.

137
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:04.800
So I'm just going to have some VTX waiting for it.

138
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.710
All right.

139
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.220
As a matter of fact we screen if you like this fine.

140
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:19.070
All right let's go to the function and rerolls right here and just get a copy of that in here and just

141
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:25.070
going to take the HD mail out BHP tacts.

142
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.550
Let's see

143
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.510
if we can fix this.

144
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.610
It looks a little better.

145
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.460
There we go.

146
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.560
Looks looking better make sure that all the text match or the curly brackets by clicking on it and you

147
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.500
can see the little thing under the click and it's perfect.

148
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.330
This should be the function right here.

149
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.120
Perfect.

150
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.690
All right.

151
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.740
So I think we're good with this.

152
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.790
All right we'll find out.

153
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.530
Right now we are good.

154
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.130
All right.

155
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:07.630
So let's go ahead and call this phone the Logan from here.

156
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.010
See how that comes out.

157
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:13.230
Let's go to read

158
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.710
on the five.

159
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.420
All right forgot the global.

160
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:26.310
Remember to put the global connection all the time in there.

161
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.990
Perfect.

162
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.450
All right.

163
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.680
There we go.

164
00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.270
As you can see there.

165
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.550
All right we don't have the pretax because we're not using it right here.

166
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.130
But let's go back to that and we can use the pretax outside.

167
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.470
So let's use a pretax right here.

168
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.810
Strap it around there and it should look better right here.

169
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.500
Now there we go now.

170
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.730
All right.

171
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:02.700
So we showed the first array here and the second array right now is not going to divide each array into

172
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:11.390
each each like we did on the last time but is going to do it like this I think is better than we showed

173
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.200
on in one place here.

174
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.770
So I mean we did a lot here and look at this how this looks.

175
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:25.410
Now we need to include we have the head or we need to include the footer on this fous here.

176
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.120
So let's just go ahead and get the footer.

177
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:36.080
And I believe the Create has it create logging on the score create has the footer.

178
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.640
And let's go to the next one cross update.

179
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.880
Let's take the foot out of here and let's just include it there.

180
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.970
The next one is B C C R.

181
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:55.080
Read it to have the read also make sure we have the head for the read.

182
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.110
We have the header.

183
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.040
And what else update we have.

184
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.100
The lead lead we need to get the lead done.

185
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:21.450
So take this off let's copy first the head or let's get the body out of there with this we have footer

186
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:21.710
here.

187
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:26.510
No we don't let's get an update copy get the hang of it.

188
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:32.490
Whoops.

189
00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.190
Right right here.

190
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.450
This is for the elite perfect.

191
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.590
And make sure we have the head for it perfect.

192
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.880
We can even include this form in another file used to make it cleaner.

193
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.960
How about that.

194
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:54.570
We can include the whole content inside somewhere else if we wanted to but this is OK since we don't

195
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.250
have the same content everywhere else.

196
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.190
I know we know that the head is the same and the foot is the same.

197
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.260
So that way we can include it.

198
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:09.940
So let's just double check that everything is working Hetter create is good.

199
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.410
The lead is good.

200
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.410
UPDATE IS GOOD AND IT'S check read real good.

201
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.010
Let's just check it here.

202
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.970
Just make sure start with crud create.

203
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.420
All right let's do of date

204
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.210
right.

205
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:38.520
We can use a little touch center there on this form here a little class called data center

206
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:48.130
right to center stuff.

207
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.400
Right.

208
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:59.640
So across the next one will be read which will check on that already read and delete the next one.

209
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.810
This files looking good.

210
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.070
Delete.

211
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.230
Whoops.

212
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.560
Answer me.

213
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.420
All right.

214
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.280
All right.

215
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.450
Perfect.

216
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.600
So we are good to go.

217
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.110
All right.

218
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.360
I mean there's nothing else we got to do here.

219
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.250
And I think this was a good exercise for you to learn refactoring.

220
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.210
And if you are with me still.

221
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.250
Great job.

222
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:31.750
If you follow everything here if not for some reason just go back and rewind videos or ask me the questions.

223
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.270
All right.

224
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.720
Thank you again for watching this and hopefully this will help you organize your applications a lot

225
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.680
better.

226
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.160
Take your
