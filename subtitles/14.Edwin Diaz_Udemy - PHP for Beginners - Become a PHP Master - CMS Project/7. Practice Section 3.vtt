00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.940
Hi welcome back.

2
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm glad you made it to Section 3.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.500
I'm really excited for you.

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.890
Seriously you're doing really good.

5
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.810
So now let's go ahead and do Section 3.

6
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.470
All right.

7
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.090
So we already know that this is located in the practical app.

8
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.620
All right.

9
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.870
And we are on page number three right.

10
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.760
Section number three.

11
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.420
And there we are going to be doing.

12
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.820
Step one make an if statement with Else everything else to finally play we did this already so you should

13
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.570
know how to do that.

14
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.060
We make a for loop that display 10 numbers you should know how to do that just make the little go around

15
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.740
10 times and make a switch statement that tests against one condition with five cases.

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.440
Wow.

17
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.120
All right.

18
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.700
So anyways go ahead and do this.

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.670
Post a video.

20
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.160
Don't Chih do it.

21
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.970
Because the more you do this the more you're going to learn.

22
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.510
Right so I'll be waiting right here for the video.

23
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.580
Don't cheat.

24
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.600
All right perfect.

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.410
All right so now that you now that you're back you that you were you able to do it good.

26
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.000
No.

27
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.470
Wow.

28
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.860
All right.

29
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.440
Well whatever your answer is let's go ahead and start doing this.

30
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.350
So we need to make any statement right.

31
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:18.120
So let's do that let's just create a really simple statement here and let's just put some else if there

32
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070
let's do that else right here.

33
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.900
And all we've got to do is just put some something here that is going to execute and that's it.

34
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
So I want this to execute so why not make it simple right.

35
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.560
Three is smaller than one.

36
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.230
I want to echo what is.

37
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.320
I love BHB.

38
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.740
Oh I love BHB.

39
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.490
I love the HP she's so great right.

40
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.770
And I'm going to make this not at SECU 20 less than 10.

41
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.720
No of course not and just blah blah blah.

42
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.750
And just for the heck of it right because I'm not going to print this out.

43
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.140
We're just going to be printing.

44
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.580
I love BHP and trying to do that as fast as I can.

45
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.870
That way you don't get stuck here watching me for 30 minutes.

46
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.920
Right know you got better things to do right now.

47
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.340
All right.

48
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.020
All right.

49
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.840
All right step to make up for you.

50
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.550
All right.

51
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.910
So we know how to make a little bright.

52
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.010
Very simple for you were four and some curly brackets there.

53
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.250
And how would you make it to make.

54
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.650
How are we going to make this for a little gold.

55
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.480
So many times around right.

56
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.250
Well we could say something like.

57
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.840
First we need a variable right.

58
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.730
So I'm just going to type this.

59
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.180
This is equal to zero.

60
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.830
And this could be the counter if you just want to call initialiser right now.

61
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.320
And then we're going to say wow I is less than ten or equal than 10 right.

62
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.740
I want you to I actually we need to increment right here.

63
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.550
Remember that.

64
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.080
All right.

65
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.400
Forget Wow this is smaller than or equal to 10.

66
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.130
I want to echo how I thought so let's go let's go here and see what's going on here.

67
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.970
All right we've got some Actually we got some stuff executing here that not supposed to.

68
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.550
What do we do.

69
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.240
I went too fast and I said no of course.

70
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.400
There we go.

71
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.540
My logic was actually backwards.

72
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.020
All right so we got.

73
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.840
All right.

74
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.950
I love BHP.

75
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.700
Let's put a break in there right.

76
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.800
Let's put something here that will.

77
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.250
We can do that if we wanted to.

78
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.230
Right.

79
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.410
Perfect.

80
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.480
I love BHB and we printing out all the numbers all the values right.

81
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.220
Perfect.

82
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.830
So let's go ahead to the next one.

83
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.410
Now the next one.

84
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.870
It's a switch statement great.

85
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.800
Let's make a switch statement here let's just put a break right here.

86
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.850
That just comes Kartini every tag here.

87
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.710
So that way we don't have that problem with our switch statement.

88
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.720
So how do we create a switch statement.

89
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.260
Do you remember a switch and then same thing right.

90
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.150
What we need to put a variable here we need to make a variable say something like value.

91
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.670
And this is going to be 10.

92
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:32.460
And we are going to test against value right here and we're going to put a case here case and the case

93
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:41.390
is going to be this case 20 then we put two colons there and an echo out this is not it.

94
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.850
Should I'm going to make a simple case 10.

95
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.830
This is at man

96
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.080
right.

97
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.050
What do we need to do.

98
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.150
After we were done finding this out.

99
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.840
After this we need to break.

100
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.570
Remember that break.

101
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.950
All right.

102
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.340
Let's do a couple more statements because he said Five

103
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.060
and then just oh this is just going to have different numbers.

104
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.700
This is going be in there.

105
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.300
Let me see.

106
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.230
All right.

107
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.650
Refresh this is it man that the that.

108
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.610
And I got these values coming in like this.

109
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.100
And we found it.

110
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.750
But let's just say.

111
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.870
So this is this is 10 man.

112
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.200
Let's see if that's the right answer.

113
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.290
This is 10 men.

114
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.820
You see that the only one that change.

115
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.300
All right.

116
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.710
So really simple right.

117
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.050
Perfect.

118
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.770
We got the if they mean here.

119
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.310
Printing out of BHP because that's the only thing that we are accused of true right here everything

120
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.620
else is false.

121
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.840
And of course if everything else is false it would do this.

122
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.280
But we have a true statement right here.

123
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.560
We have the for loop.

124
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.190
We created this variable here.

125
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.930
It started out at zero and we say as long as eyes less or equal to 10 then we're going to print that

126
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.930
out then value 10 right here.

127
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.430
We are actually testing the switch they may against this value here with 10 different of five different

128
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.310
cases.

129
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.060
They get 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 so I was a good student today.

130
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.930
And the case is this is right here this is the condition the.

131
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.370
And this is the one we testing against right case 10.

132
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.200
Number 10 number seven.

133
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.390
This could be a stream by the way.

134
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.920
Right.

135
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:51.150
So anyway hopefully this test here this exercise helped you enforce what you learn in this section.

136
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.670
And thank you so much and I see you in the next section OK.

137
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.500
Having fun.

138
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.120
Take care.
