00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.680
Hey welcome back my students so then that's function from Chanology super simple to create.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.440
We have to do.

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.120
This is fecche or the likes.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.430
For this specific pose.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.340
OK super simple.

6
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.060
So I'm going to go to functions actually I'm going to create one where we have all of this and we should

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.360
make some type of you know

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.750
some type of section where we just do this like for the user or the post or something like that like

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.330
a common for the polls.

10
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.520
But anyway so this user liked this post right below it.

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.360
I'm going to do a function get forced like something like that just in case you want to have lights

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.500
for something else in the future.

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.840
But

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.090
he's going to do that and he's going to make equerry

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:07.900
and equerry is going to say this in a variable called resoled like we have been doing and which you

16
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:17.360
and I do select all from likes where maybe the post Id

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.170
cause post Id come in from the from here somewhere.

18
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.520
And you know you guys can go go and I think I had this placeholder or something and put it back if you

19
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.850
want.

20
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.800
I was going to take it off.

21
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.210
OK but anyway

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.200
just get the post ID from here.

23
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.780
So we pass a post ID there and just right there.

24
00:01:50.230 --> 00:02:02.200
OK so we can use a confirm query function to make sure that everything went according to plan and then

25
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.270
we can you know right from this function we can egle stuff out instead.

26
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150
But before we do them we need to make the query.

27
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.640
Right now the query we can actually echo everything out right away.

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.650
My your name Rose we can't even make up a function for this one to just to you know fetch rows or something.

29
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.840
Maybe call effect Euros

30
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.100
get Paul Slyke So lets go and test this boy out.

31
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.450
And where do we want to put it let's see let's go back to post up BHB and we do have a place here that

32
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.710
we can try this out.

33
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.760
And there let's see this works and we don't have any problems.

34
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.830
And make sure that we pass a post ID.

35
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.490
As refresh.

36
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.240
And these post has no like less like it and you can see now that it's awesome.

37
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.130
Now we need to go and create another poll.

38
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.340
So let's go back here.

39
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.020
We're going to be doing a lot of stuff guys to to see him as a guy like a lot of things that we can

40
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.220
add.

41
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.060
So this is just to my second posts

42
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.600
and like stuff like there's lay users make sure it's the right user that's posting and things like that.

43
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.930
You know

44
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.170
let's just do that.

45
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.430
And Card Number two or something.

46
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.170
And Alexis puts

47
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.670
I want to get some some words.

48
00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.110
I was going to copy the same thing from this guy.

49
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.190
All right up the posts.

50
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.400
Let's view the polls and we can see that the second pose as no likes.

51
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.000
And then we go to the front and let's go to the first polls and we can see that those have a like.

52
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.300
OK.

53
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.100
So I'm going to raise you another user and I'm going to see if there are the users can see this can

54
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.860
see the like or not.

55
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.680
Is there another user called Maria.

56
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.910
This has one like this is the first post I move stuff around so don't worry too much about it.

57
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.080
So I'm going to go here and I need a logo and I'm using Safari by the way I can use the same browser

58
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.550
because it's taken the session my session.

59
00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:00.180
So in Safari which is my browser for my Mac I'm going to Louie and Maria and I go to the front.

60
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.380
I'm going to go to my first post and you can see that it does have one like what is a technique that

61
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.180
Maria has not liked it.

62
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.620
OK.

63
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.000
So first polls you can see here that is detecting that this guy liked it.

64
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.210
So I kind of like it.

65
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.410
And then Maria in the Maria side right here on the outside like and you can see now that it's as two

66
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.680
likes we go back here refresh.

67
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.360
You can see two likes but this doesn't change.

68
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.710
OK this is the Edwins side.

69
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.710
OK.

70
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.110
So let's go to the next pose which has no likes.

71
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.540
I don't like it in the Maria side as one like.

72
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:49.440
And he's attacked in that we already that we are liking it as a matter of fact that's just refresh.

73
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.460
Actually I liked it in the Edwins site.

74
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.050
Let's go back to where Porsche's is.

75
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.310
I'm already getting confused.

76
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.240
Let's go to the second pulse.

77
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.250
You can see that he has one liked and this is one make sure they use the same.

78
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:17.470
So my second post has one like which is Edwin and this here it says he has one like but it's not Maria.

79
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:27.680
So refresh Now Maria stuff is not changing come back here.

80
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.440
He does a day go one like but this is not working with the Safari

81
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.870
refresh.

82
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.150
OK so this is now working with Safari which is our

83
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.150
you know user like this functionality.

84
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:56.460
So let's go and check this out with this logo.

85
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.980
Whoops.

86
00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.510
We got to fix that.

87
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.250
This is a bond hearing in Polsce.

88
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.810
So let's go ahead and do that real quick.

89
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.710
I'm going to start fixing up things when you know that I wrong with this.

90
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.990
But let's fix that real quick because that's annoying.

91
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:26.500
That has to be in the enclosed navigation so loadout make sure that you have for slashy a mass in your

92
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.030
logo.

93
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.700
OK.

94
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.940
But that is

95
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.750
PPOs has a dear friend.

96
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.630
Let's go to sidebar actually.

97
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.870
Sorry.

98
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.060
So you can see logo doesn't have the force.

99
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.550
I see a mess.

100
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.990
Make sure you have that in your links.

101
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.300
Nice.

102
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.210
That didn't work.

103
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.540
Oh there we go.

104
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.530
This is chrome This is Edwin.

105
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.500
Let's.

106
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.140
I'm testing things out here guys.

107
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.800
There's always a fiery and now safari.

108
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.030
Let's go to Firefox and let's see if this works in Firefox on the

109
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.490
this is Firefox.

110
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.190
I'm going to log in my read your once entry

111
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:26.220
and I'm going to go to my second pause see what's up so as to LAX.

112
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.260
I'm going to click like and it's not working on this side so we got something wrong.

113
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.560
Then we got a fix and now is good that is good that we tested it.

114
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.220
OK.

115
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:35.520
So something is going on here.

116
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.970
Let's go to the next lecture and let's fix it.
