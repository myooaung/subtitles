1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,840
Or write so now that we have our structure right we need to build a database for a system.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:14,450
I'm actually located at local holes for Slash CIMS as you can see.

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:21,320
We don't see the in that BHB because our server knows that it's that BHB will be our home so it doesn't

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,100
display it.

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:29,430
But if I type here in that's BHB and I click on it you can see that it is the same thing.

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:29,850
All right.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:35,840
So one thing before we continue that I want to make sure that we are on the same page is that I'm using

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,830
version five point six point three on this course.

9
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,030
Now this is the latest version.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:54,260
All right in my time now if something major changes in you know the system in BHB or my ask you well

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:01,120
I will update the course make sure that you're using the latest software for a zap I'm using this version

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,530
right here.

13
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,940
So it's up to you if you want to download the same version or you want to go ahead and download the

14
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,910
latest version that the latest version should be fine since I will be updating the cords all the time.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,320
One thing to make sure also that I'm using.

16
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,920
We're going to be using the API my Eskew.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,650
I there is an API called my rescue L which is the old one.

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,310
All right.

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:31,060
We have the new one for my my Eskew L I which me the I stands for improved.

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,600
All right.

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,710
So I know that.

22
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,360
So if you have an older version or zap update it.

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,770
All right so let's go back here.

24
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:48,480
Let's go to our local halls ph be my admin then you can get there like this locavores BHB my admin and

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,550
you can just type it in there and go to databases.

26
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:59,720
And here we're going to create a database called CMOS we can actually create we to select the here in

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,020
the right hand side we're going to create create a database with a database I'm sorry a table and this

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,610
code is let's create a category table actually let's do that first.

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,990
And we just kind of said to

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:23,490
two fields for that two rows I'm going to go and the first thing that we will be doing is putting an

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,470
ID on it.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,160
And of 3 meaning that we can have up to three characters 9 9 9.

33
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,690
Basically we will have probably a thousand ideas if you want more ideas and you're going to have a lot

34
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,660
more categories then you can go ahead and do that but I think this is not necessary.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,780
I don't want to use more space than have to and let's go and say primary and or increment that's what

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,630
I stands for.

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,500
You can put your mouse over I think it would tell you they would go.

38
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,330
And then the next one is cat title which is of course short for category title.

39
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,990
And this is going to be of our car and it's going to say is 2:55 that's fine.

40
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,990
That's a match for that.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,650
All right.

42
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,730
So we're good to go with that and just save it.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:20,890
All right so we build the database see a mess and we have a category table in here we go to the structure

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,800
and we see that this is actually in fact good right.

45
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,650
Perfit so we're done with this lecture.

46
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,840
Thank you so much for watching.

47
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,190
I'll see you in the next lecture.

48
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:30,560
Take care.
