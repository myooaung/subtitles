1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,090
All right so we got our form the first form on the left side on the last video right.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,820
So what we need is we need a table here on the right hand side so we can display some of the categories

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,050
that we are going to be added in and adding into in-crowd on it and remember crowd means create read

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,070
update and delete.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,180
That's the acronym.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,860
So now we have the forum here.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,460
This is a forum we want to create something else in the bottom related to this.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,750
So I'm just going to use the same class here.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,630
And because I want to explain things in half and that's how we do it

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,570
because remember they said we're using a framework here and this framework is helping us out style things

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,660
and make things responsive really easy.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:59,100
So let's go ahead and create a table that's actually create a table inside a table we're going to create

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,310
a something called Elliman inside a TLM element and create a row.

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,540
Is going to have two pages times to th elements.

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,390
And that's about it.

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,840
All right.

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,680
And I take on tab and that does this for me and to me that's a plug in that we download with this editor.

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,020
For those of you that have this editor if you don't have this editor and you weren't able to do that

19
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,600
just pause the video and copy it.

20
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,420
All right.

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:38,940
So we're going to put the idea right here on the T-H and category title here.

22
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,270
All right let's look at that.

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,280
We should have something

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,900
refresh.

25
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,490
All right we do have something year but it's on style.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,410
All right.

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,780
We'll have more styles there.

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,520
We're going to have to put some clauses in here made just a little better.

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,080
So we want to add something so.

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,240
Well yes we are looking at something right.

31
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:12,320
So inside is th list at a T body while not inside after it had to roll a roll with these times.

32
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,640
There we go.

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:24,660
And it's just something here saying something like baseball just for them striation purposes only baseball

34
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,200
cats Gorie

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,510
and

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,500
basketball.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,280
All right let's just check it out.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:47,430
Fresh as you can see here it looks pretty bad because we this framework stripping down some of the default

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,610
styles from the browser.

40
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,250
But we are going to be fixing that.

41
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:59,400
Right now it's at a class here called Table that she just helped it out a little bit and she refreshed

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,750
it and now the styling is really nice right now right.

43
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,820
Let's use another style here.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,370
Let's add more data.

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,050
Add a little bit more tedious.

46
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,660
Right.

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,660
So actually let's add another rolls on TVs right.

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,450
It's.

49
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,150
This is fine the way it is.

50
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,620
To be honest with you that's fine.

51
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,390
We're good to go with this.

52
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,300
We will be putting more data in here.

53
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,320
But right now let's just leave it like that.

54
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,610
I want to put too much in that we don't need.

55
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:47,740
So table let's put another class here code table border and this is going to make it look nicer.

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,900
All right.

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,490
So we are squaring everything here.

58
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,570
Let's actually use another one too.

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,410
I think this will work fine with it.

60
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:06,100
However let's refresh it and if we put our minds over it we can see that.

61
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,950
All right that's being hovered over.

62
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,640
I mean we hover over it we can see that it's playing nice with us.

63
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,300
All right.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,160
So I think we're done with this table here we will be doing some more things with it.

65
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,370
But right now we won't be able to do anything because this lecture is getting kind of long for you.

66
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,640
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

67
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,510
Take care.
