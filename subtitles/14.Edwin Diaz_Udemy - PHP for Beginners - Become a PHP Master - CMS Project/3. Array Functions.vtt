00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.360
I will come back on this video we will learn how to use array functions just like string functions array

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.200
functions are very useful and they are pre-defined by BHB.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.320
Now you can't you can make your own array functions but that would be up to you.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.110
It would be actually a lot more work than coming here and finding an array function that would suit

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.480
your needs.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.580
I think it's very possible that you will find any type of fun array functions here already predefined

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.640
for you to use.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.590
All right so let's go ahead and make one and I'm just going to make an array first of all because we're

9
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.850
going to be using an array function.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.090
Let's just set it to some variables.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.180
Let's just use the new

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.180
language.

13
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.630
Right.

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.550
So new BHB instead of the array old parentheses there.

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.740
And then I just put some values there and just going to use the code used to echo some of the values

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.780
for that function.

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.060
So what I want to do is echo the mats and going to use this function call Mad's.

18
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.190
This is for a

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.620
for an array.

20
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.850
So if I click here I should see the result right here.

21
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.790
All right.

22
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.690
Four hundred and fifty three is the Mets value right here.

23
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.260
Now keep in mind now that I am if this is the end that you're exercising of course exercise fous is

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.070
on May 28.

25
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.400
On the score array.

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.300
Now I started numbering there so that way you can know exactly where you are.

27
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
Now you can if you are if you have your own folder.

28
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.810
Make a file called from blank that BHP make a file called array underscore functions that BHP.

29
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.620
OK so do that.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.290
Let me show you another one real quick and then we're going to go over on the website and show you where

31
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.030
they are.

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.880
So is going to do a space here and there and then another echo here and this one is the opposite of

33
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.610
Matt's minimum.

34
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.830
See is the minimal value right here 23.

35
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.010
Let's do another one.

36
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:14.160
This song is actually very useful and we will be always using a function like this is going to be something

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.030
like print are or it's going to be printer and you can see the whole array right there with all the

38
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.600
keys and values in there.

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.280
But we're going to do something before that you see that before before we actually lackwit it out.

40
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.200
You see though they are different numbers and different browsers you've got the small ones here and

41
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.920
I mean this is disorganize we're going to sort this thing order.

42
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.610
I'm going to use a function call sort so we can do something like this sort very small function right.

43
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.900
Look at that.

44
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940
Now we sort everything out here.

45
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.170
We started with the lowest number one to the largest.

46
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.510
All right.

47
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.250
Now does this pre-the five functions are really super useful you don't understand how much time they

48
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.940
save us when we are developing.

49
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.540
So if you go to the Web site on PSAP that net for a slash manual for slashy and ref for less ref array

50
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.230
than you can find all of them here.

51
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.070
Another way of looking for these is you go to Google and just type in if you don't want it just go ahead

52
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.380
and type all this.

53
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:29.490
I go inside DHP rate functions ref R E F and you will find the rest of them you will find this page

54
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.130
right.

55
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.950
If you click on it you will find options here.

56
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.430
I mean you will find examples and how to use them better.

57
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.920
All right.

58
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.600
So anyway thank you so much for watching this and I'll see you in the next story.

59
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.470
Take care.
