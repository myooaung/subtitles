00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.280
All right so in this video we are going to be downloading and coeditor that we will be using for this

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.290
course.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.680
Now this code will be compatible with Windows operating system Mac and for Linux.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.650
So that's one of the reasons I'm going to download this one and the best part it is free.

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.130
All right.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.460
So let's go to chrome the type in brackets here brackets with s.

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.860
I'm going to get this Web site here bracket's I will.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.510
And then I'm going to download it.

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.040
Depending on your speed you should take a couple of seconds or minutes.

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.850
Right for me it's just downloading.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.210
I probably have a 5 megabyte down right now because I'm in the second floor and my wireless is downstairs.

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.080
So once it finishes downloading then just sort of like install any program on your operating system

13
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.550
usually use.

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.830
Click on the program and we start opening right away for those for some of you.

15
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.940
You're going to have to double click it.

16
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.930
All right.

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.820
So for me I mean a Mac I just have to drag it into the applications for you use double click it or do

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.440
whatever you need to do in your operating system.

19
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.250
Very self explanatory.

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.770
And once that is done then you go to where that program installed and just double clicking open it.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.660
Right.

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.820
So one of the reasons I chose this is because as you can tell it looks really nice.

23
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.530
It works for Mac for Windows and for Linux just like I said and we have some more functionality there

24
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.640
that we're going to be using like we're going to be able to write code a little faster than just you

25
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.870
know with any other co-editors we're going to be able to see tets highlighted like this different tags

26
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.640
different colors is really cool.

27
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.630
There are many different features that we have in this coeditor that are really good for developers

28
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.720
and programmers right.

29
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.190
So anyways if you were able to download this great without any problems let me know and maybe I can

30
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.790
help you out.

31
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.880
But again if you have your coeditor and you are ready you know you were happy with it.

32
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.090
Go ahead and use that one really does it matter.

33
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.760
But for this course I'm going to be using this one so if you want to follow everything exactly like

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.540
me download this one right I see you in the next lecture.

35
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.800
Thank you so much.

36
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.160
Take care
