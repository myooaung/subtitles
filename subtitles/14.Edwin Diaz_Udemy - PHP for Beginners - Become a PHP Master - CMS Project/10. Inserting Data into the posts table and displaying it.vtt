1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.590
Or right now.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:11.960
So we want to display some information from our database right here right on this home page.

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.180
That's that Ph.D. This is our home page right now that's where I am locavores force less force less.

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.410
That's BHB.

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.710
So we have a table called posts with some Rosing there.

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.720
But in order for us to display some information here we need to insert some data into that table.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.980
So let's go ahead and do that right now.

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.960
Select the table let's insert and let's just insert let's not or anything for the post ID since that

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.080
increments automatically post category.

10
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.310
We're not going to do that either.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.960
Let's just say that we wanted to post title to be.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:57.540
I don't know eling CIMS of course you can write whatever you want.

13
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.950
I'm just saying it's awesome.

14
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.530
Or actually othering see a mass BHB course

15
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.970
and has just put this like this here.

16
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.520
Peachi course is awesome.

17
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.510
Alter doing.

18
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.110
Yes that's my name by the way.

19
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.790
Let's put a date on it.

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.480
And this just say forever every 25.

21
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.500
And we don't have a pause image for that.

22
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.640
As a matter of fact we don't.

23
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.210
We're going to have to do some setting with image right now.

24
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.490
We're going to put some some content here and we're going to say something like wow I really really

25
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:54.400
liked this course and let's make the whole or somebody else because I shouldn't be liking my course.

26
00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.240
I am actually kind of like my materia of John Doe is the name we're re some posts.

27
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.980
And we're going to call this Edwin.

28
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.850
Who's going to put some pokes Edwin or javascript.

29
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.450
Be some key words there.

30
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.730
Coming kÃ¼ng we don't have that and these on draft right now.

31
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:30.570
So let's just one row in of one incorrect into integer value so we made a mistake somewhere on the category

32
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.040
ID with end up with an ID for that.

33
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.300
All right.

34
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.070
Let's go back to it.

35
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.720
All right so he did insert some value there but is incorrect.

36
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.330
Let's just make an ID for you just to make BHB Miami a little happier with us.

37
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.540
All right.

38
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.440
So Bertha we have some data here that we can display.

39
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.020
All right so let's go ahead and do that.

40
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.420
All right so let's go and start changing some things around.

41
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.960
Let's go to the index and if we go see this.

42
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.430
This is going to be this is the page heading right here right here the title right here.

43
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.080
So we're going to be putting some of that title of the title that we got from the database here.

44
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.040
Let me replace some of this data H.T. mail which SS I mean Nazi SS BHB.

45
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.990
So where do we want to actually make our Querrey.

46
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:39.960
All right so I want to make our query very close to this here would I don't need to but I will.

47
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:50.840
So let's first go ahead and create a query and it's a call and it's actually right up the tax DHP.

48
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.380
I think sometimes I think the tax should be right should write themselves automatically just by looking

49
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.330
at them right.

50
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.830
Select all from where from polls.

51
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.550
All right.

52
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.930
That's all we got to do there.

53
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.280
And then we can just copy.

54
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.030
We don't have to write all this.

55
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.990
We can just copy from what we had on navigation right.

56
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.950
This is copies while statement right here.

57
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.960
I'm just going to copy all this renaming.

58
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.460
Really cool right.

59
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.300
I don't have to do all that but what I will do will change the names of some of these things.

60
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.900
So I went to navigation I just copy everything below the select all because I had to be using something

61
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.370
very similar.

62
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.650
So again get in the habit of copy and pasting things that way you don't know what you don't have to

63
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.290
write so much select all polls where we are right.

64
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.560
That's what I'm going to call this.

65
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.560
And we are.

66
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.100
Whoops sorry about my volume.

67
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.710
So

68
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.740
we're going to change this here by that perfect

69
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.700
and this is called post-Idol instead of cat title post-Idol this is coming from the database right here

70
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.100
remember that post title so this is the roll from the database make sure that you know that.

71
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.730
And then we are assigning a variable.

72
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.420
And of course we got to this play puls title.

73
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.190
Now we are not going to explain this in a tag sense.

74
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.230
This is going to be this plain and here right.

75
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.920
So let's just take this out.

76
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.700
All right.

77
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.310
That looks really that by itself there.

78
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.340
So now remember this is a loop here in no way.

79
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.600
Surely there is a thing here.

80
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.540
So this is a loop is going to loop through all the evidence we've got in our data from the pulse table

81
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.340
and is going to bring this back here.

82
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.760
But we want to make sure that we bring everything back.

83
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.830
We have a lot of things in our table that we need to bring back Ray.

84
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.340
We have a false ID category Id post title.

85
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.320
Let's bring what we need right now.

86
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.510
Let's bring the title let's bring the author so let's make a more copy and paste of here says we're

87
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.020
going to be needing some of this and I don't know how many of these we need and we're going to find

88
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.350
out right now in a minute.

89
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:54.560
So let's bring the title let's bring the author back.

90
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.110
Walter let's just copy this here.

91
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.080
You don't have to name the same if you don't want to but I like to do it just to keep simplicity what's

92
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.000
next after the day by the day the image and the content.

93
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.920
So they take the

94
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.330
image

95
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.690
and we've got to do something with that image just to we're going to do another function for the image

96
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.880
or I'll I'll show you in a minute and was the one content.

97
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.600
I think that's it.

98
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.640
I mean that's all we need for this right now.

99
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.450
All right Paul Staples content.

100
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.960
Yeah.

101
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:45.230
That's all we need for now.

102
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.660
So I'm just going to take the rest of this.

103
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:55.190
So we've got the title they alter the date the image and the content type to alter the date image in

104
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.530
the country perfect.

105
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.570
So we got those assigned to variables.

106
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.040
All right.

107
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.580
And we need to make this bigger here so you can see it

108
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.590
right.

109
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.380
We need to display many different posts and the way this is going to do is by going through the loop

110
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:21.310
because we need this data repeated over and over again Maji and we have more posts.

111
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.960
These data needs to repeat itself.

112
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.420
If I do everything outside right now I can go ahead.

113
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.220
I signed this variable here and here and here and here and with splaying one time we need to go actually

114
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.260
around this data.

115
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.490
Here is a male to reproduce this over and over again.

116
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.890
So I'm going to break out of this.

117
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.960
All right so I'm going to do this something like this.

118
00:08:46.130 --> 00:09:00.680
Break out of BHB break go completely out of there and I'm going to take this and put it in there inside

119
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.500
that loop.

120
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.600
All right.

121
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.090
Right here.

122
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:20.690
Then come back here to there and I'm going to start THP again because I want to bring down bring in

123
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.770
this little thing right here.

124
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.560
There's a little curly bracket from BHB.

125
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.340
All right.

126
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.850
I need to close my loop with this.

127
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.250
That's what I'm doing right here.

128
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:46.010
So I'm turning off BHP and I'm closing the loop and then turning it back on here again to get this curly

129
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.890
bracket.

130
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.930
So here we're going to be playing some dynamic tests.

131
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.550
This is the page heading we're not going to concern ourselves with that right now but let's go ahead

132
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.250
and do some ph be right here for the title or post.

133
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:07.670
And you can see b b c I thought this was going to do that automatically but he doesn't complete this

134
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.100
stuff for me automatically echo.

135
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.970
And then we're going to echo what the post-Idol

136
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.160
pulls title.

137
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.110
There we go.

138
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:28.990
And it's just used seem to want to just take this out of here because we want to play something else

139
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.710
here when you play the pulse alter

140
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:41.020
and pulls to his play that day here take that out and just put the date on it.

141
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.470
And this is the contents right here.

142
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:53.800
So take that out and we say pulls content.

143
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.680
All right.

144
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:58.220
So I think we're done with this.

145
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.870
What do you think.

146
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.440
We're good.

147
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.890
All right.

148
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.750
So let's go ahead.

149
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.400
I think I think we're good to see.

150
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:13.270
I mean just make sure here that our data is being sent to light poles and we may have a mistake or two

151
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.620
but you know the funny thing about it is fixing it.

152
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.530
Let's see it see see how it works out.

153
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.060
Actually we don't have a stake.

154
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.880
Good.

155
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.660
If you do have a mistake don't worry about it just do it again.

156
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:31.190
So these days being pulled from the database as you can see the titles here at the MSP HP Causey's are

157
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.230
some by John Doe.

158
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.270
We have that date right here.

159
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.280
We have the content and we don't have the image right now because we have to add an extra step for the

160
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.010
image.

161
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.100
But I'll show you that in the following lectures.

162
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.160
All right so now we have some data.

163
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:47.000
All right.

164
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:51.030
Explain dynamically there and let's insert another pause and see what happens.

165
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.720
All right.

166
00:11:51.920 --> 00:12:00.950
So let's go ahead insert some more data into this create another post and it's said this took Category

167
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:01.580
2.

168
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.620
Let's say this.

169
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:09.390

Let's go back to it and let's check it out.

191
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:47.030

192
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.750

194
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.730
As NCM as causes us some.

195
00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:02.230
All right let's just check it out real quick.

196
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.320
Berlind and its course is awesome.

197
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.780
All right.

198
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:16.430
Go ahead and post content right here.

199
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.150
We have the title.

200
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.190
We have the author.

201
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.900
We have some content right here pulls content so that should be explained.

202
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.250
Foal's can't unless I went in a database and made a boo somewhere here.

203
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.020
Polls other polls tied of course post.

204
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.600
We didn't write anything for content.

205
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:46.040
We actually we did right here post content.

206
00:14:49.680 --> 00:15:01.750
Post ID to kind of ID it automatically we had some dates and here we were fresh scruples.

207
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:08.600
It looks like this is actually let's do it right and right click inspect element on it and just check

208
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.040
it out.

209
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.650
It's inserting the title in there right.

210
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.560
And I think I know the reason why he's doing that.

211
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.320
Let's go back to our.

212
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:28.060
Here we have the content and we have the title here instead of content.

213
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.290
There we go.

214
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.280
All right.

215
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.970
A little friendly mistake there.

216
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.150
So just know that we find the really fast refresh.

217
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:41.570
And now we should have the content explain that's that happens on time and when you do a copy and pasting

218
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.180
a lot.

219
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.030
So just get used to it.

220
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.980
So sometimes when this doesn't actually display the way you want to make sure you check what's coming

221
00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.620
in for the databasing how you are applying those values.

222
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.510
So we see this wow I really like this course.

223
00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.860
We see the counting is actually this playing really nice now.

224
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.690
Wow man this is really cool.

225
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.210
He's a really cool post can you call me.

226
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.890
All right.

227
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.110
So we can make as many as we want and it would keep going down down down.

228
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.650
Right.

229
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.050
So thank you so much for watching this lecture and I'll see you in the next one.

230
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.280
Take care.
