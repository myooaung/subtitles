00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.580
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here I'm going to answer a request from one of you

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.870
guys out there.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.360
Basically the request was.

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.070
Why don't we make a feature right daddy text.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.190
If the horse has a user.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.140
So what we're going to be doing is going to be assigning our admin users to post.

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.890
All right.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.510
So instead of having this coming from the front end we're going to have this assigned to a user inside

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.010
here.

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.970
So what we need to do.

11
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.450
I'm going to tell you in a brief here what we need to do.

12
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.990
Basically when we add a new post right here from Admin we need to really use a stable with a post table

13
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.120
just like we did here with the categories we are getting the idea and we're getting the title we do

14
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.060
the same thing and then we send it in to our post table we make a new column.

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.300
I don't know saying something like Polsce user or something like that.

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.930
We search the ID and then from there we pull that information right here so we know that other policies

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.750
related to that user.

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.260
All right.

19
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.210
So I'm going to go ahead and start doing this quickly so that where you can see how this is done.

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.190
But I will challenge you if you want to go ahead and do that.

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.620
That would be very nice for you to try that on your own.

22
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.210
All right.

23
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.910
So go to your ad on the score post up DHP page.

24
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.620
Right one thing that I want to fix here on this page is that.

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.160
Let's go here.

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.100
We need to have a label here in javascript there category stuff re element.

27
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.450
So let's just put a label real quick here and just call it category

28
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260
right there.

29
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.150
All right.

30
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.300
Save it.

31
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.770
Come back here.

32
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.000
Enter now we have a category there.

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.620
All right.

34
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.230
Perfect.

35
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.790
So this post all right here is a tets tetes element so what we need to do is create a dropdown like

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.900
we do here with the categories but a drop down of users.

37
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.230
Right.

38
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.130
So let's go ahead and do that.

39
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.280
So we have the code right here for categories why don't we use this right.

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.440
So I'm just going to copy this whole thing here.

41
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.870
I actually had a copy from this day.

42
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.800
Here we go in there and it come down to Basel.

43
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200
I'm going to come in this out just in case.

44
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.330
Maybe you make an error or something right.

45
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.300
And you want it come back.

46
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.950
Well you got to do press control Z or command Z and don't do everything.

47
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.240
So I'm going to say this.

48
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.980
I'm going to call this users and I change this label to users and it changes change.

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.600
I mean changes to users.

50
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.150
Basically we're modifying all of this stuff here.

51
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:02.770
Select users copy is history here based here.

52
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.770
All right.

53
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.820
And if you allow the user ID.

54
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.330
That's a column in the database.

55
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.750
Hopefully we'll double check on that later.

56
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.290
All right.

57
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.740
And then this would be the user name.

58
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.270
I believe the same thing that I got in the database.

59
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.590
We'll double check on that later.

60
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.540
Use a name right here.

61
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.330
And user ID right there.

62
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.000
So let's check on that list saving come back here and ther.

63
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.750
Whoops we're making a mistake somewhere.

64
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm going to right click on I going to show you a trick.

65
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.880
Go to the page source and go all the way to the bottom and you can see that I have a mistake and an

66
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.710
error there.

67
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.570
All right.

68
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.560
So this is on line 93 let me see what I did.

69
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.350
I'm probably doing to.

70
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.540
You see this two dollar signs say come back here again and save it.

71
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.080
And now we can see this.

72
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.040
Right now we're not pulling our users.

73
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.700
For some reason we'll double check on that and see what's going on.

74
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.980
So we are selecting everything from users.

75
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.000
Let's go ahead and quote a user squarer let's just change this.

76
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.900
Just in case

77
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.460
we don't just change this a quick

78
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.470
cephalic users we're doing this.

79
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.770
Good user name we have with Alasan right here.

80
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.120
All right let's go ahead and check this out now.

81
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.750
Answer still nothing.

82
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.000
All right let's come back here.

83
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.420
Let's see what mistake we were making.

84
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.510
Did do that two dollar signs.

85
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.080
This is when I copy and paste what happens.

86
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.520
Enter.

87
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.170
And now we have pull in the users.

88
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.730
Beautiful.

89
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.290
All right.

90
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.800
So on the next lecture we're going to be doing this.

91
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.870
We're going to check our columns in our users table just to make sure that we have the right columns.

92
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.450
All right.

93
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.990
So then we'll jump into this page right here and try to bring this up right here.

94
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.700
All right.

95
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.200
So anyway I see you in the next lecture.

96
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.640
It was a pleasure like always.

97
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.930
