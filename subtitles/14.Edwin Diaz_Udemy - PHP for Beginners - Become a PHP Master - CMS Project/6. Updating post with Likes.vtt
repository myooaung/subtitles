00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.860
OK so let's go back to our code here and the next step is to update polls would like.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.480
OK.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.660
And this is yours you know fetching fetching would be nice.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.830
Faxing poll the right polls or something probably misspelled this like always right.

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.800
So let's go over here and start updating our polls.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.390
So the first thing that I want to do is I want to make a query here.

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.700
And you know what I'm going to make the Querrey and you're going to pass a connection here and make

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.620
the Querrey right here.

9
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.510
So that way I don't have to create an extra variable for it.

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.010
OK.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.200
So let's update

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.750
folks and let's set that likes.

13
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.910
OK.

14
00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.360
So that variable like this and let's add one to it.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.800
OK.

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.720
So what's going to happen every time we click on the Like button here.

17
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.990
Let's go back.

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.190
We're going to be updating the likes

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.290
dislikes field by one.

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.900
OK.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.200
So that's going to be one like and so on to likes if we click it again.

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.530
So let's go ahead and add Where is ID because when you make sure it's the right polls and which is going

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.900
to put the post ID that we got ok like that.

24
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.660
If you want a separation.

25
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.500
You know you can make it that way looks nice.

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.140
And just going to leave it like that.

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.530
OK.

28
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.220
Now this like cear do does need a equal symbol there.

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.840
OK.

30
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.230
So that's all we're going to do in this one here.

31
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.070
Let's go and let's just put this come in here.

32
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.160
And we don't need this.

33
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.530
I was just checking things out.

34
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.460
So let's go and see if this works for fresh.

35
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.470
We are going to like it.

36
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.060
Let's go back here.

37
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.960
Let's browse 1:39.

38
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.850
It should be one like here.

39
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.540
OK.

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:27.030
Let's go back and actually I was right there sorry and let's like it again like it

41
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.970
hands refresh and you can see that it's two legs here.

42
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.600
If you can see and you're going to make a little close put a little closer for you see the two lights.

43
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.730
And he has 82 counts.

44
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.060
OK.

45
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.400
Pretty awesome.

46
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.650
On the next lecture we are going to be creating the like for that specific pose.

47
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.430
See you then.
