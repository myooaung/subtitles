00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.020
I will come back my student I hope you're having an awesome day.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.610
It's a very sunny day here.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.900
And you know I almost did not make it today to make this video but I did.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.500
And it's really good.

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.050
So I feel good.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.110
Let's go ahead and it.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.350
Let's start building there's a little more.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.700
The next thing we do need right here is to actually read some data from the database.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Now if you don't remember where we are because you probably watched that last very long time ago we've

10
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.800
skipped some some information coming from the forum.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.500
We went inside the database here to make a connection and we are checking on this column right here

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.960
for a default value.

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.020
And now we are going to be displaying it.

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.760
All right does the full value.

15
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.220
We went into the database last time and we inserted that right here as you can see the 22 characters

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.090
and the cost parameter.

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.500
And I told you to go to the lecture on secure under the section security for the lecture on the crypt

18
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
function on the password encryption on the course itself.

19
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.630
All right so you can go to the security section.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.190
But anyway hopefully you followed my advice from The Last Lecture and did that.

21
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.630
Let's go ahead and continue this.

22
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.650
So let's create a while loop right

23
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.760
right here.

24
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.690
Wow that was completely backwards.

25
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.470
Right.

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.720
And then my ask you why we're going to use fetch array.

27
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.690
And we going to be fetching this information right here.

28
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.240
This variable result set.

29
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.590
And let's go ahead and echo it out let's see if it works.

30
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.620
Now I think that actually won't work because if I'm forgetting something I'm going to show you in a

31
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.150
minute.

32
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.340
I just thought about it the column is called Rande sold in the database.

33
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.050
All right.

34
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.740
So this won't work.

35
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.040
The reason is because we don't have anything there.

36
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.990
Even though we have a default value here.

37
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.180
The problem is that we have some old old roads that let me just browse and show you these or all the

38
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000
rows that have they don't have that value.

39
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.610
They don't have that default value because we made this before.

40
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.700
So anything that we make now will have that for value.

41
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.270
So if I go back to the

42
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.110
two men let's try to log in right here recall and go into trees a password to get in.

43
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.760
If we go back to users

44
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.560
Let's go see the users and I say I don't know one last name or whatever.

45
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.980
And literally that's what I'm going to write.

46
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.540
Use a name whatever email whatever it even for misspelling it.

47
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.930
No worry about it.

48
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.140
And so on password right.

49
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.450
And then the user and I think we should put something here to let us know that user was at it right.

50
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.600
I think we're going to do that next time.

51
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.650
I don't know.

52
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.110
And let's go ahead and check it out.

53
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.960
So we see that we had of use or whatever and now we have that Ron salt added to it.

54
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.840
So now we can see some data.

55
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.730
All right.

56
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.190
So let's go back here and now.

57
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.470
All right so we can see some data.

58
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.390
Let's go back to the forum

59
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.820
site and we need to actually we also a link here to take it to this page because it's tedious to do

60
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.780
this by hand right.

61
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:28.580
Registration as you can see here registration that be some reason taking too long to load registration.

62
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:38.220
You know we don't know what happened there but so if I click on registration and register you can see

63
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.160
that we get some value automatically from the database.

64
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.610
All right.

65
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.540
So I think that's it for this lecture here on the next one we're going to create a link here and do

66
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.130
some more things with the password encryption.

67
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.980
All right.

68
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.350
So thank you so much for watching.

69
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.540
And I see you in the next lecture
