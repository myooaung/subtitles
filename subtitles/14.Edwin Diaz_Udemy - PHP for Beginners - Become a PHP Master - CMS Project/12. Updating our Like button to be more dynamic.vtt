00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.160
You guys are ready for the next step.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:12.650
So one thing that I want to do before anything any more ph be colder here is that I want to make sure

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.580
that my resoled are all right.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.850
OK.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.550
Basically you know kill the page or show me a result.

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.790
That's what a function is doing.

7
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.210
We it is confirmed Querrey function somewhere in this function.

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.030
PH We look it up it's there.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.030
So we want to make sure that our resoled is now right.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.770
We need to display some type of information so that where we can fit it just in case something happens.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.560
I know that some of you have been out of the game for a while but get get back to me OK get back to

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.720
the horse.

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.900
So what I want to do is I want to change these class.

14
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
I don't want to but C I won one book.

15
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.250
And I want to change that class.

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:11.680
I want you to display on like or like depending if the user liked the post so we can create this BHB

17
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.470
saying if you haven't I think already show you how to do this two things here.

18
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.100
Ten are already there so I did I did in the course a couple of times.

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.750
So what I want to do is I want to echo and let's use this user like posts.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.080
Let's do the ID and I want to call if they use it like that.

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.800
I want to echo on like if it's true right.

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.780
Like I said class and if they use it then I like it.

23
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.950
I wanted to use it to like it.

24
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.830
Simple as that.

25
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.620
That's that's all I wanted there guys.

26
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.370
And we don't need to make it more complicated than what it is.

27
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.830
It's just that.

28
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.430
So let's go back here.

29
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.850
I know thing we're not going to see down as we go to inspect element.

30
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.940
We want to change this here as well.

31
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.770
So let's get this BHB esteeming or the whole thing.

32
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.840
We get it right.

33
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.760
Right.

34
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.500
OK.

35
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.540
And then there we go and he's got to capitalize this and that.

36
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.180
So let's go back here and let's refresh this.

37
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.440
And this is breaking.

38
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.420
See what I told you.

39
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.190
The whole page is breaking.

40
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.380
Something is going on OK.

41
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.930
Let's go back to functions and we're acquiring the result here.

42
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:09.290
And let's go and look for these functions I'm not seeing any of these confirm Querrey.

43
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.980
I want to be able to see.

44
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.620
Let's go up.

45
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.620
I think I made that functional all the way up

46
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.060
anyway.

47
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.290
I think it was.

48
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.830
I thought it was here somewhere.

49
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.430
Going from Querrey

50
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.170
as I suppose to video.

51
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.590
But anyway as you can see here we are

52
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.120
if it's not resold then we of course die.

53
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.590
Kill the database and show the error.

54
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.400
We're not seeing the error here but maybe if we go to Pyu view page source we can see that it says classic

55
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.900
commands out of sync.

56
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.840
You can't run this command.

57
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.530
Now of course I can google these Arab but I think I have a pretty good idea what that is.

58
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.590
So we are creating we are to by relief.

59
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.020
Let's go back here and you can see that we are inside this prepared statement loop or as TMT whatever

60
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.880
fetch and we have this statement here you see it and my Eskew L and this is something that you don't

61
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.530
know if you haven't really looked into it or study any my issue or stuff it does not allow you to execute

62
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.030
an inquiry where there are still rules to be fetch that are in progress.

63
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.950
OK so if we have stuff that is still in progress going on inside this loop we can do anything unless

64
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.970
we free it.

65
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.160
OK.

66
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.360
So what I want to do is after I'm done with it.

67
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.950
OK.

68
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.050
Right here.

69
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.930
In this loop I want to free it.

70
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:12.810
And I believe they do have a every API or BHB as to how some some of this stuff s t m t free yes free

71
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.330
salt and I'm going to free the s t TMT.

72
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:26.250
OK so once I do that I can actually you know take this to a function or something but once I do that

73
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.910
then my son says once I do that once I did that everything should be good.

74
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:39.720
But we need to do it before this thing and here.

75
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:48.810
So right after content we need to free that souls so that where we can leverage a little bit around

76
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:59.530
with this go so let's free that resort and we should be backing track with this.

77
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.780
We can just put a common here real quick

78
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.670
freeing resoled.

79
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.310
OK let's go back here.

80
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.200
And refresh.

81
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.180
OK.

82
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.290
Like it's not now it's working.

83
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.580
All right.

84
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.390
So now it looks like it's working let me click here and you can see now that is not changing.

85
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.870
Let's refresh.

86
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.170
And now it did change.

87
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.430
And I think I have a pretty good idea why it did not change.

88
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.100
It's because we're using

89
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:48.260
this is like we need a Tref I don't know what a ref is all the way down here where he's always doesn't

90
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.620
have any Tref really what happened to our age ref.

91
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.370
That's next to this.

92
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.130
All right here right here.

93
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.750
So we're just going to take the hash symbol from the ref to the way that page can refresh.

94
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.220
We also want this like to have a space here.

95
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.190
Right here.

96
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.200
So that way we can see the Tom the icon separated from the word a little bit.

97
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.320
So let's do this let's refresh and you can see now we click on it.

98
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.430
He says like any We go to our database

99
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.950
we can see that this post has two legs.

100
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.380
OK.

101
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.420
We need to delete that.

102
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:45.840
But if we go here that's deleted let's delete everything where to make sure this work is working because

103
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:52.800
what it is is that on like is not you see that and Delight's

104
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.370
OK.

105
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.200
That said we should be good here

106
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.040
study this

107
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.980
OK.

108
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:13.550
So we got that now let's go back here.

109
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.860
Let's refresh this a little bit.

110
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.230
Let's click like let's go back to our database and let's refresh this.

111
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.120
And you can see that he has one like.

112
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.870
Now if we go back to that pose

113
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.440
we can see that he says like OK.

114
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.590
So that means we have a like and you like right here as well.

115
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.080
OK.

116
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:50.960
Number five let's click on like he says like now we should see here no likes refresh no likes.

117
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:58.450
And then when we go to polls we should see that that is go back back to zero as he does.

118
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.440
OK.

119
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.060
Really really awesome stuff guys we are done with this.

120
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.520
Yes I like some of the lectures just to make it a little better and make our whole implication a lot

121
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:08.820
better.

122
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.830
Right.

123
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.880
Remember you can change the font size of this.

124
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.890
I can show you a quick way of doing that.

125
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.530
As a matter of fact let's do it right now.

126
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.310
What you guys think you guys ready.

127
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.980
Let's do it.

128
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.010
So I'm going to go.

129
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:26.210
I'm just going to do this real quick I'm going to go to the head are actually not going to even go to

130
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.940
any style show or anything like that.

131
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:34.420
And I know that it's inside a spam and lie.

132
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.210
I call on

133
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.730
lexicon Tom.

134
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:41.510
It's

135
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.120
I don't know if it's thumbs down thumbs up.

136
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.870
I think it is.

137
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.900
And fun size

138
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.990
is let's just make it maybe 22 pitchers or something like that.

139
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.390
OK.

140
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.040
Let's go and see maybe this is wrong.

141
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.850
Tom's

142
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.630
I don't know if I have this correct.

143
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:20.270
Let's just check fresh.

144
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.130
That's not working.

145
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's make this important here with a question mark and that because I know Bush Shrub is there but

146
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.240
no that's not working.

147
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.540
I might have this wrong here guys.

148
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.250
If I can let's go back to refresh guys.

149
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.200
You're welcome to go to the next lecture.

150
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.750
We're done with.

151
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.400
I'm just going to play a little bit around to try to get this to work.

152
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:56.000
You can see that there has doesn't only a class of like.

153
00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:07.220
So if we wanted to we may want to make this work we could Jos use that class.

154
00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.550
OK let's add it right here.

155
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:18.500
A Like let's see that refresh and then you can see that I went up.

156
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.290
OK.

157
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.190
Perfect.

158
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.130
So I think we we're done with this like function to hear but we need to get these lights out of the

159
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:27.670
database.

160
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.090
OK.

161
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.330
So I'll see you in and then let let your guys take your.
