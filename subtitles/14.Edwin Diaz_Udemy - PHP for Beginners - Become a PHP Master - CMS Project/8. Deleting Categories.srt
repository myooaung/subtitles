1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:09,590
All right so right now we are receiving data and we can add data array so we can add some data here.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,570
Now what we need to do is actually BE ABLE TO THE on data at a year and then after we delete that we

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,530
can go ahead.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,600
Also edit it.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,080
So the first thing that we need to do is create a GET request with it get super global.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,650
Right.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,310
So let's do that first.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,620
Well what I want to do is put a link right here on the right hand side.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,690
So every time we clicked we delete this roll right here of the table.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,010
Right.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,600
So we are going to be adding that right here with an echo right here.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,700
OK.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,770
And this is going to be a link and the link is going to have this.

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,720
The cat I d.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,310
The reason why we want to pass the idea because we want to make a very same way whenever you find this

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,790
ID I want you to delete it.

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,390
All right so we're going to make like a little condition based on ID.

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:15,090
So the idea of course this is going to be the I.D. of that specific row right in the database so let's

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,030
do a ref and here this is just an anchor tag.

20
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:29,670
We're going to be passing in some values right in the you or else so we want to catch it in the same

21
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,330
actually make sure this is only single quotes and we want to pass it in.

22
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,510
We want to make sure that it's on the same page category's ph ph B.

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,600
This is the same page right here.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,920
And when we click on it on this link we want to pass it in some parameters.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,820
And of course the Parama is going to be the Katta ID but we want to say questionmark and then we want

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,230
to say delete.

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:05,340
So this is going to make a key in the array and they get requests and they get super global which is

28
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,730
a an array and associative array and this is going to be the key and this will be the value.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,050
So let's just go ahead and say equals and let's just take this from here and put it right here.

30
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,800
All right.

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,540
And here was say something like delete.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,540
That's what we're going to write here.

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,890
So we we go back to where we are good here let's go back to it and let's check it out.

34
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,080
Right now we see that we have a link and we put our muscle where you can see down here that it turns

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,750
into an ID.

36
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,990
If I take it you can see that we do have that on the browser.

37
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,880
So we do have for that specific row we do have a different ID.

38
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,590
So you see it changing up there.

39
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,400
So let's go ahead and make that Querrey.

40
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,460
I was going to go ahead and make the square right here.

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,120
But that's going to confuse you.

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,820
I want to be able to make the question well so it does not confuse you.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,110
And that way we can maybe later on turning this into functions.

44
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,080
All right.

45
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,280
So I'm going to put this to both of these queries together right here.

46
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,130
Just because I want to keep it together here right now.

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:20,590
All right.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,050
Let's just put it a little bit to the side here.

49
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,880
All right.

50
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:39,030
So this Querrey we can make a comment here and say something like fine wine or category's just want

51
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,140
to make this clear for you.

52
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,700
Why all categories Querrey.

53
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,570
All right.

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,160
And then we're going to make something in the bottom of here.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,920
Here we're going to start another one.

56
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,020
So we open ph tag.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,190
Make sure it's lower case.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,150
All right.

59
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,200
Let's do that.

60
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,370
Let's go ahead and create one here.

61
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,910
All right.

62
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,690
I like this cursor going all the way down.

63
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,170
But that's fine.

64
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,520
All right so we want to check first if we see a GET request a get Super Bowl or we're around.

65
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:29,520
So if set we use the sets function within this statement and we say like we've done before in the lectures

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:38,550
before in the course we're checking for the delete key which is going to be right here.

67
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,630
Right.

68
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:48,610
And if we find it then everything is good and we can go ahead and save this ID.

69
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:58,590
Well this key right here is the value of the key actually into another variable called the Cat ID right

70
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,310
here.

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,010
Right.

72
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:09,720
Well we can name this something different like the cat ID name differently because this ID.

73
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,330
All right.

74
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,580
Is is is going to this right here.

75
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,490
All right but we don't.

76
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,470
This is coming already from inside the database right here.

77
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,720
So we could actually when we catch it right here we can name it differently.

78
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,650
So that way does not confuse us.

79
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,440
All we can say.

80
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,460
Get cat ID or whatever you want to call it but I like to sometimes change it that way is doing it for

81
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,500
you basically.

82
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,780
So that way does not confuse you.

83
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,070
All right.

84
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,890
It is the same idea right here.

85
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,220
All right so don't get it wrong.

86
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,110
They just using a different variable.

87
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,990
All right.

88
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:55,830
So when we get this we want to do something here once we get here we do a query so let's do it where

89
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,340
we are right here.

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,120
Let's make sure this is a line right here and there's the query that we want to do to the database.

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,730
Delete from categories

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,020
where Y was a condition where the ID.

93
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,920
Right.

94
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,350
Well actually we need to reference the column in the database which is called Cat ID.

95
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:31,710
He calls this cat ID right so we want to make sure that is in brackets just so he looks good and separated

96
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,450
from this little bit better.

97
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,450
And then we need to send this query.

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,070
Let's just put a little together a little tighter there.

99
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,430
All right.

100
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,180
So the query is going to be delete Kohary.

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,760
That's a good name.

102
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,290
We can name and whatever we want to remember that my Q Well is a function that we're going to be using.

103
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,100
Well my school Querrey we're going to pass it in.

104
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:08,290
Same thing with Pasadena peer connection and inquiry and car auction and Querrey.

105
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,100
All right we could easily copy some of this down but let's do it like this fine.

106
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,280
And what else.

107
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,620
So that's it.

108
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,950
That's about it.

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,780
Now just because we do like this you're going to see what happens.

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,400
So you right now if I clicked delete it does not.

111
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,920
But if I click it again it deletes the reason for this is because we need it.

112
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,160
If we send this request we would like to refresh that page so it will look like he's doing it instantly.

113
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,460
All right.

114
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,820
But in fact we are actually refreshing that page and right now when we click on it is now refreshing

115
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,130
that page should just send in the ID and then we have to have to refresh the page in order for this

116
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:53,540
to work.

117
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,180
So we had to click it twice for it to refresh but we don't want to do that.

118
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:03,430
So what I want to do is actually refresh Sandt once this is done.

119
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:13,530
We want to send the one to make a fresh basically So we're going to say location categories up here

120
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,160
it should be this is just going to refresh the page race basically.

121
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,030
All right.

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,720
It's going to send it again.

123
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,420
Go ahead and send that request back to categories that BHP in another is going to do another request

124
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,770
for the page and it basically is going to refresh.

125
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,220
Right.

126
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,740
So let's do it let's see how that works.

127
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,350
Let's see if it looks better like that.

128
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:41,230
So they let you see that we one time and you deletes it because he's refreshing.

129
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,480
Look at that.

130
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,960
You see it doesn't even have the I.D. right here because it's redirecting back to categories at BHB

131
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,230
before we saw the I.D. on top here.

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,890
So that's one way of doing it.

133
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,330
I think that's pretty cool right.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,640
So we can add the categories again here and we could say something like I don't know Java at it and

135
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,790
we could delete it for if it were good with this.

136
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,140
For them there.

137
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,350
All right.

138
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,700
Whoops sorry.

139
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,740
All right so think this is looking good.

140
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,780
So this just put a little bit wary.

141
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,410
All right that's fine.

142
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,140
We're just going to come into a little bit there.

143
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,420
All right just to make a little bit neater.

144
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,790
All right.

145
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,130
So all right so we are done here.

146
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,900
And let's go ahead and continue with the next lecture I think this one already got too long.

147
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,420
Take care and I'll see you in the next one.

148
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,120
Bye bye.
