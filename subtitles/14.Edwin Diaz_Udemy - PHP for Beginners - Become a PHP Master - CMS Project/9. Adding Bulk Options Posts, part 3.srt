00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,740
Hi welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm really glad that you are watching this lecture here and you're going to be learning a lot more on

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:06,890
this one.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,150
I promise you that.

5
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,580
Now let's go ahead and get on with this.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,510
Now we had some functionalities here actually some features but we haven't added functionality yet always

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,140
the functionalities and we haven't even done that yet.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,110
But anyways we started right.

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,400
That's what's important.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,760
So on the last lecture here we added a an array right here on this input as a value for this name match

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,250
review.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,820
And of course you know that his name actually will send information via posts.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:43,530
We have a form by here and we need to catch a song where the are is going to be every time we click

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,170
on one of these.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:53,010
Something we need to send the ID of this specific post so we can do things with them when we select

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,170
the right here and click on these buttons right.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,160
So this array saving each of these values we need is something there that we save many different values.

18
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,860
An array is a perfect container for it.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,510
An array can hold as many values as our machine has memory has.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,630
And you know and it's great.

21
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,130
So let's go ahead and do that.

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,990
Let's go ahead and catch those values and do something with them.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,540
So right now we have we know we have this array right here and we need to catch it.

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,820
All right so we are going to be going all the way to the top of this form and before eating this phone

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,070
starts we're going to be writing some Ph.D. I'm doing this because it's getting kind of crowded down

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,260
there with a lot of Kohary.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,790
So let's go into this right here.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,890
So first we need to check if it's available because we don't want to start doing things if it's not

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,050
available.

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,500
We all get errors.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,040
So the way we do this is by doing of course using the post-Super global because we use in post data

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:08,820
right here and we're going to be checking for the name of this array which is check Bhatt's array.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,320
Let's just double check that's the name right here.

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,520
That's the name I'm just going to copy.

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,530
We don't need to put his brackets there.

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,060
We're just checking for the name right there.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,710
All right.

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,850
So we're good to go there right.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,610
So let's make sure that we put a that we are receiving data on she's going to say something like receiving

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,860
data.

41
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,530
Let's check it out.

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:50,180
So if we come here and we select all this and we click Apply we see that it says receiving data.

43
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,710
All right.

44
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,170
Now we can do a little something a lot better than that.

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,120
All right.

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,980
We could actually print out the IDs are coming out right.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,910
We could do that if we wanted to.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,750
But anyway let me show you now how we can do that.

49
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:14,520
So what I want to do right now I'm just explaining one single type of data or just one string.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,210
Because right now there is not there is no loop going around this is an array but I need a little to

51
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,560
go around to through these array.

52
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:32,090
So what's better then to use a For Each loop that takes care of us takes care of that looping around

53
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,090
to the end of the array.

54
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,810
Right.

55
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,140
You mean.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,810
So let's do a four each.

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,500
And what we need to loop around is this Ray right here right.

58
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,770
Perfect.

59
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,690
And then we're going to use the keyword as because we are going to be assigning.

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:03,630
And if you don't remember how to write a For Each loop go to the to the course on top of this CMOS section

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,790
and go to for each loops.

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,260
Right.

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
And make sure that you understand how it works.

64
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,310
We're going to add the key we're ass and we're going to be looping through each of these values and

65
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,650
we're going to be naming it check.

66
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,970
And this is a custom variable that I'm making up.

67
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,530
I can put any variable i want.

68
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,830
Basically what we're doing is we are going through each of these fields right here I am assigning a

69
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,380
value to each of this as we loop around.

70
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,020
All right.

71
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,600
And the reason why I want to do that is because look at this if I want to echo the value every time

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,800
it goes around you say call.

73
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:56,220
And if I go here and they say plie actually right here I got an error on line sets out to do for each.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:07,050
OK of course I have a narrow there because looping through here and I have to there should only have

75
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,370
one.

76
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:07,940
Right.

77
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,630
I have to.

78
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,050
All right.

79
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,220
So if I click here and I click Apply you can see the IDs 37 and 30 now this plane so it's looping around

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,170
already.

81
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,880
Perfect.

82
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,260
All right.

83
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,970
Before we cut this section off I want to take this out of here.

84
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,630
All right.

85
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:38,520
So what I really want to do right is we need to name this select right here.

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:43,690
We need to actually give it a name on the value and because we're going to be picking up this value

87
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,500
soon.

88
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:51,420
So let's call this Baalke options.

89
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,170
All right.

90
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:01,800
We're going to be checking his value see your book options and we are going to be taking this as a post

91
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:11,210
like this and going to copy and paste this one right here actually.

92
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,420
I mean the confusion what I'm doing is Hoopes

93
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:28,060
is basically picking that value from the select in assigning it to a book options variable there that

94
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,990
I just me there and I'm doing that because we're going to be using this book in a switch statement.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,530
But we're going to do next lecture I'm going to keep this one short.

96
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,050
All right.

97
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,600
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture on the next one we're going to be doing so more

98
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,280
and more advance really cool functions.

99
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,000
All right.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,570
Take care and I see you then.

101
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,650
Take care.

102
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,540
Bye.
