1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.430
Book them back my student.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.540
So let's keep going where application let's keep writing more Your else.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.350
So we have the front page.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.020
All mostly all working right now the only thing that we need to do is replace the slings links right

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.720
because as you saw there when I click here it takes me to it's that BHB So what you might want to do

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.560
is you want to go to your head or whatever that is.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.660
I think in this case we have here which would be the navigation school back here.

8
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.610
Let's see where I put that so all in close navigation.

9
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.400
OK that's navigation.

10
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.440
Called see a mess front.

11
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.930
See if I remember where I put this the right ear.

12
00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.440
So if I replace this and you place in there save in come back here.

13
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.880
Now if I click that you can see that it's not there.

14
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.330
OK.

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.500
You can also place a forward slash like this save.

16
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.610
Come back here and you click on it.

17
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.090
Let's just take that out.

18
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.790
Well.

19
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.180
Are you my.

20
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.980
Why you want to do actually let's go back here.

21
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.550
Say see a mess like that.

22
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.350
To fix that.

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.760
As you can see now is good.

24
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.680
OK.

25
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.300
So let's go and try to get this poll here fixed up so that we you have an idea how we can do this to

26
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.980
the other pages because once I show you how to do it to this page you have to replace the query string

27
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.550
because we have a query string here.

28
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.950
We're going to be able to do it for categories or whatever other page you have.

29
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.450
Right.

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.960
We're going to be able to do it for whatever other pages.

31
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.220
So I'm going to show you how to do it for that page.

32
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.680
That way you have an idea how to do it for the rest.

33
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.240
So let's get to it.

34
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.880
Let's go and let's write something for post.

35
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.880
Let's come back here and let's see what we got.

36
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.590
All we need to match post up BHB.

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.050
Well we need to match this guy here as well.

38
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.000
And we placed this OK.

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.060
All right let's go back.

40
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.310
Let's see how we can do this.

41
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.780
Let's create another rewrite rule.

42
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.460
Rewrite rule and I want interests to start with post.

43
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.300
So when you find posts I want you to find actually.

44
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.510
Let's just start post that BHB

45
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.150
and well we know that he has the underscore ID and we don't know the value yet.

46
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.290
So we're going to just put that back here.

47
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.750
OK I'm going to do it like this so that way you can have an idea of what I'm doing.

48
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.610
OK.

49
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.510
So I want to match that.

50
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.490
OK.

51
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.310
But we can actually even make our own queries we can make our own you or else here.

52
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.870
OK.

53
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.470
So not only are we we can matchable we can replace it even make it tight and you or you or else if we

54
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.170
wanted to.

55
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.680
So what I'm going to do is going to say whoa stop like this OK.

56
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.720
And once you see post I want you to put a forward last year I'm going to put a parenthesis here like

57
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.810
this and this.

58
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.180
This is the backslash OK.

59
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.180
And the means digit.

60
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.480
So I want you to go ahead and match any digits you got there and save it.

61
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.070
You see the parentheses there.

62
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.090
OK.

63
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:08.430
And and so I'm going to end that and the right here let me just bring that back here it's together.

64
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.950
I'm just going to put a space there and now whatever did you find there.

65
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.250
I want you to play them here and we're going to use a dollar symbol in one.

66
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.920
OK.

67
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.590
Now guys this is just a little bit of regular expressions and boy might seem confusing but once you

68
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.730
take my course a regular expression this is going to become super easy to understand and you're going

69
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.220
to be able to do a lot more than what you see right now.

70
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.930
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

71
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:39.000
But anyway so we ended up with if not case sensitive and last and that's it I think we should be good

72
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.430
here.

73
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.890
There's nothing else.

74
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.220
Make sure you save it.

75
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.490
And now this is 1:13.

76
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.880
Let's go back here and now if we put post for us last 113 enter.

77
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.370
And as you can see we get the post but we're not getting styles and you might be wondering why that

78
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.510
is I'm going to tell you right now why it is.

79
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.550
What if you go to Hetter in your front page.

80
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.430
Right now what you need to do with links because this is going to break some links.

81
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.470
OK.

82
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:20.000
So what you need to do is you need to actually put down your whole relative path here.

83
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.780
OK.

84
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.670
Right now we have Ardai HGH is right here.

85
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.270
OK we got to tell it well that the says is coming from this folder in this CSSA folder here.

86
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.470
So for Slash see a mess and that's it.

87
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:45.070
Or slashy a mess for Slash of course saving come back here and refresh that.

88
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.360
And while it works you look at that that looks a lot better than the question we had.

89
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.030
Right.

90
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.000
And it doesn't affect the speed of the site.

91
00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.040
Now one thing that I want to fix is that we are and we go back here if we click here you can see that

92
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.220
you are able to link down here.

93
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.330
He has a quite a string.

94
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.800
So we still getting that.

95
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:18.390
Let's go to him that's and finish the that BHP and right here instead of actually having all these squares

96
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.790
straight.

97
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.000
Now we could do this.

98
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.440
Post folks Slash come back here

99
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.460
click here and La see that beautiful.

100
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.220
Now of course we don't have the image OK.

101
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.410
That's just.

102
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.690
And you might want to work on facing that.

103
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.980
Well let's come back here real quick.

104
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.610
We need to fix that link.

105
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.660
And we see that was them.

106
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.390
OK.

107
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.320
We need to fix that.

108
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.620
And when I come back on the next lecture We'll fix that and we will get things working OK.

109
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.030
Because so much and I'll see you in the next lecture.
