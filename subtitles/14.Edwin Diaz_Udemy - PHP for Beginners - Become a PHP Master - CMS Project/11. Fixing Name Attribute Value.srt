00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:08,100
Welcome back and my this student This is Edwin from the future and I'm back here just to help you to

2

00:00:08,100  -->  00:00:11,290
prevent some mistakes in the future in your code.

3

00:00:11,520  -->  00:00:12,030
All right.

4

00:00:12,090  -->  00:00:18,090
So basically instead of replacing the lecture I like to make videos like this so that way you know that

5

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:21,720
I'm always helping you out that I'm always coming back and helping you.

6

00:00:21,720  -->  00:00:22,360
All right.

7

00:00:22,380  -->  00:00:27,170
So anyway next lectures we are going to be creating a logging update functionality right.

8

00:00:27,400  -->  00:00:29,110
A UPDATE functionality.

9

00:00:29,250  -->  00:00:33,630
So we need some keywords right here in this select element.

10

00:00:33,630  -->  00:00:35,740
We need ID right here.

11

00:00:35,740  -->  00:00:36,410
All right.

12

00:00:36,420  -->  00:00:42,360
So in these name much of you in the value field we are going to be putting ID we need this in order

13

00:00:42,360  -->  00:00:44,920
for us to update our database.

14

00:00:45,060  -->  00:00:45,380
All right.

15

00:00:45,390  -->  00:00:47,100
Because we need to send this value.

16

00:00:47,130  -->  00:00:50,480
So make sure that you have this set right now.

17

00:00:50,790  -->  00:00:51,240
All right.

18

00:00:51,240  -->  00:00:56,760
And even though you might not see me having this in the next lectures don't worry about it just make

19

00:00:56,760  -->  00:00:59,590
sure that you have a set right.

20

00:00:59,610  -->  00:01:05,310
You don't need to remove this because we will use this anyway I want you to say hi to my husband from

21

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:09,660
the past and you will see many of me in the future.

22

00:01:09,660  -->  00:01:10,010
All right.

23

00:01:10,020  -->  00:01:15,120
So many versions of me will always come to the course and help you out with anything you need or any

24

00:01:15,120  -->  00:01:17,680
mistakes we have made on the course.

25

00:01:17,700  -->  00:01:22,520
This is a very big course and I keep adding lectures all the time so.

26

00:01:22,650  -->  00:01:23,320
All right.

27

00:01:23,550  -->  00:01:27,430
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lectures.

28

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:27,780
Take care
