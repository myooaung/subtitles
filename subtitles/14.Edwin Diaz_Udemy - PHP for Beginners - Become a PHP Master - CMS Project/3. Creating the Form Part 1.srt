1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,000
OK so I can start with you know the back end.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,300
Basically I could start with BHP or our I could I can start with the h the amount.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,990
Basically what I want to do is let's just put it here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,100
I want to create a little bone right here that when I select it is going to change or translate whatever

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,220
I got here so I could start with a P because I already know the code but I want to start with something

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,420
physical so that way you guys can see how everything works.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,240
Because if I start with a BHP code you guys are not gonna have a clue what I'm doing.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,620
All right.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,530
So let's start with that button there I want to create that bond so I'm going to go to the registration

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,490
page and basically it's not a button is a form and has a select button.

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,410
So we're gonna put it right below here okay.

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,890
And you're gonna say form

13
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:13,160
I'm just gonna do a simple form like this and it of input I'm not going to have any input buttons here

14
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,760
and select is an input it should and I actually set by and then I.

15
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,440
Sorry about that guys.

16
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,940
All right.

17
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,370
Let's just have a select here.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,620
Complicating myself here.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,420
So this is going to have a variable here that we're going to take to the BHP side so we can detect it.

20
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,080
Okay.

21
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,110
And let's just put some values here so you guys can see it.

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,870
Option

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,050
is put your option.

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,200
There we go.

25
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,120
And the value is going to be English.

26
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,830
And we're going to have another option is going to be Spanish Yes.

27
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,190
Let's just put English here and Spanish

28
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,230
go.

29
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:23,530
So now I'm not in that I want to do I could actually add a class here to make this go to the right.

30
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:31,930
So as a matter of fact there is a classical NAF bar form and nav bar.

31
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,840
Right.

32
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,690
That would help me out a lot.

33
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,240
All righty.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:45,090
And this would be the form control so let's see how that looks.

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,240
What is this.

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,690
Something I got there.

37
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's think come behind here.

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,160
Let's just put this in a different screen so that way you guys can see it better.

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,620
Let's refresh and now we have those two selections there.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,200
Perfect.

41
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,670
So now that we have this what I want is what I want to happen here what we're going to be doing basically

42
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,620
is we are going to be creating a javascript code.

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,900
We are going to be put in a javascript code here that is going to send information once we do something.

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,550
OK.

45
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,960
So we can add it doing something like this on change.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,450
Once this select button is changed to something else once I click it and it's selected to something

47
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,470
else I want some action I want something to happen.

48
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:46,090
So I'm going to call a function that could be like change sea change language or something like that

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,660
language OK.

50
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,610
So I'm going to have a function that's going to be called when I do this.

51
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,200
OK.

52
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,470
Language

53
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,950
and just give it an idea so we can pull out some data language form.

54
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,570
So now every time this changes and going to execute this function.

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,310
OK.

56
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,000
So this function could be executed from all the way in the bottom here.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,020
So this is where I'm going to do script and I'm going to do function

58
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:41,840
and just to make sure that it works I'm going to do a console dialogue and he's going to say it works.

59
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,500
So I'm going to open my console right here it sure is big.

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,890
So you guys can see it when I click it.

61
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,060
You see now that he says he works.

62
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,200
Put it back there.

63
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Another one.

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,570
OK.

65
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
So that's working that's beautiful.

66
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,720
So again all I do here was attach an event handler

67
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,540
to the form

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:17,060
and every time I click on select or change it is going to execute this function right here OK.

69
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,070
Perfect.

70
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,830
So we've got a couple more things that we need to do a couple more checks.

71
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:32,780
But what I want to do at the end of this and you know you guys and show you how to do this.

72
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:45,380
But what I want to do is I want to access that form by its I.D. which is the language form I believe.

73
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,220
Let's just check it yeah.

74
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,860
Language form is the I.D. of that form.

75
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,680
And what I want to do is I want to submit the form so I'm going to use this submit function that's built

76
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,910
in OK.

77
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,620
And once you submit it that form is going to send some data.

78
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,650
Where is it.

79
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,270
Passed it.

80
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,730
Right here.

81
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,590
So this form is going to submit the data and that data is going to be method get even though it is by

82
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:30,620
default get we're just going to make sure that it's here that is stated here OK so once it's a mix that

83
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,370
is going to give us some type of data in the PSB code.

84
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,290
OK.

85
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,720
But we are not going to submit the form right now as a matter of fact let's just let's just try for

86
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
the for the fun of it.

87
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,600
If I click here let's just refresh it.

88
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:54,210
Let's see if that form submits some data ok that my mind is not met is not a function it's given me

89
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,550
some arrows with that code.

90
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,710
Let me see what I did wrong here.

91
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,650
Language form submit

92
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,340
submit

93
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,490
to make sure that that's working before we move on.

94
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,380
Let me get.

95
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,100
Make sure that I got the right I.D. from here.

96
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,610
Oh I'm sorry.

97
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,390
This is not.

98
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,020
This is the I.D. for the select.

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,910
We need it to.

100
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:33,860
We need to give the form that I.D. in now let's just refresh it so you can see we did not get any errors.

101
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,890
OK.

102
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:43,830
And the reason why this is actually refreshing here is changing basically is because you know once we

103
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,370
refresh the page is going to go back to number one.

104
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:47,980
Right.

105
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,640
The reason why this is actually changing from Spanish to English right now if you notice if I put in

106
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,840
Spanish it changes back to English is because the pages are refreshing.

107
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,110
OK.

108
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,080
Every time the form has been submitted.

109
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,230
So that's why it's actually not staying there in Spanish but we're not getting any errors here.

110
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,470
So we're good to go.

111
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:07,800
All right.

112
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,450
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

113
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,800
Guys let's do this.
