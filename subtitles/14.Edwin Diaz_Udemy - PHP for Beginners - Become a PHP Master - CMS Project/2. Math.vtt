00:00:00.560  -->  00:00:05.230
I will come back on this video we are going to be learning how to do math in Ph be.

2

00:00:05.340  -->  00:00:07.140
So let's go ahead and open our co-editor

3

00:00:09.960  -->  00:00:11.980
and don't mind these files here.

4

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:21.360
If you don't have all these files because I might make lectures before this one here that I now related

5

00:00:21.360  -->  00:00:22.680
to the ones you got in your computer.

6

00:00:22.680  -->  00:00:27.680
So right now all you have to care about is that you have to just open up blank that BHB and we're going

7

00:00:27.680  -->  00:00:34.740
to be doing the Save As Sometimes I decide to make different lectures later on when I'm already done

8

00:00:34.740  -->  00:00:35.820
with a lot of lecture.

9

00:00:35.820  -->  00:00:40.620
So I would put I would make another lecture and put it right in the middle of my course because I just

10

00:00:40.620  -->  00:00:44.790
wanted to add it to the course so I would have all the files involved there.

11

00:00:45.000  -->  00:00:50.050
And you might now have certain files so don't worry about that just worry about the lecture.

12

00:00:50.220  -->  00:00:55.420
So worry about these blank that BHB that it should be it should be of course a size file.

13

00:00:55.770  -->  00:00:59.040
Doesn't matter what part of the corps I am right.

14

00:00:59.040  -->  00:01:02.750
So we got to make a save as on this blank that BHB.

15

00:01:02.790  -->  00:01:04.310
All right.

16

00:01:04.620  -->  00:01:07.050
I'm just going to close this.

17

00:01:07.510  -->  00:01:07.890
All right.

18

00:01:07.890  -->  00:01:11.500
So let's open up a BHB tag here.

19

00:01:12.720  -->  00:01:15.310
And let's talk about math.

20

00:01:15.630  -->  00:01:17.510
Very simple.

21

00:01:17.610  -->  00:01:18.950
So math what is math.

22

00:01:18.960  -->  00:01:24.830
Well we know that math is just calculated numbers in Ph.D. We do math like we do in real life.

23

00:01:24.930  -->  00:01:32.130
So we say let's say we want to print out 50 states plus 45 and

24

00:01:35.160  -->  00:01:39.390
we can see that he said right away we have this internal calculator working for us.

25

00:01:39.390  -->  00:01:44.950
What I really wanted to show you is that you can do math you can do addition.

26

00:01:45.810  -->  00:01:59.220
And then just going to you can also do subtraction will range between here so that where we have a break

27

00:02:00.690  -->  00:02:03.230
they're close in.

28

00:02:03.720  -->  00:02:04.760
All right.

29

00:02:05.190  -->  00:02:12.360
We can do more to placation this just copy this whole thing there and I'm just showing you the syntax

30

00:02:12.450  -->  00:02:20.790
multiplication like this with an asterisk this should be your number am your key word.

31

00:02:20.790  -->  00:02:22.140
We also can do a division

32

00:02:25.410  -->  00:02:27.610
like this with a four slash.

33

00:02:28.530  -->  00:02:31.710
And this is called a floating number right.

34

00:02:32.010  -->  00:02:34.590
Because we have a decimal there.

35

00:02:34.620  -->  00:02:41.700
This isn't an integer because there's a whole number you know that by now right.

36

00:02:41.790  -->  00:02:43.520
So we can do this like this.

37

00:02:43.530  -->  00:02:51.150
And another thing that we could do is let me just put another brick tag right here.

38

00:02:51.410  -->  00:02:52.620
These two spaces

39

00:02:56.130  -->  00:03:06.000
is that we can Forty-Five two numbers then we can multiply them and we can divide it.

40

00:03:06.450  -->  00:03:07.960
Then we can track.

41

00:03:07.980  -->  00:03:10.450
We can do a whole bunch of different things like this.

42

00:03:10.530  -->  00:03:15.440
And it was a calculated calculated force it would do just like a regular calculator.

43

00:03:15.450  -->  00:03:18.480
Now let me do another one.

44

00:03:18.510  -->  00:03:24.990
Last one I want to show you something very important.

45

00:03:25.470  -->  00:03:30.490
I want to show you the order of operation to the functions.

46

00:03:30.540  -->  00:03:31.620
I mean the math

47

00:03:33.980  -->  00:03:34.970
right.

48

00:03:34.980  -->  00:03:40.590
So the last one gave was a 55 and you might be wondering why in the world is that if five plus five

49

00:03:40.590  -->  00:03:41.320
is ten.

50

00:03:41.340  -->  00:03:47.620
Ten plus ten times ten is a hundred fifty five why did he gave it gave us.

51

00:03:47.790  -->  00:03:55.980
Well the vote operation in piece is same and mostly all programming languages is the same as your basic

52

00:03:55.980  -->  00:03:57.150
math from school.

53

00:03:57.150  -->  00:04:02.630
Do you remember that you need to put parentheses in order for you to get certain elements before Sure

54

00:04:02.640  -->  00:04:06.960
an elemental multiply will equally certain elements before certain elements right.

55

00:04:06.960  -->  00:04:14.400
So if I wanted to add this before and multiply I would go ahead and put parentheses around it and save

56

00:04:14.400  -->  00:04:14.590
it.

57

00:04:14.640  -->  00:04:20.980
And you can see this changed to 100 because we are adding five plus five before we multiply this.

58

00:04:21.060  -->  00:04:26.550
So we add five plus five is 10 and 10 plus 10 is 100.

59

00:04:26.820  -->  00:04:31.180
So with parentheses we can change the order of operation of numbers.

60

00:04:31.230  -->  00:04:39.810
We know that multiplication goes before that's why we got 55 last time because we say five times 10

61

00:04:39.810  -->  00:04:50.310
is 50 and then 50 plus five is 55 and division dissenting with division division goes first five divided

62

00:04:50.310  -->  00:04:52.810
by 10 by five.

63

00:04:52.950  -->  00:05:00.000
Five divided by ten ryo ten divided by five and then plus five is five point five.

64

00:05:00.570  -->  00:05:01.120
All right.

65

00:05:01.320  -->  00:05:08.610
So remember that division multiplication goes before addition and subtraction always.

66

00:05:08.610  -->  00:05:13.650
And that's just the basic order of operation I wanted to show you that before we continue on we see

67

00:05:13.650  -->  00:05:16.750
any other math involved in the course.

68

00:05:16.770  -->  00:05:18.020
Very simple to do that.

69

00:05:18.060  -->  00:05:28.190
We can also just for the record when I do echo here we can save these variables.

70

00:05:28.540  -->  00:05:29.390
All right.

71

00:05:29.610  -->  00:05:34.630
And also look car collisions with a just just you know just to give an example here

72

00:05:38.450  -->  00:05:41.540
and we can go ahead and call number.

73

00:05:41.550  -->  00:05:43.290
Will this make it different variables.

74

00:05:43.290  -->  00:05:50.530
Of course the number one plus number two right

75

00:05:53.670  -->  00:05:56.810
does 36 because 12 and 24 36.

76

00:05:56.810  -->  00:05:58.930
And then we can multiply here.

77

00:05:59.110  -->  00:05:59.520
All right.

78

00:05:59.520  -->  00:06:04.570
That should give you basic some basic knowledge about math and how we can do it with PH B.

79

00:06:04.620  -->  00:06:09.240
So give us some knowledge about order of operation there and that's all the math you need right now

80

00:06:09.240  -->  00:06:10.360
for this course.

81

00:06:10.560  -->  00:06:11.160
Of course.

82

00:06:11.160  -->  00:06:17.700
I will also give you some more information about some other type of calculations that BHB offers for

83

00:06:17.700  -->  00:06:19.200
us of course.

84

00:06:19.200  -->  00:06:21.910
Built in functions right.

85

00:06:21.930  -->  00:06:26.970
So those built building functions are going to help us calculate do other things with numbers that we

86

00:06:26.970  -->  00:06:31.030
need in order for us to make our programs more flexible and then.

87

00:06:31.110  -->  00:06:37.800
Anyways I hope this was very useful to you and you were able to learn a lot in this lecture and I'm

88

00:06:37.800  -->  00:06:39.150
looking forward to see you in the next one.

89

00:06:39.150  -->  00:06:41.960
So take care and I'll see you in the next one.
