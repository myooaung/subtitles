00:00:00.450  -->  00:00:05.910
Welcome back my students in this lecture here I'm going to show you how to build a simple loader that's

2

00:00:05.910  -->  00:00:08.730
going to make your application look a lot nicer.

3

00:00:08.730  -->  00:00:10.120
Let me just show you how it works.

4

00:00:10.230  -->  00:00:14.600
For click on dashboard or any on that page you're going to see this Lowder's appear on the screen.

5

00:00:14.940  -->  00:00:18.830
This is super nice and the best thing about is that you can change your background.

6

00:00:18.930  -->  00:00:24.570
You can change the loader itself and you can have different images happening on the screen here when

7

00:00:24.570  -->  00:00:26.060
you lower your page.

8

00:00:26.060  -->  00:00:26.540
All right.

9

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:29.660
So let me go ahead and show you right away how to do this.

10

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:36.510
So the first thing that we need to do is you need to have some images you need to have the background

11

00:00:36.570  -->  00:00:41.520
of the header of the loader which is that gray background with a square and a lower rate cell which

12

00:00:41.520  -->  00:00:42.950
is the middle part of it.

13

00:00:43.140  -->  00:00:43.650
Right.

14

00:00:43.870  -->  00:00:45.480
So go ahead to this.

15

00:00:45.480  -->  00:00:48.750
In this lecture here go ahead and download those two files.

16

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:55.650
All right the next thing is that you're going to have also a snippet in this lecture right here so download

17

00:00:55.650  -->  00:00:57.230
that also.

18

00:00:57.240  -->  00:01:02.000
All right so you're going to give you the C Ss and the images.

19

00:01:02.220  -->  00:01:06.160
So the images you're going to go to your admin and you're going to place it in the images folder and

20

00:01:06.160  -->  00:01:09.090
say admin just like I did right here.

21

00:01:09.090  -->  00:01:09.510
All right.

22

00:01:09.520  -->  00:01:16.650
And your SEE says you're going to come here to see SS because it's a good idea to actually separate

23

00:01:16.650  -->  00:01:23.020
your CSSA style sheets from the main ones that you have here from the bootstrap style sheets.

24

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:23.630
All right.

25

00:01:23.670  -->  00:01:27.200
So go to your store see a SS folder right click on it.

26

00:01:27.230  -->  00:01:32.440
Or just create a new filing their code styles of the SS.

27

00:01:32.860  -->  00:01:40.130
Save it and then go to your admin Hetter And right below this if statement right here.

28

00:01:40.230  -->  00:01:42.600
If.

29

00:01:42.830  -->  00:01:49.200
Is an if statement checking to see we have or responded Yes actually right here just copy one of these

30

00:01:49.200  -->  00:01:50.130
down.

31

00:01:50.130  -->  00:01:53.330
Pasted right below here and link your style.

32

00:01:53.610  -->  00:01:58.060
She writes.

33

00:01:58.620  -->  00:02:02.770
So I'm going to come here just to make sure that is actually there.

34

00:02:02.780  -->  00:02:08.880
I'm going to write click and I'm going to check page source and I'll make sure that my style she's right

35

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:15.780
here is going to click it and it says that it's not so I'm missing something there let's go back to

36

00:02:15.780  -->  00:02:23.930
admin header and that means I missed my extension and some words in there you see that if it's not linked

37

00:02:24.030  -->  00:02:25.670
is not going to give you that style.

38

00:02:25.670  -->  00:02:27.520
She lets you do it now.

39

00:02:27.630  -->  00:02:28.450
There we go.

40

00:02:28.590  -->  00:02:32.210
All right so it's linked perfect right.

41

00:02:32.370  -->  00:02:33.560
So we don't have a problem with that.

42

00:02:33.570  -->  00:02:36.710
The next thing is make sure you images are there.

43

00:02:36.800  -->  00:02:39.770
Go to use your scripts.

44

00:02:39.930  -->  00:02:42.800
Yes and this is what we're going to be placing our code right.

45

00:02:43.650  -->  00:02:49.280
Right before the end of the document right which is this function right here.

46

00:02:49.340  -->  00:02:50.400
The end tag.

47

00:02:50.670  -->  00:02:55.750
Right below then tucked right here right so make a little space for it right here.

48

00:02:55.750  -->  00:03:02.610
Right now the style CSSA ongoing that you have in your that you just downloaded from this lecture go

49

00:03:02.610  -->  00:03:08.940
to study see SS and paste it right there right and let me just explain to you what we are doing here

50

00:03:09.330  -->  00:03:09.600
then.

51

00:03:09.590  -->  00:03:15.970
No scream is going to be the background of the loader dikegrave background with the squares.

52

00:03:16.050  -->  00:03:17.610
This is that file right here.

53

00:03:17.610  -->  00:03:21.000
Header hyphen backed up B and G.

54

00:03:21.030  -->  00:03:25.000
Going to position effects of Z in that which is.

55

00:03:25.080  -->  00:03:31.050
Which means that is going to be a ball if all the elements in the HD m.p.h. So we get to see this no

56

00:03:31.050  -->  00:03:32.090
matter what we do.

57

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:35.990
All right is going to be on top of every HD m.p.h. element.

58

00:03:36.090  -->  00:03:39.080
We've got we've got the with 100 and the high to 16 pixels.

59

00:03:39.090  -->  00:03:47.870
Very very very common and the loading is going to be the the get the loader itself while right this

60

00:03:47.870  -->  00:03:50.760
is all the properties for the loader and their values.

61

00:03:51.030  -->  00:03:52.290
All right.

62

00:03:52.290  -->  00:03:53.070
All right perfect.

63

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:55.330
Remember this is an admin.

64

00:03:55.350  -->  00:04:00.450
Now the next thing is it is the code that we need to write in javascript so what we are going to be

65

00:04:00.450  -->  00:04:04.710
doing here is we're going to be actually using Jake Querrey.

66

00:04:04.740  -->  00:04:08.670
So let me just show you here a function that is going to be used and we're going to target the body

67

00:04:08.670  -->  00:04:09.970
of the document.

68

00:04:10.110  -->  00:04:14.100
We're going to be using a function called prepared and just write everything that I'm writing right

69

00:04:14.100  -->  00:04:15.130
now.

70

00:04:15.130  -->  00:04:15.690
All right.

71

00:04:15.810  -->  00:04:22.420
And for example if I say hello here with this little function very simple function right.

72

00:04:22.460  -->  00:04:23.830
Superpowerful.

73

00:04:24.030  -->  00:04:28.420
I'm going to save it and you can see that something happened here something moved.

74

00:04:28.560  -->  00:04:33.730
Let me just right clicking Specht element and I'm going to show you right now you see right here we've

75

00:04:33.910  -->  00:04:36.090
got the word hello right here.

76

00:04:36.090  -->  00:04:40.130
So it prepended that we're into our body right below the body tax.

77

00:04:40.140  -->  00:04:41.160
That's what we're going to be doing.

78

00:04:41.160  -->  00:04:45.350
We're going to be prepending a NHT male elements in there.

79

00:04:45.690  -->  00:04:46.300
All right.

80

00:04:46.440  -->  00:04:53.430
So we're going to make a VAR called dev bots and we're going to have some new elements in there.

81

00:04:53.430  -->  00:04:53.840
All right.

82

00:04:53.850  -->  00:04:58.230
Basically it is variable here and this is how you declare a variable in javascript.

83

00:04:58.230  -->  00:05:02.850
Those of you that don't know whether with a keyword var.

84

00:05:03.360  -->  00:05:07.410
Now I'm just going to be sitting here and I'm going to let you copy it down.

85

00:05:07.410  -->  00:05:15.750
Basically we have two divs here right and we have one div inside another right here with the idea of

86

00:05:15.750  -->  00:05:18.870
loading and the one with the idea of low scream.

87

00:05:19.140  -->  00:05:26.310
And then we get to be prepending that if but variable to the body right then we're going to be using

88

00:05:26.310  -->  00:05:32.910
a function a couple of functions here chained together and I'm going to explain to you how that works

89

00:05:32.910  -->  00:05:33.420
in a minute.

90

00:05:33.430  -->  00:05:35.760
But let me paste it in here.

91

00:05:35.880  -->  00:05:42.570
So we are targeting the low screen which is this idea right here that's the background and we've got

92

00:05:42.570  -->  00:05:45.770
the laded seven hundred milliseconds.

93

00:05:45.780  -->  00:05:48.870
If I make it to seven thousand This is seven seconds.

94

00:05:48.870  -->  00:05:52.750
So this function is the lane the appearance of that.

95

00:05:53.070  -->  00:05:58.140
Then we're going to fade it out in 600 milliseconds and you can target that you can pull whatever sequence

96

00:05:58.140  -->  00:05:59.100
you want here.

97

00:05:59.130  -->  00:06:03.590
This is now having a second and then we are removing that item.

98

00:06:03.590  -->  00:06:03.930
All right.

99

00:06:03.940  -->  00:06:04.750
That's what we using.

100

00:06:04.830  -->  00:06:05.790
The key word does.

101

00:06:05.820  -->  00:06:09.170
Because we are removing whatever day we got there.

102

00:06:09.210  -->  00:06:09.600
All right.

103

00:06:09.630  -->  00:06:13.040
So let's just make sure that we save everything.

104

00:06:13.200  -->  00:06:13.950
Let's go back here.

105

00:06:13.950  -->  00:06:15.390
Let's see if it's working.

106

00:06:15.400  -->  00:06:21.020
If we're not missing anything then we go really simple right.

107

00:06:21.030  -->  00:06:22.950
This is working now.

108

00:06:23.430  -->  00:06:24.030
All right.

109

00:06:24.060  -->  00:06:29.790
You might want to send if you want in the future or you can you know mortified to your needs.

110

00:06:29.790  -->  00:06:33.040
I just wanted to show you how you can do something like this.

111

00:06:33.040  -->  00:06:33.440
All right.

112

00:06:33.450  -->  00:06:36.750
And there are many loaders online there are many different backgrounds you can do.

113

00:06:37.110  -->  00:06:39.350
And there are many different ways of doing it.

114

00:06:39.360  -->  00:06:43.260
Now you have an idea how it works and I hope you enjoyed it.

115

00:06:43.530  -->  00:06:47.700
Thank you so much and I see you in the next lecture
