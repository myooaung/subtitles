00:00:01.030  -->  00:00:08.110
All right so we are doing this for the comments form and we need to check it out.

2

00:00:08.130  -->  00:00:10.850
We need to check it out on the home page and see if we get any arrows.

3

00:00:10.860  -->  00:00:12.680
Let's just click here.

4

00:00:12.810  -->  00:00:15.270
Enter refresh whatever you want to do.

5

00:00:15.750  -->  00:00:20.860
And yes we do have some undefined arrays there.

6

00:00:20.900  -->  00:00:22.970
And if I end it that's a that's what I mean.

7

00:00:22.970  -->  00:00:33.330
So our polls is undefined for because it's all right curly brackets and curly brackets make sure you

8

00:00:33.330  -->  00:00:39.890
close it because this if statement if it doesn't work is going to be assigned is.

9

00:00:39.990  -->  00:00:44.700
And right now we don't have any data coming in from anywhere on this.

10

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:46.650
And that's why we need to check it first.

11

00:00:46.650  -->  00:00:46.890
Right.

12

00:00:46.890  -->  00:00:49.370
If it's set then you can pull the data.

13

00:00:49.380  -->  00:00:52.170
If it's not said Don't even try it.

14

00:00:52.170  -->  00:00:52.720
All right.

15

00:00:52.890  -->  00:00:54.320
So we got that this make sure.

16

00:00:54.320  -->  00:00:58.940
Anything else this is good this is good.

17

00:00:59.140  -->  00:01:00.350
This is good.

18

00:01:00.360  -->  00:01:05.320
Insert into common pulls Id make sure we have all the coal mines.

19

00:01:05.750  -->  00:01:11.260
Right come in day it was good to me.

20

00:01:11.520  -->  00:01:12.300
All right.

21

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:19.710
Coming out are the common content on improve now function and oh.

22

00:01:19.920  -->  00:01:20.640
All right.

23

00:01:20.640  -->  00:01:22.560
We are missing this one here.

24

00:01:22.800  -->  00:01:24.890
So make sure you put the parentheses there.

25

00:01:25.050  -->  00:01:27.150
And let's go ahead and try to send these data.

26

00:01:27.150  -->  00:01:31.520
Let's first check our page first to see if the arrows are gone.

27

00:01:31.860  -->  00:01:33.850
And yes they are perfect.

28

00:01:33.870  -->  00:01:35.380
We are awesome right.

29

00:01:35.760  -->  00:01:37.280
We are doing great.

30

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:49.700
And let's actually create a query right now so let's say create comment Querrey and send it in.

31

00:01:50.190  -->  00:01:50.750
Whoops.

32

00:01:50.760  -->  00:01:55.150
Come on my ask you.

33

00:01:56.010  -->  00:01:58.240
Kohary dot com.

34

00:01:58.260  -->  00:01:59.700
No I'm joking.

35

00:02:00.240  -->  00:02:08.530
And we're going to send it in what the connection and what else we send in the query.

36

00:02:08.760  -->  00:02:11.530
That's right as I'm saying.

37

00:02:11.700  -->  00:02:12.540
What next.

38

00:02:12.540  -->  00:02:14.460
And I really mean what.

39

00:02:14.460  -->  00:02:15.810
Because I forget.

40

00:02:15.940  -->  00:02:20.530
So I don't think it's because I wanted you to know is unties I really actually.

41

00:02:20.580  -->  00:02:21.910
I'm asking you.

42

00:02:22.770  -->  00:02:23.520
I'm just joking.

43

00:02:23.520  -->  00:02:26.700
I know it all the time.

44

00:02:26.760  -->  00:02:27.000
All right.

45

00:02:27.000  -->  00:02:35.160
So let's do a test for this here and let's say if it's not Querrey rived this doesn't work just if it's

46

00:02:35.160  -->  00:02:35.730
not.

47

00:02:36.020  -->  00:02:36.580
Yes.

48

00:02:36.690  -->  00:02:40.470
Just give me a narrower sentence so that I know what fits.

49

00:02:40.470  -->  00:02:47.220
We love arrows right because it makes things interesting where we failed.

50

00:02:47.220  -->  00:02:49.000
I don't know who likes everything perfect.

51

00:02:49.020  -->  00:02:50.870
I don't I don't like everything.

52

00:02:50.880  -->  00:02:51.530
Perfect.

53

00:02:51.530  -->  00:02:53.580
It would be too boring.

54

00:02:53.730  -->  00:03:00.860
My ask you like Error imagine if life was just perfect that would just make it really really boring

55

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:02.600
everything would be the same right.

56

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:04.720
Everything is predictable.

57

00:03:04.740  -->  00:03:06.310
That's why life is so fun.

58

00:03:06.330  -->  00:03:07.970
Things are unpredictable.

59

00:03:08.310  -->  00:03:09.180
Well that's my opinion.

60

00:03:09.180  -->  00:03:14.630
You can make a discussion about it if you want to talk or debate about it but that's my opinion.

61

00:03:15.060  -->  00:03:15.360
All right.

62

00:03:15.360  -->  00:03:16.680
So I think we're good here.

63

00:03:16.710  -->  00:03:18.200
Let's check it out.

64

00:03:19.050  -->  00:03:19.920
All right perfect.

65

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:21.090
Let's make this a little smarter.

66

00:03:21.090  -->  00:03:22.810
I'm sorry about that.

67

00:03:22.910  -->  00:03:30.210
Sometimes I change resolution on my monitor and because I have a huge monitor in front of me for my

68

00:03:30.210  -->  00:03:31.190
main monitor.

69

00:03:31.320  -->  00:03:33.270
Things get complicated.

70

00:03:33.360  -->  00:03:36.150
Enter And we don't have any errors.

71

00:03:36.150  -->  00:03:37.760
Great.

72

00:03:38.040  -->  00:03:44.030
Let's call this guy where we want to call this guy this.

73

00:03:44.070  -->  00:03:47.070
Why does he have to be a guy let's just name it girl's name.

74

00:03:47.070  -->  00:03:48.720
This name is Cindy.

75

00:03:49.230  -->  00:03:52.680
This name her Cindy Cindy.

76

00:03:53.070  -->  00:03:57.390

78

00:04:00.420  -->  00:04:01.170
Wow.

79

00:04:01.500  -->  00:04:07.290
Let's make sure we spell it right though and then just spending spending Cindy like this there all of

80

00:04:07.290  -->  00:04:13.740
the ways of spelling it and say hey Edwin you rock

81

00:04:17.520  -->  00:04:20.760

82

00:04:20.850  -->  00:04:21.860
Come on Cindy.

83

00:04:21.900  -->  00:04:23.280
Don't ask me that.

84

00:04:23.280  -->  00:04:24.500
So admit it.

85

00:04:24.840  -->  00:04:26.250
And we have no arrows here.

86

00:04:26.250  -->  00:04:27.060
Perfect.

87

00:04:27.060  -->  00:04:29.760
Let's go back and let's refresh.

88

00:04:30.270  -->  00:04:31.080
Yes.

89

00:04:31.090  -->  00:04:33.080
He came in and came in with the polls.

90

00:04:33.110  -->  00:04:39.230
I the meaning that the polls say is wrong.

91

00:04:40.440  -->  00:04:43.200
We're going to go back and fix this.

92

00:04:43.350  -->  00:04:46.820
It came in with Ron Paul's I.D..

93

00:04:47.250  -->  00:04:52.250
Actually no no no no he came in with the right idea I'm looking at the wrong call and yes says we're

94

00:04:52.260  -->  00:04:53.340

00:04:53.700  -->  00:04:54.360
All right.

96

00:04:54.360  -->  00:04:55.610
We came he came in.

97

00:04:55.710  -->  00:04:57.990
This is actually a common ID.

98

00:04:57.990  -->  00:04:59.860
And then the post ID 34.

99

00:04:59.880  -->  00:05:00.910
Yes.

100

00:05:01.120  -->  00:05:07.230

101

00:05:07.240  -->  00:05:07.580
Yeah.

102

00:05:07.590  -->  00:05:10.280
Congratulate yourself if you drink wine.

103

00:05:10.290  -->  00:05:12.840
Drink a little while we drink beer or beer.

104

00:05:13.410  -->  00:05:15.510
And I'm going to celebrate too.

105

00:05:15.690  -->  00:05:17.700
As a matter of fact my coffee's gone right now.

106

00:05:17.700  -->  00:05:22.850
So anyway so we're going to cut this off right here because we made success.

107

00:05:22.860  -->  00:05:30.900
And on the next one there I think let's go back here to admin and let's check chicken comments Ooh beautiful

108

00:05:30.900  -->  00:05:33.900
right we got the comments showing right here.

109

00:05:34.210  -->  00:05:35.150
Right.

110

00:05:35.220  -->  00:05:38.430
E-mail an improved some title here we need to start.

111

00:05:38.430  -->  00:05:41.120
We need to get rid of this on the next one there.

112

00:05:41.400  -->  00:05:43.760
Let's make sure we get rid of this OK.

113

00:05:43.770  -->  00:05:51.760
And we bring this dynamically with a title from the post and then we start taking care of this.

114

00:05:51.760  -->  00:05:52.440
All right.

115

00:05:52.440  -->  00:05:53.430
So take care.

116

00:05:53.430  -->  00:05:54.430
Good job.

117

00:05:54.430  -->  00:05:56.110
See you in the next lesson.
