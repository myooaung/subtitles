00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,810
Welcome back my student in this lecture here we are going to be adding a registration page and I want

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,280
you to download something to your right.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,400
You're going to find a filed called registration.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,880
Let me see if I can find it right here on my desktop right here.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,700
So go to that to the side of your screen if you're in a desktop and download this file right here.

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,810
It's going be called the registration that BHB that zipped right.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,890
Unzip it and you're going to have this restriction that BHB there right.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,920
So what I want you to do I want you to go to your CMS folder.

9
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,930
Mine is right here and I want you to drop it in there and we're going to be dropping it right here in

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,770
the root directory like this done right.

11
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,560
So now when we go to our specific site localhost see a.

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:06,670
And then if we type in the page name restriction up we we don't get anything in there.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,640
That's because I misspelled it.

14
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,510
There we go.

15
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,340
And now you get it you have something like this right.

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,200
This is I mean all this mark up here for you.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,740
And we're going to be building the functionalities.

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:30,380
All right so if we go back to our open brackets ok and go inside brackets go to your CIMS directory.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,650
And here's some where you can find your registration right here.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,770
And we just double click it so I can have it up here in my working files.

21
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,210
And this is the page right here.

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,410
All right.

23
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,450
As you can see the images make these sort of smaller looks better when you have it in the high resolution

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,080
right.

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,390
So this is all the markup that I made here for you.

26
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,670
And that way you wouldn't have to spend 20 minutes doing this and then on the next video we're going

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,750
to start building the functionality of this page.

28
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:10,370
I want to also encrypt whatever information we want to clean information we might as well escape string.

29
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:10,950
Right.

30
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,820
With my Eskew ally real scale string.

31
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,430
So we wanted to clean the information before going to the database.

32
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,990
The second thing we want to do is encrypt the password that is going inside the database.

33
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,380
That way you can make this hacker proof.

34
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:26,960
All right.

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,790
So all of this information will be going to the database and then it's going to go to the our administration

36
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:40,410
area where we can allow this user insight or not allow them in psi where we can register them as a regular

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,720
user or maybe as an admin user we can do whatever we want as long as we have that information.

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,460
So the next lectures are going to be pretty awesome.

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,110
Is going to this is something very useful just in case you have a live web site on that on the on line

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,110
and you want to allow users to read you serve for your web site.

41
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,740
All right.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,170
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture and I see it.

43
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,590
And that's one
