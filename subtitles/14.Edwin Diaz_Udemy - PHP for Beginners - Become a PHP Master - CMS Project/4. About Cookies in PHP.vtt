Hi welcome back and this video we are going to be learning about cookies and you might be asking yourself

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.490
why in the world are cookies.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.340
Well you probably heard the term before you delete your cookies.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.720
Isn't that on the Web site right now.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.950
Let me show you what happens in Chrome when we visit our website.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.850
For example I type in cars I search on Chrome and I go to that website.

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.570
This is how cookies work.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.010
Now visit this Web site now automatically you know what his Web site might be doing right now and I'm

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.150
pretty sure they are.

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.600
They are setting a cookie in my browser if I have my browser if my browser is accepting cookies.

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.990
This web site was able to go into my browser and it was able to send a request to set a cookie into

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.460
my browser.

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.800
All right.

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.530
And we're going to find out how well they did it right.

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.030
Right now this browser I know for sure that is accepting cookies.

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.640
You can turn it off in your browser depending on what browser you are using on google chrome.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.050
If you go to the settings here you can erase history on Google Chrome but that's not going to erase

18
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.850
the cookies.

19
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.490
There is the information that was said by other Web sites in your browser that you don't even know about.

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.350
Right so I'm going to show you right now in Google Chrome how you get how you see this information.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.940
Let's go to settings.

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.930
Let's go to a show event settings.

23
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.590
Let's go to Canton settings.

24
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.230
Let's go to our cookies in site data.

25
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.080
These are all the site all the sites that I have visited or for some reason was redirected there and

26
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.250
all the sites that it stored cookie in my browser.

27
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.870
Right.

28
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.820
This guy I don't know what say that this is but this Web site said three cookies in my browser.

29
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.790
I click on it and I can see that they said this on this one in this one.

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.790
I click on this one.

31
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.270
This one right.

32
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.470
This could be references to sessions in the server but actually references actually get a lot longer

33
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.830
than that.

34
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.170
They're not references right for you if I click on it you can see all that information.

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.980
They said they said the name of the cookie right there that's the name our TB data zero and the content.

36
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.370
This is all the information they are saving in my browser.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.400
The path any kind of connection.

38
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.650
Accessible yes created that date and the day expires at Spierer.

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.130
So this cookie expires on February 8 and 17.

40
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.130
All right so basically this is going to stay alive in my browser for two years because we are in 2015

41
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.550
of course.

42
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.330
But two years in my browser.

43
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.530
Isn't that crazy right.

44
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.870
That's a lot.

45
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.080
So it was created here.

46
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.610
Any was they going to expire.

47
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.080
It's going to be my brows if i don't they need it for two years remove I don't know who that is.

48
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.590
I'm going to delete it.

49
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.250
Right.

50
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.860
But anyways this is how cookies work.

51
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.960
You visit a Web site and all of a sudden they are allowed to set cookies in your browser.

52
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.080
So next time you visit our Web site they know who you are.

53
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.910
Right and they can greet you by your name or they can tell you listen especially this website here.

54
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.690
Let's go to the cars that come.

55
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.050
So next summer come visit here.

56
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.870
They might say you know what.

57
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.940
This guy was actually searching on these sedans for 30 minutes.

58
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:37.980
Let's go ahead and show him another type of sedan that we have for sale this week so they can personalize

59
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.050
your visit the next time you visit.

60
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.510
Now they got this cookie set up in your browser.

61
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.840
And when you come back you actually send back that data to their server and they process that data and

62
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.090
they send back some information from their server to your browser to give you some personalize visit

63
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.110
to their website application.

64
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.160
This is how cookies work.

65
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.150
All right so you don't set a date.

66
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.940
The application sets it for you in your browser and then when you visit our website and you send it

67
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.310
back to them in the header.

68
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.930
All right.

69
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.660
So anyways I just wanted you to kind of actually I want you to know the information because we're going

70
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.340
to be talking about how to set cookies how and how we can read information in the next lecture.

71
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.690
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.

72
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.370
Take your
