00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.440
All right so now that we have created a class and we found out that it is there it's already defined.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.630
We need to start adding some functionality to it.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.450
All right.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.830
So let's go ahead Oprah co-editor.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.400
So first thing that we got to do and we got to do a save on that blank that beach actually not.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.950
No no no.

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.680
Hola.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.100
Not blank that BHP.

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.790
Let's do a save as on let's continue from where we were.

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.830
Class car.

11
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.560
Class on this corner car.

12
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.050
Let's do a Save As and call it class car to right because we want to build on this.

13
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.150
I want to keep using this class to show you the woods ampoules just right there.

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.310
Or put it in a browser because we're going to get the same thing we got last time about the class.

15
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.690
We enjoyed this.

16
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.790
So we're going to come in that out.

17
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.840
And then we're going to we're going to create a method right here the way we create methods the same

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.160
way we create function as a matter of fact they are functions we're just calling methods when they are

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.080
inside the class when they are outside the class we call them functions but we create in the same way

20
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.170
so function.

21
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:11.370
Let's create a mentor called greeting and if I trip in and call it function please don't take don't

22
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.780
don't worry about it right.

23
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.670
They are functions.

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.900
We're just getting referred to them differently so I'm going to try to refer to them as methods or that

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.180
way.

26
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.550
All right.

27
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.250
So anyways so.

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.830
All right.

29
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.810
As a matter of fact it's called something else let's call this move wheels.

30
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.010
Let's just make believe that we are creating a game and we have this car here right that we are creating

31
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.120
this cartoon car and we want the wheels to make way to move.

32
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.970
So let's make believe that I'm actually setting some properties for the big circle to move around or

33
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.870
something like that.

34
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:59.320
And I'm going to say like wheel wheels more in reality you say on delay you need to give specifics and

35
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.620
numbers and calculations on how the wheel can go around.

36
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.200
How many times is going to go around if it's going to stop in many different things.

37
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.220
But before you do that you will always have to set the properties so that we are right.

38
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.490
You have to said how big the wheel is if he's black if he's white.

39
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.660
This is how you create things.

40
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.420
Things are not as easy as people think.

41
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.860
You have to create for properties right.

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.730
Like we talked about that example we can create a steering wheel or create the hood engine all that

43
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.920
great stuff about our car right.

44
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.140
Visually that people see.

45
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.140
And then we create the functions that will make that happen.

46
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.970
Right that would make that move.

47
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.710
So in this example this is going to be a rough example I'm just saying wheels more faurÃ© and just make

48
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.230
believe that we have a whole bunch of functions here that are going to make this more.

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.650
And you see I call the functions who are supposed to call the method.

50
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.320
But anyway Matt That's right.

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.780
So anyways.

52
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.170
All right so we have this method created here.

53
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.200
Now we need to find out how.

54
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.950
If it does if it is here if it's already defined if it's working right right.

55
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.810
Well we have this thing here coming up because we are checking for class.

56
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.660
We already know that our class is working just fine that it does exist.

57
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.400
Let's see if the method there is it's ok meant.

58
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.300
If it does exist let's pass in and class which is a car and we need to pass it another parameter which

59
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.120
is a method.

60
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.090
So inside this this works like an array basically we're trying to find out if car is inside the car

61
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.140
ops class.

62
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.770
If this method exits are we going to grab the name of that.

63
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.820
We're going to put it right here and we're going to say that method the method

64
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.590
exists.

65
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.680
No it does not.

66
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.710
All right.

67
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.830
I think that's OK.

68
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.970
There we go.

69
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.180
So you can see here a change.

70
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.580
So we found out that the method doesn't exist.

71
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.160
And and then we can keep going we are now.

72
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.180
You will do this when you have a whole bunch of different methods in the class and you just want it

73
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.560
sure you want to make sure you have thousands of lines and you want to come here.

74
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.500
Said Did I make this method did it.

75
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.580
Let me just look for it and you would do something like that.

76
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.180
All right.

77
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.540
And when you have many different classes you can also do the class exists function there to find that

78
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.750
out.

79
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.130
Those are building functions that we use from that BHB the creator of FEMA for us so we can use them.

80
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.740
Imagine making this your own you have to go there and make a whole bunch of lines of code trying to

81
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:51.090
find it to say to scan all the folders or the older office functions to find if this method exists.

82
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.550
I mean you have to scan a whole bunch of different things and that's why this method on the squid's

83
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.450
is function is doing scanning a bunch of code trying to find out if this is this first is probably checking

84
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.080
on this directory here and this file right here.

85
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.620
And then if he doesn't find it here we'll move on to other.

86
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.920
But well this will work right here because this is where we are defining it right this is where we are

87
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.380
using it.

88
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.600
So we are looking for it looking for it right here on this file.

89
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.500
But anyway I don't want to confuse you I think.

90
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.500
I think we went out of time we were out of time on this one on the law.

91
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.300
The next one we are going to be learning how to start using this functionality how to instantiate the

92
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.590
class.

93
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.370
Right.

94
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.320
And I will be speaking about that in the next video.

95
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.650
Right.

96
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.710
But anyway thank you so much for listening and learning and I'll see you in the next lecture.

97
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.130
Take your
