1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,710
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,610
My amazing students.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,480
So on this section here I want to show you some really cool stuff with BHP.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,970
Some of the things that you can do.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:16,350
So I found this package a couple years ago called pusher pusher we allow us to send real notifications

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,700
I real time notifications in our app to users.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,880
Now I want to show you how to use it.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,930
They got a way to get a free account so you can use a play around with it.

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,170
OK.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,060
That's exactly what we're doing.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,030
So if you go to push it out come.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:30,960
OK.

13
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,870
This is their website here.

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,340
And you can read more about it.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,200
OK.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,580
But what I want you to do is sign up get a free account and then when you sign up.

17
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,330
OK.

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,410
Plus this video now OK.

19
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,620
And then we'll be back.

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,040
When you get this stuff setup.

21
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,450
All right.

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,890
So hopefully you finish that and you are set up with pusher you got your free account.

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,290
I must show you the dashboard.

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,790
This is the dashboard right here.

25
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,710
So the first thing that you need to do is create an app.

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,720
Simple as that.

27
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,270
So we're gonna say the new see a mess and I'm just gonna put the Newseum as you can see a mess if you

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,560
don't have any apps of course.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,250
And just gonna put any cluster here it's like a server if you put your mouse over it would tell you

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,620
what is the physical location of the server that can handle the request from your channel's app.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,830
So you want to put something close to your area.

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,190
OK.

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,870
And front end is going to be vanilla javascript and we're gonna use BHP of course create my app.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,810
Now here are the credentials for your apps the things that you have to go through that you have to be

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,580
aware of is your app keys.

36
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,550
OK well let me show you how to use a real quick.

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,540
I'm going to copy this.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,570
This is the javascript OK so here's how it works.

39
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:57,590
We download a package for BHP as deep as the gate package a software development kit.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,540
We write some code OK.

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,430
We trigger some type of event.

42
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,330
And on the other side we the email or whatever you're using or BHP but usually javascript.

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,120
OK on the client side we catch it with JavaScript and display some type of message coming from the server.

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:27,270
So they go to this page here and BHP and on the other side we can catch that event anywhere we want

45
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,420
in our application.

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:28,970
OK.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,530
Let me show you how to use it real quick.

48
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:37,040
So I copy these javascript code right here and as a matter of fact let's copy let's do the BHP first

49
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,980
so let's download this package first.

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,170
So I got an empty project right here you can add it so you'll see a mess probably if you like but I

51
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,810
have a completely empty problem all I have is a directory I've got a star composer and then initialize

52
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,010
it because that's what we're going to need in order for us to do this.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:02,690
So I'm gonna press Enter Enter Enter enter into I see these red lines asking me for a name OK.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:11,860
And then I'm going to put my email for my in this way with my name OK and then enter and enter into

55
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,740
enter enter and to enter it.

56
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,630
There we go.

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,670
Clear.

58
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,240
OK.

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:23,140
Now if you have a terminal I'm guessing you're using gay bash or maybe a trial BHP storm whatever other

60
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,720
idea.

61
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,190
Just keep in mind that what you need to do is use your terminal.

62
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,510
Right.

63
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,510
Of course we create a section about this before and I tell you to download get bash.

64
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,910
OK.

65
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,240
So make sure you have some type of terminal you can use.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,050
So we're gonna to download the package.

67
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,610
It's called composer.

68
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,780
Well this is the name pusher pusher.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,510
That's BHP server for those of you that are a little lost.

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,530
We already went through using composer.

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
OK in the course.

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,270
So this shouldn't be something new for you.

73
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:05,680
It if it is you need to go back and look for some type of BHP mailer or composer or some type of section

74
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,600
that says that in the course you can use if you don't know what I'm saying.

75
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:22,000
You can use get here download get this here and download this and use the bash shell from that is very

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,120
similar to what we are using anyway.

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:34,380
So once I have this let's download it real quick.

78
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,710
All right we have it.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,890
Now I'm going to create a page here to to trigger this event.

80
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm going to make sure it is an index page or it doesn't really matter what page it is.

81
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:53,150
This is the page where we are going to be triggering the event triggering the dysfunctionality so when

82
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,820
they visit then that's the functionality is going to be triggered.

83
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,390
OK.

84
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,760
So I got a copy my PSP and then I'm pasting here.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,780
Let me explain it to you a little bit so that way you guys are we are on the same track.

86
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,560
This is requiring auto load of course the packet that was just that package that we downloaded is right

87
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,060
here.

88
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
We are requiring it.

89
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:16,220
OK.

90
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,360
We are creating some variables that this information is coming from the push of documentation.

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,600
We instantiating pusher instance we are passing in the first parameter these the Odki.

92
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,600
The second parameter is the secret.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,540
And the third parameter is the AB I.D..

94
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,670
This here this information that you're seeing right here is my own information pusher is populating

95
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:44,830
this information from my app keys area here so these are my real credentials.

96
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,470
OK.

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,470
That's why he's going to work.

98
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,980
So we instantiating our object with all this and we passing in these options.

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,210
Ray right here with the cluster and some other functionality right there.

100
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:04,980
Now we are creating some data whatever data that is if use maybe it's something coming from the database

101
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,350
or whatever that data it's right here with passing in that data OK.

102
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,060
Right here I set our parameters.

103
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,270
So the first with the method trigger is the channel.

104
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,940
The second is event and you can name this whatever you want doesn't have to be these and you pass the

105
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,570
data you want.

106
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,190
OK.

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,350
So we are set up with that let's create the next page.

108
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,850
I'm going to call this next page.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,870
I don't know.

110
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:45,360
Students Students that BHP or student OK let's go back here and let's copy the JavaScript So let's just

111
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,740
paste that in there.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,580
And as you can see what we're doing up here is using a C the N or something from push that come.

113
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,060
That's the library.

114
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,280
The javascript site and this is just for development.

115
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,780
OK.

116
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,210
So we instantiating pusher again.

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:09,660
But on the javascript side with the I think this is the secret of the app by the OK.

118
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,270
Let me see what that is.

119
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,610
I haven't even looked yet.

120
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,730
This is 7 c this is the key.

121
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,470
OK so instantiating push it with the key.

122
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,060
The cluster.

123
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,180
OK.

124
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,190
That is our push for instance right here.

125
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:32,430
Then with that instance we can subscribe to our channel we have to be the same name channel that we

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,170
got here.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,410
OK.

128
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,600
And then we have binding that channel to that event.

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,650
That's right here and of course we're passing that data that date is coming back with this function

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,130
right here.

131
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,640
Data is coming back and we just displaying some type of alert industry.

132
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,220
OK.

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,560
So that's there.

134
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,950
That should work on your pricing now.

135
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,300
Let's see right.

136
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,550
Let's go to my where I have this project push it right here.

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,510
OK now I'm going to go to the about page and let's see if we get something let's cross our fingers and

138
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,710
make sure that this works right.

139
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,570
Well hopeful hope

140
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,290
ok it doesn't work.

141
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,380
Let's refresh here.

142
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,300
Come back here.

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,260
Let's go it up.

144
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,040
All right all right.

145
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,020
We got to check it out.

146
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,670
Let's see what's going on here.

147
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,910
I'm gonna inspect source what not source might be in the wrong page.

148
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,700
Who knows sometimes that happens he says.

149
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,620
Request now found on this server.

150
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,330
So these are about that BHP is now being found or was we didn't call it about the I know it was something

151
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,670
going on with me.

152
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,430
It's student OK.

153
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,350
That's not even found either.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,570
OK.

155
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,340
Try publishing an event to channel let me see.

156
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,090
OK let's refresh and I.

157
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,520
OK.

158
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:58,820
All right.

159
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,830
Now he works a gay I'm sorry about that.

160
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,870
I thought we wrote about beach.

161
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,040
But you see what I'm saying.

162
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
You look at the data right here.

163
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,530
Okay so that's cool.

164
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,790
Right now you're not going to get any more notifications because it's not continuously right.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,530
You have to first trigger here but watch what happens here in the browser tab when I do this.

166
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,840
Trigger it and you see the little dot right here.

167
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,840
That means there is something waiting for us there.

168
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,970
And of course you can change this.

169
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:35,660
You can go back to your index here and you can say look I'm just gonna name this channel one for example

170
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:44,610
event one and I change this to student's

171
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,850
we go.

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,800
OK.

173
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:59,500
Now of course if I go to that page and I trigger it right here yeah and then I go back to the student.

174
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,410
There is nothing going on here because we have to bind to that.

175
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:03,930
Right.

176
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,210
So we have to get that to work.

177
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:16,690
So we have to grit this into our channel 1 might bind to our event one.

178
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,650
OK.

179
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,350
I saw that.

180
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,720
And now if I go here and trigger it let's see what all the

181
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,990
went to fast channel one event one.

182
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,290
OK.

183
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Make sure that you read the right thing.

184
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,580
Sometimes when I'm going so fast I can't see it.

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,430
OK.

186
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,220
There we go.

187
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,510
It works OK.

188
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,070
So sometimes you have to come here and refresh it and then you have to go back and refresh or a couple

189
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,560
of times just in case.

190
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,980
OK.

191
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,610
There you go.

192
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,920
Say

193
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
that's pretty cool

194
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,480
and we know all right.

195
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,130
So I guess we're done with this.

196
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,080
Maybe I'll make another lecture just to show you how to implement this in see a mass and maybe show

197
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,480
you how to implement it in a cool way in a nicer way.

198
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,710
But if I don't make it don't be mad OK.

199
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,330
I'm just trying to show you some cool things here.

200
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,880
OK.

201
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,750
This extra lecture stuff.

202
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,520
Thank you so much.

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,750
And I'll see you on the next one.

204
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,350
Don't forget to rate my cause guys.

205
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,220
OK.

206
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,740
Make sure you give me those ratings because I really get motivated when I see those ratings out there.

207
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,360
So remember.

208
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,050
Thank you so much I'll see you in the next one.
