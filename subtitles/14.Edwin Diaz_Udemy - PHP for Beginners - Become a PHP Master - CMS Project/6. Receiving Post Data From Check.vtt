00:00:00.870  -->  00:00:01.620
All right perfect.

2

00:00:01.650  -->  00:00:11.940
So now that we have the mark right here all right we formed or done or log in page let's go and create

3

00:00:11.940  -->  00:00:16.890
some of the functionality that is going to receive that data would oppose super global.

4

00:00:16.890  -->  00:00:17.590
All right.

5

00:00:17.590  -->  00:00:24.030
So first of all let me just change this class here real quick call this as am I right.

6

00:00:24.030  -->  00:00:25.380
Perfect.

7

00:00:25.530  -->  00:00:28.390
That's just going to make is bigger here.

8

00:00:28.440  -->  00:00:32.020
That way we can concentrate on that right.

9

00:00:32.070  -->  00:00:35.500
So you know these are just Cenci class and it just makes it bigger.

10

00:00:35.730  -->  00:00:39.180
If you wanted you can just leave the s s which means extra small.

11

00:00:39.180  -->  00:00:42.710
This is small and we can do medium too.

12

00:00:42.720  -->  00:00:43.020
All right.

13

00:00:43.030  -->  00:00:47.540
But I just went like this the way I can write whatever I want there.

14

00:00:47.640  -->  00:00:49.090
So it spans the whole window.

15

00:00:49.170  -->  00:00:49.670
But anyway.

16

00:00:49.680  -->  00:00:57.660
So let's go on top of this page where we are going to be doing is receiving the information right here

17

00:00:57.660  -->  00:00:58.280
on top.

18

00:00:58.320  -->  00:01:00.700
I'm just going to do everything in one page.

19

00:01:00.700  -->  00:01:01.260
All right.

20

00:01:01.470  -->  00:01:06.680
So what are we going to do here.

21

00:01:06.780  -->  00:01:11.970
We are going to be receiving some of this information and we already did some of this before when we

22

00:01:11.970  -->  00:01:15.890
created the form we're talking about the post-Super global.

23

00:01:15.900  -->  00:01:24.210
So for this we need to receive that data from the form and we're going to use the Eset function.

24

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:32.740
And we are going to be checking for posts pro-global and with a value of submit.

25

00:01:32.910  -->  00:01:40.760
They were sent in from the submit button and we are going to do something when we see it.

26

00:01:40.800  -->  00:01:45.560
So let's just try to see if we get the information first right.

27

00:01:45.570  -->  00:01:48.170
Yes we got the information we got it.

28

00:01:48.780  -->  00:01:55.320
That would be this list was submitted and we are not getting it.

29

00:01:55.330  -->  00:01:55.780
All right.

30

00:01:55.830  -->  00:01:57.770
That's why it was always good to check it.

31

00:01:58.170  -->  00:02:02.410
So I made a mistake here somewhere and we need to find out where it is.

32

00:02:02.430  -->  00:02:03.520
So let's go here.

33

00:02:03.540  -->  00:02:08.880
As a matter of fact I think I know where it is but let's just double check it here and see what's going

34

00:02:08.880  -->  00:02:09.330
on.

35

00:02:09.330  -->  00:02:09.910
All right.

36

00:02:10.230  -->  00:02:10.590
So

37

00:02:14.940  -->  00:02:20.430
we have here types may we have even the name for the input that we had the value submit but when we

38

00:02:20.430  -->  00:02:24.220
come here we can't find the information anyway.

39

00:02:24.240  -->  00:02:28.650
It's like the form is not sending it so can you see what's going on.

40

00:02:28.650  -->  00:02:31.250
Can you check that out.

41

00:02:31.260  -->  00:02:35.910
Can you spot the problem.

42

00:02:35.910  -->  00:02:36.310
All right.

43

00:02:36.320  -->  00:02:38.090
Just want to pause a video and check.

44

00:02:38.100  -->  00:02:44.580
You can check it out and you saw the problem Manger's a misspelling of a word anyway is the misspelling

45

00:02:44.580  -->  00:02:45.400
of this word here.

46

00:02:45.420  -->  00:02:50.220
It's called method and you probably already saw that when I was doing it I was kind of rushing through

47

00:02:50.220  -->  00:02:50.620
it.

48

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:58.360
And this is refresh it click submit and now we got the information.

49

00:02:58.430  -->  00:02:59.910
All right.

50

00:02:59.910  -->  00:03:04.430
This happens when you are typing fast and you have it and you have first.

51

00:03:04.430  -->  00:03:04.920
All right.

52

00:03:04.920  -->  00:03:10.270
So now that we know that we are receiving the data well what do we want to do with the data.

53

00:03:10.290  -->  00:03:13.020
Well we know that we are receiving all these data.

54

00:03:13.050  -->  00:03:16.740
We're not just receiving the summit name right here.

55

00:03:16.890  -->  00:03:20.210
We are receiving the password and we are receiving the username.

56

00:03:20.220  -->  00:03:24.720
Let's make this a little bigger again right there.

57

00:03:24.750  -->  00:03:28.380
So let's go ahead and received over here.

58

00:03:28.430  -->  00:03:30.990
So I'm losing my voice again sorry guys.

59

00:03:31.950  -->  00:03:33.870
So we're going to receive that here.

60

00:03:33.870  -->  00:03:35.770
We're going to receive this here.

61

00:03:35.830  -->  00:03:38.180
I want to show you right now where I'm going to do.

62

00:03:39.110  -->  00:03:45.320
We are going to receive the user name in the same way we received submit.

63

00:03:45.470  -->  00:03:49.720
We are going to receive the password.

64

00:03:49.730  -->  00:03:51.490
Right.

65

00:03:53.190  -->  00:03:55.260
And we can assign a variable.

66

00:03:55.260  -->  00:03:58.410
So that's a sign it is a name variable

67

00:04:02.250  -->  00:04:06.480
and right there.

68

00:04:06.480  -->  00:04:07.200
Right.

69

00:04:07.650  -->  00:04:13.610
And let's just echo this thing out to see if that's just echo everything out right there.

70

00:04:14.100  -->  00:04:15.160
Can I go right here.

71

00:04:15.210  -->  00:04:17.680
Find user name.

72

00:04:17.680  -->  00:04:19.630
See those working.

73

00:04:19.710  -->  00:04:22.080
Let's go for a password.

74

00:04:22.410  -->  00:04:25.770
And you should be usually right.

75

00:04:25.800  -->  00:04:26.460
That's correct.

76

00:04:26.580  -->  00:04:33.300
Where you should be doing is copying and pasting it right here so that way you don't make mistakes.

77

00:04:33.300  -->  00:04:33.580
All right.

78

00:04:33.580  -->  00:04:38.990
I just like making mistakes the more mistakes I get I make the better I get.

79

00:04:39.540  -->  00:04:43.760
And just click submit and I made another mistake here somewhere.

80

00:04:43.890  -->  00:04:45.000
Right.

81

00:04:45.060  -->  00:04:47.280
So we just got a check here.

82

00:04:47.280  -->  00:04:48.060
What's going on.

83

00:04:48.060  -->  00:04:48.470
Right.

84

00:04:48.600  -->  00:04:49.630
So we click submit.

85

00:04:49.640  -->  00:04:52.820
We're supposed to be putting all these values here.

86

00:04:52.830  -->  00:04:56.790
All right so we're supposed to be pulling the user name is supposed to be pulling the values out of

87

00:04:56.790  -->  00:04:57.500
here.

88

00:04:57.870  -->  00:05:00.030
So we type here type here.

89

00:05:00.200  -->  00:05:01.040
There we go now.

90

00:05:01.090  -->  00:05:01.580
Right.

91

00:05:01.680  -->  00:05:06.330
Because what it is is that if you don't if you don't put the values you were not going to get it.

92

00:05:06.420  -->  00:05:13.800
Remember that while we are getting here this name here why are we getting it.

93

00:05:13.800  -->  00:05:15.620
This is an import.

94

00:05:15.760  -->  00:05:20.640
This name here means that is the value that you get to typing here.

95

00:05:20.640  -->  00:05:22.260
Not just when you click submit.

96

00:05:22.270  -->  00:05:27.090
We don't we haven't set the value yet so we don't know the value when we types of meds.

97

00:05:27.090  -->  00:05:31.920
For example say Edwyn and Superman is my password.

98

00:05:32.370  -->  00:05:35.950
Click Enter then you get that here.

99

00:05:36.000  -->  00:05:37.830
So this is working.

100

00:05:37.850  -->  00:05:41.290
We are receiving some information from the form.

101

00:05:41.310  -->  00:05:42.070
All right.

102

00:05:42.300  -->  00:05:43.870
And we got it up here.

103

00:05:44.190  -->  00:05:48.420
Next we're going to be doing some connection with the database.

104

00:05:48.420  -->  00:05:50.910
All right so thank you for watching this lecture and I see you and that's one
