00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,710
Welcome back my students I feel a lot better so let's get going.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,380
OK guys if you're tired you're not going to be learning as much.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,930
Make sure you get your at something and drink your energy natural juices of course.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,510
So anyway let's get going here on the forgot page.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,120
We're going to be doing is writing some Ph.D. coding having some really cool fun but we don't want anybody

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,040
to come in here.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,910
So that's why we created this little get requests here coming from the front page because we don't want

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,950
anybody posting anything there right.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,410
So if nobody if the person goes in there it does not.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,150
It's not a request.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,690
OK.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,680
We don't want it there.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,550
So we just a little bit of the security laid on we're going to work more.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,960
But let's just start now here.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,720
Let's create a PH speech X and this race and code.

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,040
Let's use some of our function if

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,150
see if it is method post.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,410
I mean get so if he's not

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,460
OK or

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,080
what we want it to be post and we want it to have some type of value so we can save is not that

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,350
he's not

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,970
you know while we can't use a function twice here

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,760
actually the first one we checking for the Met and this one is just going to check for values so we

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,750
get I don't have a function for that yet.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,170
You can you can create one if you like.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:05,280
So if it's not forgot because that's the key we are getting then we are going to redirect immediately

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,260
and we're going to redirect this person somewhere else maybe to and that's let's check it out to see

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,380
if it works.

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,310
So to take the parameters out

30
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,710
that works.

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,460
See what I'm doing wrong here.

32
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:32,560
If this does not get let's just do this.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,420
If it's not it should work.

34
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,560
Should work if is not good and it's not.

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,380
So you have to be oh you know what

36
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,430
he has to be bouffe.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
So you know what it's just do a or.

38
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,400
Here we go.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,710
One of those we won one of those and here let's just say it right there we go.

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,660
So if he's not I get requests or we don't have a key for a get requests we want the person to be here

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,590
at all if they have one of the one of them they can be here.

42
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,610
OK.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,590
So that's fine.

44
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,640
Next we are going to be using something like that.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,440
But

46
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,530
there will be different.

47
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:35,040
We're going to check for a post requests and

48
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,900
if we get those requests we just got to make sure hopes

49
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,240
that some of the values are set right.

50
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,580
We've got to create a function for that.

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,080
Getting a little tired of writing the essay.

52
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,840
Right.

53
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:06,650
But anyway so let's just create one that checks for the e-mail right.

54
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,860
Because in reality what we want is one to be able to get that e-mail.

55
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,910
OK.

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,530
From this form here because this form is going to have this email input.

57
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:21,320
OK.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:29,000
So if that's said we know that something or someone submitted that form OK.

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,850
So once I set

60
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,520
we're going to get the e-mail and of course that is going to be this year.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,340
And you of course you can trim it you can escape it.

62
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,660
We have functions for that right.

63
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,930
I leave it that way it is.

64
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,470
Because what we're going to be doing is we are going to be using prepared statements.

65
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,050
All right.

66
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,480
To avoid some actual injections and all that stuff.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,340
OK.

68
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,420
So we are also going to be creating a Automattic a talking here because we are going to be putting that

69
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,510
in the database.

70
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,720
So I'm going to be using a function called been to hats and I believe this is available in lower versions

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,700
of BHB.

72
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,890
But I do recommend for for most of you to be OK.

73
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,110
Always keep your ph be upgraded.

74
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:32,800
Now on this cause I'm using the I started with BHB 5.4 I believe from the beginning.

75
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:39,570
But as you can tell it on the lectures we're using BHB 7 is faster he has a couple of more features

76
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,980
that we can use now using some of the PSP 7 features yet just because there are many web sites that

77
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,390
we're only running up BHB 5.

78
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,530
OK.

79
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:58,680
And so that's one of the reasons we're having now using all of it yet but I will use some of it just

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,820
to show you.

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:08,100
So this is going to take let's use this being heads is one function but there is another function I

82
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,620
want to use.

83
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:16,210
Inside here is open hoping to sell something I forgot the random.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,640
There we go Superbikes and let's create a length for talking here because that's going to take a while

85
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,430
and if you want more information of all those functions just go to the web site gives you a lot more

86
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,420
in depth.

87
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,060
We just going to create some random strings here and with some heads values and all that stuff.

88
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,640
OK.

89
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,480
And we go and misspelling that

90
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,080
is G.

91
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:55,110
Th I always confuse a few seem like courses but the lenth thing where the lenth word super confusing

92
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,980
for me.

93
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,300
OK.

94
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,960
Once we have that then we need to start building up a statement.

95
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:02,510
OK.

96
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,390
We need to start connecting to the databasing all that making sure that the email does not exist in

97
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,300
our database.

98
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,110
You know on and on and on I'll show you how to do that in the next lecture.

99
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,980
Thank you so much.
