00:00:00,540  -->  00:00:01,640
All right welcome back.

2

00:00:01,800  -->  00:00:04,570
Student This is Edwin from the future.

3

00:00:04,710  -->  00:00:10,650
So my table here my CIMS would be a lot different than yours because I'm already done with the course

4

00:00:10,860  -->  00:00:15,900
so I don't want you to pay mind to any of this column here that you might not have.

5

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:17,520
Well you might now have some of it.

6

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:18,820
Don't pay mind to it.

7

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:21,930
I'm here to fix something that we created in the last lecture.

8

00:00:21,930  -->  00:00:24,270
All right and we need to fix it before we continue.

9

00:00:24,300  -->  00:00:25,410
So that's why I'm here.

10

00:00:25,540  -->  00:00:25,910
All right.

11

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:29,070
You're going to see a little bit of Edmond from the future in some of these lectures.

12

00:00:29,120  -->  00:00:33,200
Now what we're going to be facing here is post common count.

13

00:00:33,300  -->  00:00:33,880
All right.

14

00:00:33,960  -->  00:00:36,090
I notice that we created this to be of our car.

15

00:00:36,090  -->  00:00:37,530
This is for tÃªtes.

16

00:00:37,530  -->  00:00:40,970
This is going to be a push an incremental value with numbers.

17

00:00:40,970  -->  00:00:47,240
So we need to deal with his selection that type and this click here to change it.

18

00:00:47,250  -->  00:00:49,200
And this is in the post table right.

19

00:00:49,530  -->  00:00:55,000
Let's change it to type integer and save again.

20

00:00:55,110  -->  00:01:04,720
I mean BHB my admin CMOS posts and then on the column pulls on score comment on the score count we click

21

00:01:04,720  -->  00:01:07,670
on change and we change this to an integer type.

22

00:01:07,680  -->  00:01:08,010
All right.

23

00:01:08,010  -->  00:01:11,860
Actually let's go back here and let's change this to 11.

24

00:01:11,880  -->  00:01:16,270
We don't need 255 numbers right.

25

00:01:16,290  -->  00:01:17,540
I think 11 would do fine.

26

00:01:17,550  -->  00:01:20,280
But if you want to go ahead and put a lot more than that.

27

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:21,710
You're welcome to do that.

28

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:26,970
Remember that I'm also I also have because I'm from the future I know we're going to have a new system

29

00:01:27,150  -->  00:01:33,780
on creating pools comment counts later on but just keep following the course keep doing what you're

30

00:01:33,780  -->  00:01:34,850
doing you're doing good.

31

00:01:34,990  -->  00:01:36,540
And I'll see you in some other lectures.

32

00:01:36,540  -->  00:01:36,910
Take care
