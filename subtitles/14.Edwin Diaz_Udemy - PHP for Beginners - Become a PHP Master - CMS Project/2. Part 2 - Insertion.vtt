00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.940
All right welcome back my students in this lecture here we're going to start working on The View pool

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.520
speech.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.880
Right.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.470
So let's go ahead and do that.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.660
Let's come back here.

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.010
Let's go to View.

7
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.430
Speech.

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.260
All right.

9
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.380
So let's see the field the feel that we are going to be working on is this other feel right here.

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.050
All right.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.080
So let's find out right here somewhere.

12
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.370
All right we are echoing out the author right here.

13
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040
All right.

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.780
So that is the TV there.

15
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.460
All right.

16
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.600
Beautiful.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.960
All right.

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.740
So what we want to do is create some type of condition here.

19
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.600
They would detect if there is something here and if there is something then if for example an altar

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.200
from the common sexually would display it.

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.130
But if he's a user he will display the user.

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.930
All right.

23
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.630
So how do we do this.

24
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.750
First let's check here.

25
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950
We're going to create a column later on this going to cold.

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.310
This is going to be called the pulse user.

27
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.910
All right.

28
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:36.040
So but a while now let's create a condition so if this set right post altar then we display the puzzle

29
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.260
to my

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.250
else and we need to make a condition here where the facts.

31
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.710
Because if I say else and the author is empty or something like that then we will probably get a a you

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.340
know the next condition over.

33
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.990
So if the said is if this is a set I mean if the PLOS author is set.

34
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.510
We'll play that puzzle right

35
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.710
and we can say if it's not empty.

36
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.180
So let's let's put another condition here or if it's not empty.

37
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.430
Right.

38
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.070
With this play.

39
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.520
Right.

40
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.980
So the next one would be probably else

41
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.500
and we'll need to play around with this condition a little bit but that's OK.

42
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.820
So we can say else if Actually

43
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
let's keep this whole thing right here.

44
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.300
Put it right here we go and we'll create another very well that would be the force user is there for

45
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.480
the user.

46
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.760
And then we'll just add it all right here.

47
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.820
Now how do we get.

48
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.160
How are we going to fool all these polls.

49
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.120
User Well we need to insert it right

50
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.950
was alter and this would be post user right here

51
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.170
safe.

52
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.750
Now let's go to your local admin right.

53
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.080
And let's go here and let's insert a pulse user.

54
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.510
Let's create a database for Ray.

55
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.310
And really this is my database for this project.

56
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.310
Let me double check on that real quick because I have so many projects that I lose control I may lose

57
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.020
control but lose track.

58
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.740
So you see a miss that's my database.

59
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.310
All right let's go to the polls section.

60
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.560
Let's insert a new rolling structure.

61
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.370
And right after post alter There we go.

62
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:23.440
He says after I here go this is going to be called polls underscore user is going to be a car of 255

63
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.060
at least and then safe.

64
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.180
All right so now we're done with that.

65
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.020
Let's take a call here make sure that you save everything.

66
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.790
Unless you see enter.

67
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.240
Let's just go ahead and log in I guess

68
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.180
pupils.

69
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.290
All right looks like he's working.

70
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.430
All right.

71
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.960
Now let's go ahead and insert a user.

72
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.380
All right.

73
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.940
End it all by the way let's check to see if that column of users is.

74
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.970
Yeah.

75
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.620
User ID remember I told you that we need to make sure that we have the correct columns.

76
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.560
Well I do.

77
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.050
User ID is user on the square ID and user name is username.

78
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.820
All right.

79
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.700
So making sure that we have the right information there because this we are using that right here on

80
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.720
that polls.

81
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.010
Right.

82
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.100
All right let's bring down this guy right here.

83
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.100
And let's check him out.

84
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.370
Let's add a polls and we need to do this with Ed at page 2.

85
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.170
Guys we need to do something else to that page.

86
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.920
Let's test user one and I'm going to sign it to Rico.

87
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:47.610
Pollstar is going to be publish some images and some jibberish tags and polish.

88
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.150
On the fine altar.

89
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.520
That's one line eight.

90
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.870
Let's check it out.

91
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.830
Did it look like an 8.

92
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.120
That's right.

93
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.480
Because this is her.

94
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.820
I don't remember this here.

95
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.070
Oh.

96
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.000
That's right.

97
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.990
It's not puls altar anymore is polls user.

98
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.750
All right that's all that underscored pose.

99
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.080
I remember that guy's answer.

100
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.860
And then you need to come down to users.

101
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.050
All right

102
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.010
pause users or user enter.

103
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.070
Make sure you save it.

104
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.770
All right.

105
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.160
That looks good to me right now.

106
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:50.820
Paul's user and make sure that you also update that right here and set up those alter force user.

107
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.700
And right here

108
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.720
safe.

109
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.220
All right simple stuff.

110
00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.740
All right.

111
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.750
Fun going fast.

112
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.820
This is on for purpose because you should know how to do this already.

113
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.280
So again Tess.

114
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.390
Tess user one.

115
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.470
I'm going to sign it to Rico.

116
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.010
That's the first one in line.

117
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.810
They're polish which is an image.

118
00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.980
And if we have any box.

119
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.650
Beautiful because that way we learn more right.

120
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.310
Enter Polish posts.

121
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.920
It looks like is doing good right.

122
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.080
Let's check it out.

123
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.850
All right.

124
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.350
So it looks like it's working.

125
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:38.670
Because you know we were able to publish something but then again we have an issue here because the

126
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.070
author is not coming through.

127
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.520
All right.

128
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.630
So I think I have I think I have an idea what that is.

129
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.900
We are getting the title publish and we are missing.

130
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.700
This is the image that date.

131
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:03.810
Let me double check this for a quick user.

132
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.670
All right.

133
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.500
So we're not explained the user right here.

134
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:18.780
Let's go ahead and try it and another one here yes user to sign it to Rick javascript post-Arab publish

135
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.440
javascript tags and beautiful.

136
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.950
All right.

137
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:37.320
So we're not actually displaying this right now so you can go ahead and try to fix on your own but I'm

138
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.340
going to fix that in the next lecture.

139
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.680
Just to let you try it.

140
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.270
All right.

141
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.580
And just to make this lecture a little short.

142
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.440
So anyway thank you so much for watching this.

143
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.030
And I'll see you in the next lecture hopefully you fix it before I do.

144
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:50.520
Take care
