00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,690
Welcome back my student.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,600
So in this lecture I hope to prevent many headaches.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,590
And if you already have this headache I hope to make it better.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,710
All right so what in the world am I talking about.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,600
Well I'm talking about errors.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,390
All right.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,350
When you launch online most of the time your errors are going to be off your page is going to be mainly

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,860
blank and not going to say anything.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,770
All right.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,660
That is a headache that's a big headache.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,050
OK.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,000
You learned that the hard way sometimes.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,420
But like I say I want to prevent that from happening to some of you and offer a solution for goal that

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,900
is really easy but forcing for other hosting providers out there you're going to have to probably put

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,670
this thing every page and what I'm talking about.

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,460
Put this I'm referring to a function that will allow you to see your errors on that page.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,530
For example I'm going to actually show you this.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,470
These are ph be functions that we can use to turn errors on.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,170
All right.

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,360
You can put this function here on every page.

21
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,130
And that will show you all the errors.

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,240
Now you can actually look into it a little more if you do a little google search.

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,970
Stack Overflow is a really good Web site.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,240
All right to show you some of the things that other developers are using.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,900
All right.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,110
You can also go to the HP on their Web site and get information about those functions so you can put

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,420
that in every single page.

28
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,260
You want to see errors but that could be annoying.

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,730
Right.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,990
But again that's how you do it.

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,890
That second way of doing it.

32
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,500
All right.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,080
If using Go Daddy or maybe if you're using another hosting provider because I really don't know if you're

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,740
working all the hosting providers is to basically put a file in your root directory in your public underscore

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,530
the mail where your web is a web application is right.

36
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:58,170
You put you create this file with PH called BHB die.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,600
This has the same name as the original file in our local host.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,950
And then you say there what you do is you place the code right here you place is called error underscore

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,750
reporting equals evil.

40
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,340
This is a constant so as to be capital and you have to have the underscore there and then display errors

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,200
on the right once you do that then you're going to be able to see errors there.

42
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,290
Now you've got to weigh a couple of minutes for that to actually work.

43
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,670
So give it a couple of minutes or an hour or two or so until I die sometimes within five or ten minutes

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,280
it's working just in case.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:32,870
All right.

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,760
So again if you have another hosting provider besides GoDaddy check with them and ask him how in the

47
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,870
world can you have access to BHP DNI.

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,460
Well how can you edit the configuration of your server so that you can see errors on BHP because if

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,320
we don't see errors and when you are creating the application you're going to have a really big headache.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,030
But anyway hopefully this will save you from my headache or will make your yours better.

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,590
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
