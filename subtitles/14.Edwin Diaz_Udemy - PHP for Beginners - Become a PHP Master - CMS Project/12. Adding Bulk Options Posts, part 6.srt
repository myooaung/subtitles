00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,210
Hi welcome back on this lecture here I want to show you how to add some javascript's so that way when

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,370
we click on this little check out check box we're everything else gets selected.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,640
All right.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,500
Now don't get scared if you never done javascript.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,000
If you have you already know how to do this.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,290
But if you don't know don't worry I can't help you.

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,760
And of course I also have a course in javascript that can help you understand javascript if you're interested.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,140
The first thing that we want to do is go to our admen underscore Hetter.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,350
All right and that's INSIGHT admin of course inside the folder includes.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,980
So we're going to take this out here and we are going to be placing it on there under admin under the

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,070
score footer right below the Jake way that is here.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,550
And the reason why we're going to put this on the footers because we want our scripts to be to load

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,610
after everything else on the page.

14
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,250
If you put your scripts on the header most of the time well all the time they're going to be loading

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,770
on the header and that's going to make your site your markup law a little slower a lot slower depending

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,850
on what you're loading there.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,940
All right so once we have that let's just save it.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,840
Let's go to the folder.

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,700
Yes.

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,100
I admin and they were going to find scripts.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,080
Yes you say here we're going to add some javascript.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,520
All right.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,730
And what I'm going to be doing I'm going to show you right now if I go to View polls we're going to

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:33,100
be targeting this input right here with this ID and that is this heading right here.

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,660
What we're going to be saying javascript is when I click on this one here I want you to make all these

26
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,340
checkboxes true.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,620
And by making them true of course they're going to be checked right by making.

28
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,120
Actually when I click on it they're all going to be checked.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,840
That's what I'm trying to say.

30
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,320
And when I take it out they're all going to be unchecked.

31
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,820
All right.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,830
So that's what we're going to be doing with Javascript.

33
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,620
So we got the idea that we're going to be selecting this with.

34
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,490
And we also have I go down to it if I can find it.

35
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,680
There are other checkboxes.

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,780
They have a class.

37
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,060
We're going to also target this class right here.

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,290
All right.

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,980
So now that we know what we're doing let's go ahead and do it.

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,980
First thing is we need to make sure that Jake where he's actually working so we're going to say document

41
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,720
got ready.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,170
This is a function to load this functions after the document has being loaded.

43
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,290
So this is going to load every function after everything was loaded.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,730
And I just want to say Hello there just to make sure that he's working.

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,230
It would not work since I have a dollar sign here Jake where he was not installed.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,870
All right.

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,650
So if I refresh.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,860
Whoops.

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,990
Looks like it did not work.

50
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,550
By the way what am I doing.

51
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,090
There we go.

52
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,670
Actually they work.

53
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,430
All right.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,480
So now that we know he's working let's target that deadheading radio button there and we're going to

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,290
target it like this.

56
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,870
Sound it's going to be an I.D. call select all boxes and we're going to say something and add this all

57
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,570
the function here called Click.

58
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,190
So when we click on it something else is going to happen right.

59
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,540
That's all we doing right here.

60
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,410
I'm going to bring that down to put a parameter here call event.

61
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,040
And we're going to say we're going to put an if statement here because we want to check if it's checked

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,730
for us.

63
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,050
So this is checked then.

64
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,390
I want you to do something right.

65
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:56,410
What are we going to do is we're going to graph that little box that has a class of checkboxes.

66
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,230
Each of them have this class.

67
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,490
And we're going to iterate through and this is what each function is going to do for us.

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,100
All right.

69
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,370
So we can iterate through that object when I say function

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:24,160
then I bring this down a little bit and we make it make all these checkboxes true checked equals true.

71
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,760
All right.

72
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,630
This this key word means that if we are referring to this object.

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,680
All right.

74
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:38,500
That's what this is we're referring to this and this this is referring to this one.

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,860
All right.

76
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,190
That's where we use the key word.

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,240
This should be familiar with that.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,820
Right.

79
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,660
So once we have that then here we're going to say else if it's not

80
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,430
if we do the opposite of it right we want to grab that and actually going to grab this whole thing again

81
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,610
right here.

82
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:06,270
And want to grab that and I'm going to make this false.

83
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,000
Right.

84
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,020
So that's that.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,470
That should be able to help us out.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,180
All right.

87
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,360
So let's go ahead and try that right now.

88
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,640
Hopefully I don't mess up because that was actually kind of fast right.

89
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,020
So I not refreshing here.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,810
Putting my cursor there and clicking enter.

91
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,960
And then when I click on it he's working now right.

92
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,670
So everything selecting now we can go ahead and publish everything the send time.

93
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,710
And you can see that everything is published or we can go ahead and draft everything.

94
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,470
Look at that beautiful right.

95
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,220
Well we can go ahead and delete but I'm not going to delete right now.

96
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,300
To be honest of you we put a lot of effort into making this post right.

97
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,590
Why are we going to be the leading them.

98
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Right.

99
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,710
We already know this is the way this works right.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,010
But anyways I hope you enjoy this lecture here and we're going to keep adding some more features.

101
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,350
And it was a pleasure like always.

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,180
Thank you so much for giving me the pleasure of teaching you this.

103
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,300
And I see you in the next lecture.

104
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,730
Take care.
