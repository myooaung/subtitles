1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,950
Great.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,890
So are you guys ready.

3
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,670
Let's do this.

4
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,110
So the first thing that we are going to be doing is creating a table in our database.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,710
OK.

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,000
So let's go to our CMS database going to create a new table and tackle this likes and we're going to

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,900
have a couple of fields.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,020
The first one is going to be an ID of course we want to keep track of each individual like let's create

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,990
a autoincrement.

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:33,170
And the second that would be maybe a user ID just to keep track of the user doing this OK.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,150
And the third one would be maybe a post ID to make sure that we know which bosy was light.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,800
So once we do that let's click safe and KLISE done.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,520
OK.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,620
So let's start playing around with this.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,650
So we're going to have to Reisen javascript but I don't I don't want you guys to get scared ok.

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,230
This is going to be pretty easy.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,060
OK.

18
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,660
So basically we are going to be sending a request via Ajax to the back.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:14,860
OK and we are going to be updating the polls and you know basically updating our likes to as well.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,160
So right here below the footer are going to be writing so.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,110
So Jake where we just because we already have Jay Querrey there is just going to make it easier for

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,430
us to do OK to do javascript.

23
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:28,970
So

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:40,420
Bob before we do this let's actually create the buttons that we are going to be meeting in our seamless

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,840
shoes me.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,940
And let me just get this here.

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,530
I believe its here.

28
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,990
The first polls doesnt have an image so we need to maybe fix that too.

29
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,560
OK.

30
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,910
But I'm just going to log in real quick and I don't believe this database has my info.

31
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,650
Actually it does.

32
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,310
OK so let's go to the first post.

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,970
I'm going to edit it a little bit and just to make it look better.

34
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,710
And let's go to this guy here.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,230
And came actuaries publish this put some maybe some data.

36
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:30,300
So I just want some lowering apes in there.

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,050
OK let's do that.

38
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,380
Images are already updated.

39
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,400
Let's look at the Post and the image is not working.

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,960
That's fine.

41
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,160
Let's go ahead to the code and find out why that image is not working.

42
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:02,510
So what I want to do is I want to go to the polls and let's see where we have that image the image is

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,690
right here.

44
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:14,390
So this is going to make the link like this let's go back and refresh and

45
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,020
it's going up or are Konsole real quick it says they failed to load the image.

46
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,370
OK.

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,290
Well I don't think I have my path correctly.

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,780
See mass and the images is in PSI.

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,250
And this oh maybe the image is not there.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,100
OK.

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,930
So

52
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,940
says come back here the image is number B W D for so it looks like an image is not there.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,180
It wasn't upload it.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,010
So let's go back here again and let's figure out why this image did not overload

55
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,450
and up the post again.

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,010
Come back here now the image is there for some reason.

57
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,590
I didn't do it right the first time.

58
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,890
So.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,210
All right.

60
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,110
So we have a post and we want to link right here.

61
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,550
So let's go and create that

62
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,540
we're going to do this right.

63
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,070
No content here.

64
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,720
And let's go ahead and start playing around with this a little bit and see how that looks OK.

65
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,180
We can fix the guys.

66
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,860
I want you to pay very close attention to this.

67
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,180
We are going to be fixing our polls up that BHB page.

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,590
We're going to be refactoring all this code and we're going to make some helper functions are going

69
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,290
to help us not just in this page is going to help us along our whole application OK.

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,290
I'm telling you right now we're going to make this speech really nice.

71
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,310
We're going to fix this prepared statement.

72
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,790
I'm going to show you guys how to do really awesome things with this mess.

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,530
Guys this is a thing you guys I want you guys to learn as much as possible and I want discourse to keep

74
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,960
giving you value for your time and your money.

75
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,430
If you pay for this course.

76
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,130
OK.

77
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,530
So don't worry.

78
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,620
Just follow me along and you can learn a whole bunch of different things.

79
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,190
OK.

80
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,290
So let's go ahead and create a link right here.

81
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:36,330
So I'm going to create a role for us and we say here a paragraph and maybe inside this paragraph a link

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,940
that says like or something like that.

83
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,700
OK.

84
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,470
Want to give this maybe a class of pool right.

85
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,600
Remember I'm using was scrub three with this course.

86
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,470
OK.

87
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,740
There we go we have this like right here.

88
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,520
OK.

89
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:05,560
So maybe we won a nother def down here where if a class of clear fits for bootstrap let's just organize

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,640
this a little bit.

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,720
And refresh.

92
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,840
That's fine it's not.

93
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,620
And you see it's not doing much is just a little bit outside of the boundary of where I want it.

94
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,930
Well that's OK Will.

95
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,890
If anything will fit to later OK.

96
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,530
But that's that's a start.

97
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,440
That's why we won we won the like button there and we also won the likes below that like the amount

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,920
of likes.

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,370
OK.

100
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,280
So let's make another here.

101
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,750
And let's go and continue with this let's see.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,910
So here we just going to say likes and we're going to put 10 for now.

103
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,650
OK.

104
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,590
And this doesn't need to be a link.

105
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,190
So let's take that off the slate.

106
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,630
And this refresh and you can see that it says 10 likes.

107
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,330
OK.

108
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:06,440
Now there is another thing that we have here before the link which is a little thumbnail right now a

109
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,010
thumbnail.

110
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,920
A little thumbs up button.

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,530
OK.

112
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,580
So we need to create this ambusher has a really cool class that allows us to do that.

113
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:25,670
So before the bar and before this here before this word actually I'm going to create a spam and inside

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,410
spam.

115
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,890
Actually let me just give you the class right here I'm going to give it a class of delight let me see

116
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,190
if I remember how to spell it as it's spelled the s.

117
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,440
So glyph I know glyph spell this and then I can.

118
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,640
OK.

119
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,220
And then there is another class called glyph again and then comes

120
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,680
up and we are going to be making this dynamically.

121
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,280
So don't worry too much about it.

122
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:55,840
OK.

123
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:02,380
Because we're one of these plays that display they like or their own like if you know depending on what

124
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,700
we have in the database.

125
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:08,780
So let's go back here and refresh and we don't see anything there yet.

126
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:16,900
So I may one of these so life icon and the life.

127
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,100
Oh I forgot that I can hear.

128
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,680
There we go.

129
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,920
And look my IDs even helping me how I I make that mistake.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,630
There we go.

131
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:33,430
So you can see we got a little hand there and you know will we can make that bigger if we wanted to.

132
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:43,460
All we have to do is you know attack the foreign mailman with some fun size and make it bigger like

133
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,280
100 pixels.

134
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:46,910
All right.

135
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,280
So that's how you make it bigger.

136
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,190
You know targeting is a fun size.

137
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,920
So I'm pretty sure you learn a couple of things in this lecture here are you guys ready to take it to

138
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,480
the next level.

139
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,250
I am so in the next lecture we're going I started writing on Javascript just like we started down here

140
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,770
but you know I figure we just write for the memoir cup and then we start playing around with it.

141
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,310
So see you in the next lecture guys.

142
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:14,780
Take care.
