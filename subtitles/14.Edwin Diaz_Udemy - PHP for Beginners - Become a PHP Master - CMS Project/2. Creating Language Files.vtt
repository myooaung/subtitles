00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.240
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.320
My dear student Welcome back.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.870
OK.

4
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.390
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go and find my project which I got right here.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.590
OK.

6
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.480
Hopefully you guys can see that put Big Tex here so you guys can follow me.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.680
So I'm gonna go to the registration page right here one of the first things that I want to change is

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.620
a button that's driving me crazy read this bond right here I'm just gonna make it blue or something

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.150
like that.

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.680
So I'm just gonna come here and I'm gonna make this blue instead of beauty and custom I'm just gonna

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.200
say it's a primary color and now I'm going to refresh it and make sure that that works great.

12
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.560
All right.

13
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.510
So let's get plain here.

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.180
So the functionality is very simple we're going gonna be doing this with sessions.

15
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.160
OK.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.670
And sessions I'm going to allow us to keep some data alive wins once the page refreshes.

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.020
OK.

18
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.630
So first things first.

19
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.500
What I want to do is I want to create another directory and I'm going to do that inside includes for

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440
the right here.

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.020
I think this is a good area just because we are very close to the registration page.

22
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.030
So inside includes folder in the root directory not inside the admin inside the root directory.

23
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.520
I'm going to create a directory another directory called languages.

24
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.920
OK.

25
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.180
Just in case you have more languages.

26
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.360
This would be a good place to put him.

27
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850
And I'm just going to have two languages.

28
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.820
OK.

29
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.220
The first one is gonna be e and for English e end up BHP guys.

30
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.340
And just remember there are a couple different ways of actually doing the feature that I'm I'm about

31
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.240
to show you the feature that I'm going to show you right now can be done using arrays can be done using

32
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.410
another functionality with packages can be done using the database.

33
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.280
This is just the simplest way to do it.

34
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.930
OK.

35
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.720
So this is remember this is extra features that I'm adding to the course to show you guys more stuff.

36
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.570
This is not it doesn't mean that the the course is not complete this course is is being complete a long

37
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.670
time ago.

38
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.660
I'm just key I just keep adding stuff to it.

39
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.370
So you know.

40
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.840
So you guys can learn more.

41
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.570
But anyway so I got these two files a English version and the Spanish version because of course I speak

42
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.010
Spanish the E N I'm going to set it up right now.

43
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.210
OK.

44
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.000
So I could create a constant here called register register like that as a matter of fact I'm going to

45
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.150
put a underscore here because I'm signifying that this is a constant.

46
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.450
Now you can use a what you would call it.

47
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.340
You don't have to use the word concept but this is the newer version.

48
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.180
You can actually use define if you like to define a constant and we already learn how to do that in

49
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.560
this course.

50
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.210
But I'm going to use this new keyword here for new BHP versions.

51
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.800
OK.

52
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.690
It's just cleaner for the defined function.

53
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.720
The defined function could be use in some other features.

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.650
OK.

55
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.600
So I'm creating constancy because that's what I'm going to be using.

56
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.110
You can use arrays if you like.

57
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.940
It's up to you.

58
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.350
What is the benefit.

59
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.590
Well in reality I haven't really looked it up but when arrays you can just have one array name and you

60
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.800
can access it's values that way which is the name and the key with the key and value.

61
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:10.830
So it's up to you to do this and I'm just gonna change this to enter your user name.

62
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.640
As a matter of fact let's start each word with a capital or uppercase entry you or

63
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.470
what is this email and this would be it doesn't matter fact let's just copy this thing right here.

64
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.210
Enter your password.

65
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.060
Super simple

66
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.850
all right.

67
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.280
Now let's create Oh the one I'm just gonna copy this.

68
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.960
Put it right here in the Spanish section.

69
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.020
Well let's copy the whole thing right.

70
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.730
That would be very smart if we did copy the PSP tag and voila.

71
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.420
Now we are gonna be learning some Spanish guys ready.

72
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.140
All right so you start what you're gonna say.

73
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.170
He stood at the OK.

74
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.590
I could be a Spanish professor right.

75
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:24.600
No way they will swipe you means username and to your core cocktail means your email and just trying

76
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.900
to make a simple to your again flabby.

77
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.470
All right.

78
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.250
Your password.

79
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.190
You.

80
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.350
You can also book contract saying yeah.

81
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.560
Well that's a different word and it's the same word but it just bigger.

82
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.180
OK more complicated.

83
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.090
But anyway.

84
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:51.800
So we created these two files here which is you know I think we do good here.

85
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.110
And if you want in more languages of course you would still you know add more data.

86
00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:04.820
You would put it here and in a different file if you were from Germany you would do a German file and

87
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.920
you would put you know you would change this or have more data included depending on the file that you

88
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.310
are translating.

89
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.330
So in the next lecture we're going to continue with this.

90
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.020
See you in the next section or lecture actually.
