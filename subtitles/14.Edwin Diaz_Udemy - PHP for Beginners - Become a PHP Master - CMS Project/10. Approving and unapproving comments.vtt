1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.280
All right.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.300
So I made a couple of comments here and we you know we can delete them if we wanted to.

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.450
But on this lecture here we're going to be learning is how to change the values here for approving or

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.370
improve.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.260
That way we can show comments or not show them in the front of the website right in front of a mess.

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.910
So let's go ahead to the call right now and start doing that right away.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.580
So let's go to have you all comments and let's do something right here.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.520
Why not right.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.620
So let's keep keep on going here and let's actually use a different Querrey right now.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.750
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this one here because we don't need to reinvent the wheel

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.750
if we have all the resources right here.

12
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.320
Right.

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.150
So let's go ahead and put this down here.

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.260
And we are going to be accepting another value and we're going to be sending this value from here.

15
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.980
Right.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.880
Instead of sending the key delete we're going to send a key saying on our proof.

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.410
How about that.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.010
Beautiful right.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.450
And we're going to be sending the same ID actually post ID.

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.440
Yes.

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.860
Actually it's not the post ID.

22
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.360
We need to send that comment Id because we we are going to be on approving that comment just like this

23
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.420
one right here.

24
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.950
We could just copy it from there but that's fine.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.780
All right so let me make this a little bit like this so that what you can see and let's change this

26
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.160
to comment.

27
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.680
Perfect.

28
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.910
I think it looks good.

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.350
What do you think.

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.340
All right.

31
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.010
All right so we're going to say on improve so we copy this one already.

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.270
We'll keep it right here on top.

33
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.000
All right.

34
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.340
So let's get ahead.

35
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.330
Let's get the key word right here and copy it also.

36
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.900
And let's put it right here.

37
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.860
Perfect.

38
00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.420
All right.

39
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.710
So we get to NOT THE LEAD.

40
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.650
But we want an update and this statement actually is going to be very different.

41
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.470
We're not going to see any of these actually and we're going to say update comments

42
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.130
set status.

43
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.350
And let me just double check that column.

44
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.820
I think it's common status is not 100 percent sure.

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.870
Let me just double check right here.

46
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.630
Comments that is that's what it is right here.

47
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.290
All right.

48
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
So a comment that is just a column in the table.

49
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.610
We're going to set it equal to what we can put the static value right here the aesthetic value is going

50
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.810
to be this on a proof right.

51
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.430
That's what is going to be.

52
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.220
So when we click on that link We're going to get it right here.

53
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.660
Turning to the common ID.

54
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.800
Right.

55
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.280
And then we're going to update common set common status equal to approve automatically.

56
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.270
All right.

57
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.120
So I think we're good here and we need to on proof

58
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.440
prove common query.

59
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.910
All right.

60
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.640
I think that sets a good and of course we have to prove it right there.

61
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.540
To have to get this I.D. right here so we change the status right away.

62
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.930
I think right now it should work fine the way it is.

63
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.680
All right let's go ahead and try that out.

64
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.550
Actually they are all in a pool right now.

65
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.700
So let's actually make the other one real quick too while we're here.

66
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.070
So we're going to make another copy of that and space to here.

67
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.960
And you take the front of it take the front of it and take the front of it.

68
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:13.800
That is all we had to do was this and take the front of this would too perfect and let's copy this one.

69
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.010
Here they go all the way to the top.

70
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:23.120
And we're going to be sending it right here.

71
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.930
Proof.

72
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.600
We're going to change this to comments

73
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.390
and we're going to be a proof.

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.370
It's going to be equal to the comment ID.

75
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.710
Perfect.

76
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.160
I think we're doing great.

77
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
What do you think.

78
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.110
All right.

79
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.160
All right let's check it out real quick.

80
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.370
This click on enter on the browser.

81
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.350
And when we click here it turns everything into a pool.

82
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.960
OK.

83
00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.350
So what we need to do is actually create a because if we don't approve it we're prove everything.

84
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.580
So we don't want to select everything.

85
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.730
All right.

86
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.910
We just wanted to let a couple of things.

87
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:19.860
All right so set of the comments said come and start as equals to approve where what where common ID

88
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.500
equal to why.

89
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.120
All right.

90
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.020
Two common idea right here.

91
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:45.220
Let's do that as do I where statements we don't want to hear too and we're steaming right here.

92
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.620
Who's

93
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.570
who where.

94
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.070
Come in.

95
00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:01.200
The ones who come in Id write this check it out right now.

96
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.170
All right prove it.

97
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:11.430
Prove prove prove or prove you see that only one changes are an approved this one changes and going

98
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.750
to prove that one changes perfect.

99
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.830
So now it is working right.

100
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.070
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

101
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.810
I hope you were able to get all valuable knowledge out of it and I'm happy that I was able to teach

102
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.100
it to you.

103
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.210
See you in the next lecture.

104
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.630
Take your
