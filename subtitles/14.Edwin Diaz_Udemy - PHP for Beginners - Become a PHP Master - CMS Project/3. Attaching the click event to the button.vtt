00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.270
OK so it's time to add something soon.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.290
Well not something but a click event to our link here.

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:16.510
So that way we can send post requests OK or request to our database as Paul's requests.

4
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.610
So how can we do this.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.750
Well we can use vanilla javascript we can use this using just a core javascript fundamentals or not

6
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.750
fundamental features or use Jake way which is a lot simpler.

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.710
So we're going to use GTK where we're going to go all the way to the bottom here.

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.140
Like we were trying to do before and we're going to write Sanjay where are we.

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.020
But before we do that let's go to footer and I want you guys to change in the foot of that BHB I want

10
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.690
to make sure that in every page our foot is actually going to see a mess.

11
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.250
So I force last see a mass there so that way we don't have a problem with this link.

12
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.090
Make sure you check your console.

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.180
OK.

14
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.490
Your javascript console your browser cancels.

15
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.820
Go here and more tools and then developer tools I'm using Chrome always.

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.720
So I want to attach an event here so let's make sure that a page has loaded and we are going to create

17
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:22.190
a document listener here with ready ready function and we're going to listen to when the document is

18
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.620
done and then we are going to create a click event here and we attach a click event to some type of

19
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.460
element and that element is this.

20
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.830
Here I'm going to add the class like OK.

21
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:50.970
So let's go down and right here I want to add the class like yours like the.

22
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.980
And when does click event on there is activated.

23
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.890
We are going to use cancel something out right now.

24
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.660
Cancel log.

25
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.370
And we seem to say it works or sometimes so let's refresh Let's click it and.

26
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:20.790
Well it's working but we need to you know get the make sure right now we put just a power symbol right

27
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.770
here and this anchor tag where we are clicking.

28
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.790
So that way that page refresh we can prevent that default but we don't do it like this.

29
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.340
So it works OK.

30
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.210
So once as we're working then we can start adding our Ajax.

31
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.830
OK.

32
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.560
Pretty pretty pretty awesome.

33
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.790
So let's do then the next lecture because I wanted to make these lectures short I wanted to make all

34
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.610
lectures short.

35
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.610
So you guys can make things work if you have any questions please post it in the discussions.

36
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.130
See you in the next lecture.
