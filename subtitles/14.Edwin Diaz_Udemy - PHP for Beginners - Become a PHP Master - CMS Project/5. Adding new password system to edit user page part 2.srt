1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:09,420
All right so we are at the second part of this here added in the functionality of a user page.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,940
All right.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,160
So one thing that I want to do here is I want to make sure that everything is inside this edit user

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,780
functionality here right.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,550
So we got this going on here.

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,170
We got this.

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:29,290
I know that I want to actually include this here that I have a comment that for some reason.

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,250
So instead of user pass we're going to make this hash password

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,770
right.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,790
And they're not uncommon.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,880
This show is available.

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,520
Put my coma right above.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,020
Make it work.

14
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,790
All right.

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:54,990
And again they're going to wrap everything around these edit user right here and that's about it.

16
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:55,920
That's all I want to do.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,600
To be honest with you if it's not empty then I want to actually do everything here.

18
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,760
So if he's 90 we're going to do this

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,400
right.

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:27,980
And we are going to have details as well.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,420
That's OK.

22
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,430
Let's look into it like this.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,130
All right perfect.

24
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,490
And save it.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
All right I think we're good to go here.

26
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:48,040
All right let's just leave this comment real quick.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,870
All right.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:58,790
Save it or let's go ahead and try and log in.

29
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,620
Call 1 2 and 3.

30
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,290
All right perfect.

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,030
So let's go to the user right now the passwords one two three let's add the user and let's make this

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,830
do another password.

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,970
And then before we do that let's check to see what password we have right now.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,990
So when I click on here and I grab this here and I copy into a text file.

35
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,750
Right.

36
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,540
And this is the old password right here.

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,790
So I don't know the old password.

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,110
Let's see if it does the new password right.

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:46,140
So I'm just going to put this here and let's see now let's go back and of the user does the user was

40
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:52,410
updating let's refresh year and looked like he did change.

41
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,860
What do you think.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,980
Yeah for sure.

43
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,410
Now we have a different password.

44
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,550
Let's check it out.

45
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,960
All right totally.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,790
All right we were able to change to that new password so now our functionality is change here.

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,300
All right.

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,640
So for those of you out there that haven't changed just do it and change it.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,180
Make sure that it's working good for you.

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,440
One good thing about this here too is that after you do this it's actually good to to to redirect back

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,400
to users.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,840
What do you think.

53
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,150
All right so if you want to add that that's cool you can add it.

54
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,360
All right.

55
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,740
So we're done with this one.

56
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,710
Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture
