00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.200
Alrighty then.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.380
So we have done some work here.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.490
We have done the left form that we're going to be use into the categories we have at the table.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.170
Now it's time for us to redisplay some data here.

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.500
All right.

6
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.020
So let's go ahead and do that.

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.510
But actually before we do that I noticed that we are getting kind of Claudet here we have a lot of fires

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.180
going on here and what we want to do is rename some of this so that when we don't get confused about

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.930
them right here that foot or the head of navigation here has the same name as the one anatman.

10
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.860
See that.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.440
So let's go ahead and click over them and click one time I'm going to say admin on the score for I just

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.130
going to renamed it to admin to have the prefix in the beginning of the word.

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.360
Let's do another one.

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:59.180
Admen navigation so I'm renaming footer header and actually this is the it's just back up a little bit

15
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.090
here.

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.810
This is the header and rename it to us.

17
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.590
There we go.

18
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.630
Enter actually the wizard is the footer.

19
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.270
And this is the hetter if I can save it

20
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.220
right now my.

21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.950
All right.

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.260
This is actually the head of but he's not saving for me.

23
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.110
So when that happens to you all you got to do is just close your brackets quit it and then reopen it.

24
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.230
All right.

25
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.050
So I did a check on my header is fine footer.

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.420
All right.

27
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.750
So what we need to do is come back to.

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.680
And it's here and we're going to rename already does ahead of time.

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.110
But you got to have something like this in the end let's make sure that you do this admin Hetter and

30
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.480
you make sure that you have admin navigation.

31
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.520
I really did this by the way before I made this video here.

32
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.010
Just make sure that you do have that and make sure that you do have all these prefixes on the phone.

33
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.600
All this includes make sure you also have it on now on categories here.

34
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.370
I don't have them so I'm going to make them because we are including these files from there but we have

35
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070
a prefix in them now.

36
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.730
So let's just do the footer also.

37
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.790
So.

38
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.300
All right.

39
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.800
So let's just check to see if we broke anything or everything is good.

40
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.730
Let's go ahead and display some data really quick before our time is over in this lecture.

41
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.260
All right so we are in categories and I want to display some data right here.

42
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.770
I want to put a while loop but I need some feature BTX right.

43
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.290
Actually we do have some color that we can use already.

44
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.950
So we do have to write everything as good a sidebar.

45
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.310
This copy some of this thing down ready copy the query curve goes up HPN and I put it right here organized

46
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.570
a little bit using the command left bracket.

47
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.670
And let's go to sidebar and let's get it while loop.

48
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.780
Why not let's get it with all the PH pre-tax.

49
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.920
All right we have to be lazy when it comes to this or I would just be writing everything we need.

50
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.770
Time is very important and we need it.

51
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:37.010
So for a while loop right here and going to organize it a little bit.

52
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.640
All right.

53
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.550
So we have a query here I'm just going to rename this to select categories.

54
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.850
That's it.

55
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.120
And copy this and send it right here.

56
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.600
Remember that on the wall.

57
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.760
All right.

58
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.870
Perfect.

59
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.530
So what else.

60
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.550
Well those were the well we're bringing in the idea.

61
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.430
So right now this is just bringing in the title.

62
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:08.940
Let's bring in the ID and let's call this cat ID then we'll call this cat ID.

63
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.370
This is the field in the database in the table right here.

64
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.950
This is the name of the day and I'm making this up I can make any name up for this for the variable.

65
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.580
But for the key inside that database I cannot for the for that column.

66
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.640
OK.

67
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.200
So that's the call and that's that's what we need it in database.

68
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.550
Now here we're not going to be using list items or anchor tags.

69
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.260
We're going to be using the TV right here.

70
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:46.100
So I'm going to put that right here take this tattoo audio there and put this instead right there.

71
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.670
I'm going to do this.

72
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.080
Copy this again here because I don't want to keep writing this stuff down and I'm just going to say

73
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.590
cat ID there.

74
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.290
All right.

75
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.340
So now we're bringing in the valleys from the inside of the database and we are displaying it right

76
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.410
here in NTD.

77
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.240
Let's take this out of here.

78
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.420
All right so let's just bring this up a little bit.

79
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.950
All right.

80
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.580
Perfect.

81
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.220
So I think everything is good here let's see how that looks.

82
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.170
Refresh.

83
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.450
All right.

84
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.290
So we're bringing in some values here but they are not looking really good.

85
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.460
So the values here the idea here let's add the titles but let's go ahead and organize this a little

86
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.620
bit.

87
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.440
And I think I know what it is is that we are missing a PR here.

88
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.640
Actually we need to put it inside a loop since we are going around a couple of times we need a couple

89
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.480
of them.

90
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:47.550
So let's echo a TR and their tag and let's do another one in the bottom there about that thing is going

91
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.480
to organize it really cool and see how that looks.

92
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.290
Refresh.

93
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.610
Perfect.

94
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.290
All right.

95
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.210
So we were able to bring some data from our database.

96
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.900
As you can see right here we have the ID of each of the categories and we have the category titles.

97
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.890
Perfect.

98
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.730
All right.

99
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.860
So we are done with is a great thing is that it looks really good as you can see we haven't done any

100
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.780
CSSA styling or anything like that.

101
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.230
This framework is doing everything for us and I'm glad that we have something like this available.

102
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.680
And I do have a course on that just to let you know.

103
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.060
But all right so we're coming together in the next lecture where we'll be continuing doing some more

104
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.950
work on this right.

105
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.280
So see you in the next lecture.

106
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.100
Take care.
