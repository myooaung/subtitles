1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,410
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:08,220
I'm a student so after some time of being very busy I took some time because I wanted to show you guys

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,160
how to create dynamic active links.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,470
Right now we have done other namak navigation right here because we have our categories but they're

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,050
not being really selective.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,740
Here when we click on it right they're not taking the active class.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,560
And right now we can actually show you how that looks if we right click on this right and we go inspect

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
element and we come here and we right click again.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,830
It as HD mail and we put a little classier call active.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,900
And this comes from Bootstrap right here like this and you click away from it and you can see that data

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,190
get selected right.

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,140
So all we got to do is add that active class to each of this links here.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,490
The problem is that we already have navigation and dynamic navigation here and we have study links here.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,380
So we need to figure out a way to do this.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,750
I'm going to show you how to do this right now in the code.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,190
So go to your navigation that BHB page.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,460
All right that's in the front page.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,880
And this is where we're going to be doing this so I'm going to go.

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,640
Actually we are already here.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,170
And I think I drank my coffee this morning.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,790
But anyway let me show you how we can do this.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:23,820
First of all let's create a category on the score a class variable and this is what we're going to be

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,620
keeping.

24
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,060
We're going to put this empty here because right now later on we're going to be putting the active key

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,610
in here like this.

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,570
Depending on where we are on that page.

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:33,900
All right.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,740
And then we can use this category to put it in psi here like this.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,540
Right.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,270
And then we can put that very well there but let me just show you we're getting ahead of ourselves here.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,980
All right so we got the empty variable there.

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,880
Let's create another entry variable for the region for the static links like this.

33
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,320
And there are a couple ways of doing this and some of you are already probably doing them in a different

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,890
way.

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,100
But this is the way I'm going to show you how to do it.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,550
All right.

37
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,380
Then you can come up with your own way on your own time.

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,620
So we got these registration we just going to call the registration class like this.

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,730
All right.

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,980
Now I'm going to show you a little trick here.

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,510
This is how we can find out the name of the column page that we are on.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,410
We're going to use this function basename just to clear things up for us a little bit.

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,000
All right.

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,500
You can look it up and it should be on their website.

45
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,070
We're going to use the server variables.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,560
It's magic Konst and here we're going to say self.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,450
You see this value right here.

48
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,750
Right.

49
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,660
This value would be our

50
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,170
category that BHB.

51
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,520
All right page so that would be the page that we we are on.

52
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,730
Right.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,540
So if we are on in that it would be indexed that BHB.

54
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,970
All right so that's what that is.

55
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,470
So let's assign this to a variable called Page name like this.

56
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,370
All right so now we get the page name here.

57
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,190
And all we have to do is create an if statement.

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,580
And check this out.

59
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:09,990
All right.

60
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,190
So we can say something like this.

61
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,760
First of all let's check to see because we have some dynamic menu right categories.

62
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,300
So let's first check for the get.

63
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,400
All right so let's check to see if we have a get called category.

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,870
All right.

65
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,340
So that way we don't get no errors.

66
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:37,710
And then we want to do is we want to say and I want you to compare this.

67
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:45,100
All right well what the category Heidi.

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
All right.

69
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,650
Now keep in mind that there are ways of doing this with javascript Buswell is a little more complicated

70
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,540
than this but I just want you to keep that in mind right.

71
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,900
All right.

72
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,740
So now that we had this condition here.

73
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:10,130
All right all we got to do is set this category variable right here too active.

74
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:10,720
All right.

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,210
Remember we started this in empty because we wanted something to be there and so you in a minute.

76
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,010
Why.

77
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,570
Because if this is if the page is not selected.

78
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,990
All right.

79
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,480
We don't want anything to be there.

80
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,660
We do want to get any errors there.

81
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:37,380
So anyway so that would make that work for then we can also do another statement here for our page name

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,040
for the static links so we can say if Bache name is equal and you know what we don't even have a page

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,980
name here.

84
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,850
All right so let's.

85
00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:00,460
Actually we don't have the registration and we need to make the registration page here like this registration.

86
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,720
We don't have the name on that page.

87
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:08,740
So we need to do that so we can compare it so we can say if the page name is equal to the registration

88
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,640
then we can say that the category you see this

89
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,210
we need to right here this one we need to set this to active

90
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,480
active.

91
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,210
There we go.

92
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,620
All right.

93
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:45,390
And now here what I'm going to do because this is going to be the category one we can put the category

94
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,740
clause in there.

95
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,950
All right.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,100
That would do that for that.

97
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:05,490
And then the registration class we can put it for this static many right here and we can say BHP call

98
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,180
category class which is not selected.

99
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,550
If it's not active right it will be empty.

100
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,150
All right.

101
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,650
Again there are other ways of doing it and you are welcome to do it your way just the way I'm teaching

102
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,430
you so that way you can grab some more ideas if you like.

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,410
So let me just show you now why this is right now.

104
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,060
So enter we are in category so we go to registration.

105
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:41,700
You can see that is already select and this is the static link BHP is already selected if we go inside

106
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:50,110
or admin and we create another category for example bootstrap category or.

107
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:58,180
We go to the we click here you can see that it's already selected this is selected select.

108
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,670
Even the restrainer and static page is selected.

109
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,460
All right.

110
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,790
Now keep in mind that every time you make a static link.

111
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,110
All right.

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,290
You need to create the variable there and then you need to place it.

113
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,930
You've placed a class on that static link as well.

114
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:16,370
All right.

115
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:24,720
So that's how you create a static dynamic active navigation link class whatever you want to call it.

116
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,250
Right.

117
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,200
But anyways a pleasure guys.

118
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,010
And I hope you enjoy it and enjoyed it and see you in the next lectures.

119
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,510
Take care.
