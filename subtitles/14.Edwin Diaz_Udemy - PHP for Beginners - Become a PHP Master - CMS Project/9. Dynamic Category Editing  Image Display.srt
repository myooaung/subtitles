1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,790
All right so we are missing a couple of things here.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,040
And we're going to finish it up on this lecture.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,690
So we want to display the categories dynamically from our database.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,380
We also want to have this image here and we want to fix this so let's go ahead and start doing that

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,040
quickly.

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,310
So let's go ahead and fix this.

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,310
And this is just very simple fixes put it in the beginning of that and maybe you already did that so

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,560
the image is another quickly very quick fix.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,500
We just put an image there.

10
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,290
This source is going to be in the images in the root directory.

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,710
And of course there's no ises just two dots there.

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,290
We're going to do a Ph.D. here.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,680
Let's make sure that we do it correctly though.

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,760
We don't want to make mistakes their false image.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,750
As you can see here I was the something that I did with all other

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,460
elements.

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,920
All right.

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:07,000
I just put the path here and the name of the image and let's do a with because if Now this image is

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,520
huge so we don't want it to be that big.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,220
All right so let's check on that refresh.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,550
We've got the image and we fix this.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,610
Perfect.

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,650
Looking great.

24
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,260
All right.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,860
So the categories Let's go ahead and work on that.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,400
We don't need this input here.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,650
Actually take it out.

28
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,460
And this work on a select element there the amount and this like this.

29
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,460
And on this select just going to put a couple options but I'm going to do this options dynamically.

30
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,580
So I'm going to do a query for the categories we want to do is one of these play all the categories

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,560
from our database right here and they select

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,400
right right now select doesn't have anything.

33
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,260
So if I refresh you sees empty right here we won.

34
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,330
We want to display some stuff from the database.

35
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,980
Right.

36
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,980
I already have a category selected somewhere in the Update section actually right here.

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,180
So I'm just going to copy this update categories.

38
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,370
Remember that includes files in the admin.

39
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,660
So I'm just going to select that go to Edit again face studding here.

40
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,500
All right.

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,810
So we're going to change a couple of things here.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,010
Select categories who took the idea out there that keyword based right here.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,810
And we have this entire query for us.

44
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,060
There's one thing that I want to change and I probably did not tell you about age that we have a function

45
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,890
here with a misspelled name.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,380
And let's go to functions and here this function if you brawly you didn't name it correctly but I didn't

47
00:02:53,590 --> 00:03:01,150
put a name here and he's supposed to be and then to confirm this is how you spell confirmed C O N and

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,200
I misspelled it there.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,440
I might do that once in a while but it really doesn't matter as long as the functionality is good.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,250
But I want my code to be a little cleaner.

51
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:17,060
So I corrected that and I also went and corrected it in the ADD post right here right.

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,020
Well we used that function because right now I'm telling you this because we are going to be using it

53
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,410
right now.

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,090
So make sure that you correct it too if you want it.

55
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,940
You don't have to correct it but I want to because I'm going to use it again.

56
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,960
All right so I'm going to use it right here this function

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,310
just to confirm that this query will be good.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,920
You see that but it's going to be Kohary right there.

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,180
And when you get to use these result that's what it's called resultset.

60
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,130
And we're going to use that query to confirm it that function.

61
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,240
All right.

62
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:06,270
So here what I want to echo is an option element mail option and I'm just going to go here and make

63
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,920
one because I got him to help me out with that.

64
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,590
And that's the plugin I use with this to remember that let's make this sim go cold's here.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,290
This cords to enclose that in the echo.

66
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,830
Perfect.

67
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,600
All right.

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,990
So we have that what do we want to echo here and between these we want to Eccl. cut Title right here.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,980
That's what we're going to call.

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,930
You can even lie down.

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,160
You can just put the brackets if you want around it.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,500
This is from the future and coming back here just to fix a little Boothville you know that my little

73
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,060
brother Adam from the past just may right now.

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,410

75
9:16 OK.

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,940
Nice upset with me.

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,670
Please please don't tell him I came back to the course and corrected his lecture for him OK.

78
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,980
He's going to get really upset.

79
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:02,930
But anyway on 60 if you notice on the video this element right here don't worry about what I got outside

80
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,200
because it's not the same code.

81
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,510
Remember that I'm from the future so I'm just giving you an example and telling you what to fix.

82
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,550
But anyway this is going to be a long 60 on the video make sure that you put the category ID right here.

83
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,130
OK.

84
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:24,980
Because if you don't put in this value field is not going to be carry in the select element name attribute.

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,610
OK remember that this guy right here is the same as the same value as this guy right here.

86
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,820
OK so make sure you have that value which is probably empty right now.

87
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,470
That's why I came back to you guys.

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,760
OK so nothing is always good to have your post category ID OK.

89
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,420
This idea here is always good to have it here or have a name for it so that way maybe later on you want

90
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,780
to style this element.

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,900
The select element you always have some type of hook into that but you can always leave it empty it's

92
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,110
up to you.

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,460
All right so see you.

94
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:03,720
Maybe I don't see you in the future but you know if I see you that would be good and bad but good to

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,720
see what your lecture guys and take care of Hopefully you are enjoying the course.

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,610
But by and I think it should work fine right now.

97
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,880
If I enough of getting anything let's check it out.

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,180
I write function is not working and that's a function of relief as we go to functions.

99
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,510
Confirm it is make sure that function is

100
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,590
calling frm

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
make sure that the same name has to be the function

102
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,110
let's compare it real quick.

103
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,100
It is the same name.

104
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,190
It might not be the function

105
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,290
to edit post.

106
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,730
Let's take the function out just to check it out.

107
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,110
A quick and check it out.

108
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,770
Refresh it is a function right.

109
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,610
And the reason why he's giving me that is because we haven't saved here safe refresh still giving me

110
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,360
a problem misspelling something and not doing something right here.

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,850
That function should work.

112
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,620
Actually we are doing this the wrong way.

113
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,820
There we go.

114
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,400
We're not supposed to be having that where you statement there.

115
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,400
Refresh.

116
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,110
Perfect.

117
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,000
See that.

118
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,060
So now we have all of the categories here Karaite right.

119
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,820
So we display all of the categories we've got right here.

120
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:58,170
And if we add another one for example example category category right there we go back to few posts

121
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:02,800
and then edit we could see that simple category popping in here.

122
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,250
All right.

123
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,640
Perfect.

124
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,090
Great.

125
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,690
So I see your next lecture where we will update the form when we submit it.

126
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,960
We're going to create a query to update the form and he's going to be great.

127
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you so much and I'll see you then.
