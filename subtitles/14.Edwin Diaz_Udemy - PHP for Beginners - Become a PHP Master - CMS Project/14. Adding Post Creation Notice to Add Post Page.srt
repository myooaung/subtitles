Welcome back my dear student in this lecture here I want to add disinflationary to that we have an edited

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,790
post right right here when we enter the polls we have this function idea where we can see we get this

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,490
information.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:21,390
I want to add it to the ADD post section right here because we don't have anything like that right now

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,110
so let's go ahead and start working on that.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:32,400
So the first thing that I want you to do is actually and I'm going to do myself is get this echo right

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,900
here.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,490
All right we're going to use the same echo with the same strings.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,690
We're going to use it in the post and then we're going to be placed in this.

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,550
Let me just fix this a little bit.

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,650
We're going to be placing this.

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,350
I mean the add on the score post up that way.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,850
Right.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,830
So after we create the pools and we get this information after we get this super global value here right

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,800
after the insert.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,890
All right I'm going to be placing this call right here.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,880
All right.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,880
So we're going to say post created.

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,330
All right.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,350
We're going to change that name there.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,760
Right.

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,780
And we can view the post and we Cujus clicking added more pools.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,360
All right.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,780
So now if I try to to use this right now I'm going to try to use it just to show you what can happen.

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,110
I'm just going to say it's simple post and we can read whatever it doesn't matter a simple post and

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:49,110
alter one status publish in a name and then choose a file and just write some random stuff and click

27
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,040
publish.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,050
We're going to get this undefined variable to post IDs just because we don't have the pulse ID.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,840
So what we need to do here and this is different from the exit polls because in the exit polls we have

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,460
that I.D. available to us and this one we don't because we are creating a new record.

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:12,330
So what we need to do is the best idea here is to try to actually prove that last created ID the last

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,730
create a record ID and then use that.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,130
All right.

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:25,560
And the way we do that would be is that we can use a function call my you a lie insert ID.

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,370
OK.

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:33,970
This function is going to pull out the last created ID in this table right in our database right here.

37
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,810
So we provide the connection that's a parameter that's what.

38
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,800
That's all it takes.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,270
OK.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,340
And then here we can grab this variable.

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,400
All right.

42
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,640
We can sign the function to this variable right here.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,640
So now we have the last ID that we created right here.

44
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,150
Right now we can use that.

45
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,660
Let's go ahead and try doing that.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,920
We can also create a query here and find out right.

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,140
We can also create and say you know what I want you to go into the database in and search for this ID

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:04,730
right.

49
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,260
We could do that but why.

50
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,370
When we have this function to do that for us.

51
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,390
Right.

52
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,700
So let's try to create another one example.

53
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:24,440
Was going to write whatever here and here and publish and then publish.

54
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:32,820
Then when we look at this from here we could see that it takes us to that record that was created right.

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,020
Beautiful.

56
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,900
So anyway thank you so much for watching this lecture.

57
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,240
Hopefully we'll help you out in your journey and I'll see you in the next one.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,690
Take care
