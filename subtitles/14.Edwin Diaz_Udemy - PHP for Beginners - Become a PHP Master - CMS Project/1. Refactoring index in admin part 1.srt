1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,750
All right welcome back.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,740
I'm a student so on this new section here we're going to be we're going to start refactoring.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,790
And for those of you that don't know what are we factoring is refactoring is when we grab complex code

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,620
you know very complex code or you know a long cold from our email.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm going to show you in a minute we have a lot of code in this and it's that BHB so we grab all these

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,200
code and we make it into a function and we make it even smaller pieces and you know even with the same

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,140
functionality or even with better functionality.

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,760
So let's inspect this in there so that we having admin which is crazy with a lot of code.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,520
A lot of Ph B as you can see we have a lot of queries here for each of these individual boxes and these

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,500
queries are basically the same thing right.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,330
They were they doing is they're returning the count of the record in the database of the table records.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,270
They're doing the same thing.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,370
We can create a function that would take some parameters and return to count of that specific table.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,480
Look at this here.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,570
So let's start working on it real quick and let me show you how we're going to do this.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,500
So the first thing that I want to do is I want to grab all these cold out a year or I am going to call

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,830
it say or control it go to functions up BHB And remember we bring in the index of BHB of admin.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,290
All right.

19
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,260
So let's go to functions and right below this on a pool full function or whatever function you got there

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:37,190
we're going to create another function and we can call this function record count.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,240
Right.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,170
Then we go and this space are called in there.

23
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,840
Whoops.

24
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,550
All right.

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,370
We're going to take a parameter.

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,480
It's going to be the table name.

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,310
That's all we need because that's what we got here.

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,200
All right.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,310
And then we'll put the variable here like this.

30
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,540
Now go back here we have a couple of things that we've got to take out.

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,530
If I can find where I was that would be nice.

32
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,620
There we go.

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,220
All right let's just take this.

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,640
We're going to need is very one a minute but let's just take that the piece base there and name every

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,220
sold

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,150
and we can even use a function confirm Querrey to make sure that our Riso goes through them.

37
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,840
If we if he doesn't go through he's going to give us some type of error that we can check.

38
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,140
And then here we have to do is return it.

39
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:49,380
All right we're going to return sort result like this in there if you can even make this smaller if

40
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,750
you want and you can put stuff inside functions you know and make it like that.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,240
But I'm just doing it like this so that it's very clear to you and while we are doing it right.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,080
Very simple so we can return this whole thing if we wanted to and you don't even need this function.

43
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:04,600
Right.

44
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:12,450
You can just return and save yourself a lot of lines of code like that.

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,830
He can even go further.

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,070
But I wanted to make like this so that way you know exactly what we were doing.

47
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:28,700
So we save it and then we grab this and paste it right here and now we are searching for their own account

48
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,070
in the polls table.

49
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,840
All right.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,790
We can grab all of this if we wanted to take all this BHP out of here.

51
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:46,670
It does pry open another BHP tagging Here in it out like this.

52
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,400
All right we well the whole thing.

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,150
We need these polls calmed down here so that's what we're going to keep the very well we need it all

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,430
the way down here somewhere.

55
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,750
All right.

56
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,370
We're using it right here.

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,950
So we're going to keep it.

58
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,090
All right.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,600
So we're going to save it and they will go back to our

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,680
moves.

61
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,980
I think I have an error somewhere on line too.

62
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,660
Twenty eight in functions.

63
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's just check real quick with saved.

64
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,550
Come back here refresh.

65
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,680
All Not now that we make sure that you have is you a global connection.

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,800
Right.

67
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,640
Because we are using the connection right here the database connection save it.

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's see we are good to go now.

69
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,540
All right so it looks like he's working we have a number eight.

70
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,910
And if we wanted to search let's say the common stable.

71
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,350
Let's go back to it.

72
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,660
That's we can say comments right here like this.

73
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,730
Save it.

74
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,610
Make sure you save your file.

75
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,400
Come back here and save it and refresh and look at I changed to one.

76
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,120
So we are able to check for each individual table that we won we won function.

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,430
That's really cool stuff right.

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,160
We don't have to repeat ourselves so much so now we can come here and paste that code in there and just

79
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,720
make this mortar.

80
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,060
All right.

81
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,290
This is the comment.

82
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,030
This update is to post

83
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,110
fools and just do the same thing for.

84
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,600
This is the users.

85
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,550
All right so I'm basically doing the same thing all of them just changing the table name.

86
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,700
This is categories

87
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,150
categories.

88
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,990
It is save it come back here and refresh.

89
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,060
And the last one there is we're missing a..

90
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,510
There we go.

91
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,970
All right is breaking our cold and the reason why is breaking is because those variables that I was

92
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,490
talking about.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,070
All right.

94
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,360
We're missing those variables so make sure that you have those variables and have to go back here real

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,660
quick and know what a variable that you know very well that this is category.

96
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,250
So they're all going to be coming down category kown and all that.

97
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,230
All right.

98
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:33,770
So make sure you have those variables here that you changed this disease category count

99
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,330
is it.

100
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,830
This is where we count like that.

101
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,220
The last one is categories.

102
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,810
All right so don't make the same mistake I just made and this is the users.

103
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,400
So user user account.

104
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,580
So we got an coming can't

105
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,500
save it.

106
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,190
They see this when these users account my data helps me.

107
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,200
Yeah because I already have the same variable the way when the bottom so that's why my editor is auto

108
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,960
completing this stuff for me.

109
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,890
So refresh.

110
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,730
And now you can see that it works 100 percent.

111
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,280
All right.

112
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,550
Beautiful.

113
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,280
So there you have it.

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,960
We've refactor a lot of stuff.

115
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,970
And the next thing I guess would be to refactor this year so we've got to go to the next lecture and

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,230
work with a little bit because I think this is a lot of cold here and we don't need it.

117
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,000
All right.

118
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,860
Another thing is make sure that you comment your code.

119
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,310
All right.

120
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,180
And explain to you explain what you are doing because you might come back in a couple of months and

121
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,520
do not know what the heck you did on his line right here.

122
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,470
So I don't call me my code because it would take me twice as much to complete the lectures and this

123
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,500
course is very long.

124
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,300
So just come in your code and you're good to go.

125
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,500
All right.

126
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,120
Of course I just wanted to show you that Bill we created this function.

127
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,720
So you want to start commenting your code.

128
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,290
Anyway thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture I have fun
