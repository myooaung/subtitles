00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.010
I will come back on the last video we created some records in the database using BHB.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.490
It was really fun to do.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.810
For me I don't know if it was fun for you should have been fun for you if you like BHB.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.320
All right.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.650
So until now we were able to connect to the database create a table doing ph my admin.

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.530
Now we have create finally started creating some data inside my su l using BHB So we created that username

7
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.860
X man in the password Linda in 93.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.380
Now I want to be able to read it right.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.140
So we want to be able to get that data out and do things with it right.

10
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.180
So first the first this next step is after Cross do we say that we started we cross with a C creating

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.730
and then we create.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.220
Now we are going with our crowd.

13
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.870
Remember we have crowd this is the acronym for's create read of day in daily.

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.550
So the next one is they are reading.

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:05.690
So let's go and do a Save on this file and let's call it Logan on the score read.

16
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.260
All right.

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.970
Perfect.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.790
So I want to do a couple of things here.

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.950
First of all let's make sure that we are in the right page.

20
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090
I want to take this form out of there because I'm not going to use it anymore.

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.580
So let's go down here and just delete this for right here.

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.690
I think that's OK right there.

23
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.310
We're going to be using this and that's just delete this

24
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.580
right.

25
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.060
All right let's use delete this also.

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.590
We don't need that.

27
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.750
We don't even need his user name because we are going to be reading information out of the database.

28
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.410
So this is fine.

29
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580
This is fine.

30
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.460
This is and what I'm doing is when I click and you can see the little dash on there the curly brackets

31
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.510
I'm just checking to see if this they match if they match.

32
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.070
Right.

33
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.530
So now what we've got to change is we've got to delete this because we're not making our query is going

34
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.120
to be very simple and our query is going to be something like select from actually all this Astras right

35
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.060
here means all in as well.

36
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.550
So select all from users this is a command.

37
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.330
Very popular commanding as well.

38
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.160
All right.

39
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.400
And it's going to be from users.

40
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.170
So now that we are making this square of course is going to give me an error on the page because actually

41
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.480
we're not getting an error.

42
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.330
But we are connected we are good.

43
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.220
So we're good we're good at those going to give me a narrow here.

44
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.510
But he has no reason why because we are making the right Querrey and we are not trying to get anything

45
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.210
there that we don't have any answers to yet.

46
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.210
So no no errors.

47
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.990
Good.

48
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.350
All right.

49
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.790
So now that we have this now we need to connect to my as well VFP HP.

50
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.410
All right.

51
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.740
So we do this let's create a BHB tag here.

52
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.140
Let's do some BHB.

53
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.910
And the way we do this the way we bring data out from from my is is going to come into in an array.

54
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.830
So we need a loop to go through that and we can use a while loop.

55
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.520
All right.

56
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:42.460
So and this while loop what we want to do is we want to use a function call my ex Q L I fetch Roe and

57
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.530
I'm not spelling it right my ass.

58
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.640
Q L I there we go for each row and what we want to fetch out of there.

59
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.720
Well if we go up here we know that we have a connection and the Querrey and this is bringing about the

60
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.250
result right.

61
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.760
This is we are making the query here and this is bringing back some information.

62
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.620
So let's just take this resoled and put it in between this in the parameter of this function here.

63
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.660
All right.

64
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.060
So how are we going to display this down here.

65
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.690
We need to assign it to something let's assign it to a variable called roll.

66
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.890
Now let's do the assignment operator there.

67
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
So while my Escurial fetch roll equals resoled why this is true.

68
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.820
We are going to assign it to this variable right here.

69
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.250
And then we are going to be displaying it down here.

70
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.970
All right.

71
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.630
So let's do a print.

72
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:44.090
Our functions here and see if we can get some data out of their row and let's see if that worked perfect.

73
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.310
So we got some information out of the database right.

74
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.460
We got an array the first row right here.

75
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.440
All right.

76
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.900
The idea is equal to 1.

77
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.670
The second is equal to Edwyn and the third one is equal to Superman then I'm pretty sure this is the

78
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.990
password field.

79
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.530
All right.

80
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.560
That's pretty cool isn't it.

81
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.900
All right this actually organizes a little better.

82
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.120
Let's see if we can get some.

83
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.950
Let's see if this works here.

84
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.330
There's another one this call saucier array of fresh this.

85
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.950
Let me just give in and explain to you a little bit my ask you Ally underscore fetch on this score a

86
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.060
S S or C returns and associative array back to us.

87
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.540
The other one with just returns a normal array with just the indices with 0 1 2 and 3.

88
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.920
The other one which chose an associate or way that we can actually read the columns and that is a lot

89
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:50.160
better I think as you can see here we can see that the key for the user name and the value right here

90
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.420
at when we can see the key password and the value of Superman.

91
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.470
And on and on right here the key and the value for the ID right.

92
00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:59.720
Perfect.

93
00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.960
All right.

94
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.800
So let's actually make this a little better.

95
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.300
So what I'm going to do is something that Michael fusion but I want you to rewind this video for some

96
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.120
reason you don't understand I'm going to turn off BHB right here.

97
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.890
All right you heard me correctly.

98
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.220
I can turn it off.

99
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.420
So I know by the end user in the end tag I'm telling you I'm standing back to stop executing ph be what

100
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.020
I want to execute.

101
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.120
Actually I'm male.

102
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.650
See that's what I want to execute there.

103
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.290
All right.

104
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.620
So now here I need to return to PH B to get this function here.

105
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:46.770
So let's open BHB again with open BHB attack and let's go over here over here and what we need to do

106
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.670
is actually wrap this around in a pre-TBC.

107
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.790
Right so let's play it again and let's put the in here and let's open it again.

108
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.560
I know that sounds crazy is it.

109
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.100
So many opening and closing we come here we got a nice pretty format right.

110
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:14.640
Look at that really nice right format with your ID with a key here ID with a value equals one the user

111
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.640
name value Edwin.

112
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.420
Look at that perfect.

113
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.110
All right this is how you organize data you bring it back from the database.

114
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.250
Beautiful right.

115
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.070
And we still have this.

116
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.420
We are connected that's fine.

117
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.360
We can leave it there we can take it off if you want but remember this actually these styles are coming

118
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.420
from Bootstrap.

119
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.030
This is of course the other course that I got here and you to me so make sure that if you want to find

120
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.100
out some more information about that just check my all the courses and you can find this out and and

121
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.280
learn how to use Butros really easy is a really short course.

122
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.480
By the way.

123
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.970
All right.

124
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.950
So now we were able to bring some data back.

125
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.730
Perfect.

126
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:57.120
Now on the next one so we are ready the Create read and we need to update data.

127
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:03.180
Right so the next video we were of they some data from from will be to the database.

128
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.590
Right.

129
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.770
So anyway thank you so much for watching hopefully you liked this video.

I appreciate it.

133
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.800
Appreciate it very much.

134
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.740
Thank you.

135
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.470
And keep enjoying my lectures
