00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.410
K so the next thing that we need to do is let's go back to our code here and now that we have this you

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.850
know click event on that button there we need to create Onge Ajax.

3
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.890
So that way we can sense our request to our server.

4
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.580
Right.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.370
Well we are going to use AJAX right here.

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.270
This function takes an object.

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.190
OK.

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.850
And the object are going to have the key of we you are able and just by is already pre-build into the

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.480
language guys you know that.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:42.060
So I wanted to send an event to the same you know as a matter of fact we're going to be writing our

11
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.930
ph some of the PH be in this page here.

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.870
So I want to be tech data posts requests has been sent.

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.030
So I'm going to be sending it to the same page right here so CMOS pulls up BHB and we need our P underscore

14
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.400
ID.

15
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.930
We need our ID or post ID here.

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:11.610
So what I'm going to do is going to open some PH BE tax inside the string and I'm going to echo Wow.

17
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.930
OK.

18
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.280
The polls ID which should give me the post ID.

19
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.670
OK.

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.840
So when I click on this link I'm going to be sending that.

21
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.640
OK.

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:33.890
Now I got to make sure that this put a comma there that type of requests or data is going to be appose.

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.700
And then we have another key for the data.

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.730
So these objects are going to have remember that this is just going to carry some of that data in our

25
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.080
post requests to the same page.

26
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.110
OK.

27
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.640
So we want the post I.D. which I don't know where I'm getting that from as a matter of fact.

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.280
You know what we can actually do this right now let's do it right here.

29
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:10.470
Let's let's do this let's get the pulse I.D. And let's see if this works like this.

30
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.070
PH BE COOL.

31
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:22.850
And this would be depost Id just like to OK.

32
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.670
So this would be the post.

33
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.480
Well we don't need to post it here but we need it down the road.

34
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.960
So it's like it's going to pull one because I just want to make sure they have some type of value here.

35
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.220
I'm going to differentiate my keys and values because I'm going to have the same name which is single

36
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.750
court.

37
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.040
You don't have to do this.

38
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.970
You don't need single courts here.

39
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.840
I'm just doing it just because I want to the French.

40
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.270
I want to make sure that you know the the keys and the values.

41
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.180
They look a little different because they have the same name.

42
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.950
You don't have to do that.

43
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.400
It works both ways.

44
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.860
And other than that I wonder is I wonder logged in user ID.

45
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.600
OK.

46
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.820
And I'm just going to really right now just hard coded.

47
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.460
But later on I want to create some type of helper function that is going to allow us to have the logged

48
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.210
in user ID just because I want to make sure that I'm getting the right type of data.

49
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.840
So right now for now

50
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.350
we see this stuff here.

51
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.390
Var I want to create a user ID but I'm just going to give it whatever I have in my database so for their

52
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.980
users I have browser users.

53
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.480
I have a whole bunch of users here in this database if I don't go into the many of them

54
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.200
you

55
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm going to create another user and I'm going to give it that ID.

56
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.250
I'll be back and just create another user.

57
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.150
I just have to refresh.

58
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.750
I just went to the front page and created that room so that way you guys didn't have to wait for me.

59
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.920
So I'm just going to put admin role here.

60
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.250
In their.

61
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.260
And actually you know we're not going to put a rule there are going to poor admin in this describer

62
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.640
for the new user.

63
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.360
OK so this is Edwin.

64
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.330
He has an idea.

65
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.780
Twenty six.

66
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.930
So that's what I'm going to put right here.

67
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.240
Twenty six remember just hard coding this right now.

68
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.330
And User ID.

69
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.410
I don't have to give this keys the same name.

70
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.170
OK.

71
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.220
But I do it anyway.

72
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.000
OK.

73
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.890
So remember these keys can have a different name.

74
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.250
And this will be the pause data that you're going to get in your server.

75
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.900
Ok the name of this.

76
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:09.040
So right now if we try to submit something I'm just going to check for this key in the end I can do

77
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.750
that if I wanted to I can just put a single cause here.

78
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.210
OK.

79
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.620
So to make everything uniform.

80
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.360
So I'm going to check for these post-state because that's what we are submitting here we Ageod's every

81
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:30.760
time we click so we go here to our top right below navigation and I can just open some ph tags.

82
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.360
I know this lecture went a little bit beyond what we were thinking of.

83
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.010
But I'm doing it like this so that where you guys can learn a little more.

84
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.820
But let's check for that light and if we have that like then we are going to be Eccl. something out

85
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.900
my let's just do I don't know if it's H-1 here.

86
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.290
You say that it works so that way we can see right.

87
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.230
Or maybe we can make the whole page die or something page 1.

88
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.400
There we go.

89
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.680
Let's see if this works.

90
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.450
Hey guys.

91
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.490
You know sometimes this does not work.

92
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.670
And you have to you know make sure that you do something to make it work.

93
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.610
So let's click like and

94
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:36.050
right now it's not it looks like it's not working let's let's use kill that page and see that works

95
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.440
right.

96
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.770
That's

97
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.190
Let's go here.

98
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.810
It might be working.

99
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.320
You have the wrong tab open Alamance network.

100
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.070
And we go so we go out and network and then we click here.

101
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.210
Obviously it will look at the head or you can see that we are sending requests which is posts and the

102
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.490
status is OK.

103
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:11.750
So it is finding that page and getting us a glance a glimpse of what it is and if we do work on now

104
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.050
let's do that.

105
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.190
And we do this again

106
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.370
next refresh OK.

107
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:29.660
Let's come back here like and you can see that we could come back here and you can see now that we are

108
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.810
sending the whole page headers and we are send in there.

109
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:42.050
I don't know if you see there let's see if I make this bigger so you can see it and you've seen that

110
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.560
like values number one the pull side is 139 which is the pulls ID here and the user at least twenty

111
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.200
six.

112
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.030
So we're getting those those values there.

113
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.590
And everything seems to be working if it wasn't working we get some type of error here with a page.

114
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:06.480
So let's say for example if you are l was now working let's just write one page here.

115
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:15.380
Let's come back here and refresh Let's click the link you can see now that we get a form for error here.

116
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.110
OK.

117
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.590
Pretty awesome right.

118
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:24.490
So it is working so well you guys already know how this works.

119
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.270
OK so we were sending everything that we need to send.

120
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.230
And let's take it to the next level.

121
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.190
See you in the next lecture.
