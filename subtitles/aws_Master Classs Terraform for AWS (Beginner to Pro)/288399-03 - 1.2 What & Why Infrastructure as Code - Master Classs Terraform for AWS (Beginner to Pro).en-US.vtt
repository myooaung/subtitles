00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.490
hello and welcome back to another lesson off hashtag lending courses.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.940
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.410
we're going to see what is infrastructures accord and why do we need it?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.310
So in the previous lesson,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.350
we have taken a quick look at what performers and we have seen,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.320
like whoever perform and like how the website looks like and off.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.300
What language do we need to learn for this?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.610
And and a brief introduction now in this lesson,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.610
let's take a step back and let's analyze,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.980
like,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.150
why did hash carp even develop him to like terra form?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.090
What is the problem that they're trying to solve now?

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.850
If you think off it,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.620
the problem here is basically let's say you have a cloud infrastructure you have.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.590
Let's a let's talk about AWS now most off,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.280
you know,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.340
like some off the AWS Resources like Lord balancers are easy to instance are are the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.170
scaling groups or s three buckets any off that?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.050
So what you usually do it's like you go to your console.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.970
You open it up,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760
You you go.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.900
You walk through the,

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.620
uh,

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.520
different visits to kind of create your resources.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.720
Like Lord balancers are easy to instance underwater Where this and let's say if you're

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.760
doing a simple task,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.440
that is fine.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.300
But if you are actually working on an enterprise application,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.130
are you are.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.050
If you are like building a huge infrastructure for your company,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.030
then you need to keep track off each and every resource that you create,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.390
and you need to know exactly how you created it.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.530
And,

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.160
uh,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.050
it is nearly impossible for anyone to remember why they have created a particular resource

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.050
.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.320
And what is the reason for it?

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.640
If you ask them,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.080
like six months later,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.570
when they often they're like,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.990
moved on to some other project and then they go back and try to think,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.330
Why did I even create this like who changed this?

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.150
That's another thing.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.390
Let's say multiple people are managing your infrastructure and you go back and see.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.980
This is not what I've configured of the security group.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.450
I've never opened the sport who opened the sport.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.660
Can you go back and check and can go back and track and easily?

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.690
Can you go back and fix it like do you even remember what it waas?

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.950
So these are the problems that that a typical adminstrator or a typical AWS guy or any

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.020
clouds guy will face in his dignity.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.660
Job operations now using telephone like normally terra form any other infrastructure as

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.950
accord basically here what?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.110
We're trying to solve this.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.240
Trying to keep track off what resources were creating,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.470
who created what and now when you have infrastructure as accord.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.570
Now let's say script saying that,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.100
Okay,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.160
I need a load balancer.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.750
I need any Zito and I need a security group.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.320
And here are the rules that I'm going to put in this security group now all those rules

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.290
that you've specifying the security group and you run that script.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.470
Your resources are created in your cloud environment.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.200
And once they're created,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.620
what you're do is like you're just check those changes in in tow,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.660
any version control,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.850
like git or subversion.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.210
Now,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.350
once you do that,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.050
what you're doing is basically keeping track off saying that OK,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.800
so they have created these particular resource is in my cloud,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.220
and this is the reason that I've created it.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.860
You log it in your comment message or you can even throw in some comments in your terra

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.690
form or like any infrastructure as a code or document and,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.350
uh,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.080
later,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.720
if you like,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.470
go back like,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.210
come back to it after six months,

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.750
then you know exactly why something was,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.350
um,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.940
Prohibition.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.850
Innocent in a way.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.390
So that is the main problem that we're trying to solve.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.790
So we want to document what we're creating.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.380
We want to know why we're creating and we want to keep track off who created stuff.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.900
And not only that,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.260
no,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.100
let's talk about handling multiple environment in your infrastructure.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.820
Let's say you're working for the enterprise company.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.390
Typically,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.960
they have,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.160
like death stack U.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.580
S stock and production stack.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.760
Now let's say you have created a stack for a specific application,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.780
and it needs,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.740
like Lord balance or orders killing group security groups.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.040
What?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.840
Not right.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.780
So you go ahead and create it for death Stack.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.120
Now let's say once they've stack is all done.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.560
Everything everybody liked your obligation are are your infrastructure stack and they want

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.100
to promote it pre prod or like Q A or production.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.480
Are you going to go and like run?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.130
I mean,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.210
are you going to go ahead and create all the stuff that we have created manually in a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.130
different environment.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.040
How much time your spending their tryingto recollect and it is not even guaranteed that

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.890
you're going to create the same infrastructure that you have created there.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.790
This is There were so many little things that you might actually miss when you're

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.020
configuring the cloud infrastructure.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.140
So this infrastructure as accord also solved this problem.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.570
Because now what you're trying to do is like,

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.980
basically,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.840
you're saying you change that in para matters in your own accord,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.920
which is like pointing to different security groups are different creating with a different

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.170
name or something like that.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.850
And basically you're running the same infrastructure.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.840
I mean same court that you have used in depth and you're replicating it in Cuba and

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.340
production.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.550
Now you're saving time.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.100
You're making sure your infrastructure IHS like same across different environment,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.140
which is really essential,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.410
Right?

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.860
So if you're testing so certain security issue and your devils different from Q is

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.150
different from production,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.170
then how are you going to figure out if there is,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.500
say,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.610
issue which is in production,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.570
and if you see no issue endeavor Q A.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.630
So these are the kind of problems that we're trying to solve using infrastructure as a

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.950
court.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.110
So now that we know,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.510
like what and why Infrastructure as accord.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.370
Now let's talk about like Why do you stare?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.980
For now,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.390
Terra form is a amazing tool and it is loved by all the guys that are working in the cloud

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.390
.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.980
And I personally love it and I have been using for more than two years now.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.660
I used literally terra form for every AWS operations that I make for,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.210
for for publishing,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.260
any resource is in aws Oh,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.760
and basically one off.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.330
The main reasons why people choose terra form is that it is a cross platform.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.320
Now let's say you have an infrastructure which is scaling across different clouds,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.650
multi cloud infrastructure or hybrid cloud things like that.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.550
So Terra form supports many different cloud providers,

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.900
and you can have all off them scripted under the same terra form file.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.730
You can target different cloud platforms,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.400
and it is easy to manage easy to learn,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.640
easy to kind of maintained,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.660
and there are different strategies that I'm going to discuss in in the coming lessons,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.990
like have having the remote state files.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.350
I mean,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:41.830
I'll get to that special fix off like bandages off terra form as as and when we come to

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.660
those topics along the course.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.850
So I really hope that you got a good understanding off like,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.480
what is Infrastructures Accord and why we actually need this.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.750
I'm going to stop this lesson here and in the next lessons,

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.650
we're going to continue more on Terra form the installation in the set apart.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.390
So that's it for this lesson.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.850
And thank you so much for watching.
