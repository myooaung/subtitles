00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260
hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.500
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.650
we're going to look at terra form variables.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.760
Now,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.510
As you know,

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.640
variables kind of play very important role in any programming language and similarly inter

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.070
form.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.800
We do have support for variables,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.550
and let's look at the different types off variable stars of order here.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.720
Now the types off variables that are supported here are basically strength maps,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.660
lists and billions.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.480
Now these are like common types that you find in any programming languages.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.260
And let's look at the syntax off,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.040
how to use these variables and,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.060
like how toe kind of use.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.970
I mean,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.580
how do declare these variables and also how to consume these variables?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.080
So let's look at the 1st 1 which is the strengths Now.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.180
Strength is kind off a commonly used variable because you can declare stuff like,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.850
Oh,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.950
you're name off the specific resource,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.210
our name off vpc or idea of VPC or or anything anything that relates to your infrastructure

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.210
.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.540
You can declare it as a string,

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.080
and then you can consume it.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.350
A zey.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.230
You can continue it as a variable within within any terra form blocks that you would like

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.250
to oh,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.160
create our utilize.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.100
So let's go ahead and write some court and test it out to see whether that works out or not

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.100
.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.300
So I'm going to open up my same file,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.390
which worse,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420
which was used earlier in the years.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.050
Example.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.890
Which is my hello world rtf now within this hello world rtf.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.230
What I'm going to do is I'm going toe type in the court that we see on the street on the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.550
screen.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.100
So let's declare some strength.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.520
Now I'm going toe commenting that Is this a string available?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.260
Okay,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.130
now to declare a variable that this it is really simple.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.840
All you got to say,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.510
it's like I'm declaring a variable.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.380
It's variable and followed by a key.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.400
So KIIS,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.480
like the name off the variable with which you would be suffering within your uniform script

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.480
.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.350
Now I can say my first strength,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.070
and I should open a curly brace.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.350
Close curly brace inside that you have to declare the type type is strength.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.130
Now,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.140
if you don't specify a type and if you just specify the default value,

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.160
it will automatically assume that it is a strength.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.650
If it is a string and kind off in a kind of flick,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.640
self evaluates to a string,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.750
but it is always a good practice toe.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.280
Specify what type of variable it is.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.630
Eso Well,

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.830
we're gonna say type equal to string.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.700
And inside this we're going to say default equal to and one of the value that you want to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.450
give saying that this is my first strength.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.920
So that's how you declare strength now how to consume mystery.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.490
So let's talk about I'm just going to put in the output variable here.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.290
Ah,

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.700
my first output.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.520
I'm going to explain you when and why We need output variables in the next lesson.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.350
But for now,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.780
just,

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.450
uh,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.150
just look at it as like,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.460
Okay,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.560
this is how you're going.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.200
Toe output.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.230
Uh,

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.030
I'm going to explain why and when we'll be using the output variables,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.390
so just ignore it for this lesson.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.680
So I'm just going to say value equal to now.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.690
Here's the important part.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.420
So this is the reason why I'm using here.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.270
I'm showing you how to consume this particular variable within any block,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.350
so I'm just condemning it here in output so that I can show you the output that that's

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.560
strangers consumed.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.340
So do use any very well.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.210
You need to open double coats inside that you need to specify dollar open calibrates close

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.900
calibration.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.190
And inside this,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.430
you're going to save our dart first string.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.930
Now you're saying,

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.150
OK,

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.000
I want the value off variable off for strength.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.390
So that's what you declared here.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.420
Now hit.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.040
Save.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.130
Now go back to your power shadow and inside your power shell.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.050
What you're going to do is you're going to again do terra form plan.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.270
Okay,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.960
The event added anything to the infrastructure.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.410
So it saying it's up to date.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.610
But let's just apply their form.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.380
Apply now.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.270
Once you apply,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.190
you should see the output variables getting printed.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.520
If you see here in my output variable,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.870
you should see my first output.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.100
Music will do.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.940
This is my first strength.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.150
So that's what you have declared here.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.970
So that's how you declare a string and consume it.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.710
Now there must.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.960
There are certain cases where you will need my feline strings to kind of input your

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.820
variables in tow.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.990
Let's say use the data scripts for easy to R s awesome commands are.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.370
It could be any use case.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.730
I mean,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.580
stuff like uploading eyes,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.550
a document to your s tree by customizing that that string within the Terra form script

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.940
there can be any use case.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.740
So that's why they also support multi line strings.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.950
So the value declare Moneyline strings would be Let me just copy this variable here,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.100
and,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.780
uh,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.580
you can say model B lying spring inside this,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.990
you're still going to be calling it the type of string.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.120
And instead,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.740
off this open coats,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:05.340
you're going to say of your edge and here you're going to say,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.960
this is a month.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.610
This is a marty line thing.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.720
New line.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.770
I'm just making up things here,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.980
and you have to end it with us again.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.760
So it starts with,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:29.090
ah to left out of rackets and then you etch and then the content that you want to put into

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.450
that string and ended with again you etch and let's output this variable and see.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.490
So I'm just going to copy this outward variable.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.580
And I had it here.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:55.420
I'm going to say my multi lying output and I'm going to say multi lying strength right now

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.880
if I go back and do tear off form fine again.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.130
There should be no changes,

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.450
and I'm just going to apply.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.850
And you should see that.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.500
Okay,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.920
my multi line output.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.090
This is a multi lion string new line.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.970
So it's all printing out nicely,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:22.180
and we have now used strings Moneyline strings and also we have up output it those

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.810
variables.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.170
I mean,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.240
we have consumed those variables within the terra form,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.410
so that's how you use the strength.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.700
Now,

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:35.470
let's go ahead and look at this some other type of variables and see how it's going to be

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.910
used.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.450
Now let's start with the maps now.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.120
Maps is typically used for key value pairs.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.490
Let's say,

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:49.730
if you have variable that's holding multiple keys and multiple values and,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:50.450
um,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.580
you kind off need them all grouped together in a one variable.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.120
That's when you use the maps.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.010
The good example for this would be,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.880
let's say,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:05.250
if your family or with AWS and you should be family with regions and a mice.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:05.920
Okay,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.070
so let's say you have a set off am I that you've created in each different region and you

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:18.660
want a one terra form to be used and you want to specify a different Am I when you're

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.960
running in a different region,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.770
right?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.810
So So in that case,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.070
what you could do is basically you can create a map variable.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.610
Ah,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.560
and you can say if I if I'm saying,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.680
if I'm if I want us East,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.040
I want this Pacific,

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:33.470
Am I?

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.940
And if I say us rest,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.190
I want this specific.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.650
Am I?

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.900
So that's one off the use case that you can use maps for and there are many other use cases

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:41.900
.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.060
We're going to use it in the coming examples.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.390
When we're actually working with the infrastructure we can.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.050
I'll be showing you many different examples how to use maps and,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.330
like,

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.310
very fits properly.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.560
So for this example,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.830
we're going toe,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.900
create the same court and let's see how it's going to work out.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.800
Now.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.530
Here what?

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:03.420
I'm going to do this.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:11.420
I'm going to say this is my maps example and here we're going to say again,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.420
variable and we can say map example.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.450
And inside this,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.540
we're going to say type equal to map.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.190
Now again,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.520
if you are declaring a map here and if you don't specify type equal to map.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.740
It's still going toe.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.990
Read it as map if you are formatted it properly,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.240
But it is the best practice toe declared the type of variable that you are declaring here.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:42.870
So here we're going to say the fall equal to and here we have to open a open and close the

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.440
curly brace.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.240
And inside that you gain against,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.750
say,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.950
the you can specify the key values.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.000
So I'm saying,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.470
am I wand you vest?

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.800
Am I too?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.620
Right.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:04.490
So this is how you have declared the air mice and I mean the map and the way you're going

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.070
toe output,

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.650
this output map output.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.800
And here,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.410
inside this,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.550
we're going to say,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.500
uh,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.030
value equals We're going to say again,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.880
we have to open dollar could open curly brace,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.220
close,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.080
cuddly brace.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.040
And inside this,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.500
we're going to save our dart map example right.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:37.050
And here you have to refer to the specific key by opening and closing square bracket.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:43.100
And inside that you have tose specified in double court saying us east or if you you vest,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.230
whatever the value that you want to use.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.880
Now,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.200
if I save this and run my terror farm saying form plan again.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.600
There's no infrastructure change from a play.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.450
Now you should see Ah,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:04.020
my map output equal to am I want right,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.380
So that's the map output,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.060
and we got out with us A my one.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.400
So that's how you use them available.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:10.550
Now,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.590
if you want to use the other map,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.090
I mean,

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.420
other key.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.280
You can just say you rest,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.930
and if you see you apply,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.440
you should see my about critical do.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:21.910
Am I,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.240
too?

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.770
Because now you're using the second key here.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.350
So that's how basically maps are used.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.380
And,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.960
ah,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.610
like I said,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.180
I'm going to show you many different applications off this map in the coming lessons.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.490
Ah,

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.990
and that's it for this map.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.090
So now let's go ahead and see another valuable type.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.320
It is our lists.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.110
Now.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.550
Lists are basically a race,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.210
and,

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.950
uh,

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.790
there is no special interaction that's required for her.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:59.530
Why and went to user is there are many use cases where arrays are used,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.920
so let's go ahead and look at how to use the array Now are a or the list,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.630
whatever you call it.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:11.140
So this is a race or lists OK,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.990
And in this,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.900
we're going to say variable.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.250
Uh,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.620
my aim.

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:19.410
I know.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.970
Let's call it my security group list.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.160
No,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.480
the way you can use list is basically,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.320
you can say our type equal to list again.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.290
And inside this,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.810
you can say default equal to you have to specify open square bracket.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.790
And within this,

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:48.340
you can say security group one security group to security group three so on and so forth.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.350
And you can use this as output.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:58.990
You can say security group output,

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:04.660
and inside this you can say value equal to again.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.300
You have toe open up early for dollar open.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:07.940
Cuddly brace,

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.920
close curly brace.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.850
And within this,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.250
all you got to say is my security group list off.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.090
You have to specify the index off a specific element.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.690
If you want to choose a specific element from within the list now,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.070
you can just say save it.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.990
Clear this out.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:35.380
There a form planned Teoh form planned,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.130
huh?

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.380
Oh,

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:39.580
yeah,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.020
My bad.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.590
So I have toe do this.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:48.500
I thought my security group because I'm refering to a variable and I forgot to put wire

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:48.940
there.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.150
That's why it kind of complained that we clear the screen,

00:13:53.150 --> 00:14:02.580
so I'm going to run again to the farm planned and no changes again from apply.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.440
Now,

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.370
if you see,

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:10.560
you should have an output variable saying SG output equal to SG one.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.840
So that's what we're refering to SG one here.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.460
Now,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.640
in some cases,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.680
you need toe like you might need to apply all the security groups.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.310
Let's say if you are multiple security groups and you want to assign all those secondary

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.100
groups to your easy to incentives you're creating In that case,

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.470
you can just say Okay,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.850
I want everything from this list.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.140
So how do you do that?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:37.320
So you just don't need to specify this particular index in the square brackets.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.870
You can just leave it like that and it should work.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:47.160
Now if you see as the output is in a day off S C one and C two industries three.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.410
So that's how you basically used the lists,

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.290
and that's how you're going toe output them or consume them.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.400
So that's about it for the less.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.550
And let's go ahead and take a look at the other um,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.410
variable type,

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.820
which is billions now.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.220
Brilliance is also one of the most commonly used,

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:15.370
most commonly used data type.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.040
And,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:16.660
ah,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.120
we're going to check out check it out.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.560
How to use it now for bullion.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.730
You don't need to specify the type.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.500
It's going to figure it out based on value,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.050
true or false Now.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.420
Also,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.850
there's two ways off declaring it so you can say variable,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:31.990
uh,

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.070
test bull,

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:39.650
and you can say it as default equal to weaken.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.810
You can declare it as a string,

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.650
or you can declare it just like true.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.780
Now,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.640
if you declare it as a string,

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:54.140
it will also treat it as a bull when it is applied to a appropriate available.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.030
Let's say you have a bull flag expecting I mean,

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.810
you have a bull variable expected in a terra form,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.750
um,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:07.180
in it a form block and you're supplying a string off bull,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:07.730
which is like,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.420
true in the din,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.250
a double courts.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.790
It's going to still treat it as a bull if you specify it without the strings.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.020
It's also going t o treated as a bull,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.720
so it really doesn't matter.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.730
But if you look up the documentation for terra form,

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.840
it's going to specify,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.680
saying that it's going to tell Tell you that there is some version incompatible t so you

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.800
can choose either ways.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.830
Um,

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.730
I would prefer to just say true instead off having it in a double court.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.620
So it's up to you whether to use it in a double court or not.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.000
So I'm just going to say Default equal to true.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.270
And if you output this,

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.100
let's say output,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.170
uh,

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.850
full output.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.600
And again,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.350
I'm going to say Value quarter to dollar open,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.630
close and inside this where I thought the school.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.120
Now,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.310
if I are put this,

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.900
I will not get true or false in a string.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.630
I'll just get zero or one.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.380
So that's how the bulls are represented.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:21.770
And let's open up or tell a power shell clear off it and run the command again.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:27.270
Terra form plan and applies to form a play.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:33.780
Now you should see your pull out for this one because it's true now.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.990
If I set it to false save it and run terra form,

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.770
apply again.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.520
You should see my bull output equal to zero.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.390
So that's how the billions are used in telephone,

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:54.350
and that's pretty much it about the variables and I'm going toe talk to you about more

00:17:54.350 --> 00:18:01.780
about thes variables as and when they come up in the in the examples that we're doing and

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.560
that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.450
And it's been a really long lesson,

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:14.220
and I really hope you got to learn all about the variables in terra form and I will see in

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:14.810
the next one.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:15.660
Thank you for watching.
