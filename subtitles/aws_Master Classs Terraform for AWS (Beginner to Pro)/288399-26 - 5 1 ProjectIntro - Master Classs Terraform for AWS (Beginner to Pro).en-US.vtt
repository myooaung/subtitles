00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.400
And this is going to be a really exciting lesson because we're going to discuss about the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.410
AWS project that we're going to build using the Terra form.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.500
And you're going to apply all the concepts that we have learned so far in the course.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.680
And we're going to see how toe create a production grade infrastructure with multiple

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.770
environments using the terra form.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.260
So in this lesson,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.460
I'm just going to give you a walk through off,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.640
like what are different components that will be creating using terra form and how the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
sample infrastructure is going to look like and the architecture diagram offered.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.110
So first thing that we're going to do is basically we're going to use a default BPC,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.350
which will be created in by default in every AWS region.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.340
If you have an AWS account,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.610
every region has a default vpc and before sub nets created for you.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.550
So you don't have to worry about creating the new network set up and so on and so forth.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.210
If you re introduce so you can actually go ahead and do it shouldn't be ah really difficult

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.210
.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.950
If you want more information about how you can provision in a production level

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.770
infrastructure,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.910
I have another course.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.120
You can go and check out in my courses where you'll find,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.620
like setting up production infrastructure in AWS.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.950
And I've also put in the a lot of terra form material there in that course as well.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.030
So for this project,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.960
what we're going to do is we're going to use.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.570
Like I said,

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.670
we're going to use the default VPC and default subjects which are already created and the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.010
route tables and everything.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.160
So we're not going to do a lot of network set up.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.070
The only thing that we're doing in the network part is basically creating the security

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.460
groups.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.260
We're going to create two security groups.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.870
One is for the load balancer,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.640
and one is for the easy to instance,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.670
that the example application will be running.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.700
So that's one thing.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.490
The second thing is,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.710
we're going to create an application load balancer,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.300
and we're going to create one target group and a listener associated with it.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.190
When,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.320
when we go to that sectional all kind off like expand on like what are the subcontinent's

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.280
are required in that particular model,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.480
so you don't need to worry about it.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.870
And the third thing that we're going toe create is the launch conflict with user later.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.720
So basically,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.220
this user data is toe,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.060
um,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.380
specify what commands it needs to run on the boot time and the launch configures basically

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.710
a platform where you'll create the configuration and give it to the orders killing group,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.050
which will be creating in the next step.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.890
In order,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.070
Scaling Group will actually use this launch configures template off like what the artist

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.160
killing group needs to launch and all the properties like which instance with am I and so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
on and so forth are actually supplied in the launch conflict.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.920
And we'll be using that with the Auto Scaling Group.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.360
And once we have this entire set up completed in one environment will boot up the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.410
production environment.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.660
I mean,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.300
we're we're going to create two environments.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.900
One is staging and one this production.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.240
And when we create the staging environment,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.490
we're goingto do step by step,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.120
step by step,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.780
step by step.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.910
And at the end,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.110
what we're going to do is like just run the same infrastructure for a new production

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.200
environment and we're going to see how it is managed.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.540
So here is the reference architecture that we're going to use for this project.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.870
So this is how it's going to look like when everything is created like a sad we're not

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.010
going to create the default.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.580
Vpc I mean the VPC in the network part because the default VPC is already created in every

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.870
AWS account and in every region,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800
and the default cabinets are also created for us.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.700
So for the purpose off this project we're going to use Ah,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.010
I mean,

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.350
I'm going to use the Oregon region.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.490
You can your Frito oh,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.810
use any region that you would like to use,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.740
So that's pretty much about the architecture.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.500
So let's get started.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.450
So I'm really excited toe complete this AWS project because this will give you a complete

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.570
exposure off how you can handle a complex infrastructure and how you can model arise your

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.260
infrastructure into different,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.240
more deals in terra form and how you can a manager ah,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.520
project easily end in the effective eight and in a maintainable way.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.070
So I will see you in the next one.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.350
Thank you so much for watching
