00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.390
hello and welcome back to hash tag learning courses.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.480
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.540
we're goingto take a look at all the requirements for this course and ah,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.350
let's get started.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.750
So the first thing that we need is,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.170
of course,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.180
we need our terra form software to be installed.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
And once we have to reform software installed,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.650
we need a AWS account.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.330
I mean,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.600
like,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.250
we're basically in this course we're covering a lot off AWS things and are kind off.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.720
Do the examples that I'm showing you here you would need an AWS account and you need to set

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.260
up AWS credentials by creating a user.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.130
And you need to set those credentials in your local system and,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.680
uh,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.550
um,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.260
for editing the court itself.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560
You need a coordinator.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.270
It could be a visual studio.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.990
Or it could be nor pad plus place are it could be a sublime words.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.160
Sublime editor.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.490
That's that's up to you.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.610
Whatever the corner there,

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.590
you want to use it.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.330
It's fine.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.790
And then last,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.220
but not the least you need in the west off your choice,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.530
Which is which could be Mac Windows,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.020
Lennox,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.810
wherever the system that you choose to so that's pretty much about it.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.250
And in the next lessons,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.020
we're going to go ahead and,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.450
uh,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.970
install or the required software and,

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.550
uh,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.770
make our system ready so that we can go ahead and do some cool stuff using the terra form.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.690
That's it for less this lesson.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.880
Thank you for watching and Elsie in the next one.
