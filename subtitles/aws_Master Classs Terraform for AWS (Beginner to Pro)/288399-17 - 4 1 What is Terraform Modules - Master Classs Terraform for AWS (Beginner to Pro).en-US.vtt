00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700
hello and welcome back to under the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.780
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.680
let's look at what terra form module ter and why we need the models.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.860
So let's get started.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.470
So the first thing that comes to my mind when when we say model is basically separation off

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.150
constants.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.700
Right?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.570
So when you have a big infrastructure that you want a provision through terra form,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.150
you would like toa basically separate it out into smaller segments so that it is easy to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.720
manage.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.030
And also you can construct ah,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.270
reusable,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.210
competent so that you don't have toe repeat the same court again and again and instead use

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.210
,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.000
um,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.200
a module so that you can reuse that with in your main terra form and reduce the court that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.900
you are writing to achieve the same task.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.350
So to give you an example,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.910
let's say you are big infrastructure has ah,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.120
a load balancer that needs to be configured,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.490
right?

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.090
So if you want a load balancer Toby configured four times,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.580
right.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.340
So if you have a set of work lower,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.590
which needs four different lord balances,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.020
you don't want to write like the same Lord balance or logic Four different times inside

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.530
what you're do ist you separate it out as a module and you give its own input variables.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.380
And you'd say from outside that Okay,

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.040
I need this more deal with so and so input and this morning with so into input and you're

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.750
just used that particular model now I'm just giving a small example.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.410
In your case,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.670
it might be they set off in frustration.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.900
Chur,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.730
where you have a load balancer,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.440
you have an order scaling group and they cloudwatch alarm.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.710
Let's say you separate that all out into a model and you can reuse that whole competent in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.350
a other terra form by just calling it and supplying it with the required variables.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.160
Then you're have a smaller chord,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.190
which is easy to manage.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.370
And if you want to change something,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.830
you don't have to change many different places.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.220
You'll just change at one place,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.520
and that would basically change in all the places wherever the particular model is being

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.890
used.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.000
So that is why we need models.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.350
And it is really important to understand this concept so that it becomes very easy for you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.910
to manage your infrastructure and it is a right way to handle infrastructure.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.260
So I will stop this lesson here.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.980
And in this in the next lesson,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.000
we're going to go ahead and see how to create this more deals and how to import a specific

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970
model into another telephone file.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.390
So I'll see you there.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.280
Thank you for watching.
