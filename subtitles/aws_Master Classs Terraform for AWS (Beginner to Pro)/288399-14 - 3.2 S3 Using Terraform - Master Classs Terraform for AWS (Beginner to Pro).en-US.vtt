00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.730
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hashtag landing courses.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.790
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.430
we're going to create industry bucket and upload a test file using the Terra Form script.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.290
Now,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.690
before getting started,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.000
I want to show you how to use terra form documentation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.680
You're toe kind of figure out like what resources do any to choose and like what?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.600
Ah,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.470
input video was that I need to supply.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.970
And,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.180
uh what what are the required variables and what are the optional stuff that I can use to

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.760
configure?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.320
So to get started,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.060
let's go to the website.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.250
There are formed out i o.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.680
Now here we are,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.050
basically trying toe go ahead and create industry bucket.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.150
So let's go and see how toe find that s t bucket resource documentation.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.150
No.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.640
So find documentation.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.550
All you have to do is go to the dark section here and you need to choose the provider now,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.030
Like I said in the introductory lesson,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.080
saying that their farm is supported by many different providers,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.390
you can find all those providers here.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.220
The one which we are interested in here is basically aws.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.870
Now,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.180
inside this aws,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.240
we are there Are there two types of things.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.560
There are data resource.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.160
There are data sources and there are resources.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.630
So we're not looking for the data sources here.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.970
Data sources is like when you create a specific resource.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.810
What type off output information that specific resource is going to provide.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.060
That is not what we're looking for.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.060
We're looking first.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.520
The AWS resource is itself.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.650
So I'm going to search for A S three.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.960
Now,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.550
if you search for s three,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.950
this is a data resource.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.510
You can see your so as three resource is.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.960
So this is what we're looking for and we want to create the bucket.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.980
So click on that and you should see that AWS s three bucket is the resource name.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.810
And so you'll specify resource whatever the resource name is AWS s T bucket And whatever

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.290
the while uh um reference name that you want to give within your terra form script so that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.450
you can refer to it s so this is like a variable name.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.040
So you can specify whatever you want here and inside that it is expecting a bucket.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.970
Uh,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.690
bucket is the bucket name that you want to create and,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.340
um,

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.360
what is the issue?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.040
L which is like,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.870
who wants toe access that by default it would be private,

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.730
and,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.330
uh,

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.250
your you can specify some off the tags here.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.010
Now,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.950
if you want toe,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.850
create a static website hosting these all the parameters that it is expecting.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.630
And if you want to utilize cars so that you can specify cars rules and these are all the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.550
examples that he the documentation is showing.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.580
But if you want toe,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.010
see,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.540
what are all the supported arguments you can scroll more down and you can see argument

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.050
reference.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.800
You can see what other option is values for the required values and all those things.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.980
You can see which region it is asking you to create.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.650
And those are Those are all the different properties that you can specify now,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.230
for over example,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.410
we're just going to go ahead and create a nest Reebok it in Ireland region.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.730
So let's see how to do it.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.590
So I'm just going to minimize this.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.280
I'm opening my power show in my course folder.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.000
What?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.850
I Lewis,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:41.960
I'll create a new to the form folder which is going to be s three bucket right inside That

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.560
s t bucket or I have to do is create a new terra form file,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.480
which I'm going to say Main don t f All right,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.410
So my main Dr Jeff has created.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.060
Now I'm going to edit it with my,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.950
um very my sublime.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.350
Let me open Sublime first.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.690
Okay,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.270
this is our previous file.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.940
It's open file,

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.610
Mr Bucket.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.370
Okay,

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.250
so my main dot t afis ah opened.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.880
And I want to copy the same stuff that we have used in the previous lesson.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.200
That is are you have to specify our provider.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.290
So I'm going to use the same provider here,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.650
were specified the region,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.950
and,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.690
uh,

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.400
let's go ahead and create our first s three bucket using this particular telephone file.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.310
So to do that Ah,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.550
we can see that we need resource AWS history Bucket,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.970
right?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.010
We can just replicate what it what is here?

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.400
If we can say resource if to give the what type of resource you want to create and you are

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.830
to give it a name so I'll say my bucket and open close inside this you're saying bucket

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.080
mimic will do my bucket,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.080
uh,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.420
underscores are not separated.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:17.750
Say the of course and you'll say today's date 10 11 18.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.420
And this is just to make sure that we're not creating something which is already existing,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.450
because S three doesn't allow in duplicate name.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.690
So I'm just making up some random name for you.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.030
It might be a meaningful name,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.650
so I'm just leaving it like that.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.360
We just need a private one.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.350
We can also specify the region.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.720
We've already specified the region.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.960
Here you est one.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.530
We don't need to specify a region,

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.490
but still,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.370
if you want,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.250
you can omit this part and you can specify the region here individually to different

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.770
resources.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.160
So I'm going to specify a region here to say,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.310
uh,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.450
you rest one.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.010
And,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.670
uh,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.440
I just give it a name inside the tax,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.590
you can say name equal.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.250
Do what is a tag name of this college name.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.170
And I say,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:18.480
uh oh,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.820
no.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.350
So inside tax,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.160
you can say bag that name intact value,

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.750
so I can say name.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.670
I could just call it let's call it.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.640
And while meant death,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.250
right?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.790
I just want to give one pack for now and let's see if there's anything interesting that

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.450
weaken supply more here.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:52.510
So bucket bucket prefix A C l policy tags force destroyed.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.650
Website Carcelle Worsening logging.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.220
Uh,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.280
I think that's pretty much how I don't want a war complicate this particular part.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.360
I would just go with the basic,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.980
uh,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.310
S T bucket creation.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.100
So now,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.560
now that we have this,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.270
we can go ahead and create the bucket.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.170
So the way we'll create iss,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:22.090
basically go to the folder s three bucket and inside this will do terra form plan.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.660
Okay,

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.640
Something went wrong.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.420
So what did I save?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.210
Whenever you're creating a new terror farm file,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.750
always remember to initialize the file.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.810
So I'm clearing this and doing terra form in it.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.630
Now,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.090
once you do initialize,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.590
it will download the required rate of reassessed Ikea.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.340
And once you have the rate of recess decay and plug ins ready,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.590
you're good to go and run detail,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.180
form plan.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.380
So let's wait until the plug installer it for us.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.330
All right.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.310
So the terra form has been initialized,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.250
and you can see that it has completed the downloading off.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.080
All the required pregnancies is our aws plug in.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.050
I'm going to clear this part and run the the command to reform plan.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:14.380
Now you should see that we are creating one resource of it is our aws s three bucket and it

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.260
is going toe.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.330
Choose the less private we're going to give the name as my bucket bastard.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:26.250
A form course dash to the state and we have supplied the region and that's pretty much it

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.000
now,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.540
toe.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:27.840
Oh,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.770
actually create.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.510
Basically.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.110
Like I said,

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.720
plan is just going to tell us what we're going to create.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:39.140
But when you from the commander of from apply that's actually venue create e specific

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.630
resource?

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.140
No,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.650
let me clear it from here.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.890
So instead,

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.750
a form apply.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.250
And once you apply it,

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.790
you should see that it will ask you for a confirmation that yes,

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.680
you want to create,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.710
so it will only take yes as the accepted value.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.600
So let me supply Yes and hit.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.120
Enter and you should see that it is creating my AWS s three bucket.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.320
And once that gets created,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.700
I'll open up the AWS console to verify that our bucket has been created.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.470
So it's going to take a bit off time.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.800
Okay,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.350
Now you can see that it has completed.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.230
Creating that resource apply complete one resource has been added.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:24.300
And now,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.640
if you Ah,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.600
if you're curious,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.110
you can go to your,

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.010
uh,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:35.490
history Bucket folder here and you can see in the terra form Doctor of State.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.380
You can see that that it's one resource which has been added,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:45.140
and this is the information or the meta data that that is associated with that particular

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.660
resource.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.210
Now,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.560
when you do change us,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.650
toe this particular the source in the telephone file.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.160
And when you run telephone planned,

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:59.040
the Terra form script will actually find the differential between you,

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.750
the meta data that is in terra formed RT of state and the actual infrastructure itself and

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.630
does a compare.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.190
And if it finds any difference,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.730
then it will prompt you saying that.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.050
Okay,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:13.000
this is the stuff that you need to create all that that is being updated or that is being

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.500
destroyed.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.980
So that's how it is going to work.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:21.630
So let's go back to our AWS console and ah goto our history section and see if our bucket

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.890
has been created or not.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.140
So if you go double AWS console,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.060
I'm going to go to the history here and inside s three.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.950
Now I'll have to search for the bucket,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.650
which is have so many buckets here.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.930
Uh,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.260
you can see.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.690
What would we name here?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.570
So what did we name here?

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.780
My bucket DF right.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.130
So let's look for the my Okay,

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.830
so now you can see here it has been my bucket e.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.890
Of course you go here,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:56.750
my bucket e.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.360
Of course,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.270
you can see that it is not public because we have set the access control list as private.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.570
That's why it's not public.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.440
And your bucket is created and ready.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.200
Okay,

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.310
so now you have your bucket ready.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.550
Now,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:19.120
let's go ahead and see how you can create a Plourde and upload a test file toe this

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.680
particular,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.650
um,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.580
s T bucket.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.360
So in this,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.280
what I'm going to do is now again,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:31.350
go back to my terra form documentation and I'm going to search for Astri.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.050
Uh,

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.380
well,

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.310
let's go all the way down,

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:43.860
and here we want to upload an object to it.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.350
So I'm going to use Aws s three bucket object,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:54.010
and you can see the sort of the argument reference when you school all the way down.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.030
I'm just going toe Use this particular example.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.940
I'm saying I need a resource,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.000
which is a double SST pocket object.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.290
And I'm just giving toe,

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:09.050
give it a reference name and I'm going to supply the bucket name and we're using the key.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.110
We're supplying the key name that we want to use,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:20.020
and we're going to give a part to this particular source file and we can create e tag,

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:24.190
which will check for the I mean,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:30.530
e tag will basically the way compute on your on your data off your file,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.730
and then it's going to come in for the attack.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.920
And whenever you have some changes in that,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.040
your tag will be different.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.180
And that's how it's going to compare and see whether a new resource has to be applauded are

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:44.780
it?

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.350
Just has to ignore whenever you're running the telephone,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.560
So let's go ahead and check it out.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.260
So I'm just going to copy this entire block here.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.050
I'm going to paste it here Now.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.460
What are the things that you need?

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.560
We need to give it a name,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:57.840
right?

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.140
So I'm saying my first object in the bucket.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.890
So here's an interesting application that we have learned in the previous introduction.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.750
So the way you're going to reference I mean,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.120
we already have created the bucket here,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.540
right?

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.370
And we don't want toe hardcore our bucket name here instead.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.790
What?

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:26.280
I'm going to show you It's like we're going to reference this particular pockets name from

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.370
this particular resource.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:31.570
So I'm going to say dollar open,

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:39.150
close flower rackets inside that I'm going to say aws underscore s three underscore bucket

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.160
dark name.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.310
Now,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.150
how do I know that it is going to support this name?

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.750
We can go to the data sources now and we can search for AWS.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.300
Ah,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:58.150
search for AWS s three bucket.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.950
If open this in new tab,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.150
you should see Ah,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.840
one of the data that it is going to output.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.450
Okay,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.510
so it is going toe output the name off the bucket as idea.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.960
So I'm wrong here.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.390
We don't need to wait.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.300
Don't We should not supply name.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.720
We should supply the i d here and the object.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.950
He I want to give it as like test file,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.100
Doc Txt and back to the fight.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.240
Now we have to create a file,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.530
right?

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.250
So to create a file.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.570
I'm going back to my folder Street bucket,

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.460
and you can say inside the scores,

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:47.750
I am going to create a new just ah,

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.770
fires inside this,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.910
I'll create a new text document,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:59.950
which is going to be sample object text inside that highly guest.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.450
This is a test.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.290
In your case,

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.100
it could be aerial object.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:12.900
So now how do I reference to this particular fight?

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.370
Right.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:23.150
So all we have to do is say we want to go up one folder because we were in the s three

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.100
bucket folder.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:28.850
So we have come toe one up and we're going to go to the test files.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:34.160
So inside this we have test files and inside test files.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.260
We have sample object,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:42.950
doc txt So you can say sample object dot txt.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.550
Now we're going toe supply the same thing in sight.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:16:02.650
So this and now let's run this thing and see if it actually uploads this particular object

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.630
into history or not.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.790
So to do that,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.620
I'm just going back to my,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.350
uh,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.800
we're going back to our terra form,

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:23.060
going back to our partial and inside this I'm going to clear off this and say to our farm

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.750
planned now,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.630
If you have done everything right,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.050
we should not see a ah s three bucket resource being created.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.290
Resurge F C A s three object being uploaded.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:41.260
Now if I ah i d must be teapots.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.990
Type Name?

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.960
Attribute.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.970
Okay.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.440
What did we do wrong here?

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.650
So we have to give our dot,

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:59.810
Okay?

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:05.960
It's not of our So let me go back to this.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.040
Oh,

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.710
actually,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:11.420
this data,

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:11.870
right?

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:19.060
So it's going to be data about aws astri now if we do telephone plan Oh.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.120
Oh,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:23.590
Okay.

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.870
Okay,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.040
Okay.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.420
Okay.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.240
I know what we're doing wrong here.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.620
So it's actually a process three.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.640
We didn't specify which s three bucket.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.950
Right?

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:38.280
So we have to reference our pocket reference name that we have created here,

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.260
which is my bucket.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:44.360
So we have to do a double s s three bucket dart my bucket dot i d.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:44.790
Now,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.350
if I go and run terra form plan,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.550
it should work.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.500
All right,

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.130
So it is refreshing the state and it is basically checking.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.780
Do we need to create a new bucket or not?

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.690
And if you see,

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.570
it's not asking us to create a new bucket.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.540
It is just saying that.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.050
Okay,

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.080
we're uploading our first object here,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.650
and,

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.280
uh and there's nothing to change and nothing to destroy.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.130
So now we'll clear this will go terra form apply.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:25.440
It's getting going to refresh the state and verify if everything's okay,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.990
and then it is going to ask us for a confirmation.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.560
OK,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.140
so it'll asking for the confirmation.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.090
So I'm going to say yes because I want to create that history,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.920
object and hit.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.550
Enter.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.250
And once you do that,

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:43.390
you can see that you are resources is applied and you have one addicts.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.780
It'll change and zero destroyed.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.500
Now,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.050
if you go back to your s three,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.710
uh,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.600
console and do a quick refresh,

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.520
you should see a new object,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.290
which is test file that you have uploaded using the terra form.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.280
Now,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.650
that's how you're going to upload now.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:08.730
Next thing that we're going to do is like how to modify specific resource now to modify

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.590
specific resource.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.020
Like I said in the in,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.160
the when we're creating,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.310
it's going to check the attack right now.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.830
If we go ahead and say in my test file,

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.400
if I right,

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.980
if I say this is a test file now have modified the texts.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:29.570
Right now,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.340
the uniform should detect that There is a change in my file,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.600
and there's a change that needs to be applied to the infrastructure.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.720
Let's see if that picks it up or not.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.660
So I didn't change anything in my terra form.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.900
It's all the same.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.180
All I did was like change the sample object dot txt file.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.820
Now I'm going to do a telephone plan again.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.820
Now you should see that there is a difference.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.870
And it needs to create a new object because the old object is different from the new object

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.870
.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.260
Because the new eat ag value is different from the old object,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.110
so you can see that the e tag has been changed,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.010
so it will have to update that file,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.130
so you have to do their form apply.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:12.260
You can see that there is one thing to change.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:12.570
Instead,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.840
off zero to change,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.410
want wet.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:24.720
So we are changing just one file their and let's apply once it's applied,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.370
just hit yes,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:32.130
and you can see that the resource has been applied and it is if you go here,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.050
you should see the last modified date being changed.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.080
Ah,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.800
last modified was 10 39.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:38.980
Now,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.000
if I refresh,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.240
you should see 10.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.910
41.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.810
So it's the latest file that we have uploaded.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:49.880
Ah,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.190
the changed version without changing anything in the terra form file,

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.420
it automatically picked up the changes in the test file,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.160
and it uploaded a new object.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.010
Okay,

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:03.440
so now we have created RST bucket.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.700
We have created our new object.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.070
Now let's go ahead and tail down or infrastructure no tail down,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.180
meaning like we're going to destroy all the resources that we have created.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.740
We should be very careful when you're running this command because this is going to take

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.370
down everything.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:22.860
So let's clear out from here and let's try to reform,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.380
destroy,

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.260
and you do terra form destroy.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.890
It's refreshing this state,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.460
and it's going to give you a list off all the resources that it's destroying.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.150
So if you see it is destroying to resources,

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.430
which is your history bucket and your object.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.280
Now if you supply yes,

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.400
it's going to go ahead and take down those things now.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.260
Yes.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.230
Okay,

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.130
so let's try complete to resources were destroyed.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.620
Now,

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.580
if you go back to your AWS console.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.390
And if you refresh,

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.050
it should say that there is no bucket.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:03.060
They are not fun because the bucket we have created billeted and here you should see that

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.980
there is no refresh desk that should go away.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.120
Okay,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.290
this is an old bucket.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.550
There's no my bucket here.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:17.280
Which means that we have Billy successfully deleted the resource,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.710
and that's pretty much it.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:20.480
Uh,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.470
this is a pretty long lesson,

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:29.700
and I really hope you have enjoyed working with the Terra Form to create the AWS resource

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.750
toe,

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.850
modify it updated and actually delete the files.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.580
So that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.080
And I'll see you in the next one.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.330
And if you have any questions,

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.970
you can always being me in the course.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.230
And I will be happy toe respond to all your questions.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.280
Thank you for watching
