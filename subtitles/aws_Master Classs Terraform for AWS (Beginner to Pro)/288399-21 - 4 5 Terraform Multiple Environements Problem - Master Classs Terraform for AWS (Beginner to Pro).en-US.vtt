00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
hello and welcome back toe hashtag landing courses.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.400
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.550
we're going to learn about multiple environments.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.060
Problem now?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.480
What do I mean by multiple environments?

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.960
Problem.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.720
So in any enterprise level infrastructure,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.660
you can see that there are different environments off your infrastructure.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.430
Like let's say you have ah development and where when you have your key way or staging

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.960
environment and then you have a production environment.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.390
Now the key factor here of when you have multiple environment is basically toe.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.790
Have consistency across different environments,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.440
meaning you should have your infrastructure identical across different environments.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.880
Now,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.480
if if it is not identical,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.840
then basically you're not testing against the same infrastructure.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.670
For example,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.610
let's say you have a load balancer configured using a classic load balancer in your dev

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.280
environment,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.190
and you are using an application load balancer in your staging and prod then of what you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.650
are seeing in your death of the results that you're seeing in your dev environment of the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.200
performance metrics that you're seeing in death might not match the performance metrics in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.180
in the queue environment.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.570
I mean,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.380
this is just a hypothetical example,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780
but ah,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.610
like you can also think about the security groups.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.020
Let's say you've created a security group with a port open in your staging,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.650
but then you forgot toe open that particular port in your production environment.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.520
Then,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.280
um,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.940
then you have a problem,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.140
right?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.610
When you test in your staging,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.600
it's going toe work.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.760
But if you promote it toe production,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.180
then it's not going to work because the port is closed.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.310
So toe avoid these kind off situations.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.130
We have toe have our terra form script to be used across different,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.600
very different environments using the same telephone file,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.070
meaning you'll write the cord for your infrastructure.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.540
Saying that I need the security group.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.890
I need her load balance that I need in order.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.510
Skilling Group and all the These are all the properties that I want to apply to it.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.200
But what you're going to do issue are going to give it environment specific inputs and it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.250
is going toe create different resource is based on what environment you are on it,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.760
so this is achieved by using the feature off at a farm called workspaces.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.430
Now,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.450
using workspaces,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:44.150
you can create different work spaces in the same terra form project and you can work on

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.290
specific workspace at a time,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.000
and you should be able to create our modify resources in that particular workspace,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.410
and then,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.400
once you're satisfied,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550
you can apply to the other workspaces.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.980
Now I'll give you an example of how you can use workspaces to solve this multiple

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.950
environment problem.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.330
Now let's say you create three different work spaces for the same terra form file and what

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.660
you will do.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.040
It's like first workspace would be your death,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.720
and you create that workspace.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.870
You apply the your resources,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.520
and then all the sources are provisioned.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.870
Now want to verify that everything is fine,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.940
Then your,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.850
uh,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.210
select your staging workspace and you'll apply your resources there.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.690
And once everything is done,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.960
you'll apply to the prod,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.420
and everything is working fine now and then.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.870
After day.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.430
You want to make a change,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.310
and you want to test it in deaf straight so you'll switch back to your development

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.900
workspace.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.020
You'll make your changes and you will apply it and see that Oh yeah,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.180
this is working fine.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.050
This is the required change that I need,

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.180
and I need to promote this.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.870
Two Q A.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.640
All your free do it's like again change back to the Curia workspace or the staging

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.210
workspace.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.940
Run it.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.060
They're very fired and then promoted to prod.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.640
Now what we have achieved in this process is basically consistency across multiple

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.440
environment,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.170
and there is no doubt that whether we have missed any off these properties and if there's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.060
any mismatch across different environments,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.010
so workspace is a way to go to solve the multiple environments problem.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.250
I'm going to stop this lesson here and in the next lesson,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.040
we're going toe talk more about workspaces and we'll see how it works.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.170
Businesses creator and how the switch between different work spaces and how the terra form

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.400
state files are managed for different workspace environments and so on and so forth.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.210
So I'm really excited to start,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.900
Ah,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.140
this workspace concept because I really enjoy it.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.820
And it is a really useful um um,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.480
piece off information that you can apply in your enterprise level projects are even your

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.380
personal project,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.290
um,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.670
toe manager infrastructure in a more consistent way.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.390
So that's it for this lesson.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.840
I will see in the next four,

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.540
and thank you so much for watching
