00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.150
hello and welcome back to hashtag learning courses.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.200
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.320
we're going to see how toe create shared environment variables,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.710
which can be used across different,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.240
more deals in terra form.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.010
So this concept is basically an extension off what we have done in the previous lesson.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.110
Now we will create environment specific variables,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.910
but we'll also see how we can share these environment specific variables across different

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.700
models.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.250
So let's get started.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.350
So again,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.990
I'm going to use the same project.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.490
So I'm going to open up.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.190
Ah,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.370
this particular foreigner where we have workspaces project and here I'm going to create a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.210
new model.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.790
So this new model will be our share.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.340
Variable smart you'll and you can use this more jewels import this model in different,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.930
um,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.660
different other competent subcontinent off the main project,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.360
and you can share those variables across.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560
So one off the use cases that I can explain to us.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.980
Let's say you have,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.100
um,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.080
a BBC created O.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.370
R.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.180
A.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.850
Um,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.250
trying to think what's the best example?

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.870
Let's say you have set of resource is created vpc security groups and am I ID's.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.660
And,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.430
um,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.140
you want this information to be available in different,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.530
more jewels off your infrastructure.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.900
So how do we create this?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.270
Like,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.950
if we create this in Maine,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.410
local variables,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.750
then you will have to end up,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.660
uh,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.880
passing this from main variables.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.990
Toe the to the specific models,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.960
or you'll have toe.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:54.090
Either Let's say you're you're creating a model which is a part off different projects,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.390
right?

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780
Not just this project and different projects.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.080
And you don't want your main file Toby in putting those variables for you.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.470
So in those cases,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.950
the shared variables concept will help you a lot.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.470
Um,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.180
again,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.050
this is you won't find this information out there.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.470
This is something which I have figured out on my own trying to experiment my in my use

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.910
cases.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.960
And I really think that this will help you guys to kind of organize your project.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.420
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.620
So I'm gonna create a new folder in here and which will be my new model,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.660
which I'll call it a shared underscore wars.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.530
And inside this,

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.640
I'm going to create a new telephone file which is going to be shared underscore war Start

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.330
TF.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.790
Right?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.200
So,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.500
yes,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.730
I want to change this.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.540
Now,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.660
I'm going to go back and open up the,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.470
um,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.640
open up my project for the here.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.340
All right,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.250
so now our shared wars,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.950
um,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.110
module has been created and ready to use.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.670
Now,

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.640
let's go ahead and change your code so that we can create some off the shared bars and use

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.000
it across different models.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.260
So what I'm going to do is ah,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.060
let's use this concept off using this local environment and,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.740
um,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.130
will use the same concept from here.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.880
Right.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.050
So let's copy this part.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.360
Actually,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.710
let's let copy this entire part from here and paste it in here.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.140
Now,

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.490
this local environments terra form workspace will be propagated toe all the model.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.170
So you don't need to worry about it and hear what I'm going to say is,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.720
um,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.180
entered off using the am I I d.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.440
On a school environment?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:59.610
What I'm gonna call this is he see toe instance on the school name environment,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.350
and I'm going to use the same name here and all this the same thing.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.000
And here I'm gonna call this nasty environment.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.250
No,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.340
to make you understand what I'm doing here.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.390
ISS basically we are saying Ah Oh,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.730
no.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.250
We have to kind off and we finish this up so that I can explain what I'm doing here.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.650
So what we are doing here is using the ah,

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.120
no,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.500
actually,

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.960
let me do something else.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.450
So let's Dio because we want toe provide an example where we can leveraged this across

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.660
different models.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.890
Right?

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.550
So what I'm gonna do is environment underscore suffix right?

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:06.710
And we can call the same thing here in 11 suffix underscore environment kind of religion

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.210
and name.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.340
Just take this off.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.850
Here,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.150
take this bucket Here,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:25.540
call this this and we're gonna call it this.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.030
Right?

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.990
So what I'm trying to do is basically created environment suffix which will written back

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.570
saying,

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.370
ah,

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:44.540
staging and staging and tried.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.150
Right.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.670
So let's do this.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.260
And what we're going to do is s O.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.470
This is just like what we have done in the previous example where we have ah,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.630
a local variable which is environment suffix.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.360
When you call this very well,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.050
it is basically doing a look up on the local environment suffix environment map.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.180
And here it is looking for ward over the local environment is so the environment,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.450
this map to that workspace that you are selected.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.800
So if you're on staging,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.900
it's going toe.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.810
Map it with the staging staging map inside that variable,

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.010
and it is going to assign into the environment suffix and hear what we're saying.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.390
It's like we want to output environments affects.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.220
Ah,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.400
and the value that we want to give It is basically the local environment traffic.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.040
So that's how we were exposing this particular environment specific variable to a different

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.430
model,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.970
Right?

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.590
So let's see how we can go ahead and leverage this particular are put variable in other

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:50.200
models.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.960
So I'm going to now go toe the,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.650
um,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.170
easy to models.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.820
I mean,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.350
is it a model and changed a bit off court here?

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.550
So instead off.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:08.940
So instead off importing the EEC to underscore name from here,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:20.330
What we are going to do is basically will important the shed uars module into this

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.260
particular model.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.550
So the way you will do it this using more do and give it a name,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.000
we're going to give the reference name the same name as the model itself,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.340
and we have to give the source the source is Basically you have that shared wars,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.970
Mardell.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.870
Like one step about this.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.840
Ah,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.320
about this folder.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.660
So what we have to do is go dot,

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:43.860
dot,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:44.450
Slash.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.020
And you have to specify the name off the model which is shared.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.100
Underscore wars.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.760
Right?

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.590
So now your model has been imported and you want easy to name variable.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.000
Toby declared So in the previous examples,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.250
I mean,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.090
in the first example,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.480
we have taken this as an input from the main Dottie F.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:02.960
Now,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.370
instead,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.720
what we'll do is we'll say readable.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.580
Ah,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.820
Underscore.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.770
Uh,

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.150
no.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:16.240
You're going to say default equal to dog.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.950
Inside this,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.510
you have to do a dollar close.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:27.620
We have to reference to more jewels that share underscore wars dot And when my time to

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.760
score suffix.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.220
Right.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.830
So what we're saying Yes.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.150
We want to go fetch the suffix from Ah,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.660
this shared wars and we want to upend toe the name off this incident.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.410
So we're calling easy to underscore name underscore Instance.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.200
Right instance.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.610
And we're changing the basically easy to name here.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.270
Tag value.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:52.850
Right.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.240
So that is pretty much done.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.060
And ah,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:05.150
the other thing that I want to show it's like how we can use the same variable in another

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.580
model.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:13.430
So let's go to the share security group here and let's call it the SG name.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:22.120
And we're not taking this as an input and we can say default equal before this,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.580
we have to import the model.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:30.050
So the value of importance again more do give it the reference name shared underscore bars

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.050
.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.750
Inside this,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.030
you are going to specify the source,

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.840
which is one step about from this folder,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.290
and it's under shared wars.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.940
And once you are imported,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.890
you're going to give this the name s S g underscore.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.940
Um I see.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.850
Underscore name underscore.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.450
And you're including the farce.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.780
More deal more detailed.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.270
Our shared underscore wires underscore.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.000
And what?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.410
Not in wire Montaner score suffix.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.750
Right.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.120
So now you have this name.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.340
Now,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.090
as these names are changed,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.020
the security group will be recreated.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.400
But the easy to instance it will just be renamed with our previous resources that were

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:18.860
created.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:26.350
So the other change that we have to make is in the main dark TF because here Ah,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.490
we don't want to specify this input variable anymore,

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.150
right?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:36.030
And we don't want to specify this SG name anymore from here.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.400
Right.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.350
So we took those two things off.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.850
And now let's go ahead and run the terra form,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.140
uh,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.880
in the power shell problem.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.720
So let me clear this off.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.120
Now,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.350
what we need to do is first thing is to run a terra form in it because you have added new

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.670
models to your project,

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.370
so you have to do it there for minute.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.090
Call it.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.610
So there's something wrong that we have done.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.950
So it's saying variable SG named Default may not condemn interpolations.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.300
All right,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.090
So Okay,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:29.000
so what we'll do is it's complaining that we should not give default equal toe something.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.330
All right,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.920
so we can do one thing.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.330
We can directly applied this name here instead of diverse.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:37.680
Right?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.810
So we have easy to instance,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.400
name shared more deal wars,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.750
and we can just get rid off this variable from here.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:56.270
And we can do the same thing for security group modules here so we can take this name and

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:56.600
instead,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.570
off name here,

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.270
we'll just take it off and just save it,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.850
right?

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:09.200
So that should be pretty much it.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.440
Now,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.380
let's go back to our power shell.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.630
Clear this.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.190
Run the terra form in it.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.770
Okay,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:17.900
now we don't have any errors.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.540
We can do telephone plan.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:19.920
Now,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:29.430
we should see that the EEC two instances updated and the and the security group should be

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.090
recreated.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.680
And it should be district.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.080
Yes.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.940
So that's what we see.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.000
So we're destroying the security group and re creating it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.080
And we are changing the easy to instance,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.250
if you see we are operating the tag to instance name changing.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.790
This is the new name that we have given it,

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:49.300
and we're give will be giving it the new security group idea when once the security group

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.680
ideas created and it will be assigned to this.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.820
So what I figured was like this would fail on creating the security group because,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.780
um,

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.970
there should be at least one security group assigned to the east to instance,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:09.380
and we're trying to delete and recreate that security group which would create issues for

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.690
us.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.900
So what we're going to do is,

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.520
um,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.860
instead off deleting and re creating it.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:18.450
Ah,

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.450
what we can do is ah,

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.060
out of his show.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.760
This example.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.250
Right.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:34.360
So So what was the previous name that we were supplying here,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.870
right?

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.450
So let's try to replicate the same thing.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.550
So?

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.980
So we were giving SG underscore.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.800
Easy to write.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.170
So let's do the same thing here.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.970
SGN or score easy toe.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:53.650
And inside this Ah,

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:59.550
it's too.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:15.240
That's u S G underscore e c two and begin modify these guys so that it gives us for

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.160
production.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.750
Right?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.550
So now if we go toe the,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.650
uh you see to model here,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:36.560
I mean security group model and let's get this year and give the name here.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.250
So there should be no change because we're using the same exact PVs one.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:49.650
So now if I go back and run this terra form their form planned,

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.860
there should be only one.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.810
Ah,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:58.000
change with just the easy to instance optation off the tag.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:19.890
And I'm still seeing from course history to perform s G underscore.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.220
Easy to underscore in wire moment suffix.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.550
Right.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.970
So environments affects here is giving us staging,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:35.780
so oh,

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.550
they use upper case lower case,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.840
right?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.280
So that's why it is creating a problem.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.040
So now if I run this again,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.450
I should see only one change.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:55.110
All right,

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.470
there we go.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.900
So So the issue here Waas.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:04.680
We didn't want to recreate the security group because it's every easy to instance.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.320
Need to have at least one security group in place because when you're operate the name off

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:10.320
,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.150
the security group tries to destroy that and recreate the security group,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:22.480
which were not be possible because it wouldn't it couldn't delete the security go because

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.270
it's already assigned to BC two instance,

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.600
so it has to detach it.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.050
But there's no other security groups and it will fail.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:36.840
So what we did was like we we hacked our cord so that our environment suffix would give out

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.950
the um,

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.130
we will give out the same name,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.670
like as it was there in the previous example.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.270
So once we do that,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.200
it it's it's working.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.830
Aceh expected.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:17:04.810
Now we can do a terra form apply and and something yes,

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.980
now are name off.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.070
That easy to instance will be updated.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.020
Yes,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.300
so that has been updated and changed.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:24.040
Now we can cleared from here and we can do terra form workspace,

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:31.450
select production and we can do terra form plant.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.570
And now again,

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.690
you have to see just one change here because we're just updating the name off,

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.760
the easy to instance,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.620
and you should see that the instance name exchanged for me.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:44.760
C.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.770
Two instance production to BC to name incidents production,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:54.410
and we can do Terra Farm apply and give it a confirmation off.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:54.950
Yes,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:09.710
elect.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.500
They also bought The resource is in Cuba,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.520
and I mean in staging and production Have bean changed.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.700
Let's go back to our easy to console and verify if those changes of are reflected or not.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.370
So let's go back here.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.990
And if I refresh,

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:33.030
you should see that the name should now be updated too easy,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:33.450
too.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.750
Name instant production and stating.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:42.590
So this is how you can have shared variables concept separated in a model,

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:49.150
and you can reuse that share variables across different models with your project are across

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.060
different products.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.270
So I really hope that you enjoyed this lesson.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.950
And if you have any questions or if you think that Ah,

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.380
I did not explain any specific parts off this lesson.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:01.760
Clearly,

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.490
you can ping me in the course,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.190
and I will be happy to explain the concept to you.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.830
Oh,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.190
are like clarify your questions offline.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.320
So that's it for this lesson,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.120
and I will see in the next one.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.380
Thank you so much for watching
