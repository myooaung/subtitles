00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.660
Hello and welcome back to one of the lesson in hash tag landing courses.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.470
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.790
we're goingto go ahead and create the orders killing group,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.350
which is the last piece off our infrastructure.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.240
And we're going to use the launch confusion that we have created in the previous lesson.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.990
And,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.700
um,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.550
start booting up the PC two instances at the end of this lesson.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.550
So let's get started.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.190
So the first thing that I'm going to do is open up my sublime text and,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.510
uh,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:46.060
goto the terra form dot io site and search for the order scaling documentation.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.190
So I don't want the data sources.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.020
I want something in the,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.650
uh,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.880
e c to resource A section,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.850
right?

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.050
Ah,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.310
yeah,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.220
And a receipt to resource is you should see the aws underscore or the scaling underscore

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.550
group.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:16.150
So we're just going to use this and here we can copy one off the examples.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.070
So,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.950
looking for what example would be good with the simplest version because we don't want toe

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
go ahead and create all the policies and so on and so forth.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.950
All we want is a basic Ah,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.560
we want a basic resource off artist getting group.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.100
All right,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.620
so I think this particular example would be helpful for us.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.400
So let's paste it in our auto scaling model.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.780
Right?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.110
So once we're here,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.550
we don't want to call it Barbie.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.520
You want to call it?

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.250
Ah,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.620
sample app.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.540
Underscore a SG and the name that we want to give this a sample.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.750
Hap underscore a SG underscore.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.710
Let's give it,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.750
uh so module dart shared underscore war start,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.400
um,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.580
environment underscore suffix.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.890
Right.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.450
So that makes sense.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
Going to give maximum size two men size one.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.620
And ah,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.930
I think I think we can make this as the local variables,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.250
right?

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.250
So instead off using maximum and the What's the desired I think we need the desired size as

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.470
well.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.810
Let's go back to this documentation and search for desired capacity,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.270
right?

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.660
It's called desired capacity.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.010
So we have to do Oh,

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.950
you gotta need desired capacity.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.110
So instead of hard coding these let's also take this as the environment specific variables

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.640
because,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.650
um,

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.410
it's always better to have in 11 specific variables for,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.250
ah,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.900
for stuff like that so that you can have more control over which environment has how many

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.570
instances,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.820
right?

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.330
So you don't want to hard code them.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.050
So begin.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.520
Replicate one off these and call it is This is Fresh Man desired Min and Max.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.900
Okay,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:50.160
let's call this SG desired and going to give this name this and you want to call going to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.610
give,

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.550
uh,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.990
decided one certain one production we want to.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:06.000
And for this this is SG men,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.950
right?

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.410
Issue men?

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.550
Uh,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.490
yes,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.100
Jim men.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.070
And we want to copy the same values for the minimum.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.450
Right.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.050
And for Max,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.950
you can call this SG Max,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:40.170
and we can call this max issue max.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.960
And here let's copy the palace from here instead.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.800
Off one.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.350
Let's do maximum tool and Max room for for product.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:01.820
So we'll have ah one and one as minimum on desired for the staging environment and for

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.230
production,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.850
we want to instances as minimum and for as the maximum for the auto scaling group.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.470
All right,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.570
so I think we have the variable set up properly.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.240
Now.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.380
All we have to do is assign it to them.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.870
Here,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:25.790
we're gonna call our dollar open close and inside this we're gonna call local dot SG,

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:26.730
understand?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.430
Tasty men is that meant Yeah.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.720
Min Max and decide.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.070
And we're gonna copy the same thing.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.820
Oh,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.870
this is the max,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.130
right?

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.790
So we have to give Max men,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:47.270
and this is going to be the is she desired parts of the large configuration name.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.400
We have to fetch it from the previous step.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.020
The previous stepped along plans configuration was sample and score.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.590
Elsie,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.230
sample up.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.730
So we will give the same thing here.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.650
Launch configuration that sample app dot name,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.510
and we need the VPC zone identity fire right zone.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:12.900
Island fire is basically the which order scaling group of which submit zone that you want

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.870
to use,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.750
So oh,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.190
so zone identifier iss.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.090
Basically,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:30.470
we want to supply the for Blake SG now.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.890
Public submit idea.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.480
Now we need the private submitted because we're launching the easy to instance here.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.760
Right?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:45.790
So we can get it off this and we have to give a module dot Shared underscore wars dot

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.260
Private sub net.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.340
The baby that's verify from shared wars.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.430
If we're in putting the right one,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.910
we have private summit.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.730
I'll write.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.200
So I think we got that one right in the tags here.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.690
We can give the name tag and the value tired.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:15.590
We can have as sample and underscore.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:16.950
We can have dollar.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.310
Um,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.840
module dart shared for shared underscore war.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.570
Start in wild rents,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.140
effects right and propagated.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.480
Launch?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.090
Yes.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:39.550
And we can also have n wife meant you can have again the same value from here.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.160
So in a copy it from here gonna baste it here.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.930
And we don't need all of these interpolations and all.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.760
So we're gonna save it here.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.540
All right,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.690
so So we have the auto scaling group.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.730
We have the launch configuration,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.720
we have the identity zone.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.630
I didn't fire where we want to launch DC two instance,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.640
and we have the min and Max set.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.570
Oh,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.640
and we have referenced our launch configuration that we have created in the previous step.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.630
So I think we're pretty much set here.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.970
Let's go by head and execute it in our partial,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.290
prompt and see if we are able to launch the new easy to instance or not.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.650
So ah,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.120
let's go to our partial.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.180
Clear it Here,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.650
Do it in a form plan.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.980
Let's hope for no winners.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.880
All right?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:47.560
So it is creating our or the scaling group and let's try toe do this writer farm apply.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:57.090
Remember,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.620
we're just creating this order Skilling group with,

00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.910
like,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.630
the defaults and like the basic properties being set here Now,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:05.260
in your case,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:12.580
you might me to ADM or stuff like default cool on period or termination policies are you

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.550
can add the lifecycle hooks and you can have order scaling policies.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.570
Um,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.420
scaling alarm,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:19.770
skating,

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.420
notification center on and so forth.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.050
What was this project?

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.500
We're not going to add any off that.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.630
You can check all off the that information in the,

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.960
uh in the data from documentation,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.400
so you don't have to worry about it.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.850
So I'm just going to supply Yes,

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:36.450
here.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.620
And once I do this,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.180
we should see that the new auto scaling group is being created.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.780
The reason why it takes Ah,

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:51.240
um it's delayed here is basically it tries to launch the instance first,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.560
and once it is launched,

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.090
then it's going to come back with saying the success message.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.250
So I'm just gonna pass it here and come back once the instances up and ready.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.240
All right,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.310
so now artist skating group has been created.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:12.090
Let's go back to our AWS console and see how it looks like and check.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.170
We'll check it out if our ah SG has launched a new issue two instance or not.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.860
So I'm gonna go back to our AWS Easy to control.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.390
I'm goingto go to the art of Skating group Now I should see a new waters killing group

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.530
being created here,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:30.050
and we can already see that there is one instance desired.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.670
Ah,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:36.990
and Min and Max being set to our our properties that we have set here.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:42.650
And you can see in the instances section that it has launched a new easy to instance in to

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.030
be bitches are private zone that we have chosen.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:55.840
And if I goto this easy to instance now you should see that it is being booted up and off.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.000
One replace that we have to check is going to target group and see if this easy to instance

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.320
has Bean assigned to this target group or not?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.180
No,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:10.130
it won't be assigned to this target group because we haven't specified attaching it to this

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.750
target group.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.070
So that's one issue here.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.050
So let's go back and fix that thing.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:21.830
So all you have to do is go back to our scaling group here and we need to supply the target

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.050
group.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:28.600
So let's go back to our documentation search for Target Group A rinse.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:28.950
Right.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:31.290
So we need to supply this target group,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:37.790
er and and we have toe and I give it here.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:46.240
And we need to fetch this from the ah from the from the load balancing section.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.460
So I'm just going to use this as an input variable.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:54.890
So variable de g underscore Aaron.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.270
Right?

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:05.140
And we're going to input that here as dollar open toe darty g underscore Aaron,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.480
once that is done now you have to go to your load balancer,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.000
and you have to output that variable from this target group.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.250
So the way you can do it,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.050
ISS create a output variable Here,

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.950
calling naming TG underscore,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.650
Aaron.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:30.830
And here you can see the value will be this particular thing.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.150
Target group Aaron,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:37.290
they should be in there double courts,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:42.380
so double coats is done.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.500
Now,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.180
once we output this,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:50.210
we have to input this into the ah or the Skilling module.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.500
Your so t g underscore.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.550
Yaron merely confirm if that's the right valuable.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:02.490
So go here.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.740
T J underscore Aaron City underscore Erin equals again.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:17.810
Dollar module dot network underscore module dot DJ underscore here.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.470
Right,

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.370
So one start is done.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.230
Ah,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:27.320
we have to see that if that runs properly on our So let's clear this.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.890
Do a telephone plan.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.560
Mm.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.040
Dd underscore is not a lead.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.130
All right,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.280
so let's go back to our lord ransom arguments.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.550
Look at what are output.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:48.520
So we have our all put off didn't give it in the double coats.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.470
That's why complain about it.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.510
So Right,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.830
so we've saved this.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.150
Now let's go back in.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.370
Oh,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.930
still it is complaining tg air.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.710
And it is not a valid walked off,

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.110
more deal network model.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.250
Oh,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:06.630
no.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.610
I made a mistake here.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.950
It's not a network model.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.500
It is a auto,

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.150
uh,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.200
load.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.260
Balancer underscore.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.640
Margie.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.580
Right now,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.850
if we go back and do a telephone plan,

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.980
the target group Aaron should be a list.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.630
All right,

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.000
so we made one more mistake that's cleared here.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.440
So this is expecting to be as a list inside the what is killing.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:46.260
So all we have to do is sup late as an Audi saved it.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.700
Let's go back and try one more time to a farm on.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.330
All right,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:53.870
there we go.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.460
So now it's being modified,

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.440
and it is attaching it as a target group to the artist killing group.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.360
So let's do it on our farm.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.250
Apply in supply?

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:07.480
Yes,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.470
as conformation.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.640
Now,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.770
once we do this.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.410
All right,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:19.930
So one fundamental mistake that we have done here so far is we need tohave the availability

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.750
zones matching with where we've I mean,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.740
the art of scaling group available the zone and the load balancers available.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.810
The zone should be matching even though they are in different subjects,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:34.770
it doesn't matter,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.150
but zones are actually important and it needs to be matched.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.360
So what we can do is like,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.120
we can go back to our network model and fix them and make sure that ah,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.410
everything is a line,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.450
and then we can start using this.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.730
So all the after do is instead off.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.630
Using this,

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.620
um uh to be zone,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:04.360
we have to just use one off the to A or to see zone so that it starts using this.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.320
So let's go back and fix it.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.870
It's very easy.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:17.630
All we have to do is go to our go to our terra form here,

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:26.180
and you can see that the zone identifier will be after do it's used the public sub net one

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.180
.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.750
No,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:35.180
we don't have any public or private created in our network set up because we're just using

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.840
whatever the defaults which are available.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.320
Usually you create public private Ah and,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.820
um public private and DMC within the same two.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.780
Available the zones and you basically have different subjects created in the same zone so

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:55.050
that it's all a the all The traffic is flowing in the same zone rather than it is about

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.130
them going cross on and creating problems.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.470
So all we have to do to fix this is changed.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.250
TV PC Zone.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.060
I didn't fire toe public submit one,

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:11.800
and we just have to relaunch the instance or that it starts seeing the traffic,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.960
and that's pretty much it.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.870
So let's go ahead and clear this.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.450
Run their telephone plan.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:27.610
It's not a valley resource from public subject.

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:37.910
Want I said not valued one shareware public submit.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.100
I anyone All right,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.000
so it's probably some net.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.310
I need one.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.120
Let's go ahead and none this.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:51.700
It's going to update it I want to say that a farm apply.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.110
I do.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.720
Yes.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.620
Okay,

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.190
so that's being applied.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:03.200
Now,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.890
another thing that we have to do is to launch a new issue.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.700
Two instance.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:19.050
So all we have to do is change the men and desire to zero so that it terminates.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.170
And then we'll will relaunch the instance.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:26.200
Form applies.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.670
So we're like terminating the existing one and will re launch a new instance now for play?

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:32.220
Yes.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.730
Okay,

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.740
so now it's Bean turned to Zito.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.560
If I go back to my console here and check in the artist killing group,

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.780
we should see that the C two instances being terminated here go here.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:56.260
You should see the instance is being terminated.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:04.590
Not sure whether to instance came in from Oh,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:09.350
maybe it has come from our previous execution.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.660
So let it.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:18.860
Let's just do a full refresh in C If you have any instances left.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.120
Okay,

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.670
So what are getting tormented?

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.580
So let's go ahead and,

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.260
uh,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:34.400
change our values back toe one and the execute terra form so that new instance starts

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:34.950
coming up,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:41.100
making new terra form apply and,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.310
yes,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.450
information.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:58.570
Let's just give it a few minutes and ah,

00:19:58.570 --> 00:19:59.380
let's go,

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.340
toe.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.170
Ah,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.220
instances,

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.710
stab.

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:09.700
And I see that the new instance has come up into a And now let's go to our target group and

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:09.950
see,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.630
for instance,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.050
is registered here.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:18.740
All right,

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.910
so we can see that in targets.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:22.810
Okay,

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.260
so this saves it is unhealthy.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.260
Ah,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:35.170
so I'm not sure why this target group is still unhealthy here.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.120
So one thing what we can do is,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.500
like,

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.390
go ahead and debug what's going on in the instance itself.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.060
So if we do that,

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.470
we have to go to the instance.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.270
All right,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:51.250
Now we have to see whether we have able to get it 200 response back from the easy to

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.000
instant or not.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.990
But we have locked our security group so that it's not allowed for,

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.760
um,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.300
access from outside.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.500
So first we have to go and fix the security group de Buck,

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.720
and then we can again close it back,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.490
using the Terra form by running it.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:17.840
So I'm just temporarily opening the http port to everything just to debug.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.130
And now I can go back to my instance,

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.660
select the public.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.390
Uh,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.850
I p and run it,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:27.780
Huh?

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.880
So I do see that my page default page has been loaded,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:37.200
but somehow it's not being registered as the,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.260
um,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.320
healthy target.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:46.590
So let's inspect this guy and go to the network tab to see what response we're getting.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:47.760
If I do a refresh.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.910
Ah,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.570
so for some reason,

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.090
this is returning a 403 This is a default page.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:00.550
I'm not sure why it is straightening 403 That's why it is not being registered as a healthy

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.060
target.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:03.220
So also,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.540
I see something here from the old balancer,

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.070
which is,

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.430
I mean,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.350
from the instance which is giving it toe wondered back.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.760
So maybe we can use this.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.110
Asked the health check instead off just a default.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:22.950
So let's take this and let's fix it in the,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:28.580
um that you start as a health check in the target group,

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:28.910
right?

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:35.350
So what we can do is we can go back toe our uniform,

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.200
and we have to go to the Lord balance or module.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.950
And here in the target ah,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.010
target group.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:48.490
There should be something called health underscored check.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.110
I think our health underscored checked.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.840
Let's quickly verify it.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.550
In the target group,

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.070
it's called Health underscore.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.430
Check.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:58.670
Yeah,

00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.370
that's right.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:02.850
So health underscore Check is basically this.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:08.260
And let's go ahead and do it on our farm plan.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.830
Ah,

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.430
health check.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.700
Should be a list.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.160
Why would health check be a list here?

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.160
Ah,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.660
health check.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.260
This is a target group sample target group.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.280
Why would help Check blocks are documented.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:28.900
Oh,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:29.370
health check.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:30.160
It's a block.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.150
Okay.

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:33.660
Health check and target type.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.070
Okay,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:42.320
So health check blocks,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.120
so health check is a block,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.300
and we need to give all these information in to that.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.860
Right.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.480
So we need to give Ah,

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:59.660
the we need to give health check is basically a block,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.050
so it doesn't have equals here.

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:04.160
And instead,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.050
we need to give it the,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.450
um,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.730
part variable equals,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.160
um,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.180
can actually give this the spot.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.840
Close it here.

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840
All right,

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.350
so this will be my part,

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.900
and I can say inter well,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.000
equal toe.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.120
I want to check every five seconds and,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.570
uh oh,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.150
Time out.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.280
Time out.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.640
Time out.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.910
Equal toe.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.680
Let's call.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.230
Let's give four seconds time more time.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.950
What should always be less than the interval?

00:24:50.950 --> 00:25:02.490
We have the healthy underscore threshold equal to let a to in unhealthy t underscores

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.050
threshold according toe before.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:13.190
And let's make this 10 so that it doesn't go too quickly.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.760
All right,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.170
so now let's try to run our terra form fam.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.330
All right,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:27.670
so it is now reverting back our security group,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.700
and it is adding these ah,

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.670
properties toe the target.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:39.350
So let's do it from apply and let's see what happens now.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.060
Yes.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:45.130
So our changes have been applied.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:45.260
Now,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.070
let's go back to our target group and ah,

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.380
do it quickly.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.970
Fresh here and see for health check.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:54.850
Got updated.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:55.130
Okay,

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.050
so I got up there to Jeff here,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.050
which should written back,

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.840
uh,

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.570
the 200 back to this.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:09.550
We have to wait under like,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.740
fuel.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.260
A few runs off this?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.170
Yes.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.760
So that it reports back 200.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.470
All right,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.490
so after a couple of refreshes,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:29.010
you can see that the target has now being marked as healthy because we have 200 coming back

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.380
from this particular part.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.730
So that's pretty much it.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:38.120
So now we have ah launched an easy two instance using the order scaling group,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.930
and we have registered the particular easy to instance to a target group,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:49.400
and we have debunked are easy to instance by opening up that security group,

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.190
um,

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.380
for for temporary debug purpose.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.940
And then we figured out the issue.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.980
We fixed it.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.380
And once we're on the same terra form again,

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.450
it actually,

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:04.510
um what are all of my security group changes and got me a clean state.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.460
All right,

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:12.910
so one last thing that we have to verify s by going into our load balancers and,

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:13.690
um,

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:21.810
by browsing the load balancer Deena's and check if our app is being responded on this

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:22.710
particular Dennis.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.870
So I've copied the URL.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.190
The browser.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.930
Alright.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.570
So yes.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:32.060
So we do get back the response from our load balancer,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:38.810
you are so this Ah tells us that our project is now complete.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.670
So that's pretty much it for this.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.840
Ah project.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.300
We have garden all our competence created.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.220
We have got the art of scaling.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.600
We've got the load balancer,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.820
Target group and the oh and the in.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.890
The entire project is now complete.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.830
So the last thing that's left in this particular project is now spinning up the production

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.910
environment using the same script.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.350
Now,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.890
remember,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.940
you've got so many problems when you were creating staging in wiring because that was the

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.450
first time that you were setting it up.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.930
So if you were to send it up all again manually,

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:21.950
without the sterile farm script now you might encounter many other problems with many other

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.800
manual errors.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.460
Now that we have everything scripted in terra form and it it's like,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.280
um,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.340
created using the works basis,

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.680
you can just create the production workspace.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.850
And as we have already keyed in all the production variables,

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:43.520
it is as simple as creating just a new workspace and spinning up the entire environment.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.820
And I'll show you in the next lesson how you can easily spin up this copy off this

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.100
environment in within few minutes.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.520
So I'll see you there.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.430
Thank you for watching.
