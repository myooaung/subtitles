00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
Hello and welcome back to hashtag landing courses.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.450
Now,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.330
this is going to be our final lesson off this particular section.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.230
So let's get started.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.390
So in the previous section,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.510
we have completed our AWS project by creating our artist killing group and the,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.170
um,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:33.580
and putting up the instances and fixing various issues that we had with the availability

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.850
zone issue and then the health check issue and so on and so forth.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.190
And finally be very fight it by browsing through the load balancer you are So now we have

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.150
completed all these steps in our previous lessons in our staging environment.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.020
Now is the time that we have to launch this for a production system.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.340
And to do that for a production system,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.010
all we have to do is basically creating a new workspace for prod and run our terra form

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.960
script and see that the magic happens that you have replicated this entire environment with

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.190
just one single command.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.450
So let's go ahead and get started and run that particular thing.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.040
So total,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.280
that first thing that I have to do is go to my Terra Farm folder,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.590
the power shell prompt here and we're clear on from a previous thing.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.770
Now,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.830
after the later form workspace new and call it production Lepic quickly verify in the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.790
variables whether I call the uppercase P or lower case P.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.950
Um,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.430
best way to check is to go to the shared virus and see that.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.840
Okay,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.800
it's a lower case P right,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.800
So it's new production and then select,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.540
hit,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.960
enter.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.140
And once it is created,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.700
you can see that the workspace is now switched to production.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
You can verify that by running terra form workspace list,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.540
and you should see that you're currently running the production environment.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.260
All right,

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.980
so now the next thing that we have to do is run terra form in it.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.550
This is going to include all the models that we have created so far,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.150
so there was no problem.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.900
It created it included all the models.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.460
I'm clearing this next thing that I'm going to run this terra form plan now you should see

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.520
that all the resources that we have created previously step by step in staging environment

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.570
that now are created in one step.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.530
You can see that there are,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.770
like,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.050
70 sources that are being created when it's the order skating group.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.460
We have the launch config.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.200
We have the sample up l b and we have the listener than we have the target group.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.990
Then we have the private security group and the public security group.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.880
So let's go ahead and run.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.650
Apply this.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.060
Changes to reform.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.650
Apply.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.060
And yes,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.090
I'm enough.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.180
Pressed a wrong key here.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.490
So I ask you this.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.730
Do it Terra form.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.350
Apply in type and yes,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.410
All right.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.290
So now our resources are being created.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.510
Really?

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.220
Just give it a couple of minutes.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.020
All right?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.580
So after a few minutes,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.770
the ah,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.160
all the resources were successfully created.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.200
Now let's go back to our AWS console and verify all our resources are properly creator or

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.480
not.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.110
So the first thing that I'm going to do it's like go back to my AWS console.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.930
Goto,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.030
the easy to in first thing that we have two very far is if we had our security groups

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.020
created properly.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.060
So inside security groups.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.320
Now you should see that privatised reproduction in public,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.530
etc.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.050
Production has been created.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.910
And after that we have to go to our load balancer and see if we have a new Lord banter

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.870
created for production or not.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.090
So yes,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.670
I do see your new lord Bands are being created and under listeners we should have extra TP

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.220
listeners and the listener shirt.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.190
Forward it to a production target group.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.420
And if I go to target groups,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.660
I should see a new target due for production.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.200
And we should see all our health checks that we have configured in staging Environment

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.120
should be applied to the production as well.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.550
And the next thing that I'm going toe verify it's going to the auto Scaling group and see

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.150
if the instance is now launched or not.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.020
Yes,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.810
so you should see two instances being launched and the maximum should before.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.560
If I go to the incidents a stab,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.410
you should see two instances are created.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.720
Now,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.280
the one last thing that we have to check is going to the target groups and see if the

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.550
targets are registered.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.920
Um,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.880
so the ah,

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.440
I mean,

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.910
if the instances are redistricted,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.830
the target group or not.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.170
So if I go to the target,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.620
you should see that two instances are registered and their mark healthy,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.320
and the one last thing that we have to check is going to the load balancer and browsing the

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.020
load Balancer,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.250
You are ill and see if we got getting If you're getting back at a sponsor knock.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.810
So I'm gonna open up a new tab and use this.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.480
Now you can see that sample app production is also working properly.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.290
And this is how you create your terra form project toe.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.470
Maintain your infrastructure so that you have one specific terra form script and you run it

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.150
across multiple environments.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.210
Now that's pretty much it.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.950
Now we have completed our project,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.130
and I really hope that you guys enjoyed building this particular project.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.470
I know this was a lot of hands on and I really increase you all toe.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.140
Um,

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.180
follow along my,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.760
uh,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.240
lesson and,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.750
uh,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:16.710
create the resources along with me so that you So you get a lot of practice doing this type

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.900
of stuff and it will really help you in your career.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.010
And also it will help you toe manager infrastructure in a better way.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.050
So that's pretty much it from this lessons perspective.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.970
One last thing that I wanted to mention was that I'm going to upload this entire project

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:42.700
into the course resources so you can download this entire set up and you can change your

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:43.420
valuables.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.660
Oh,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.240
and,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.780
uh,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.890
you can basically reuse my template to create an infrastructure in your environment.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.760
So that's pretty much it for my side.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.510
And if you have any more questions,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.100
you can always ask in the course.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.690
And I'm happy to answer everything.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.460
So that's it for now.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.600
And I'll see you later.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.100
Thank you.
