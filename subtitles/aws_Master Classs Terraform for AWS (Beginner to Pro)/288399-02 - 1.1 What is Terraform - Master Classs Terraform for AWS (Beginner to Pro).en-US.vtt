00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
Hello and welcome back to another lesson off hash tag learning courses.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.000
And in this lesson,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.750
we're going to see what Esther form.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.910
Now,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.040
I know that off.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.640
You are here for terra form because this entire courses designed around terra form and I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.780
felt like I need to give a little but off introduction off water for miss and give you a

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.920
walk through off like who developed it.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.710
What is a website?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.670
How does it look like?

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.130
And,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.710
uh,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.690
what do we get out off it.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.560
And how are we going to use it to build our infrastructure?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.010
Now,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.780
once we get a quick introduction off Ward,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.720
this is And like,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.580
um,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.120
the quick walk through off the website were going toe like,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.800
Go in depth off.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.110
Like,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.640
what is infrastructures accord?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.230
And,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.900
um what exactly?

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.290
I mean,

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.610
the cow to install terra form,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.120
like how to set up your aws and so on and so forth.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
So if you're if you already know what performance,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.320
you can just get this lesson.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.750
This is for someone who really don't know anything about our farm.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.990
We're just going to get a start from,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.200
like,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.920
absolutely taking a perspective off the student knowing nothing about terra form.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.820
So,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.450
um,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.020
so that said we will get started.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.280
So first thing is,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.530
terra form is infrastructure asset cord tool.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.650
Meaning you were going toe script.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.700
Your entire infrastructure That is going to be your maybe your AWS resources.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.680
Or it could be,

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.270
um,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.660
any objects that you want to put in s three or or anything that is related to your

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.420
infrastructure that you're going toe,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.230
specify it in a form off a terror farm script,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.800
and you're going to save it in a washing.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.930
Control are wherever you want.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.200
Toe.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.560
Put it in a secure place.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.550
Now,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.560
in the next lesson,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.850
I'm going to show you like I'm going to tell you what Waters infrastructures accord and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.690
like what exactly?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.420
You get off it.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090
But in this lesson,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.910
let's just go and take a quick look at the website itself and see what their farmers.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.390
Okay,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.060
so this is how their form website looks like.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.400
It is basically the doctor from that,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.800
are you and ah,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.460
Terra form is a open source tool.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.410
So basically it is free for you to use and it is developed by hash card.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:37.370
No hash carp is a kind of a very good community contributor in terms off any clouding cloud

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.370
,

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.850
any tools that are like used in cloud applications,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.530
you can check out like the other tools which hashing carp offers their tools,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.430
like Reagan,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.550
their tools like Packer,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.320
which are used for different purposes.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.890
Now,

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.050
terra form is basically infrastructure as a court platform,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.760
which,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.270
um which is almost basically you to write,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.470
plan and create infrastructure as a court.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.950
Now,

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.600
Well,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.500
why do we need terra form like you could you could argue,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.750
saying that AWS provides cloud formation,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.990
right?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.470
So cloud formation is another infrastructure as it court to.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.670
Now,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.510
if you're hosted completely native,

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.870
Yes,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.210
you kind of get a question like Why do I need to use Terra form?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.410
Like,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.890
Why?

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.130
Why not cloud formation now to answer that cloud formation is basically you're tying

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.490
yourself into AWS,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.560
and whatever form does this,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.840
it gives you an opportunity toe kind off,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.400
have your infrastructure open toe a multi cloud thing,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.570
and you can always have like I mean,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.350
you can have always have the same terra form court.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.660
And if they had more components from other cloud providers like Let's say you have the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.170
sources,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.460
like easy to instances or whatever from AWS,

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.750
and you want to use some other cloud services like,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.350
um,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.550
as your or any other cloud provider.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.960
So basically,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.310
you can have everything set up in one place,

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.410
and you can use the same tools toe kind of organize your entire infrastructure so that it's

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.270
one off the,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.940
um,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.730
benefits off using their form.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.160
It is cross cloud platforms,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.280
and it's kind of easy to use.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.140
Now.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.020
You must be wondering,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.340
like,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.950
what is the language that I'm going to use to write this Terra form script?

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.480
It is basically,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.250
um,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.170
head seal.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.390
It is called hash carp language,

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.200
and it's it's kind off mawr off a declarative language where you're going to specify,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.680
Okay,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.600
I need a W s easy to instance with these in these properties.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.810
It is quite simple.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.270
Ended this,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.930
like any programmer,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.630
are like even I would say,

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.410
like even if there is no past programming experience,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.170
you could easily get around and get hold off this writing inter form script,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:18.300
and I'm going to walk you through the different different steps that that will be our I'll

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.020
be walking you through,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.040
like all the different competent off this terra forming scripting.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.840
And I'm going to show you exactly like,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.200
what is the best way to do it?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.210
I have used Terra form in all my experience.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.560
And then I figured out a lot of these which are which are actually not documented.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.770
And I've kind of have techniques around like workarounds for situations which are not

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.350
natively supported by terra form.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.590
Like using variables like in a different.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.210
They have experimented a lot in terra form,

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.150
and I'm going to show you a lot of things.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.090
So,

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.620
uh,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.530
this is a quick introduction off whatever.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.920
Form it.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.880
So now,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.850
um,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.940
we can't stop our lesson here.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.810
You I just allow you to go ahead and visit the website,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.580
check out the documentation,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.620
or like whatever the guys that you want to see.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.780
You can read through all of these.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.150
I don't need to like this.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.790
Read through our,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.980
like,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.480
explain.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.070
Warded does so basically like a set of home is an infrastructure,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.180
as it's called tool.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.720
And it gives us a lot off,

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.280
um,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.140
out of options.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.580
Oh,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:34.150
and you can use the same tool for different cloud service providers and so on and so forth

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.150
.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.070
Now I'm going to stop this lesson here,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.400
and we in the next lesson off Will,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.780
Will,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.150
Will Seymour about her farm and infrastructure as a cord.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.040
So thank you for watching.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.450
And I will see you in the next one.
