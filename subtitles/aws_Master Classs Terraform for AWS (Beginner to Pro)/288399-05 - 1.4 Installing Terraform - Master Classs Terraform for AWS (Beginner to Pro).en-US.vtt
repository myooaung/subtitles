00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
Hello and welcome back to hash tag learning courses.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.360
And in this lesson,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.720
we're going toe install terra form for our course and,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.040
ah,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.920
let's get started.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.140
So the first thing that you would do is basically going toe your web browser and,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:28.500
um Justine www dot terra form dot io and you'll be landing onto this site now all you got

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.550
to do is go to the downloads section here and then select the west that you are currently

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.260
working on.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.110
Now,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.910
basically,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.750
this is not installer like a typical Mac or Windows installer.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.250
It is just a zip file that you're gonna download and you gotta configure your part variable

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.350
still kind off,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.690
figure out like what that a farm resolves to,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.740
and that's pretty much it.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.630
So let's do this for Windows.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.850
And it is pretty much similar in all the other operating systems as well.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.120
So let's go ahead and download it for Window 64 bit.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.070
I'm currently working on 64 bit.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.180
I'm going to create a new folder here saying that terra form latest and inside this I am

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.710
going toe.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.130
I'm just copy this part and then I'm going to save it.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.550
here.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.950
So one studies downloaded and saved.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.060
The next thing that we're going to do is go to that folder and extract that file.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.670
So once we have that extracted,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.640
now you can see that we just have the Terra formed or e x c here.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.410
Oh,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.950
and this is already like a it's ready to use.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.750
And you won't need to install anything here like I said previously.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.440
So all you gotta do is like,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.430
configure your part to point to this.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.670
Now,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.840
let me open up my power shell and let's see if I've have terra form already set up and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.640
let's see.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.150
Ah,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.530
So what folder My terra form is currently pointing to,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.870
uh,

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.650
we can say get to come and form.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.920
Okay.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.290
So you can see that currently,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.060
my terra form part is being pointed toe C program files Terra form and terra form dot e x c

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.060
.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.360
So this is where I put my terra form file.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.450
Um,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.700
now I can change that by saying that in my part,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.660
variables Aiken,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.720
goto my,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.370
uh,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.970
it system,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.170
environment variables and I can say environment variables,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.910
and I can check for my pot and inside this Ah,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.090
you can see that this is my order from.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.650
But now I can,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.030
uh,

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.750
did this.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.670
And I can say this is my new telephone pot.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.840
And then click.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.350
OK,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.270
In your case,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.040
there wouldn't be an entry here.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.100
So we all your do is basically select the new and,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.600
uh,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.340
give the folder pathway over your turf form dirty,

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.610
etc.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.240
Is present,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.710
and you'll just hit,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.120
OK,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.490
and then Okay.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.670
So once you're done with that,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.400
now this.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.470
Now we have to restart this parcel because it won't pick up the changes.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.250
Um,

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.250
right away way have toe,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.690
reopen the partial.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.530
And once we re open now,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.950
if you do get command Terra form,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.570
it should actually show us the new part,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.550
which is our documents.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.750
Ah,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.470
terra form,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.440
which is whatever the part that we have here.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.810
So now the terra form is basically set up in our no system.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.300
Now,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.550
let's just do a test command off like terra form version.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.760
So yeah,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.900
so you got back to terra form version,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.480
which means,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.000
like your terror for miss properly set up.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.530
So that's pretty much it for this lesson.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.390
And I hope you liked it and,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:23.910
uh if you have any questions you can always get to me like by messaging in the channel are

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.950
like personal messaging through through the course.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.220
Andi,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.920
I'll get back to your questions.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.400
So that's it for this lesson,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.030
and I will see in the next ones.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.950
Thanks for watching.
