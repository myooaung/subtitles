00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.660
Hello and welcome back to another lesson in hashtag lending courses.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.310
So in this lesson,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.080
we're going toe continue from where we left off in the previous lesson.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.710
So in the previous lesson,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.270
um,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.190
to give you a quick recap,

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.490
we have created our test.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.150
Ah,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.830
first uniform files with Saleh World rtf.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.840
And then we learned her a few commands,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.090
which is there for minute there from planter from applying there from destroyed.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.230
Now,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.850
Um,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.480
now you Once you have written something in your terra form file and you have run something

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.470
like the reform plan Terra form apply.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.280
You are going to create some resources,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.620
right?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.150
Like of if you Let's say,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.620
if you have created an E C two instance are you have created a load balancer you have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.170
created You have uploaded industry filed something like that.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.830
When you do something like that,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.220
there should be somewhere.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.730
Um I mean,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.190
terra form should record that information somewhere and keep it right.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.890
I mean,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.870
it should keep track off what resources created and like,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.180
one of the ideas that that that got written from AWS and like those kind of information.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.320
So all those information are stored in a terra form state file,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.460
which is It has an extension off dot PF state.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.680
No,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.950
this t of state is really,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.850
really important because whenever you run the telephone plan,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.770
basically terra form uses this terra form state file and it basically compares your current

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.250
state with,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.220
ah,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.180
the reform that you have currently specified in there.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.060
Not be a file.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.000
Meaning Let's say you have created an easy two instance early and you have run that as it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.200
there from plan and terra form Apply now what happened?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.520
This you have created that resource in the AWS system like you have a new easy to instance

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.100
running there.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.600
Now you're terra form state file will have that information saying that.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.100
Okay,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.900
um,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.290
for this pretty little farm folder,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.520
we have created a easy to instance.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.860
And here the properties.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.600
Now,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.280
once you have that information in there you go in your telephone Dr file and you add a new

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.580
resource saying that Okay,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.950
I also want a load balancer.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.380
No,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.680
technically,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.560
when you're running,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.340
you should go and create a least two instance as well as a load balancer.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.640
Right?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.300
But you don't want that to happen you want the Terra form to go ahead and check?

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.420
I already had.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.380
Easy to instance.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.450
Now I need a load balance.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.770
So whatever form does this first it checks the state fight and it verifies if you're terra

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.170
form state file is in sync with what you are there form filers.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.410
You'll have a mismatch there saying that.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.950
Okay,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.590
I had just had an easy to incidence.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.810
Now,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.160
I also have a load balancer.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.990
So I have to create a load balancer.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.620
So in your plan statement,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.100
it's going to tell you Oh,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.430
you already have a C two instance running.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.430
It also verifies,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.070
if that instituted instances still running or not.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.920
If Randy will try to create one Now that you're easy to instances already running,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.250
you need a new lord bands that it's going to say,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.180
Um,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.550
I want to create one resource.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.380
I want to modify no resources,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.820
Tyrone,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.060
to destroy no resources,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.210
that is one create zero destroys.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.910
You don't modify.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.650
So that's how you kind off create new resources and keep track off.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.640
Old resource is that you have already created.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.220
So that is why don t a file,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.460
but are not the DF state file,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.060
which is the state file is really important.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.530
And it is going toe keep track off all the resources that that you have created.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.760
So there are different ways to manage the start.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.440
State file.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.490
Naughty of state file.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.640
Ah one.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.180
It's like,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.030
um either having it checked in into your version controlling or you can have a remote state

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.350
fire.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.070
Like whenever you run something your ST file gets updated in s three are or were there with

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.630
the remote destination that you have chosen.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.210
Now,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.000
those are some of that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.420
Once topics will come to its Ah,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.090
at the point.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.170
Once we are like very much comfortable with terra form.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.210
But let's focus on,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.520
like,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.340
their form state file.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.510
So whenever you apply something,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.530
you,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.880
you your dark TF state file is created.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.730
And,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.350
um,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.970
now,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.260
in the previous example,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.920
when we learned a bunch of comment,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.200
you can see here that there are few come a few files that are created oneness the estate

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.490
and the estate dart back up.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.870
Now,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.340
the steve ST dot backup is something like you have run.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.090
You had a first run,

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.900
and then you run a second time.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.060
You running third time.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.930
It's going to,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.250
like,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.460
have the most current information and daughter file and all the states that it was it had

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.970
earlier,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.650
It will save it in the dark day off backup file.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.720
So this is not that much often important,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.490
Really.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.200
All you need to care about this start e of state files.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.290
So in this file,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.070
this is this is just going to be a Jason file,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.750
which,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.770
which has,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.050
like,

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.680
Okay,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.970
this is my version three because I ran it three times,

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.350
right?

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.100
Um and then I have my telephone version,

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.600
which is,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.790
um,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.070
telling like this is a worsen off terra form that I'm running.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.030
And,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.650
ah,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.800
currently,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.400
you don't have any output or more deals are your resources are dependencies,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.680
right?

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.330
So all this information get Paul gets populated once you have some resources that are

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.250
created in here.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.220
So that's why terra form state the estate file is really important.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.020
And in the next lessons,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.750
you're going to see when you create new resources how this terra form state fight is going

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.770
to get populated.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.220
All right,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.030
so that's it for this lesson.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.680
And,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.290
uh,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.780
I will see you in the next lesson.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.130
We're goingto go ahead and configure our AWS,

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.110
um,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:15.490
permissions in your telephone file so that you can start creating new resources.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.650
So I'll see you in the next one.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.150
Thank you.
