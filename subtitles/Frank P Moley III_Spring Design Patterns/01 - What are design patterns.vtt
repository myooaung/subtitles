00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.070
- Before we begin talking about

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.040
the design patterns that we're going to use

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.000
with the spring framework,

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.060
we need to talk about what they are.

5
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.040
And really what they come down to,

6
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.060
is that these are a set of best practices for

7
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.060
solutions to common problems,

8
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.010
designed with good object-oriented programming in mind.

9
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.060
And the solution and application or

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.050
implementation of it.

11
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.020
And finally it prescribes how to use the solution as well.

12
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.010
So a good, well defined design pattern

13
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.090
not only shows you the solution to the problem,

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.020
the implementation of that solution,

15
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.040
but prescribes how to use it

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.070
to maximize its value.

17
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.050
Now you may ask:

18
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.060
why do we care as developers about these design patterns?

19
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.060
And the answer comes down to that they provide

20
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.060
a common answer to common problems.

21
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.040
There's no need to solve

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000
the same problem over and over again,

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.080
after all that's just an exercise in futility,

24
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.020
and there's no reason to recreate the wheel

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.030
it's already been done before.

26
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.010
And these design patterns are

27
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.050
proven implementations that you can leverage for free.

28
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.030
And the industry as a whole has adopted them,

29
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.070
and that adds even more value to them

30
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070
because other developers look at them

31
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070
and understand them immediately,

32
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.030
which makes reading code for them

33
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.040
that much better.

34
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.020
Now there's some value to developers

35
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050
as well that I just talked about.

36
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.030
Now these are trusted and well-tested patterns

37
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.060
that makes determining the solution

38
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.090
and solving the problem that much easier.

39
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.050
Because these have already been tested,

40
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.080
and these patterns have already been defined

41
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.040
you can get to market faster

42
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.060
because you don't have to create a new algorithm.

43
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.010
And they're easier to explain your code

44
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.060
when you use patterns

45
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.050
because other developers will recognize them,

46
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.090
and because they're written with highly structured

47
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.000
object-oriented programming you can explain your

48
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.010
code in a way that makes sense to others

49
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.080
doing object-oriented development.

50
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.050
And because you're using a pattern

51
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.070
and you haven't recreated something from scratch

52
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.070
its easier to read your own code later,

53
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.050
which makes fixing issues,

54
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.000
as well as debugging problems,

55
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.010
that much easier later.

56
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.080
So leverage design patterns,

57
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.070
leverage them for your own benefit,

58
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.010
and use these trusted solutions

59
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.000
to do your job and to do it well.
