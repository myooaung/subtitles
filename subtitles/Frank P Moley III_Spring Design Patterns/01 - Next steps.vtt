00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Frank] So we've spent quite a bit of time

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
talking about design patterns,

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.020
and you may wonder what's next.

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.010
But before we get there,

5
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.050
I want to recap on what we've done in this course.

6
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.090
So we started by learning about

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.080
design patterns in general and the Gang of Four.

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.090
We then focused on the major patterns

9
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.040
in the Spring Framework.

10
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.080
Those that the framework itself uses

11
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.040
in its day-to-day operations.

12
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.060
We've learned about the patterns

13
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.040
and how to implement the ones

14
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.080
that are most commonly used

15
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040
with and outside the framework.

16
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.050
The ones that you most likely are going to encounter

17
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020
are the ones that we talked about

18
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.070
how to implement.

19
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.000
And probably most importantly,

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.040
we discussed why to use each of these design patterns,

21
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000
because you can always go look up the implementation,

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.080
but knowing why to use them is 90% of the battle.

23
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.040
Which leads me to where we should go next.

24
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.020
We need to study the patterns,

25
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
especially the more common ones.

26
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.030
The ones that I presented

27
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.070
are a subset of the most common patterns,

28
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.070
and I highly encourage you to look at the ones

29
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.040
that I presented implementations for

30
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.030
and study them deeply.

31
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.040
One great way to do that

32
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.020
is use the concept of kata exercises,

33
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.000
to use them where you're implementing them

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.090
several times over

35
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.050
until you commit them to memory.

36
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.030
Learn to use them when writing code in Spring.

37
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.020
After all, Spring is a great framework,

38
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.050
and one that lends it self to

39
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.020
writing good object-oriented software

40
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.030
which includes the use of object-oriented

41
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.020
design patterns.

42
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.060
And really what you want to be doing

43
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.060
is focus on reducing the complexity

44
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
in your code base by using these patterns.

45
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.030
Now, I've alluded to this,

46
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.060
but one thing to note is we've only touched the surface.

47
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.080
I've only introduced you

48
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.060
to a small subset of design patterns,

49
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.090
and those specifically that are very easy to determine

50
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090
are used within the framework.

51
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.090
There are many more patterns in a framework

52
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
and definitely a lot more outside the framework.

53
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.030
I encourage you to study

54
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
as many of these that you can that are outside the list.

55
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.050
The more design patterns you have familiarity with,

56
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.010
the better armed you're going to be

57
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.080
when a problem arises

58
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.010
that may have already been solved by somebody else.

59
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.000
Learn the most common ones in your areas of focus,

60
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.090
and they do exist everywhere.

61
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.070
If you're an ETL developer,

62
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.030
learn the patterns for ETL development.

63
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.090
If you're a distributed systems programmer,

64
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090
learn the ones around domain-driven design

65
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.070
and asynchronous messaging

66
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.090
and microservices architectures.

67
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.040
And I'm going to reiterate this once again,

68
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.010
kata exercises are a great way

69
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.020
to commit things to memory.

70
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.080
You do the same implementations

71
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.060
over and over again, eventually they stick,

72
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.000
and you can use them

73
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.010
without having to go look them up.

74
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.050
And finally, before I let you go,

75
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.010
I want to say thank you.

76
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.050
Your time is very valuable,

77
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.080
and the fact that you would spend it

78
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.070
watching this course with me

79
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.090
actually means a lot to me,

80
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.090
and as such, I want you to know

81
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.080
that my commitment to you doesn't end

82
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.030
when you're done watching this course.

83
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.050
Often, I reach out to people who ask me questions

84
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.010
through the use of GitHub or LinkedIn Learning

85
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.040
or the many other ways you can get a hold of me,

86
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.020
and I provided you some great contact points

87
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.080
where you can look at what I've done,

88
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.060
you can look at the questions I've answered,

89
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.040
you can look at who I'm following on Twitter

90
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.040
and some of the things that I talk about

91
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.090
with software development.

92
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.010
So once again, thank you for your time,

93
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.080
and get started with design patterns,

94
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.000
especially in the Spring framework.
