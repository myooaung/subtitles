00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
- [Frank] Writing good object-oriented software today

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.020
can benefit greatly from the use of design patterns.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.040
These patterns have evolved and been refined

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.070
to solve consistent problems that routinely pop up

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.030
when writing software.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.040
As with most quality frameworks,

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.050
the Spring framework leverages many design patterns

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.050
and integrates them into the consumption

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
of the framework as well.

10
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.040
In this course, I will show you the value

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.090
of these design patterns,

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080
how you could exploit them for your own efficiencies,

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.060
and how you can use the power of the framework,

14
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.020
along with common design patterns,

15
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.040
to solve problems quicker, more efficiently,

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.050
and in a way that other developers will clearly understand.

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.070
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.050
I'm a software developer and architect

19
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.060
who leverages rapid development practices,

20
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.040
including design patterns, to build large, robust,

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000
and highly-available distributed systems.
