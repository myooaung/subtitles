00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] In order to be truly successful

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.040
in this course,

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.080
there's a few things that you need to know.

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.010
First it's standard Java knowledge.

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.080
And when I say standard, I'm expecting you

6
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.010
to be a little bit more than beginner,

7
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.000
but maybe not advanced when it comes to Java knowledge,

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.080
because we're going to leverage it

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.040
to do all of our object-oriented development.

10
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.030
I do expect you to know Java 1.8 language constructs.

11
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.080
Now you can use Java 11 for most of our examples

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.030
without any issue,

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.030
but Java 1.8 is what I'm going to focus on

14
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080
as it still seems to be the most common

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.070
in everyday use.

16
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.060
And for this course, indeed, we will be using JDK 8

17
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.010
for all of our examples.

18
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.040
Now I do expect you to have some basic understanding

19
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.070
of the Spring framework.

20
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.060
Consider my course, Learning Spring with Spring Boot

21
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.020
if you haven't worked with Spring a lot

22
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.000
or you want a little bit of a refresher

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.040
on how the framework itself works

24
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.020
and how to use it for rapid application development

25
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.000
because in this course, we're going to leverage Spring Boot

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.090
to get up to speed quick with the Spring framework.

27
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090
Now we can't talk about design patterns

28
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.010
without understanding object-oriented programming,

29
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.030
and as such, I'm going to expect you

30
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.060
to be able to leverage OOP in practice.

31
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
Some basic understanding of design patterns,

32
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.050
what they are, or how they operate,

33
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
or even why we would use them will be helpful,

34
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.050
but not really required

35
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.030
because I'm going to talk through 'em

36
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.000
as we go through each of our design patterns.

37
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And with that, we're ready to jump in.
