Hello and welcome to this new lecture and this quick to tell me all I would like to introduce you to

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,300
a great member of the team Aleksey Jack.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:16,020
The reason I want to introduce you to him is that he is not only a great contributor of the torch community

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,790
but he's also a great contributor of discourse.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,050
He's actually the one behind the virtual platform and we gave him the responsibility to prepare the

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,550
right models for you.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,670
So not only I'm happy to introduce you to him but also I would like to thank him so much for making

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,560
this course such a great course and decided to bring so much improvement to this course.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,290
Thanks to the virtual platform.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,010
So Alex thank you so much.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,650
And now I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to show you his passion and his work so you

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,080
can find Alexi actually on two Web.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,950
First his own Web site which you can find that HTP as Cullens fleshless.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,880
Alexis dush Jack dad kid have that.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,660

That's his Web site.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,440

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,690
Also his publications and in his research you'll see that he's actually a Ph.D. students at the EPA.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,610
Felt one of the best universities in the world.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,990
He's actually doing a Ph.D. in robotics about human robot interactions so you can be convinced of his

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,140
talent and his high skills in the machine learning and robotics world.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,110
And funny note actually before doing his Ph.D. He was actually doing the semester of research as me.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,340
And before that we actually did the same Bachelor of mathematics.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,610
So there we go a very similar background as mine then you can see some of his publications and then

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,930
you can also see his get her page where you will see that he is actually a very active member of the

29
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,340
You can check that from the get her page this page you can find it at H to CBS Kunstler slash.

30
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,200
Get to have that.

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,160
Slash Alexie hyphen Jack I highly recommend that you have a look.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,470
He's a great programmer great machinery and scientists and also a great pedagogue.

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,610
So Carol and I were super happy to work with him.
