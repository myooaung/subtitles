00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.700
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.970
So in the previous tutorial we started to define our detect function which takes as input the grade

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.510
that is the black and white image.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.780
And that same original image which is frame and we started to get the faces to apples which are not

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.120
only the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle that will detect the face but also the

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.910
width and the height of these rectangles.

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.070
So we got this things to detect Montell method.

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.100
And now we're going to start a full loop that will iterate through these faces and for each of these

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.360
faces we're going to draw a rectangle and we will detect some eyes.

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.820
So let's start this for loop four and we're going to iterate through the faces and as we said faces

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.640
are tables of four elements x and y which are the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle

12
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.520
detecting the face w which will be the width of the rectangle and H which will be the height of this

13
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.390
rectangle.

14
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:14.100
So for X Y W and H N then obviously faces because spaces contains exactly the Stupples of x y w an edge.

15
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.260
So that's it that's the beginning of the follow up.

16
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.810
And now we are ready to enter inside the loop to say what we want to do at each step.

17
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870
That is for each faces.

18
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.420
So the first thing we want to do very simply is to draw the rectangle.

19
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.860
And actually this is very simple that's why we're using Open City.

20
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.700
We have a function for this which is the rectangle function very simply.

21
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.000
So what we need to do what we simply need to do is take C-v to our opens the module then do that and

22
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.970
then this rectangle function and this rectangle function takes several arguments.

23
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.820
The first one is frame of course you know we want to specify on which image we want to draw the rectangle.

24
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.830
Our ISO frame is our first argument and then we need to input several more arguments.

25
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.730
The second one is the coordinates of the upper left corner of the rectangle and that we have it because

26
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.440
that's exactly X and Y.

27
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.750
So that second argument is exactly the couple of these coordinates x and y.

28
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.780
So that's the second argument.

29
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.970
Then the third argument is going to be the couple of coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangle.

30
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:37.630
And that we can get it by taking x plus w and y s h because W is the with and h is the height.

31
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.650
So that gives us exactly the coordinates of the lower right corner of the rectangle.

32
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.780
Then we need to pick a color for the rectangle.

33
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.840
So that's going to be exactly our next argument.

34
00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:00.590
And you know to specify a color we need to use RGV code 255 0 0 and then for the X we'll pick a different

35
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.960
color we'll pick for example green to zero here to Phi Phi here and 0.

36
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.030
But anyway that's the fourth argument for the color.

37
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.330
And then we need to put one last argument which is not very important bresh is going to be the thickness

38
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.590
of the edges of the rectangles.

39
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.490
So we're going to pick two is just in order to have some nice rectangles and that's very important that

40
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.130
just for the form but two is a good choice.

41
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.900
You will get some nice rectangles for the faces.

42
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.680
All right so congratulations.

43
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.060
We actually detected the faces draw the rectangles.

44
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.000
Now we're going to do the same for the eyes.

45
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.380
But as we said in the previous tutorial or tutorials before.

46
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.970
Well we're going to do that in the referential of the face to save some computation time.

47
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.900
So we will take care of these eyes in the next toils.

48
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.900
And until then and joy can be division.
