Hello and welcome to this new tutorial and this toile we're going to create the brain of our discriminator

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,740
now that we have the class.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,590
But the thing is I might break the record for the fastest to toil in the world because actually we already

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,670
have everything.

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,490
There is nothing more easy to create the brain of the discriminator because basically that's exactly

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,540
the same as what we did for the brain of the generator.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,690
We simply need to choose a new name.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,810
We're going to call it net D.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,250
Obviously we need to create an object of the class corresponding to the discriminator that contains

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,060
the architecture of the neural network and the void function.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,860
And then that's the same here.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,430
We're going to take our discriminator object and apply the weights in a function that will initialize

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,190
the weights the proper way.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,000
And here we are done with the creation of the brain of the discriminator.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,500
So now huge congratulations.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,940
You created two brains.

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,650
It's now time to train them make them smart and actually make them artists because they will actually

18
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,110
generate some art by creating some fake images.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,520
But you're going to see that these are actually going to be some beautiful images.

20
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,160
I mean some images that look like something.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,910
So again I have to insist.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,150
Congratulations because not only have created two brains but also you are done with the first huge step

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,720
of this implementation.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,160
If we want to divide this implementation into two big parts Well I would say that the first big part

25
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,080
is the creation of these two brains.

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,700
And the second part is the training of these two brains.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,340
So you're done with the first big part because you have created these two brains.

28
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,040
And now we're going to move on to the second part to train these two brains.

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,220
And of course train them according to the process of degenerative adversarial networks and let's give

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,840
a quick reminder of what this process is about this process is two big steps.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,040
The first step is to update the weight of the discriminator neural network and that consists of maximizing

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,510
the error calculated by the B.C.E..

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,420
You will see that.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,910
And the second big part and then the second big step of this process is to have data weights of this

35
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,370
time the generator which again will consist of maximizing the area calculated by the bacillus.

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,010
All right so if you accept take the challenge to train this brain will join me for the second part of

37
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,430
this implementation and so I'll you very soon to make our decisions the greatest artist of all the computer

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,420
vision models.

39
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,460
Until then enjoy computer vision.
