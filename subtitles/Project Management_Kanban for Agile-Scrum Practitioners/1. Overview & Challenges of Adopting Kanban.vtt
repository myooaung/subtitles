00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.050
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.190
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.430
I will be presenting Preparing for Organizational Challenges in the course

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.640
Kanban for Agile Scrum Practitioners. This module will provide the awareness to

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.050
challenges that may obstruct or impede your adoption of kanban and offer

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.840
recommendations and techniques to mitigate them.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.070
How you fit into your organization may reveal the

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.020
challenges or approaches that lie ahead for you.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.950
Maybe you are presently using kanban to various degrees of maturity.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.090
Every organization may be a little different.

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.990
If so,

12
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.930
you are likely able to apply what you've learned in this course moving forward.

13
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.640
Perfect.

14
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.180
Or you are a technical lead or manager with decision‑making

15
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.370
responsibility on software development processes.

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.270
In this case, you might have a challenge,

17
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.140
but not necessarily with the prerequisite to get management approval.

18
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.770
But you may need to lead or guide your team to adopt new kanban techniques.

19
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.850
Lastly, if you are not using kanban presently,

20
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.370
you may have even a greater organizational challenge ahead of you.

21
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.840
You may have to both convince your management and your team

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.040
before you can move forward with adopting kanban.

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.950
Here are two key adoption challenges you may encounter. First

24
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.360
and foremost will be management. If managements says no to

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.670
kanban or you have kanban now,

26
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.150
but they are not comfortable to making it, say, more complicated, their words

27
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.460
in their minds, that might inhibit you from moving forward.

28
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.230
Another adoption challenge, assuming you have management's

29
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.150
acceptance, is getting buy‑in from your teammates.

30
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.320
Sometimes this is the hardest hurdle to overcome.

31
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.840
This module will address these challenges and how you might surmount them.

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.010
Change anyone?

33
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.830
Well, let's see how that might go.

34
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.420
Who wants change?

35
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.600
Usually everyone wants change, management and the teams.

36
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.140
Everyone is raising their hands on that question.

37
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.190
Who wants to change? Well, most people seem to want someone

38
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.640
else to change. So you need a change agent.

39
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.140
That is someone who transforms the department or organization

40
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.860
by focusing on organizational effectiveness,

41
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.120
improvement, and development, that is implementing kanban. Well,

42
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.710
that person is you.

43
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.440
Lastly, who wants to lead the change?

44
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
Sometimes everyone runs for cover. And again, that person will be you,

45
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.380
leading the transition to kanban. Here are the topics of this

46
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.330
module: obtaining acceptance, it all matters, plan,

47
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.680
prepare and present; implementing kanban; and

48
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.000
measuring success, metrics and reporting. Okay, let's get started.
