00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,640
Defining your value stream endpoints is a critical activity

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,940
for the success of your Kanban system.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,130
We already defined and discussed what a value stream is,

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,630
and I gave you some examples in the module Kanban 201,

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,840
but in this section we want to talk about the endpoints where the

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,340
stuff comes in and where the stuff goes out.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,900
Let's start by defining the endpoints of your value stream.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,440
Determine where to start in in your value stream.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,560
That's important.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,090
That process is what you will visualize from the step when you

11
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,840
receive work until you deliver that work.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,240
Hence,

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,910
you need to define your interface points upstream and downstream with

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,140
your coworkers or possibly other external partners.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,130
Recommendation.

16
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,840
Adopt your workflow within your control.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,170
You will likely not be successful by enlarging the workflow value

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,150
stream to areas where you cannot control the work,

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,110
cannot control someone else's team, their resources,

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,870
and budgets, and things like that.

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,050
Now that could be different if the upstream partner,

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,780
for example, was also a Kanban team, think about that,

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,440
but that topic is outside the scope of this course.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,730
Now let's look at an example of a value stream with endpoints.

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,390
You will discuss and negotiate with your upstream

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,570
partners who are providing requirements,

27
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,700
prioritization,

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,150
and other project artifacts such as budgets and resources potentially as well.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,420
Here is your value stream, and in this example,

30
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,010
I am showing a simplistic value stream composed of specify,

31
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,440
implement, and validate.

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,440
This is where you have control and influence over analysis,

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,210
design, coding, and testing.

34
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,180
Lastly, your downstream partner could be operations,

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,630
those who put things into production release,

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,180
or even your end users.

37
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,930
So as this bracket is showing, the orange boxes are what's in your control,

38
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,840
and therefore, in your value stream.

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,990
Here are the key points of value stream endpoints.

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,360
By defining boundaries,

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,040
you are asking your team to adopt limiting work in

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,680
progress only for your value stream.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,080
You can't ask your upstream or downstream partners to do that.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,240
You are asking your partners to interact in a way that supports Kanban.

45
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,890
Again, you don't need to tell them that you're using Kanban,

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,190
but you are asking them to provide you what you need

47
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,680
that would support a pull system, and on the other end,

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
a way to deliver what you have produced.

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,180
Value stream mapping is an extremely valuable component of Kanban.

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,330
It is a significant part of achieving continuous

51
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,240
improvement of the way you work.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,640
It allows you to visualize and bound your process, your value stream.

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,550
It helps you optimize the way you deliver value to your customers.

54
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,690
So designing your value stream in conjunction with determining those

55
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,800
endpoints and negotiating with your upstream and downstream partners is

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,640
critical to the success of your value stream.

57
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,940
So don't just map your value stream and forget all about the

58
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,000
endpoints and your up or downstream partners. That would be a grave error.
