1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,890
Scrum versus Lean.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,600
Scrub is a software development framework following the principles of Agile.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,770
But it is a bit rigid and has rules that you must follow.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,330
Don't get me wrong, I really like Agile/Scum practices,

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,480
and they've been a big leap over waterfall or Scrum‑a‑fall

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,410
or even if you roll your own process.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,410
Now lean is all about process optimization and waste reduction,

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,920
whatever the process is.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,640
And for this course, the process is going to be system development.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,860
But keep in mind lean can apply to any workflow process.

11
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,350
So what you learn in this course can be repurposed to

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,480
any workflow from building cars, software,

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,890
or even to your personal projects at home.

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,510
Now we will contrast Agile/Scrum with kanban in a later module,

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,940
so hang in there.

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,190
I have worked in the information technology field for a very long time.

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,090
In every circumstance, every company, every organization is very different.

18
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,630
People have different experiences, skills, and capabilities.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,180
Projects have different scope, budgets, schedules, and more.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,240
Companies have different customers, suppliers, goals, and markets.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,690
So,

22
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,630
strictly adhering to a prescriptive software development process for our team

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,440
is just too rigid and is not as efficient as it should be.

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,920
Because everything and everybody is different,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,500
you need a very flexible and adaptable approach,

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,040
and that's kanban.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,860
Kanban is a method that can be used to create a process which will always

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,970
be unique to the problem and to the resources available.

29
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,260
So kanban is not a process in and of itself.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,700
Kanban is a practice that symbolizes a principle and is flexible and adaptable

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,820
based on the challenge at hand and the necessary resources.

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,550
Still a little fuzzy understanding kanban?

33
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, that is why you're here, and by the end of this course, you will have a very solid grasp of kanban.
