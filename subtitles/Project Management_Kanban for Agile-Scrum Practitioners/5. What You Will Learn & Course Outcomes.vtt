00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.440
Here is the course overview and what you'll be

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.800
learning. Kanban 201: Taking It Up a Notch.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.230
Here we'll do a deeper dive into kanban.

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.390
Transitioning From Waterfall to Kanban. This module is well suited if

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.520
you're coming from a more traditional or ad hoc development approach.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.340
Transitioning From Agile/Scrum to Kanban.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.740
This module is targeted for those coming from the Agile/Scrum world.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.650
Either way, I wouldn't skip either of these two modules.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.720
There are many key nuggets of information that you just don't want to miss.

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.890
Managing Your Workflow. In this module, we'll move through a complete

11
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.250
scenario of using kanban, a great module indeed.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.540
Preparing for Organizational Challenges.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.310
Yes,

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.520
being unaware of the politics or organizational environment may

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.040
severely impede your efforts to use kanban successfully.

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.370
I will show you how to succeed. Lastly, Applying Key Learning Objectives.

17
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.840
Basically, I'll sum up the course with key takeaways.

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.030
What is your development approach today?

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.480
As the title of this course suggests,

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
this course is geared for Agile/Scrum practitioners,

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.150
such as developers, analysts,

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.990
maybe even project managers, and the entire world of engineers.

23
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.260
If you, on the other hand,

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.830
use a more waterfall approach or a blend that's

25
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.290
sometimes called Scrum‑a‑fall, perfect.

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.370
I've included a module to help guide you into the world of kanban. And lastly,

27
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.000
you might use other disciplines, even roll your own,

28
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.620
and that is just fine.

29
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.250
This course will provide the information you will need to

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.620
jump‑start or enhance your kanban knowledge and skills.

31
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.840
So whatever your development background may be, kanban is

32
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.740
definitely a practice you want to add to your tool belt.

33
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.150
Here is the course outcome. When you have completed this course,

34
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.180
you will have the skills and knowledge in how to design, execute,

35
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:58.000
and deliver high‑quality kanban systems. Up next, Kanban 201: Taking It Up a Notch. See you there.
