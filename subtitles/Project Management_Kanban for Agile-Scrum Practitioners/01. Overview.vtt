Hello, and welcome.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.270
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.470
I will be presenting Managing Your Workflow in the course,

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.750
Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners. In this module, I will

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.080
provide you the knowledge to design,

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.040
implement, and operate an efficient kanban value stream.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.340
In other words, from soup to nuts.

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.370
Here are the topics of this module: Defining Your Value

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.550
Stream Endpoints, Managing Work Types, Done Means Done,

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.420
Limiting Your Work In Progress,

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.770
Managing Variability, Cumulative Flow Diagrams, Forecasting Future Work,

12
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.510
Dealing with Bottlenecks, and Handling Blockers & Spikes.

13
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.040
Okay, let's get started.

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
What Kanban "Is" and "Isn't".

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.920
Do not think of kanban as a project management methodology.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.870
Do not think of kanban as a software development lifecycle process.

17
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.750
Kanban is a technique to manage change by varying, amending,

18
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:10.000
modifying, and adjusting your process as business evolves. Please keep that keenly in mind throughout this module.
