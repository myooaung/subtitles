00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.070
Now let's talk about limiting work‑in‑progress,

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.640
one of the more interesting topics to me.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.550
Let's explore how Kanban limits work. A resource, a person,

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.820
works on one and only one work item at a time.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.160
No exceptions.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.840
Wouldn't you just love to do that?

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.830
I know most probably work on several things at once,

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.150
usually at the expense of quality.

9
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.330
A person, a resource, pulls or takes new work from the done

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.790
buffer only when they have completed their current work item.

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.090
No two work items at the same time.

12
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.970
And lastly, the maximum number of work items is set for each workflow step.

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.540
You know, a couple slides ago we talked about the capacity for each step.

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.070
So that is the definition of limiting work‑in‑progress.

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.140
Very simple and very easy to understand.

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.340
Here's our board.

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.640
So we're going to limit the work‑in‑progress for each workflow step.

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.470
We have done the initial analysis of the work we have ahead of

19
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.280
us and we have made the following decisions.

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.120
So in this case,

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.530
we need two resources for the specify step, we need three

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.790
resources for the implement step, and we determined we need

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.820
one resource for the validate step.

24
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.610
So, our six resources equals our value stream capacity. Now,

25
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.440
we have chosen these limits by reviewing the backlog, reviewing our

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.940
resources, and what we expect the flow of work to be.

27
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.530
Here's our board once again.

28
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.200
Now let's annotate the board further and add more visual cues.

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.930
Here's our work‑in‑progress limits per step.

30
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.750
Now let's add the done rules right on the board.

31
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.080
I added them on the bottom in blue.

32
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.140
This is important since you want the team to easily see and

33
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.470
fully understand the done rules while the stand‑up is in action

34
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.940
or when they view the board either in person or online. No one

35
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.340
needs to remember anything.

36
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.640
All the information is right on the board.

37
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.490
These are the same done rules from an earlier slide.

38
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090
Here's another way to illustrate capacity. So let's

39
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.300
remove the work‑in‑progress limits.

40
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.330
So now the black boxes are gone.

41
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.020
Instead,

42
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.300
we will place the maximum number of work items per step above the column. So

43
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.530
you can see the blue boxes above our steps, 2, 3, and 1,

44
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.590
respectively.

45
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.030
So we have our backlog on the left showing priority work items,

46
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.590
we are using color cards to illustrate the work type, we have

47
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.880
divided our steps into two sub columns, WIP and DONE,

48
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.400
we have added our done rules to the bottom, and now added our

49
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.800
work‑in‑progress limits to the top of each column.

50
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.340
Wow, looks like it's time to get to work.

51
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.040
Why is limiting work so important to a successful Kanban system?

52
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.640
Well,

53
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.730
let me tell you. Limiting work‑in‑progress allows you to

54
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.490
complete single work items faster.

55
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.210
This approach helps you focus only on current work items.

56
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.740
This enables locating and reducing bottlenecks as well because

57
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.280
you can see things stack up in the buffers.

58
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.610
The buffers are the done columns.

59
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.440
Improved workflow and quality will shorten lead

60
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.160
times and improve predictability.

61
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.740
Also,

62
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.950
regular cadence and delivery will build trust with customers and build

63
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.810
trust with upstream and downstream partners alike.

64
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.000
Limiting work‑in‑progress supports higher quality and better workflow performance.
