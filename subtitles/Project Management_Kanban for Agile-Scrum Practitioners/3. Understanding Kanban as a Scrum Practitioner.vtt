00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's talk about understanding and learning kanban from the

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.440
point of view of a scrum practitioner.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.570
Here are some key differences between kanban and agile scrum. Time‑boxing

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
causes artificial constraints on project changes, customer feedback,

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.230
release dates, and any process improvements.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
Ideally, you want to handle issues with those topics as they arise,

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
but typically they're on hold into the end of the sprint, the end of

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.960
the retrospective, or even you've got to wait all the way until the

9
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.640
sprint planning meeting or, maybe worse,

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.940
pushed off to the following sprint. That might be okay of things run smoothly,

11
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.500
but as we know, projects seldom run perfectly.

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.640
That's just life.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
Kanban removes the artificial sprint time‑box boundary,

14
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.340
and the other events, like retrospectives,

15
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.900
reviews, etc., while keeping the workflow moving forward smoothly.

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.190
Remove doesn't mean eliminate. Issues with workflow are discussed daily

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.200
and not put off until an agile scrum meeting or event.

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.710
Since so many of the basics of kanban are like agile scrum,

19
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.090
just refining your knowledge and skills without making any major adjustments,

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.110
I think, will work just fine.

21
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.390
So rest easy.

22
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.410
Transitioning to kanban should go pretty smooth for you.

23
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.830
Now a big plus is that kanban can identify and correct

24
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.230
workflow issues more quickly, which is better for the team,

25
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.140
better for the customer, and better for the organization.

26
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.140
Alright, let's continue this theme on the next slide.

27
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.000
Here are a few more key differences between kanban and agile scrum.

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.040
Kanban explicitly defines what done means for each step.

29
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.810
This is huge and creates succinct handoffs between workflow steps.

30
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.000
All information will be visible and trackable on the board.

31
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.250
Now that's not unlike agile scrum,

32
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.710
but yet it's still different. With agile scrum, the visual

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.440
boards are only visual control systems,

34
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.070
and the boards do not reflect or support limiting work in progress and no

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.620
signaling mechanism to move work forward, and kanban does both.

36
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.390
Each step will have two columns, work in progress,

37
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.650
WIP, and done, including the done rules, in other words what it

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.680
means to be done. When the item arrives in the done bucket, that is

39
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.240
the signal that work can move forward.

40
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.900
Now each work‑in‑progress column will have limits on how much

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.700
work can be in progress, and so you can also see visually the

42
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.620
limits on the board and determine any adjustments to make, both

43
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.090
extremely powerful concepts.

44
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.140
Intrigued? Well good. Much more to come on those topics.

45
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.060
Kanban is always focused on value‑driven outcomes and the elimination of waste.

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.110
The work in progress limits and done rules enable and

47
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.570
drive early issue identification,

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.240
and the design of kanban enables a continuous workflow.

49
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.830
So if you think about it, it's like having one continuous sprint.

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.040
Think about it for a minute.

51
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.980
Interesting, huh?

52
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.040
One continuous flow.

53
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.340
Let's emphasize the benefits of using work‑in‑progress limits and done rules.

54
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.210
Every work item is production‑ready the day it is completed.

55
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.690
There are clear done rules through each step of development,

56
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.080
each step of your workflow process.

57
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.990
There are no artificial time boundaries, that is no

58
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.030
time‑boxing. Customer feedback is welcome daily,

59
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.000
and there is no waiting for an end‑of‑sprint demo or sprint planning meeting. Each and every day is value added.
