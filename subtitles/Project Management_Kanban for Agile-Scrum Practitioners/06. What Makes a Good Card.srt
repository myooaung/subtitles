1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,450
Let's see what the attributes are that make up a good card.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,870
A card represents a discrete work item that adds value to the business,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,260
plus contains additional information.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,310
The design of the card is important, you want it to be easy to read,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,920
understand, and to take action upon.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,910
The card must convey enough key information to facilitate a smooth

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,540
workflow and support a clear decision‑making process.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,210
And lastly, the card typically varies by work type or work source,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,280
skills needed, and other attributes,

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,910
and those variations should be visually evident, so

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,340
you definitely want to be creative.

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,470
You can annotate your kanban cards to contain a brief

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,020
but rich amount of information,

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,630
choose annotations that make sense to you and your team to

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,920
help you make timely and quality decisions.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,930
Now let's pull a card forward in our value stream,

17
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,810
and let's blow up the card so we can see some detail. First,

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,340
maybe we want to have an item number for reference,

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,540
an item title or name, maybe the backlog date,

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,660
the start date when we first pulled it forward,

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,770
days and work, hey, who's working that item,

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,780
who owns it, related or independent tasks or dependent tasks,

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,550
the estimate of the size of work, and in this case,

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,050
medium, and maybe in the upper‑right corner,

25
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,210
an alert symbol,

26
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,840
an exclamation mark, if the days and work is greater than the average lead time.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,100
Now,

28
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,560
be creative. It is up to you and your team to do whatever you

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,890
need to have the most relevant information to maximize the

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,860
smooth running of your workflow.

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:40,000
So if you are selecting a digital kanban tool, be sure you pick one with the greatest flexibility to meet your needs.
