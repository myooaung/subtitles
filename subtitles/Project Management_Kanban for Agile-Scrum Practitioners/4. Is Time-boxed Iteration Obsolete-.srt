1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,010
Let me pose a question to you.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:09,050
Is time‑boxed iteration dead or obsolete. With waterfall, one iteration

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,650
of say 1000 requirements was the approach to get a project done. With

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,630
Agile/Scrum, maybe it was 10 iterations of 100 requirements with each

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,400
iteration being about 2 to 3 weeks.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,950
So, would maybe 50 iterations of 20 requirements be

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,560
better? Hmm, where does this end? Well, the answer lies in this course.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,340
Well, I'll give you the answer, so join me on our

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,480
journey into the world of kanban.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,570
Let's cover the key benefits of using kanban. Kanban

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,060
enhances a team's ability to focus.

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,490
I think we all focus better when you have a visual dimension

13
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,850
with only the critical data on the board.

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,000
Kanban offers flexibility and ease of use.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,490
There is no perfect way to do kanban.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,660
Shape it for your team's effectiveness? Sounds agile to me.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,650
Kanban provides easy‑to‑comprehend visuals.

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,280
Visuals are simple and clear and therefore easy to understand.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,290
I am a very visual person, so I love it.

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,020
Kanban focuses on continuous delivery. With kanban, you see the flow

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,140
of work from backlog to delivery or completion,

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,500
and you see each step of your delivery process very easily.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,300
Kanban reduces wasted work and time.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,550
I truly believe it saves time and money. And kanban

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,700
also enables great team collaboration.

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,080
Kanban increases productivity and efficiency.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,390
Because of the items I mentioned above,

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,240
you will see an increase of productivity. Also,

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,700
what people don't always realize, doing the wrong work

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,440
at the wrong time isn't work at all.

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:52,000
It's just waste. Kanban helps doing the right work at the right time for the right reason.
