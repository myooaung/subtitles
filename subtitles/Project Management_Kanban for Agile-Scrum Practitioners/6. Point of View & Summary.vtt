00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.480
Here is my point of view.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.070
Politics and organizations are a fact of life, so be aware of your

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.400
surroundings, find allies and supporters from other people,

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.050
managers, and leaders.

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.940
Sometimes it might actually be harder to convince developers than managers,

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.190
so be prepared for some amount of resistance,

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.320
which can be managed and dealt with by providing education,

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.190
information,

9
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.260
training examples, and experts to coach the team along. Metrics and

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.210
reporting progress is mandatory for your success.

11
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.180
Don't shoot from the hip on this one.

12
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.090
Ensure that everyone is okay with being patient and

13
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510
allowing time for kanban to take hold.

14
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.220
Otherwise, it might appear that kanban is making things worse.

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.540
Okay, now let's summarize this module.

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.590
Here are the key points of this module.

17
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.150
Management buy‑in will take some preparation.

18
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.520
Management can be focused on risk aversion and the bottom line of the business,

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.090
so you'll need to prepare.

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.460
I have illustrated in this module that I recommend a

21
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.340
presentation format and not an email or a letter.

22
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.490
I want you to stand up and present and hit each point of their

23
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.310
concerns face to face with good eye contact.

24
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.160
Next is team acceptance.

25
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.690
Many of us have been building the applications and systems for many years,

26
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.680
so this change could be daunting.

27
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.260
I discussed the phases of change and, in particular, the ADKAR model.

28
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.020
Be aware of those phases so you can prepare to coach and support your team

29
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.920
through the change. Either starting out for the first time with kanban or

30
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.660
ramping up, start prudently by first using a pilot. Select your team and the

31
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.490
value stream that they'll be working on.

32
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.060
The results of the pilot are to evaluate feasibility to management,

33
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.020
educate, and train your team.

34
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.780
Also,

35
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.860
to identify where you need to change or improve your approach. It is important

36
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.170
to measure your success through applying some simple metrics.

37
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.320
This will instill trusted management and self‑confidence in your team,

38
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.690
both valuable.

39
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.890
Now let's see what's coming up in the next module.

40
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.000
Up next is the final module on Applying Key Learning Objectives. See you there.
