00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,030
I would like to quickly suggest several companion courses that can enhance your

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:11,820
skills and capabilities while using kanban. The course, Developing Effective

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,780
Agile Sprint Plans, will give you insight into Agile and sprint planning that

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,710
you need to help better relate and communicate with your Agile dev teams in

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,950
their transition to kanban. The course,

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,470
Project Management for Software Engineers, will give you insight into

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,640
traditional project management that you need to help better relate and

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,700
communicate with your traditional dev teams in their transition to

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,570
kanban. It never hurts to hone your estimation skills no matter what

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,590
development approach you are taking. You might want to consider this

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,220
course, Best Practices for Project Estimation. Leadership and

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,620
Communication Skills.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,820
Everything we talked about in this entire course has an

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,930
underpinning and requirement for strong and dynamic

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,780
leadership and communication skills,

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,080
especially when you are trying to influence management and your

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,500
dev team during your transition to kanban.

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,690
So check out the course, Leadership and

19
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,540
Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,740
You won't regret it.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,420
It never hurts to brush up on your requirements analysis

22
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,470
skills to help you on the specify step,

23
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,360
so check out the course, Best Practices for Requirements

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,710
Gathering. Here are some examples of some of the top tools

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,050
that may help you get started.

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,950
Please do your own research because everyone's requirements are different.

27
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,180
Also, this should be used just as a starting point,

28
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,000
and I don't promote any of these tools. This is for your reference and further discovery.
