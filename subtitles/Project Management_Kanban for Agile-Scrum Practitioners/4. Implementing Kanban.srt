1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,630
Implementing Kanban.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:06,900
Okay, so you have management's approval and the team is willing to begin.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,540
Let's discuss some ideas on how to make this happen.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,470
I am a big believer in pilots, which is a small‑scale preliminary activity.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,120
Whether you are starting from scratch or want to enhance

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,810
your current usage of Kanban, I would recommend using a

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,890
pilot approach to get things started.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,510
The purpose of a pilot is to evaluate feasibility, duration,

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,050
cost,

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,190
adverse effects, and use the feedback to improve upon the

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,820
initial parameters and expectations of the pilot.

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,540
Determine your baseline metrics.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,310
Here are a few examples, your current velocity,

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,780
that is how much work are you producing now so that you can compare against

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,780
your production of work with Kanban, amount of new bugs per week, with

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,740
Kanban we expect them to go down certainly, or even customer satisfaction.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,540
Measure your customer satisfaction before the pilot and after the pilot.

18
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,210
Track your pilot project and compare the results with your baseline metrics

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,750
to see any improvements.

20
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,350
And in this example we chose three metrics, the amount of work completed,

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,940
the number of bugs, and customer satisfaction.

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,440
Now this may take time so be patient because it takes time for people to

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,120
learn and apply new methods and techniques. Maybe your pilot is between

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,890
three and six months. So your pilot is a success.

25
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,350
And here are a few more ideas about a rollout plan. Continue

26
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,300
to brief managers and team members on Kanban, the benefits

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,400
and the pilot and usage outcomes,

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,940
maybe monthly. Provide Kanban training, in person or online, consultants, and,

29
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,890
most importantly,

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,170
hands‑on, real life practical experience using Kanban. Don't wait,

31
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,210
just do it.

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,820
Organize the backlog, document your value stream,

33
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,250
set up the board, determine the WIP limits,

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,360
create done criteria, and go. Run daily stand‑ups, make

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,480
course corrections, review metrics,

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,990
status your team and management on performance improvements or issues.

37
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,650
If you're starting from scratch, what kind of team members do you want?

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:01,310
If you have the opportunity to pick and choose your own team members,

39
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,960
this slide will help you do that. Or, since you may not have this luxury,

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,390
this slide will also help you frame the message to

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,510
them and prepare them for Kanban.

42
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,090
Here are the attributes of team members that may adapt well to Kanban,

43
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,040
people who are comfortable to think for themselves,

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,570
people secure to design their own destiny,

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,830
those that can make real time reflections on what is happening and

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,560
make changes accordingly, those that feel it's okay to evolve the

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,570
value stream as necessary, those that can work without a more rigid

48
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,740
process such as Scrum or Waterfall.

49
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,250
Ensure your team is in alignment with your Kanban vision and that they

50
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,940
know your longer‑term vision and outcome as well.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,440
Also,

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,210
there are people that like and want to be held

53
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,870
accountable and they embrace responsibility.

54
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,630
I love those kinds of people.

55
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,150
Okay,

56
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,400
people that exhibit most or all of these attributes will serve you well

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,360
and your organization. Change can be difficult for people so be aware of

58
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,120
naysayers. A naysayer is someone who criticizes, objects to, or opposes

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,620
something, and in this case, Kanban.

60
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,480
Some people may resist change as a political strategy

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,340
to prove that the decision is wrong.

62
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,110
They may also resist to show that the person leading the change

63
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,840
is not up to the task, that could be you.

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,780
Others may resist because they lose some power in the organization.

65
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,770
So a solution to this may be education, training,

66
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,340
coaching, one‑on‑one support, long term career benefits,

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,940
satisfaction of the personal challenge.

68
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,480
Please listen to any naysayers' feedback.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,500
Some may be very important and beneficial. So be a good listener,

70
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,740
incorporate their concerns if possible, and lead them forward.

71
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,780
Here is another tool that might help with major

72
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,970
changes to the way people do things, these are phases to change.

73
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,420
And I really like the change model called ADKAR and here it

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,350
is. Awareness of the need for change, desire to support the change,

75
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,770
knowledge of how to change, ability to demonstrate skills and

76
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,670
behaviors, and reinforcement to make the change hold.

77
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,070
Change will happen if these steps are followed.

78
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,370
Awareness and desire alone is not enough.

79
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,770
So when you prepare your communications and implementation planning,

80
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,510
keep these in mind. They will be a very helpful template.

81
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,370
Lastly, if you want to learn more about this topic,

82
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,680
please check out ProSci at the URL below. Do not underestimate how

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,000
resistance to change from senior management to the knowledge worker can affect the success of your adoption of Kanban.
