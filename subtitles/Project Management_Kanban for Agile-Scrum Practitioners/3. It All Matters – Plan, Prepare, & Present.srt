1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,340
It all matters â€‘ Michael's three Ps.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,010
So what are Michael's three Ps?

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,770
Plan, prepare, and present to management, teammates, and even customers.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,440
Don't just walk into someone's office and say, Hey, let's use Kanban.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,750
It's so cool!

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,140
Plan, prepare, and present in a professional style,

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,230
and you will be successful at either establishing or

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,980
growing Kanban in your organization.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,200
Plan and prepare your case for Kanban.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,090
Have the outcome in mind before you start your presentation.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,860
Know exactly what you want to accomplish and fully

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,100
understand your message before you begin.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,360
Who is your audience?

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,110
Know your audience and what they may expect from your presentation.

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,040
Maybe who you thought would be there is not, and maybe others have showed up.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,800
Always be prepared to adapt.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,500
As long as the core message is in your presentation,

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,570
you can use your words to evolve or adapt to reengineer your message if need be.

19
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,880
Research your topic.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,670
It's important to spend enough time collecting and confirming information in

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,710
order to speak with confidence and knowledge about Kanban.

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,140
Organize the main points in the most appropriate order.

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,020
Avoid writing complete sentences or paragraphs and prepare note cards

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,560
to help you elaborate on the information presented.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,240
Align your presentation with business interests and objectives.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,430
We've talked about that.

27
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,670
Align the benefits of Kanban to business value. Tie in in how

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,100
the application of Kanban may help meet your audience's goals.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,540
Determine your delivery medium.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,210
Use something like PowerPoint.

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,210
Your format must be easy to read and understand.

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,890
And what I have just said will be a critical element in

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,240
delivering your business case for Kanban.

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,590
Prepare your presentation.

35
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay,

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,840
I know. You thought this was a Kanban course, and now I'm

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,960
talking about how to deliver a presentation.

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,820
Okay, here are a few pointers for you.

39
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,190
Design your presentation to enhance comprehension, know your

40
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,720
audience, maintain good eye contact, engage your audience, speak

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,740
clearly and with confidence, look presentable.

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,740
Yeah, it matters more than you think.

43
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,670
And be sure the content of your presentation and the words you

44
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,560
choose include Michael's five Cs: Be clear,

45
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,080
concise, courteous, and compelling.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,890
Okay? At the bottom of the screen,

47
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,340
you'll see another one of my Pluralsight courses,

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,290
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,000
So I have a whole bunch of more information in that course if you'd like to pursue that for your presentation.
