00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,840
In this course, Kanban for Agile/Scrum Practitioners,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,290
you will learn the skills, approaches,

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,950
and techniques to advance your essential kanban capabilities to the next level.

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,690
First, we will explain that kanban is not a process in and of itself,

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,080
but is a practice that symbolizes a principle and is

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,580
flexible and adaptable based on the challenge at hand and

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,790
the necessary resources. Next,

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,220
we will discuss the approaches to moving from both waterfall and

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,970
agile/Scrum to kanban. Though agile/Scrum greatly improves

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,330
development over waterfall, we will explore how kanban takes it a

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,200
step further in improving product delivery.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,690
We will also compare Scrum events with kanban events and how kanban will

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,620
increase the workflow and productivity of development.

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,470
Next, we will go into detail on defining your value stream,

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,230
managing work types, understanding what done means, limiting work in progress,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,030
adapting to variabilities,

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,170
the benefits of cumulative flow diagrams, and how to

18
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,840
forecast future work dealing with bottlenecks,

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,640
blockers, and spikes.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,260
Finally,

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,430
the course will take you through the process of

22
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,740
implementing kanban at your workplace.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,250
This will include developing a pilot, applying metrics, and provide the

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,900
awareness to challenges that may obstruct or impede your adoption of kanban and

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,710
offer recommendations and techniques to mitigate them.

26
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,610
When you have completed this course,

27
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:40,000
you will have the skills and knowledge on how to design, execute, and deliver highâ€‘quality kanban systems.
