00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.730
After you have defined your value stream,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.370
which, by the way, you can change it anytime, you want to define your backlog.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.730
Backlogs are items listed out that are typically features, bugs,

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.920
tickets, or other units of work.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.310
Remember,

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.760
these are your value demand, something that is required or wanted of your team.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200
Now, predefined backlogs, that is your backlog may have

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.350
been predefined by someone else or just given to you by

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.030
your customers or stakeholders.

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.920
Or maybe you will determine your own backlog.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.460
That is,

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.770
you're not given anything from anyone and you will need to figure

13
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.620
out just what your backlog is by doing some planning. It may be

14
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.390
that you'll need to conduct interviews, perform research,

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.360
analysis, and more to determine the features or items in your backlog.

16
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.770
Now this may take some time,

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.360
and you may need to brush up on your requirements analysis skills,

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.670
customer interviewing skills, and identifying just who or

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.470
whom the product owner or owners may be. So, however you

20
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.100
receive or conceive of your backlog,

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.640
please plan accordingly and ensure your team has the skills

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.300
and time to perform this critical function.

23
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.790
Next,

24
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.540
each item in your backlog will have a card and it will be

25
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.150
placed in the backlog column in any order.

26
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.440
And we will talk about priorities a little bit later.

27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.880
Now you might want to check out a couple of my courses that

28
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600
might help in this area of creating a backlog.

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.400
The first, The Technical Business Analyst, and the other course,

30
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.940
Best Practices for Requirements Gathering.

31
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.860
Now let's add the backlog to our sample value stream as follows.

32
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.600
Here's our backlog and we have added it to the front of our value stream.

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.380
This is our backlog of requirements.

34
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.900
Specify the work that is necessary to implement.

35
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.280
Here in this step is where we further refine and define the work.

36
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.870
Next, we implement it. You know, we code, we develop,

37
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.660
we design databases, all those other software things.

38
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.350
Next, we validate and test the workout comes to ensure that it meets the

39
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.000
requirements and then deliver it to the customers.

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.470
And now the work is done.

41
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.050
Now, after all those discussions with customers to determine your backlog,

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.340
or you may have received a very large backlog,

43
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.660
you will likely feel overwhelmed by a ton of work coming your way.

44
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.100
That's exciting to me,

45
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.580
especially since this time you may be using Kanban for the first time and

46
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.990
therefore are providing workout comes faster with higher quality,

47
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.900
since one of the core properties of Kanban is that we will

48
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140
limit the amount of work in progress.

49
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.140
So no matter how big your backlog is, per se,

50
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.460
only so much will be flowing through the system.

51
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.370
And we're going to talk about that more throughout this module. Now

52
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.200
that we have a pretty good backlog built up, now we need to

53
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.050
determine our MVP, our minimum viable product.

54
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.140
You may have heard of this term in the Agile Scrum world,

55
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.750
and it's really the same definition. Backlog ordering is driven by the MVP.

56
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.750
This is important.

57
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.890
You will only select and pull forward items that are in the MVP.

58
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.620
Your MVP is a set, or I should say a subset, of backlog work

59
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.700
items that you must complete for release to have any viability

60
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.520
in the market or to your customer.

61
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.320
In other words,

62
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.110
the release can't be anything less. So its not a

63
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.820
Christmas list of things you may want,

64
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.460
but instead it's the got‑to‑have items for a release to meet the bare

65
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.410
minimum requirements to be practical and feasible. Come up with a fast and

66
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.340
effective way to order and prioritize your backlog.

67
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.270
No need now for large estimates,

68
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.500
but instead look at the importance to the business value.

69
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.770
Though this may take some analysis to determine,

70
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.490
but you don't want to spend too much time.

71
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.210
The must‑have MVPs we're going to call priority 1, the should haves,

72
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.780
if you will, priority 2, the would like to have,

73
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.520
if you will,

74
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.490
priority 3, and gee that's nice thanks for sharing, they have no priority at

75
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.140
all, but we might put them off into a little parking lot.

76
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.040
As we know,

77
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.320
business can change in a blink of the eye so each day when

78
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.040
stand‑ups are conducted these priorities could change.

79
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.440
I will talk more about stand‑ups later in this module.

80
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.730
Now let's take my stylized value stream and convert it to a simple Kanban board.

81
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.280
So here's our Kanban board.

82
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.060
We have our columns and our column names,

83
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.520
just like we had before, Backlog, Specify,

84
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.020
Implement,

85
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.890
Validate and Deliver. And you can see on the left we're going

86
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.130
to add now all of our backlog items. Now what we want to do

87
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.850
with those, let's mark those items.

88
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.340
Here are the priority 1 items, everything in that little box in the column.

89
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.600
Here's our priority 2 items. And lastly,

90
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.520
here's our priority 3 items. And gee that's nice items to have at the very,

91
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.040
very bottom. Those are maybe our parking lot items.

92
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.140
So we have priority 1, 2, and 3. And earlier we defined the MVP as

93
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.670
the priority 1 items. We know we have to get those six items done in

94
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:39.000
order to have a minimal viable product. This general sample and layout is what we will work with throughout this course.
