00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,140
Now for my point of view and the module summary.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,310
Here is my point of view.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,730
Here is an interesting thought.

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,870
We are likely expected to do ROIs, return on investments,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,680
for projects or determine ROIs for large features or large use cases.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,350
Certainly not a bad idea,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,040
but only if it adds value to the business and if the ROIs are

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,540
really used to make business decisions,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,310
and why waste time doing ROIs on everything,

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,880
but instead trust the business owner's judgment in prioritizing the backlog.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,850
That works, too.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,700
If an item is important and adds value to the business,

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,310
then select it and work on it, don't question it.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,420
How about aging backlog items,

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,590
maybe remove those items from the backlog after say x

16
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,910
months, or 6 months, or 9 months, you come up with your own threshold.

17
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,070
If it's just been sitting there for that long, just remove it.

18
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,740
Remember, if the business thinks it's critical important to the business,

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,480
that item or something like that item will be added back in later.

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,540
And here is another reason why detailed estimates of

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,810
everything in the backlog may, in fact, be a waste of time.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,790
Since if items have age and are never implemented,

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,400
then why do the estimate in the first place?

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,080
It might be that a product owner or customer puts an item in the backlog list,

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,000
which is a very large level of effort, indeed,

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,570
maybe it appears it is a whole new system.

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,770
Basically, you will need to make a judgment call and push back professionally.

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,040
If you have a PMO, or a project management office,

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,760
that organization should take a closer look and decide if a

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,350
whole new project needs to be approved, funded,

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,430
and resourced.

32
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,490
Remember, we talked about thresholds earlier in this module?

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,450
Some backlog items may be just too big to do without

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,780
better fiscal oversight first.

35
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,640
As you can see,

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,100
this list has a flavor of overarching policies you will need to define

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,180
and they will help guide your work from a macro level.

38
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,100
Kanban has a different way of measuring progress.

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,070
Kanban is a continuous flow system and may not be

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,940
fully understood by management.

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,770
So check out the next module where I discuss how to best

42
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,220
prepare for organizational challenges.

43
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,170
So with Kanban,

44
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,650
there may be less focus on is the project on time, is the plan being

45
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,420
followed, and more focus on is the Kanban process predictable?

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,160
Is there a focus on workflow,

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,610
and is there a clear continuous improvement with the business? You can see

48
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,340
those are both significantly different from each other.

49
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,240
Here are the key points of this module.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,580
A very important first step in setting up your Kanban system is

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,660
determining your value stream, define your boundaries,

52
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,310
the beginning and end, and then all the steps in between. Don't spend

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,040
too much time since as you will use the system,

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,470
it will evolve quite nicely on its own.

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,930
Now that you have your value stream defined, what is the kind or type

56
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,400
of work that will come in, and in the IT world,

57
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,640
they will come in all shapes and sizes.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400
Hopefully, you can narrow them down to use use cases or user stories,

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,190
but be prepared to get all sorts of backlog work types.

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,640
The more visual the board, the better. Use colors,

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,920
icons, columns,

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,060
sub rows, or whatever you want to make the value stream easy to read,

63
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,340
easy to understand, and easy to take action upon.

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,990
Remember,

65
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,160
you have the freedom to design the board any way you want that

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,140
makes sense and adds value to the business.

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,270
Are you done done?

68
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,850
Well done rules are critical to the success of your quality.

69
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,110
Don't just write them down, actually follow them, and if you

70
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,240
pull a task forward and it's not done, we'll give it right back.

71
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,530
Kanban limits the amount of work in progress by doing a couple of

72
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,620
things. First, each resource is working on one and only one work item

73
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,480
at a time. A resource pools or takes new work only when they have

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,210
completed their current work item.

75
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,000
And lastly,

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,070
the maximum number of work items is set for each workflow step, also

77
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,470
notice, capacity. A bottleneck in a process flow is anywhere that an

78
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,910
accumulation of work builds up waiting to be processed. By visually

79
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,950
seeing the bottleneck, you can quickly take corrective actions by moving

80
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,100
or adding resources or re evaluating other things that you're doing. And

81
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,550
spikes are pretty much handled just like any other piece of work, make a

82
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,140
card,

83
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,710
put it in the backlog, and place it in an order that

84
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:23,000
makes priority sense. Up next, preparing for organizational challenges. See you there.
