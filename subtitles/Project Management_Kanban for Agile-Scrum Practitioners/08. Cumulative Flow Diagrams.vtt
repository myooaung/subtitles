00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.080
So what the heck is a cumulative flow diagram, and why do I need it?

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.040
Let's find out.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.630
A cumulative flow diagram is a graph that shows the

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.790
quantity of work in a workflow step over time.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.070
By observing the graph,

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.280
you can see the number of backlog items, work‑in‑progress

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040
items, and delivered items over time.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.850
Sure, but how would that help us?

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.840
Let's find out.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.450
So why use cumulative flow diagrams, or CFDs?

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.040
Well,

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.090
they help you keep track of your work in progress,

13
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.470
they help you identify bottlenecks,

14
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.810
and therefore, they help you increase your team's productivity.

15
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.590
It is a continuous improvement tool.

16
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.380
A CFD is typically an area graph that depicts the quantity

17
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.160
of work in each value stream step, but it could also be a

18
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.840
stacked bar chart as well.

19
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.890
Here is an example of a cumulative flow diagram.

20
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.700
Each colored area represents a workflow step from our sample Kanban board,

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.060
and you can see the steps in the legend; backlog, specify,

22
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.170
implement, validate, and deliver.

23
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.600
The horizontal axis on the bottom shows the time period, and the time periods I

24
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.190
have chosen are daily, and the vertical axis shows the number of tasks in each

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.610
step for that day. And going through the chart, here is the backlog, specify,

26
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.970
implement and validate, the two narrow strips there, and deliver. The size of

27
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.490
the areas indicates how many work items are currently in each step for that

28
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.030
selected time period.

29
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.320
By using the CFD, you can measure the amount of work your team has delivered.

30
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.910
If the area, the purple area, of our CFD represents the deliver step,

31
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.970
then the slope of that line between any two points is your average

32
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.510
throughput between those points. As you can see, between April 20 and April

33
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.450
22, the number of tasks per day completed was growing.

34
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.510
And if the top of the purple line was flat, or let's say, falling,

35
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.100
then our productivity was also falling. Then you can inspect and

36
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.450
talk about the reasons; maybe you lost a resource, someone on

37
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.800
vacation, maybe you added a new tool,

38
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.300
or you just can't quite figure out the reason, and it might

39
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.840
take more time and thought with your team.

40
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.850
But as you can see,

41
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.160
this chart can provide a wealth of valuable

42
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.040
information to ensure a smooth workflow.

43
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.890
There are other great benefits of using CFDS,

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.960
such as if the work in progress line goes up, this means your team is

45
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.820
working on more tasks than they're able to handle at a time. Increase work

46
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.640
in progress usually results in increased lead times,

47
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.230
reduced team efficiency, and maybe even project delays.

48
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.840
CFDs allow you to see how much work is in each step in each day.

49
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.130
Now,

50
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.480
unusual variations may be cause for any changes in team size or priorities, for

51
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.680
example. CFDs can be used to measure your past performance.

52
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.090
You can see your average lead time over broad periods of time,

53
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.740
which can be a predictor to forecast your work.

54
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.340
This will be invaluable when your customer says to you, when will it be done?

55
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.740
And now you can better predict that.

56
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.360
And lastly,

57
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.000
there are a lot of other benefits you may want to further research on your own if you're interested.
