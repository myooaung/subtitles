00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,770
In this section,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,530
we will discuss the Agile Scrum roles and how they map and compare into Kanban.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,040
Now for the Scrum Master, the only formal accountability is over the process.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,840
They're not product owners nor project managers,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,390
but only facilitating the Scrum process.

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,520
Scrum Master role responsibilities are to enable teams to deliver value,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,400
facilitate the Scrum events, ensure product owner is engaged,

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,940
remove process roadblocks, and keep progress visible to

9
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,640
everyone. How about a Kanban coach?

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,150
To be clear, there is no Scrum Master role in Kanban at all.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,270
A Kanban coach is not necessary nor is it a recognized Kanban

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,970
role, but since Kanban may be new to you,

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,240
I recommend a temporary Kanban coach who would act as a team enabler and

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,610
maybe spread the role of coach across multiple Kanban teams.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,540
This role is not required as a Scrum Master is for Agile Scrum,

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:00,370
but optional for transitioning. I think it would be a great help.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,090
The product owner is the person responsible for managing

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,530
the business requirements and priorities.

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,000
Tomato, tomato.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,760
Whether you use the term product owner, customer, or user,

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,430
you absolutely need them for populating your backlog and

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,100
setting priorities at a minimum. Okay. Here are the product

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,590
owner responsibilities in Scrum Agile.

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,720
The product owner represents the customers,

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,100
manages the business requirements, provides priorities, very important,

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,980
provides feedback to delivered features like when you provide a demo,

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,140
conveys business value by feature, and by the way,

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,680
there could even be multiple product owners.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,210
Okay, now let's keep that role, so to speak.

30
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,340
That really doesn't change with Kanban,

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,060
but how we react with product owners does.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,860
So we are nothing without our customers for sure.

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,160
Business analysts are usually the main interface to your customers.

34
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,940
The more they know about the business domain and technology,

35
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,890
the better, but also, all team members can engage the product owner.

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,130
There are no boundaries. But personally,

37
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,740
I prefer the business analyst to own that responsibility and keep the

38
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,040
rest of the team focused on creating great systems.

39
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,500
Let's explore the role of project manager and Kanban.

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,930
Project managers are responsible for managing work of

41
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,160
project teams. The project manager role usage.

42
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,010
Okay, there are no PMs, no project managers in the Scrum model.

43
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,920
Now there are project managers in the Waterfall model, as we

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,690
discussed in the Waterfall module. There can be PMs in the Kanban

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,640
model, and based on the size of the effort or project, I definitely

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,820
recommend using project managers. So please consider adding the

47
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,780
project manager role as needed.

48
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,850
Typically, small teams can manage themselves,

49
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,860
and they may not need project managers.

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,860
What is great is that PMs can share progress to all involved,

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,760
upstream, downstream, management schedules,

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,990
budgets, you name it, absolutely essential to me.

53
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,100
I think the project management role is

54
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,940
underappreciated and needs to be more widespread,

55
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,880
especially on larger projects.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,030
Your resources may be a bit tight, so maybe consider a blended role.

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,080
Many business analysts can perform project manager duties as well and

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,210
business analysis activities concurrently, that might be a great use of a

59
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,660
resource or consider migrating your Xâ€‘Scrum Masters to perform project

60
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,000
management duties or business analysis duties as well. This gives them a transition path to Kanban.
