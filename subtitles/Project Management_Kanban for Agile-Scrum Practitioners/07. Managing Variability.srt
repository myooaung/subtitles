1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,710
In this section, we will discuss variability.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,610
What do I mean by variability?

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,560
Let's find out. Variability, what is it?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,740
Anything that affects the smooth flow of work. As you have likely

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,180
gathered by now, anything that causes our flow of work to be

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,140
disturbed has significant consequences.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,850
Here are a few examples,

8
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,690
a requirement changing during work in progress that

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,440
is midstream in your workflow.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,340
What do you do?

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,440
Stop work?

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,900
Another example, the size of requirements.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,060
Remember, earlier in this model we looked at the

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,500
immense variety of backlog work types.

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,980
The goal was to see if we could normalize them so as to be

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,910
more similar by using the use case structure.

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,250
This technique is used to reduce variability, and hence increase workflow.

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,240
Now, of course, there are a lot of other forms of variability, certainly,

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,140
but let's look at these in more detail.

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,990
Changing requirements, that's a fact of life in system development.

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,040
So when your workflow has variability,

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,670
it can disrupt the predictability of your work.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,630
Changing requirements is acceptable in Kanban, of course,

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,940
but it will affect your throughput, so I want you to be aware of that,

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,480
hence, a requirement change that'll affect lead time, the time it takes for

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,140
a piece of work to move through your value stream.

27
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,280
Now here are a couple of options that you can mitigate this issue.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,610
You could block the card, that is stop work temporarily.

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,370
Maybe you block it if the requirement change is relatively small

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,510
and you need to get further clarification and ask some questions

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,170
to the people who specified the work or maybe even your

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,140
customers, so in this case, maybe blocking would be the best choice.

33
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,940
Or just move the card back to specify.

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,880
I would do this if the change was significant and we

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,970
really needed to rethink the card.

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,260
Maybe the card needs to be decomposed into more

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,410
tasks, maybe there are more issues,

38
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,070
and maybe there are significant negative consequences to the business,

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,910
so work must stop and the card is pushed back to the

40
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,640
specify step in order to figure things out.

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
Changing the size of requirements affects predictability.

42
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,810
When your workflow has variability,

43
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,710
it can disrupt the predictability of your work.

44
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,100
Changing or large variation in the size of requirements, certainly,

45
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,190
at a minimum, affects your first step,

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,910
which is specify. Use case versus epic, remember,

47
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,200
that's a really big difference,

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,390
and we went through this earlier In the module. Size variations of work items

49
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,570
affect lead time, that is the time to get through your value stream, and can

50
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,800
affect each step down the value stream, certainly. Here are a couple of options

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,610
to help you mitigate this. Work with your upstream partners to see if you could

52
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,500
normalize the size of the work.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,130
That's the best place to start.

54
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,870
Also,

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,730
if your upstream partner is unable to give you better size

56
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,560
requirements, then consider adding a business analyst resource to work

57
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,390
in the customers department or area to help out.

58
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,690
This can be immensely helpful and useful,

59
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,520
since customers or product owners are pressed for time and do not always

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,850
have the skills necessary to best populate the backlog.

61
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,410
And, of course,

62
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,990
you could certainly add business analyst resources to the specify step

63
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,880
as well. Here's a silver bullet, allow slack. Well,

64
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,020
nothing is really a silver bullet, but since you may not be able to

65
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,310
influence your upstream partners, then slack is for you,. Enabling slack

66
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,090
helps you deal with any unexpected issues because you'll have more

67
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,410
capacity to be agile to deal with those issues.

68
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,440
Slack helps expedite blockers.

69
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
We'll talk more about blockers later in this module.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,320
A blocker is if you are stuck on something, and hence

71
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,750
your smooth workflow is at risk.

72
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,390
Leverage digital tools that will help you shorten lead

73
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,350
time or reduce work in progress.

74
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,990
These tools give you great metrics and reports to

75
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,220
help you identify and solve issues.

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,400
Also slack enables improvement opportunities like removing technical debt.

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,850
Those with an agile scrum background will be familiar

78
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:52,040
with the slack concept and usage, since it is a common method to both.

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,720
So in summary of this section,

80
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,330
variability affects predictability of your planned

81
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,290
outcomes in the following ways.

82
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,960
As variability goes up, this results in more work in progress.

83
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Also,

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,760
variability results in longer lead times. Strive to reduce

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,520
sources of variability. Now many times these sources of

86
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,390
variability are, in fact, outside of your control,

87
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,000
so it may not be a trivial challenge, and that is why I encourage the right use of slack.
