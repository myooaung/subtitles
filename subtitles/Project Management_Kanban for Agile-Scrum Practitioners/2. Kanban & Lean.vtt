00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.860
So just what is kanban? Kanban is a method to manage workflow.

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.440
That is the most basic, simple definition.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.390
If your team's practices are a series of steps,

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.010
your workflow, then kanban is for you.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.580
So if your team's activities are requirements,

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.610
user interface design, coding, data design, or quality assurance,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.590
to name a few,

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.490
those activities can be thought of as steps in your workflow, and

9
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.350
therefore, you'll be well served by using kanban.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.010
Also, kanban is a lean practice.

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:37.920
Now let's see what lean is. Lean can be defined as a set of techniques

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.360
to identify and eliminate waste from operations.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.900
This is one of the main goals of kanban. Lean systems focus on process

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.500
improvement that eliminate waste and improved workflow.

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.040
You are not lean. That is,

16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.030
a system is not considered lean unless the process that is followed is

17
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.340
dedicated and focused on eliminating waste and improving workflow.

18
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.590
And guess what?

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.380
That's kanban. Principles versus manufacturing.

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.800
Lean can be described or defined as a set of principles and

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.680
shouldn't be described as a method or process that can be easily

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.050
copied from one environment to another.

23
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.720
Like the earlier slide stated, each and every kanban board will look

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.920
different and function differently, but they will still follow a set of

25
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.630
basic principles. Though the lean principles have its roots in

26
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.100
manufacturing from Japan, you shouldn't think you have to make software

27
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.090
development look like manufacturing.

28
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.700
Some people think kanban can only apply to the manufacturing world,

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.140
and it does not. Now for a little historical background.

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.190
Taiichi Ohno and Muda. It all started in the early 1940s.

31
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.830
The first kanban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno

32
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.770
from Toyota Automotive in Japan.

33
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.430
It was created as a simple planning system to control and manage

34
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.210
work and inventory at every stage of the production workflow.

35
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.040
Muda is a word for waste in Japanese.

36
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.290
Any activity that uses resources, but create no value

37
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.140
is waste and must be eliminated.

38
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.540
Examples of muda are rework, inventory nobody wants,

39
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.000
workflow steps that are just not needed, or resources waiting for upstream work to complete.
