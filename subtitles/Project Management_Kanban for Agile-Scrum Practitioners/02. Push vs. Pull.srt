1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,240
Push versus pull.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,160
It is quite typical for us to receive work from others,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,410
and we might even say our customers are pushing demand on us.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,890
Kanban is a pull system because new work,

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,850
or demand, is pulled into the system when there is capacity to work it,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,780
and is only pulled when there is capacity to work it rather than

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,040
pushed into the system based on the upstream demand.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,530
This is likely to be quite different from how you work today.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,450
My guess is that you might be simply overworked or there may be a queue of work,

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,700
but you must start on it even if you are still working on

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,720
other work and your management may expect you to work

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,620
concurrently on several items.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,460
As you have experience,

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:50,940
that is not likely to be very productive or result in quality work outcomes.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,150
Here is a quick and simple card wall or board example.

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,740
And I stress simple.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,000
There is so much more to a true kanban board system,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,540
but just to be sure we are on the same page, here's an example.

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,730
Here is our grid with three columns.

20
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:09,250
This is the To Do column, or demand, things we will pull from.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,880
This is the Doing column and the work in progress. And our Done,

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,690
or completed item, column, items ready for delivery. N ow here are

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,280
our To Do or demand items,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,640
and here are our items that are work in progress. And lastly, our done items.

25
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,180
Now, if we have identified the purple ticket as our next priority item,

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,330
then we are ready to move, or to better say it,

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,950
pull the ticket into the Doing column.

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,740
So let's pull it.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,390
Okay,

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,260
now this is a very simple example and a card wall does not equal

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,980
kanban, it is only one attribute of a kanban system.

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,080
I would like to make an important point.

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,270
Card boards and visual workflows that are common in agile

34
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,740
methodologies are not kanban systems.

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,330
They may be great things to use and be very productive as

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,280
well, but don't confuse them for kanban systems. They are

37
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,440
merely visual control systems.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,940
It is a subtle distinction, which you will come to realize soon in this course.

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:21,000
Besides being visual, kanban systems need to meet of following constraints, so let's check that out on the next few slides.
