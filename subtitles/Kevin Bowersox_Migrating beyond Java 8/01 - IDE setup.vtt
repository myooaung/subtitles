00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Recent Java versions

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.005
brought some great new features to the language

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.007
that we'll dive into and explore over the next few lessons.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.007
Unlocking new language features is one of the best parts

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.009
about migrating to a new Java version for developers.

6
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.004
To help explore these new features,

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:22.002
I have created classes within the exercise files

8
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.006
that contain methods that mimic the functionality

9
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.009
of the news Java features we're going to explore.

10
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.006
This allows you to see what a particular feature does

11
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.009
and how to use the method

12
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.002
in the new version of the language.

13
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.000
So here you see the isBlank method,

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.004
and what I've done is added an implementation

15
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.003
that trims a string and then checks to see

16
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:52.009
if the length of the string after it's been trimmed is zero.

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.007
We will take this implementation

18
00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:01.004
and replace it with the new isBlank method found in Java 11.

19
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.007
Then we're able to check

20
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.009
that there is parity between the functionality

21
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.000
by using unit tests that I've created

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.009
for each of these methods.

23
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.004
So this is a great way to understand

24
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.000
what the new methods do.

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.004
Now some of the methods that we're going to explore

26
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.000
will be preview features.

27
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.001
A preview feature is a fully implemented feature

28
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.003
that will be available in a future release,

29
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.001
but it is not yet a permanent feature of the JDK.

30
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.000
Preview features are typically used

31
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.008
to gather developer feedback

32
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.002
before a feature may become permanent.

33
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.002
So they're not meant for production usage.

34
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.007
In order to enable preview features,

35
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.005
we need to configure our IDE.

36
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.000
So I'm going to navigate to Window, then Preferences,

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.004
and then I'm going to expand Java,

38
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.003
and navigate to the Compiler section.

39
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:02.009
Now you'll notice currently our compiler is set for Java 14,

40
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.006
but it is not enabling preview features.

41
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:09.009
So simply uncheck the use default compliance settings

42
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.008
and then click Enable preview features for Java 14.

43
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:17.001
And then I'm going to go ahead and tell it to ignore these,

44
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.008
so we're not going to get any squiggly lines in the IDE

45
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.005
when we use them.

46
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.004
After that, I'll just click on Apply,

47
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.008
and then hit Yes.

48
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.008
And then Apply and Close.

49
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:32.003
Excellent, so our IDE is now set up to use preview features.

50
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:33.008
I'll be sure to point these out

51
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.000
when we encounter them in our lessons.
