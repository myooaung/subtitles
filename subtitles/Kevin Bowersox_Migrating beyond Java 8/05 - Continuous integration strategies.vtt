00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:06.005
we'll configure our build server Jenkins to include JDK 11.

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.000
We'll also create a Java 11 build

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.006
for our project within Jenkins.

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.007
Adding a build for the new Java version

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.006
allows our continuous integration processes

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.008
to support both versions of the language at once.

8
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.001
In order to get started,

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.009
we'll need to configure Jenkins to include the new JDK.

10
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.005
To do that, we can click on the manage Jenkins link

11
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.008
and within our options,

12
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.005
we'll select the global tool configuration.

13
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:40.007
Within this pane, you'll notice a section for the JDK.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.003
If we click on the JDK installations,

15
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.004
it's going to list all of the JDKs available

16
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.005
for our Jenkins server.

17
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:54.001
Currently, we have one JDK installed for Adopt Open JDK 8.

18
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.002
We'll need to add another JDK,

19
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:59.007
so I'm going to go ahead and click on the add JDK button

20
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.008
and here's where we'll add Adopt Open JDK 11.

21
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.004
The first thing that we'll need to do

22
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.006
is uncheck this install automatically button,

23
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.002
and then we're going to specify the name

24
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.007
as Adopt Open JDK 11.

25
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:19.004
Next, we'll need to point to where this version of the JDK

26
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.005
is located on our workstation.

27
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:27.006
To do that I'm going to open a new file Explorer window

28
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:32.007
and then navigate to C, program files, Adopt Open JDK,

29
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.009
and then here, I find JDK 11.

30
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.002
If I navigate into that folder,

31
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.005
I can then click within the toolbar

32
00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:44.005
to copy the path to this directory.

33
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.002
I'll navigate back to Jenkins at this point

34
00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:52.002
and paste the directory into the Java home option.

35
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.003
Once that's in place, I can go ahead and hit save

36
00:01:55.003 --> 00:02:00.008
and I now have JDK 11 configured with my Jenkins server.

37
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:04.002
The next thing we'll need to take a look at is our builds.

38
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:09.000
So if we navigate into the H Plus Sports API folder,

39
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.006
we'll find a build for our API.

40
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.000
Hopping into that build, we can check out its configuration

41
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.006
by clicking on the configure link on the left.

42
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.009
As we scroll down through the configuration,

43
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:27.005
you'll notice that we haven't explicitly specified a JDK.

44
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.005
We want to do that now that we have multiple versions

45
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.000
of the JDK on our Jenkins server.

46
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.009
So for this build, we're going to stick with JDK 8.

47
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.009
So I'll select Adopt Open JDK 8

48
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.008
and then we can continue navigating

49
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:44.008
through our configuration.

50
00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:47.007
You will notice that the source code for this project

51
00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:50.004
is being pulled from GitHub

52
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:54.001
and we have integration with that platform.

53
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.000
As we continue to scroll down,

54
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.003
you'll see that we are instructing Maven on the goals

55
00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.008
that we would like to see executed.

56
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:05.007
In this section, we also need to instruct Maven

57
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:08.005
to use our Java 8 profile.

58
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.005
To do that, we add the dash P flag

59
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:15.000
and then we specify the name of the profile.

60
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.007
In our case, that's Java 8.

61
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:19.001
Alright, scrolling down.

62
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.005
That looks like all the changes we'll need to make.

63
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:26.009
So I'm going to go ahead and save the changes to our build

64
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.002
and then we're going to hop back up

65
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.002
to the H Plus Sports API folder

66
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:37.004
and we're going to create a new project here for Java 11.

67
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:41.003
So I'm going to click on new item on the left side,

68
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:45.004
and here we're going to create a new item.

69
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:52.000
It's going to be named H Plus Sports API dash JDK 11.

70
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.007
And as we scroll down through the options,

71
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.006
we're not going to create any of the projects

72
00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.009
that are available.

73
00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:03.000
Instead, we're just going to mimic off of the existing job

74
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
by copying its configuration.

75
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So here in the copy from text box,

76
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.005
I'll just specify H Plus Sports API,

77
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:15.000
and then I can go ahead and click on OK.

78
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.009
This is going to create a copy of the job we just looked at.

79
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.009
Now we need to make some changes for this job

80
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.007
to build our application using JDK 11.

81
00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:27.004
So the first thing we'll want to do

82
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:30.001
is switch the JDK that it uses,

83
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.002
and then we'll scroll down

84
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:37.001
and change the profile that Maven will use.

85
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.006
So instead of Java 8, we want to use the Java 11 profile,

86
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:44.001
and that concludes our changes.

87
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.002
And at this point,

88
00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:48.004
if we look in our H Plus Sports API folder,

89
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:51.004
you'll notice that we have two projects.

90
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:55.001
One to build our application using Java 8,

91
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:59.007
and then another to build our application using Java 11.

92
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:03.001
Now I mentioned the Jenkins server and the builds

93
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.004
are integrated with GitHub.

94
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.003
So what I'm going to do is just make a small change

95
00:05:08.003 --> 00:05:10.004
to our pom dot XML file.

96
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:15.001
And this is strictly so that we can have a code change

97
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:18.005
to push to GitHub.

98
00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:20.006
Okay, that should be small enough.

99
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:23.003
I'm going to go ahead, save the file,

100
00:05:23.003 --> 00:05:27.006
and then I'm going to commit the changes,

101
00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:28.008
and then I'm going to go ahead

102
00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:34.006
and push those changes up to GitHub.

103
00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:37.003
There we see that the changes are pushed

104
00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.009
and now let's navigate back to Jenkins,

105
00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.009
and you'll notice, in a minute here,

106
00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.004
that we're pulling GitHub with these two projects.

107
00:05:47.004 --> 00:05:49.005
So once the changes are detected,

108
00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:51.006
that will trigger two builds.

109
00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:54.001
There we see the builds were triggered

110
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:56.008
and let's just hop in

111
00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:59.007
and we can take a look at one of these builds

112
00:05:59.007 --> 00:06:04.003
as it executes.

113
00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:07.008
Here's our Java 8 build.

114
00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:10.004
It looks like it completed successfully,

115
00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:14.003
and now I will expect issues with our Java 11 build,

116
00:06:14.003 --> 00:06:16.003
and we can see there were problems.

117
00:06:16.003 --> 00:06:22.002
Let's hop in, take a look.

118
00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:25.008
Once again, you can see that we are getting errors

119
00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:28.007
that are related to the Java version

120
00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:32.000
and some incompatibilities within our source code.

121
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.005
So we're going to have to fix those

122
00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:36.000
as we migrate this system.
