00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Narrator] There are four main criteria to consider

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.002
when selecting a JDK provider.

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.004
First, you should think about why you need Java

4
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.009
and what you intend to use it for.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.002
If you do not intend to use Java in a production environment

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.009
for commercial purposes,

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.003
you most likely can avoid paying costs

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.004
associated with support.

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.006
Second, you should consider how frequently you are willing

10
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.003
to migrate to a new Java version.

11
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.000
If you can migrate with every new Java version,

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you will not require LTS

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.009
because each new version should remedy any critical issues

14
00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.002
found in the last release.

15
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.004
Unfortunately, this option is probably not viable

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.007
for most enterprises.

17
00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.009
Next, you should consider if you're willing

18
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.008
to pay for support.

19
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.006
Most enterprises will pay for support

20
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.001
because it provides stability for their applications.

21
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.004
If you choose not to pay for support,

22
00:00:56.004 --> 00:01:01.002
your JDK options will be limited to several providers.

23
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.000
Finally, if you have existing agreements

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.007
with an organization that provides JDK binaries,

25
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:12.003
you may already have access to LTS updates and support.

26
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.009
This is typically true for enterprises

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.008
with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription

28
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.004
because Red Hat packages their OpenJDK binaries

29
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.007
with their operating system.

30
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.004
If we take a look at some popular JDK providers,

31
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:29.004
we can see that each provider

32
00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.004
has benefits and disadvantages.

33
00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:36.004
Adopt OpenJDK is largely free without restrictions

34
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.002
and has paid support through IDM.

35
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:42.004
However, is not TCK tested,

36
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.001
meaning it is not considered

37
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.000
a Java SE compatible implementation

38
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.007
because it hasn't passed the test kit.

39
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:54.002
Amazon Coretto is also widely free without restrictions.

40
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.001
However, it does not have paid support,

41
00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.001
which may cause some enterprises

42
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.005
to shy away from this provider.

43
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:06.005
Azul Zulu comes in a community and enterprise edition.

44
00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.009
The enterprise edition is free without restrictions

45
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.007
and does manage to check all of our boxes.

46
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:17.008
The Oracle JDK is provided for every release of Java

47
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.009
and has LTS updates.

48
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.001
However, the major downside is that it requires

49
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:25.008
a commercial license to be used in production

50
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.008
and updates are only provided

51
00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.005
for six months without a license.

52
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.008
The Oracle OpenJDK builds

53
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.004
are widely free without restrictions.

54
00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:39.004
However, support for the builds only lasts six months.

55
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.002
So you would be required to migrate every six months.

56
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:46.004
Additionally, commercial support is not available

57
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:48.003
for these builds.

58
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:51.005
Red Hat is one of the largest contributors to Java

59
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.003
outside of Oracle.

60
00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:56.003
They offer commercial support for their binary

61
00:02:56.003 --> 00:03:00.007
and access to updates requires RHEL subscription.

62
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:02.009
There's no one size fits all choice

63
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.001
when choosing a JDK provider.

64
00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.005
Your choice will likely be based upon your situation,

65
00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.006
intended use of Java, willingness to migrate

66
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.009
and need for commercial support.

67
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.002
Throughout the course, we'll be using builds

68
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.001
from Adopt OpenJDK

69
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.005
because they provide most versions of Java,

70
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.007
which we'll need for evaluation,

71
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:27.008
and they offer the GPU with Classpath Exception license

72
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.000
which can be used without restriction.
