00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.006
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.006
- [Instructor] In order to complete the solution,

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.004
we'll need to set up our local development environment,

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:15.004
build toolsm and continuous integration server for Java 14.

5
00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.007
The first step in doing that is installing Java 14

6
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.002
on our workstation.

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:24.002
So here on the adoptopenjdk.net website,

8
00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:28.007
I'm going to go ahead and select the open JDK 14

9
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.007
binary distribution, and then I'll click on

10
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.007
the latest release button to download it.

11
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.002
Now, I've already pulled this software down to my system,

12
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.004
so I'm going to just navigate to my desktop,

13
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.009
where you will find the installer for the binaries.

14
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.001
I'll double click on the installer,

15
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.004
and we can click on the next button to get started.

16
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.005
It will ask me to accept some general license terms,

17
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.003
which I will do, and then continue.

18
00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.006
And then, on this pane of the dialogue,

19
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:04.000
it's going to allow us to specify some configurations.

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.004
I'm going to leave the Set JAVA_HOME variable unchecked,

21
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:13.006
and I'm also going to uncheck the add to PATH option.

22
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:17.008
This will prevent Java 14 from becoming the default version

23
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.000
of Java on my system.

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay, with those options selected,

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.004
I'm going to click on next, and then install.

26
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.007
Okay, so Java 14's installed on my system.

27
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:39.003
Now let's head over to Eclipse, where we can add Java 14

28
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.002
as one of the available JREs within the IDE.

29
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.007
To do that, we'll click on window and then go to

30
00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.008
preferences, and here you can see, inside of

31
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:55.001
the preferences pane, we can look at the installed JREs

32
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.004
that are available for the IDE.

33
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.002
Currently, we have Java 11 and Java 8,

34
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:06.001
and we're going to click on add to include Java 14.

35
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.002
So just allow standard VM to remain selected, then hit next,

36
00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:15.007
and on this dialogue, we're going to click on directory,

37
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.006
and here we'll navigate to the directory

38
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:22.006
containing the JDK we just installed.

39
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:26.002
So I know that my JDKs get installed within C,

40
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.000
program files, AdoptOpenJDK,

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.008
and then I just need to select the JDK14 option.

42
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.000
Once I've selected that, I'll click on select folder

43
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.009
and then hit finish, and then apply and close.

44
00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:46.000
Now, within Eclipse, we can use JDK14

45
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.001
to compile and run our applications.

46
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:53.000
The next thing we'll do is configure our Maven pom file

47
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to include a profile for Java 14.

48
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.006
So we've done this for the other two Java versions.

49
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:05.005
I'm just going to copy the profile of Java 11,

50
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:10.001
and then from there, I'll paste it into the pom file

51
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:15.004
and then modify it for Java 14.

52
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:18.000
Okay, we'll go ahead and save the pom file.

53
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.002
And now I'm going to navigate to the run configurations

54
00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:23.009
for the project.

55
00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:28.004
And you'll notice that we have existing run configurations

56
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:31.002
for Java 11 and Java 8.

57
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:35.006
I'm just going to click on the Maven build option

58
00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:40.004
and then right click and click new configuration here.

59
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:43.001
I'll then, within the base directory,

60
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:48.000
select our project location.

61
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.006
And from there, we can specify the goals that we would like

62
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:56.000
to include, and those will be clean and package.

63
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.005
And then you'll remember that we want to use

64
00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.002
the Java 14 profile.

65
00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:05.009
Okay, and the final thing we'll need to do is set our

66
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.007
Maven build to use an alternative JRE,

67
00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:13.002
and in this case, we want it to be Java 14.

68
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.007
So with that in place, go ahead and apply the changes

69
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:20.001
to the run configuration, and then click on the run button.

70
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:23.006
That's going to kick off a build with Java 14,

71
00:04:23.006 --> 00:04:27.005
and you'll notice that we do have some issues compiling

72
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:29.006
our application in Java 14.

73
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.002
This is to be expected.

74
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:33.003
It didn't compile on Java 11,

75
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:35.009
Java 14 is not going to fix that.

76
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.006
Okay, so the next thing that we'll do is set up a build

77
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:44.007
on our continuous integration server.

78
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:48.001
So I'll navigate back to the browser.

79
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:53.000
And I have my Jenkins server running on port 8000,

80
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.003
so I'll just need to log in.

81
00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:04.002
And within Jenkins, we'll navigate to the manage Jenkins

82
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:07.007
link, and here's where we can set up our JDK

83
00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:11.002
by going into the global tool configuration.

84
00:05:11.002 --> 00:05:13.005
Within the global tool configuration,

85
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:16.000
we'll click on JDK installations,

86
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.006
and we need to add another JDK.

87
00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.003
In order to add the JDK,

88
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:24.006
I'm going to uncheck install automatically,

89
00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:29.005
ad then we can provide a name of AdoptOpenJDK14,

90
00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:33.007
and now we'll need to navigate back to the directory

91
00:05:33.007 --> 00:05:39.001
where we have JDK14 installed.

92
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.002
And then I'm just going to copy that directory

93
00:05:43.002 --> 00:05:47.001
and paste it in the Java home text box.

94
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:50.002
Okay, so once we click on save,

95
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:54.008
that's going to include Java 14 in our Jenkins server.

96
00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:59.005
And now we're just going to duplicate one of our projects

97
00:05:59.005 --> 00:06:04.000
in order to configure it to build with JDK14.

98
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
To do that, we'll click on new item.

99
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Here, we're going to specify the name of this item

100
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.002
as H Plus Sports API - JDK14, and then we're going to

101
00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:22.008
navigate down to this lower section to copy

102
00:06:22.008 --> 00:06:24.009
one of our previous builds.

103
00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:30.004
We'll select the H Plus Sports API - JDK11,

104
00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:33.002
build, and hit OK.

105
00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:39.002
And that's going to open the configuration for the new item.

106
00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:44.001
And this time we want to select AdoptOpenJDK14

107
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.006
as the JDK we'll use to build the project,

108
00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:50.000
and then we need to, once again,

109
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.004
switch the Maven profile we'll use.

110
00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:57.008
So here you can see, we're going to use our Java 14 profile

111
00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.007
that we recently added.

112
00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:02.006
So I'm going to go ahead and save that.

113
00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:05.003
Okay, and you'll remember that our build

114
00:07:05.003 --> 00:07:09.001
was integrated with GitHub, so we'll need to push

115
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:13.007
those changes up to GitHub.

116
00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:16.005
So here we can see changes to our pom file.

117
00:07:16.005 --> 00:07:24.003
I'm going to commit those.

118
00:07:24.003 --> 00:07:28.008
And then push them to GitHub.

119
00:07:28.008 --> 00:07:33.004
And now, if we navigate over to our Jenkins server,

120
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:37.002
you can see that the changes were already picked up

121
00:07:37.002 --> 00:07:39.008
and we're starting to trigger our jobs.

122
00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:43.009
So here we can see the JDK14 job did trigger.

123
00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:46.002
Now, I would expect this to have some issues,

124
00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:49.003
because we have known migration issues in our system,

125
00:07:49.003 --> 00:07:53.003
and we do see those in our console output,

126
00:07:53.003 --> 00:07:57.007
but now we have a canary build of sorts set up

127
00:07:57.007 --> 00:08:01.001
so that the latest Java version will be used

128
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:02.008
to build our application.

129
00:08:02.008 --> 00:08:06.005
Now, we don't expect this to run smoothly every time.

130
00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:09.007
In fact, we're hoping for this build to alert us

131
00:08:09.007 --> 00:08:13.000
to problems with the latest Java version

132
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.006
and our application source code.

133
00:08:15.006 --> 00:08:18.001
All right, so I hope you enjoyed this solution

134
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:22.000
and learned a lot about working with new Java versions

135
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and various tools in your development environments.
