00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:04.000
we're going to begin our migration to Java 11

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.007
by updating the JDK and IDE on our local workstations.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.007
This is a pretty common first step in every migration

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.007
because it provides a working environment

6
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.009
where the application can be migrated

7
00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
prior to promoting it to upper environments.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.004
First, we're going to need to install our target JDK

9
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:23.009
for the application.

10
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.009
This is going to be JDK 11,

11
00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.002
since it is the latest LTS release.

12
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.002
If we take a peek at my machine in PowerShell,

13
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.003
you'll see that currently I have Java 8 installed

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.002
and we're going to navigate

15
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.001
to the adoptopenjdk.net website

16
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
in order to get JDK 11

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.004
from our provider AdoptOpenJDK.

18
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.008
You'll notice that the website provides us

19
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:55.008
with a nice form where we can specify the JDK binary version

20
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.004
that we would like to obtain

21
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.009
and also select between a JVM.

22
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.004
So in our case, we're going to use the HotSpot JVM

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.001
and we're going to use OpenJDK 11.

24
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:11.008
Once we've made those selections just click on Download

25
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.003
and that will cause the JDK to be downloaded

26
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:15.006
to your machine.

27
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.002
Now I've already downloaded the JDK to my machine

28
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.002
so that we can quickly install it.

29
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.006
On Windows machines, this is pretty simple.

30
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:28.001
Here, we see the MSI Installer and all we need to do

31
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.007
is click on it and that's going to open up a wizard

32
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:37.002
where we can begin installation of the AdoptOpenJDK JDK.

33
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.007
You'll notice it is version 11, which is our target version.

34
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:44.000
So I'm just going to go ahead and click on Next.

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.006
I'll then accept the license terms.

36
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.006
And then on this screen,

37
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.009
we're able to specify a custom setup.

38
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.001
I'm going to select

39
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.006
the Set Java Home Variable option

40
00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:58.009
in this screen

41
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.002
and this will cause JDK 11 to be set

42
00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:06.003
as the default Java version for my machine.

43
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:07.006
Once I've selected this,

44
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.005
I can just go ahead and hit Next

45
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:16.009
and then begin the installation.

46
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.008
Okay, so the installation has finished

47
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.007
and now if I were to close the PowerShell Window

48
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.004
and open another PowerShell Window,

49
00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:32.001
you can see that my machine has been updated to Java 11.

50
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:36.004
Okay, so that takes care of the JDK on my local workstation.

51
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.004
Let's check out our IDE.

52
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.000
So currently, my IDE

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.009
is Eclipse Neon.

54
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.009
This is a pretty old version of Eclipse

55
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:51.004
and it will not be compatible with Java 11.

56
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.006
So we're going to go ahead and upgrade to the latest version

57
00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:58.004
of Eclipse to ensure that we get all of the support

58
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:02.001
and tolling the latest version of Java.

59
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.005
We can download the latest version of Eclipse

60
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.008
from the eclipse.org website.

61
00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:10.003
Simply click on the Download link on the website

62
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:13.003
and you'll notice that it automatically sets you up

63
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:16.004
to download the most latest version of Eclipse

64
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:18.001
for your platform.

65
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:22.006
If you were to seek other versions of Eclipse,

66
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.006
you can navigate into this page,

67
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.008
where you'll see there's other builds that are available.

68
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.007
But in general,

69
00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:32.002
we want to stick with the latest version.

70
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:35.002
Now I've already downloaded the Eclipse IDE

71
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:38.005
for enterprise Java developers to my workstation,

72
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.002
just to save us some time.

73
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:44.006
Let's go ahead and we can install that software

74
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:45.006
to our system.

75
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:48.009
So I've placed the software within a dev directory

76
00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.004
on my C drive.

77
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:52.007
So there you see Eclipse Neon

78
00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:54.006
and we're just going to go ahead

79
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:57.002
and right click on the latest version of Eclipse,

80
00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:02.002
which is distributed as a zip file and hit Extract all.

81
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:03.006
Now here, you can see

82
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:05.005
it's trying to use a pretty long name

83
00:04:05.005 --> 00:04:08.002
for where we're going to place Eclipse.

84
00:04:08.002 --> 00:04:11.003
So I'm just going to shorten the name of that folder

85
00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:16.006
and we'll call it Eclipse-2020-03.

86
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.007
And then we'll go ahead and extract Eclipse

87
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:26.009
and you'll see that it begins to extract onto our workspace.

88
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.002
Once we have extracted the Eclipse IDE onto our workstation,

89
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:35.004
we can navigate into the folder and open the program.

90
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:37.001
The first time we open the program,

91
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:41.007
it's going to ask us to specify a default workspace.

92
00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:47.003
I'm just going to create a new folder on my desktop

93
00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:51.004
and I'll name this folder, Exercise Files

94
00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:55.006
and then select it as my default workspace.

95
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:57.003
And then we'll click on the Launch button

96
00:04:57.003 --> 00:05:01.005
to continue opening Eclipse.

97
00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:04.001
Okay, and then once in Eclipse,

98
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:06.008
if we take a look at the preferences,

99
00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:10.005
you'll notice that our installed JREs

100
00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.008
is going to contain JDK 11.

101
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:15.007
Eclipse picked this up by default

102
00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:19.002
and was able to make this our default JDK.

103
00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:21.008
Now in many situations in a migration,

104
00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:26.001
you're going to need multiple JDKs installed in Eclipse.

105
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.009
So let's go ahead and set up JDK 8 as well.

106
00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.000
So within this panel, just click on Add

107
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.001
and then from here, select Standard VM and hit Next.

108
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.005
And then it's going to ask us to navigate

109
00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:43.001
to the directory containing our JDK.

110
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.000
So just click on Directory

111
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.008
and from here,

112
00:05:46.008 --> 00:05:49.003
we're going to find that JDK 8

113
00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:53.009
is installed under C, Program Files, AdoptOpen JDK.

114
00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.000
And here, we can see that JDK 8 is installed.

115
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.009
So just double click that folder and hit Select Folder.

116
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.007
At this point,

117
00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:05.006
we have everything in place in order to add JDK 8

118
00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:08.004
as an option within Eclipse.

119
00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:11.004
There, we can see it appears within our installed JREs.

120
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.008
So we'll just hit Apply and then Apply and Close.

121
00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:16.000
After these steps,

122
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.005
our local workstation is set up for our target JDK

123
00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:23.002
and our IDE has been upgraded to the latest version

124
00:06:23.002 --> 00:06:27.002
and we've added our JDK 8 in case we need to support

125
00:06:27.002 --> 00:06:29.007
both versions of the application.

126
00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:32.003
This positions us to begin migration work

127
00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:36.000
for our application on our local workstation.
