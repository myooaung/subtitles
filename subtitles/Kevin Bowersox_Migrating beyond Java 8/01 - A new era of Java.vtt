00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Throughout its 20 year history,

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.005
Java has evolved at an irregular pace.

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.007
The delivery cadence of new versions was often

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:12.001
irregular and lengthy due to delays in the development

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.006
of big-ticket features in new releases.

6
00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.001
In 2017, a new time-based release cadence

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.000
was proposed and adopted to allow Java

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.002
to ship new feature releases every six months

9
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.003
without delaying them for holdups on big-ticket items.

10
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.004
In addition to the new time-based release cadence,

11
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:36.001
Oracle announced major shifts in how Java will be supported,

12
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.002
released, and licensed.

13
00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.003
The ultimate goal of these changes

14
00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.006
is to keep Java competitive with other languages

15
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.002
that evolve at a faster pace.

16
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.007
These recent changes are important

17
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.004
because they apply specifically to Java Standard Edition,

18
00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:56.001
which is used by an estimated 10 million developers.

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.000
These developers rely upon the Java Development Kit, or JDK,

20
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.009
which packages and distributes Java Standard Edition.

21
00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.003
The JDK is a development environment

22
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.009
for building applications

23
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.004
with the Java programming language.

24
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.005
At the top level of the JDK,

25
00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.004
we'll find things like the compiler

26
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.003
for building Java applications

27
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.002
and a Java Runtime Environment or JRE.

28
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:25.005
The JRE supports the execution of Java programs.

29
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.005
It contains the class libraries

30
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.002
and the Java Virtual Machine,

31
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:33.001
which executes the actual bytecode of an application.

32
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.005
When we perform a Java migration,

33
00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.003
essentially we're upgrading the JDK

34
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.003
and then ensuring the functionality

35
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:44.008
of the application we're upgrading is correct

36
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:49.000
and performs properly on the new version of the JDK.

37
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.009
The JDK is used by Java developers

38
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.008
for many tasks required to develop, build, deliver, operate,

39
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.006
and maintain Java applications.

40
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:02.000
When switching to a new Java version,

41
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.005
your initial planning should evaluate

42
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.007
these areas and activities

43
00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:10.008
to determine how they are impacted by a Java migration.

44
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.008
Throughout the course, we'll review strategies

45
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.003
to successfully address many of these items

46
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.009
when performing a Java upgrade.

47
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.006
Moving past Java 8 may seem like a lot of work;

48
00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:25.003
however, it comes with many benefits.

49
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:29.006
Recent Java versions have introduced new language features,

50
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:34.002
improved JVM performance, and strengthened security.

51
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:37.003
Additionally, as some versions of third party frameworks

52
00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:38.008
reach their end of life,

53
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.006
you may be required to upgrade

54
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.005
to a more recent version of Java

55
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.004
to switch to the latest version of the framework.

56
00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:47.005
As we progress through the course,

57
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:51.001
I'll teach you how to navigate Java migrations with ease

58
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.000
so you can enjoy these benefits without a bunch of hassle.
