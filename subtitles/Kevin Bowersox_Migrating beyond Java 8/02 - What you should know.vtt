00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Presenter] Before we dive into the details of how

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.003
to migrate Java applications,

3
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.007
let's talk a bit about what you should know

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.007
before taking the course.

5
00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.006
This course is primarily for developers

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.007
that want to understand recent changes surrounding

7
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:19.002
the Java programming language and how their systems

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.005
will be impacted by them.

9
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.001
The lessons in the course will quickly get you up

10
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.005
to speed with the current state of the language

11
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.004
and teach you strategies

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:33.000
for migrating older Java applications to newer versions.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.003
This information will primarily benefit individuals

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.003
responsible for maintaining Java applications

15
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.004
or planning the life cycle

16
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.009
of an organization's Java-based portfolio.

17
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.007
To get the most out of this course,

18
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.008
you should have some previous Java experience.

19
00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.006
You do not need to be an expert

20
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.000
but this course shouldn't be your first exposure

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.005
to the language.

22
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.004
Additionally, you should be comfortable

23
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:01.001
managing multiple versions of Java on your workstation.

24
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.009
I can walk you through these examples on Windows

25
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.009
but if you choose to use another operating system

26
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.002
you should understand how to configure multiple JDKs

27
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.007
on that system.

28
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.009
Finally, a general understanding

29
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.000
of new language features introduced in Java 9 and 10

30
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.002
will help you throughout the course.

31
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.002
We will not be covering these features

32
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.004
in depth in the course but I will touch on them

33
00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.005
as we look at new features introduced

34
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:32.002
in Java 11, 12, 13 and 14.

35
00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:35.001
If you need a refresher, there are some great courses

36
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.008
on the LinkedIn learning platform that covered

37
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:41.002
the features introduced in Java 9 and 10.

38
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:42.008
To follow along in the course,

39
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:46.000
you will need several technologies on your workstation.

40
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.006
The course uses multiple versions of Java

41
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.007
and at various points will require you to have Java 8,

42
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:55.001
Java 11 and Java 14 installed.

43
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.004
When we explore the new language features in Java 11

44
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.006
through 14, I'll be using Java 14 the entire time

45
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:03.009
since it contains all

46
00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.000
of the previous versions language features.

47
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.006
When we dive into migrating an application

48
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:14.000
will start in Java 8 and then transitioned to Java 11.

49
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.003
I'll be sure to note these versions throughout the course.

50
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.009
I use eclipse for my day to day development

51
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.005
and in the course, however, you can use the IDE

52
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.000
of your preference.

53
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.003
The only requirement for an IDE

54
00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:30.008
is that it has support for Java 14.

55
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:34.003
Since Java 14 has just recently been released,

56
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:38.004
I had to add the Java 14 support for eclipse plugin

57
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:40.004
to my eclipse installation.

58
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.004
Depending upon when you take the course,

59
00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:45.002
this may or may not be required.

60
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:48.002
Some of the examples in the course we'll be using Maven

61
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:51.001
so you will need it installed on your workstation.

62
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.000
Additionally, if you want to follow along

63
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.008
with every step of the course,

64
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.007
you'll need Jenkins installed

65
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.000
but it is only used for a brief period of time

66
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.005
in one of the lessons so it may not be worth the trouble.

67
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.005
Finally, feel free to use whatever operating system

68
00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:07.001
you're comfortable with.

69
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.001
I'll be using Windows but any operating system will work.

70
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:13.007
That is all you need to know to complete the course.

71
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.000
I'll guide you through the rest.
