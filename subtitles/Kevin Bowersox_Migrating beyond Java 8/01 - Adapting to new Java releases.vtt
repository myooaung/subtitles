- [Kevin] Every six months,

2
00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.001
Java developers can now look forward

3
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.007
to receiving a new version of the language

4
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.009
that delivers enhanced security,

5
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.001
improved performance and additional features.

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.008
While many developers find the new release cycle exciting,

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.004
others are hesitant to upgrade beyond their current version

8
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.004
putting their projects at risk

9
00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.008
of incurring high extended support costs.

10
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.006
Teams that approach migrations

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.008
with a well-planned strategy

12
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.000
that includes the assistance of automated tools

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.005
can confidently upgrade to the latest version.

14
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.000
Teams that make the leap,

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.009
will enjoy new Java features

16
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.005
such as switch expressions,

17
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:44.002
and text blocks for working with multi-line strings.

18
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.005
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

19
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.001
And throughout my career

20
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.007
I've enjoyed using Java's versatility

21
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.000
to create a wide range of systems

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.006
ranging from batch jobs to web APIs.

23
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.000
I'll share strategies

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.002
that will eliminate common pitfalls

25
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.002
that you might experience.
