(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.002
- [Instructor] This challenge will require you to set up

3
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.003
and configure a preview build of Java 14

4
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.001
for the H-Plus Sports API.

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.002
The preview build will be used to compile and build

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.002
the API on the latest version of Java.

7
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:24.003
While we may not anticipate running the software on Java 14,

8
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.009
it acts as a canary by alerting us to any upcoming issues

9
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.001
in our code base for new versions of Java.

10
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.001
This allows us to know what to expect as we migrate

11
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:36.006
an application to later Java versions.

12
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.002
And if time allows, we can address the issues ahead of time.

13
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.002
Here are a few tips to get you started.

14
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.000
To set up the preview build, you will need to install

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.007
Java 14 and add it as a new runtime within Eclipse.

16
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.008
Next, you will need to build a new Maven profile

17
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.005
and run configuration for the build.

18
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.009
Once you've created the run configuration,

19
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:00.009
go ahead and execute the build.

20
00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.005
However, be ready for a few issues to be identified.

21
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.001
If you're up for a bonus challenge, try setting up

22
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.007
the new preview build to run on Jenkins

23
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:13.000
as part of our continuous integration processes.

24
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.005
This challenge should take you about 15 minutes to complete.

25
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.004
In the next video, I'll show you how I solved the challenge.

26
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.000
Best of luck.
