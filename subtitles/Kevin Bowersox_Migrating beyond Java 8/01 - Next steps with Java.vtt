00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Kevin] Thanks for watching this course,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.008
on migrating beyond Java eight.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.007
In the course, I've provided you with strategies

4
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.000
for transitioning your Java based applications,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.007
to new versions of the language

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:17.003
that contain better features, security and performance.

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.000
Before we wrap up the course,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.003
I want to provide you with some recommendations

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.002
for what to explore next,

10
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.008
and give you some information

11
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.008
about my other courses.

12
00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.007
The new Java release cadence,

13
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.003
makes it an exciting time

14
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.009
to be a Java developer,

15
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.008
since we'll be seeing new features

16
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.004
delivered every six months.

17
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.008
I would recommend setting aside some time,

18
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.003
to read up on each new release,

19
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:45.007
and to discover its new features or any potential changes

20
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.004
that may impact your applications in the future.

21
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.002
If you are really interested in a new feature,

22
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.000
you can always download the latest JDK,

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.001
and do some evaluation.

24
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.007
The LinkedIn learning platform,

25
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.000
typically provides first look classes

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.009
for each new Java release,

27
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.004
that you can use to stay up to date.

28
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.005
If you liked my teaching style,

29
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:08.009
I have a few other courses

30
00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.009
on the LinkedIn learning platform,

31
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.003
that might interest you.

32
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.009
Git for teams is a course I built

33
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.001
that deliver strategies for teams using Git.

34
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.003
These strategies can make your team's development

35
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:24.008
much more fluid, as you collaborate with the tool.

36
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.006
Building API's with swagger,

37
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.000
covers a design first approach

38
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.009
to creating API's with the open API specification.

39
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.003
Java EE eight Essential Training,

40
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:41.000
covers 13 of the most widely used Java EE API's

41
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.003
and gives you a rock solid foundation

42
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.002
for building java web applications.

43
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.002
Spring batch can provide you

44
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:49.009
with a proven architecture,

45
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.003
to construct complex batch jobs

46
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.001
that run on the JVM using spring.

47
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.000
So that about wraps things up.

48
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.007
Congratulations, on finishing this course,

49
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:02.009
and thanks again for taking it.

50
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.001
Now, put your skills to work,

51
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:06.001
and best of luck

52
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.000
migrating beyond Java eight.
