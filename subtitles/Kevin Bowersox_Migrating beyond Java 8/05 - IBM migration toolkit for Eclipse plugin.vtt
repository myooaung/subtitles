00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.005
Server Migration Toolkit provided by IBM

3
00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.002
is another tool that we can use to assist

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.009
with Java migrations.

5
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.008
Similar to the binary scanner,

6
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.002
this tool helps us identify potential migration issues

7
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.001
within a Java application.

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:21.002
However, this time with tight Eclipse integration.

9
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.004
The tight integration with the IDE

10
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.000
may be preferred by some developers,

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.009
because it allows you to inspect the source code

12
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.001
alongside the scan conducted by the tool.

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.006
This is a little bit different than the binary scanner

14
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.005
where we worked with the command line interface.

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.002
In order to get started,

16
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:43.004
we're going to add the plugin to Eclipse.

17
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:47.003
So to do that, we can simply place the browser

18
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.004
and Eclipse next to each other,

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.001
and then you'll see this install option

20
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.000
on the website for the tool.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.008
If you drag this icon onto the toolbar in Eclipse

22
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:01.007
it will automatically open up a dialog

23
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.008
for the Eclipse marketplace.

24
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.000
And we can begin to download the plugin

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.007
for the IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit.

26
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:15.004
So with that in place, just go ahead, hit confirm,

27
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.004
and it will start to pull down the tool,

28
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.001
we'll accept the license terms and then hit finish.

29
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.009
At this point, the software will begin to install.

30
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.008
Once the software has been installed,

31
00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.002
we'll be prompted to restart Eclipse.

32
00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.009
I'll go ahead and click on Restart now.

33
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.007
Now that Eclipse has restarted,

34
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.001
we can begin to analyze our application.

35
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.005
To start the analysis,

36
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.006
we can right click on our project,

37
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:47.006
and then we'll see the option for the software analyzer.

38
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:52.003
Here we can click on the software analyzer configurations

39
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:57.003
to open a dialog where we can configure our scanner.

40
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:01.001
To do that, we can right click on the software analyzer,

41
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.005
and we're going to create a new configuration.

42
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.005
You'll notice that we can give the configuration a name,

43
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:13.002
so I'm going to name this Java11Migration.

44
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.001
And then we're going to set up some of the parameters

45
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.003
for this configuration.

46
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.009
On the scope tab,

47
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.008
you'll notice that we can select from the projects

48
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.003
that we would like to scan.

49
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.006
Now we only have one project within our workspace,

50
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.000
but I'm going to go ahead and click on

51
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
analyze selected projects,

52
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.004
and then select the project

53
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:36.007
just to limit the scope of the scan

54
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:39.000
to our particular project.

55
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If we had multiple projects in the workspace,

56
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.003
this would cause them not to be scanned,

57
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:48.004
and we can focus our scan on a specific project.

58
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:52.007
From there, we can go ahead and select the rules tab.

59
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:56.004
And this allows us to choose a rule set

60
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.006
that we would like the scan to use.

61
00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:01.009
The most convenient rule set to select

62
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:06.003
is the WebSphere Application Server version migration.

63
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:11.001
So go ahead and click on this option, and then click on set.

64
00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.004
This is going to bring up another dialog,

65
00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:17.009
where we're able to input some information

66
00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.001
about the migration that we'd like to perform.

67
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.005
On this dialog, all we need to do

68
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:29.001
is make sure that the first few options match.

69
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.008
So we're going to migrate

70
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:34.003
from the source application server Liberty Core,

71
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:37.003
to the target application server Liberty core.

72
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:38.003
And what we're doing

73
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:41.004
is just making all of these options similar,

74
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:45.001
so that we can go down and change our Java version

75
00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:49.000
from Oracle 8 to Java 11.

76
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.006
And this will only cause the tool

77
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:55.005
then to consider changes in Java.

78
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:56.008
All right, with that in place,

79
00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:59.001
let's go ahead and click on OK.

80
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:03.003
Then I'm going to apply the changes to this configuration.

81
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:07.000
And then we'll go ahead and kick off the analysis.

82
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.005
Okay, we can see that the analysis was conducted.

83
00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:13.007
So I'm going to maximize that tab.

84
00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:14.008
And you'll notice

85
00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:18.007
within the Java code review for our project,

86
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:23.001
it's going to list the findings from the scan.

87
00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:25.009
Now, these findings should look pretty familiar

88
00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.005
because they are the same ones

89
00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:30.009
that we saw for the binary app scanner.

90
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.001
This time however,

91
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:35.000
with the tight IDE integration,

92
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.007
we're able to dive into a particular finding,

93
00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:43.006
and then navigate to the exact line of source code

94
00:04:43.006 --> 00:04:45.003
that triggered the finding.

95
00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:47.001
So this is a little bit more useful

96
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.000
than the command line interface

97
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.009
and the output it provides.

98
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.008
Okay, so using the tool

99
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.006
we've identified and pinpointed

100
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:57.006
the issues we'll need to correct

101
00:04:57.006 --> 00:05:00.004
in order to successfully migrate our application

102
00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:02.000
to Java 11.

103
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.008
We're able to work right within Eclipse

104
00:05:04.008 --> 00:05:07.003
and use the output of the scan

105
00:05:07.003 --> 00:05:10.000
to quickly resolve any issues.
