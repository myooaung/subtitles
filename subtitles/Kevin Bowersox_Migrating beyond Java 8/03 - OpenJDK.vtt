00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Around the same time

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.003
the new release cadence was publicized,

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:08.000
a few other substantial changes were announced by Oracle,

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.004
regarding JDK support and licensing.

5
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.009
These announcements concerned many Java developers,

6
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.000
making them question whether Java was still free.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.001
Rest assured, Java is still free,

8
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.007
thanks to the OpenJDK Project.

9
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.002
OpenJDK is an open source project

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.000
that contains the latest implementation

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.009
of the Java platform.

12
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.002
The project is led by Oracle

13
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.007
with participation from other major companies,

14
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:40.006
such as Red Hat and IBM.

15
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.000
It is important to understand that OpenJDK

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.004
is only focused on Java source code,

17
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.002
leaving other organizations

18
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:52.001
with the task of building JDK binaries

19
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.002
from that source code.

20
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:58.003
Most popular JDK binary distributions used by developers,

21
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:03.004
such as the Oracle JDK, AdoptOpenJDK, and others

22
00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:08.003
are based on downstream repos of the OpenJDK source code.

23
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.007
When considering JDK providers,

24
00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:14.002
there are several characteristics that set them apart.

25
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:18.000
First, some providers may not offer JDK binaries

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.002
for every version of Java.

27
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.006
Typically, you can expect most providers

28
00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.006
to make binaries available for LTS releases,

29
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.002
such as Java 11.

30
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:31.006
And a few will offer builds for each Java feature release.

31
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.006
The LTS versions will be suitable for most enterprises

32
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:39.003
because it is common for large companies to prefer software

33
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.005
with longer lifespans.

34
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.003
Licensing is also an important consideration

35
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.005
because some JDK providers

36
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.008
restrict how their JDKs can be used.

37
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.004
It's not uncommon for a JDK to be free

38
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.002
for development and testing,

39
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.002
but restricted for production usage.

40
00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.008
To be used in production,

41
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:04.004
some licenses may require paid commercial support contracts,

42
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:08.005
or maybe packaged with other product subscriptions.

43
00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:12.006
For instance, Oracle requires a Java SE subscription

44
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:15.004
to run the Oracle JDK in production.

45
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:19.002
While Red Hat packages their OpenJDK distribution

46
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.003
within the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system.

47
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.002
Beyond production usage,

48
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.006
the support agreements of different vendors

49
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:31.005
will vary in what they provide with some offering support

50
00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.005
for installations and configurations,

51
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.007
while others will even help debug

52
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:39.002
and patch production issues.

53
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.006
Finally, the length and availability

54
00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.004
of long-term support updates will be different

55
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:47.001
for each JDK provider.

56
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.004
Most providers use roadmaps

57
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.006
to outline their support timelines

58
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:55.003
and disclose LTS costs on their website.

59
00:02:55.003 --> 00:02:58.000
It is important to understand long-term support.

60
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.006
So let's discuss in a little bit more detail.

61
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:04.003
LTS typically consists of updates

62
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:08.003
that allow an earlier Java version to remain stable

63
00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:11.007
after the OpenJDK Project has shifted their work

64
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.007
to new releases.

65
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:17.001
LTS updates are important because they allow you

66
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:20.009
to continue using these earlier versions of Java

67
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:25.001
with the guarantee that major issues will be addressed.

68
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.003
They typically backport critical security patches

69
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:32.005
and critical fixes to earlier versions of the JDK,

70
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:36.006
allowing you to confidently use an LTS release

71
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:40.009
without having a gaping security hole or major bug.

72
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.008
Updates typically do not backport major features

73
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.000
from the newest versions of Java.

74
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.004
So if you want those,

75
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:51.005
you'll need to migrate to the latest version.

76
00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:54.009
Don't be concerned about where you'll grab your next JDK

77
00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.009
and how much you'll have to pay for it.

78
00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.000
The OpenJDK Project and its community

79
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
provide many options for a wide range of Java developers.
