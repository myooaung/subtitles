00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] From this point forward in the course,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.008
we'll be working on a small project that will migrate an API

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.002
created for the H Plus Sport Company

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.001
from Java 8 to Java 11.

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.004
H Plus Sport is a fictional company

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.006
that provides nutrition and clothing products

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.006
for an active lifestyle.

8
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.007
On their website, we can see some of the products

9
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:22.008
that they offer.

10
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.001
The API that we're going to be building

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.002
will create endpoints that provide information

12
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.005
that can be queried about these products

13
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.009
and recommendations for customers

14
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.006
that may be interested in other products.

15
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.008
We're going to take a look at the project

16
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.003
by importing it into our Eclipse IDE.

17
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:47.004
To do that, go to File and then navigate to Import,

18
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.004
and then within this dialog,

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:55.000
select the Existing Maven Projects option and hit Next.

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.006
We'll then hit the Browse button

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:01.004
and navigate to the Exercise Files directory

22
00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:02.006
for the course.

23
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.007
And then we can open the Exercise Files for this lesson,

24
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.004
which contain the API project.

25
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.008
Once we've selected that, we'll hit Select Folder,

26
00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.001
and then all we need to do is hit Finish.

27
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.001
Now, after the project imports,

28
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.005
the first thing you'll notice

29
00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.000
is that it's currently using Java 8.

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.005
We'll be working to change that and make it run on Java 11.

31
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.000
Within the packages for the API,

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.007
you'll find the product controller,

33
00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.009
which exposes the product endpoint

34
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.007
that allows us to provide a product ID

35
00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:42.002
in order to query information regarding a product,

36
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:45.008
and you'll also see the recommendation controller.

37
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.003
The recommendation controller exposes

38
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.007
a recommendation endpoint

39
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.001
that allows us to get similar products

40
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.002
to the product ID that we provide to the endpoint.

41
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.002
Now, if we want to run the application,

42
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.007
all you need to do is right click

43
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.005
on the HplusSportApiApplication class,

44
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:08.008
and then go to Run As, and then Java Application.

45
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:10.009
We can see the application's launching,

46
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.000
so I'm going to go back to a browser

47
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.009
and here we're just going to put in

48
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:21.005
localhost8080/product/500,

49
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.001
and this will retrieve the information

50
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:27.009
regarding the product with the product ID 500.

51
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.009
Okay, excellent.

52
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.002
It looks like our API's up and running

53
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:35.000
and now we can start the migration to Java 11.
