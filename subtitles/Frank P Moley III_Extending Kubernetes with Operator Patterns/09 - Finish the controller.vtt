00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] So we spent quite a bit of time building code

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.000
around the controller

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.006
and putting a few little snippets here and there.

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.001
Now it's time to actually do work in our controller.

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.007
And this is sort of the culmination

6
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.007
of everything we've been building up to

7
00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.003
so we can show you how the controller would work

8
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.006
in the real world.

9
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.008
So let's jump into our IDs.

10
00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.007
So I want you to jump to your controller.

11
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.006
Let's go down to our reconcile method and we're going to start

12
00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:32.004
after we've added our finalizer when the timestamp is zero.

13
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:33.002
All right.

14
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:40.007
So if instance.status.state is pending.

15
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.009
Now why is this important?

16
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.002
The only time we want to do a creation is when it's pending.

17
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.001
No other state should ever trigger a new creation

18
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.003
of our bucket, right?

19
00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.001
That's pretty straightforward logic.

20
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.006
So only if we're pending.

21
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.001
Now we're going to do an info message.

22
00:00:55.001 --> 00:01:00.005
It just basically says starting to create resources

23
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.007
and I would never put log info messages at this granularity

24
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.005
but for this purpose, it's fine.

25
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.005
So we're going to do an error assignment.

26
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.003
R.createresources.

27
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.004
And this is the method that we created earlier

28
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.008
that does all of the creation of our resource

29
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.004
and our config map.

30
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:23.002
Now, if the error is not empty, so if that update fails,

31
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:28.006
here we want to set our status to error.

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.006
And the reason that this is important is

33
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.003
because we don't want to continual propagation

34
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:36.004
and execution of this because it's in pending state

35
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.008
but we know we're going to get an error

36
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.004
and then we just keep doing the same trivial behavior

37
00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.003
over and over.

38
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.006
So let's go ahead and set it to error

39
00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.006
that way it'll never execute again

40
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.004
because we've guarded against that.

41
00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.004
And since this is just a status update,

42
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.003
we can do an update of our status.

43
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.005
So if this happens, we're going to go ahead and do that.

44
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:58.009
Let's log this error out

45
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.006
and we'll simply say error creating bucket.

46
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:04.003
Although it could be much more than that, right?

47
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.000
It could be the config map or something else

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.001
but for now that's fine.

49
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:12.000
And in this case, we'll go ahead and return our ctrl.result

50
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.005
and our error.

51
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:14.004
Excellent.

52
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.005
So now we will create the instance if we are pending.

53
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.003
As long as we don't get an error state,

54
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:20.007
everything is good to go.

55
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.002
Otherwise we will set the state to error

56
00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.006
on the CR and leave it alone.

57
00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.002
Now, down here in our delete flow

58
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:28.003
we've got a little bit different.

59
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.007
Remember I said to keep the finalizer after you're done.

60
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.007
And we're going to do that here.

61
00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.003
So once again, we will do an error assignment

62
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.004
and we're going to do that to our delete resource method.

63
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.007
And we will pass the context and our instance.

64
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:48.001
And if our error does not equal nil,

65
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.003
we are once again going

66
00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:56.008
to set our instant state equal to error.

67
00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:01.005
We will once again update our status.

68
00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:07.005
And then we will log this

69
00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:10.001
and just say error deleting bucket.

70
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:14.007
And we will return our control result.error.

71
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:16.002
And now we can let our finalizer run.

72
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:18.001
So now we're creating a bucket

73
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.006
or we're deleting a bucket based on the flow.

74
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.004
Let's jump into our terminal.

75
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:23.008
We're going to do a few steps here

76
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:25.002
to kind of get ourselves ready.

77
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.000
So the first thing I want to do

78
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.005
is I want to do a make undeploy.

79
00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.000
I want to get everything out of the environment.

80
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.003
And I'm doing this just to make sure

81
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:34.004
that everything is clear and clean.

82
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.005
We're going to get some errors

83
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.006
because things aren't found and that's fine.

84
00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.000
What we actually pulled out of there

85
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.007
that I care about is we pulled out our CRD.

86
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:45.000
So that way now if I do a make,

87
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.005
we're going to go ahead and make our manifests as well.

88
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.008
And we will do a make install.

89
00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:54.006
And let's put everything back out there

90
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:56.006
that we need to run this locally.

91
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:57.006
Now we can run it.

92
00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.009
So make run.

93
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.000
We'll let this do its thing and start running.

94
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Excellent. We're up and running.

95
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So before we get too deep,

96
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.006
there's a few things that I want to do.

97
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:11.005
The first thing I'm going to do is an aws s3api.

98
00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:12.009
You can do this through the console

99
00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.001
if you feel more comfortable looking at your buckets.

100
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.009
But I'm just going to do a list buckets command.

101
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.007
And then we will see that we've got one bucket out there.

102
00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:22.008
It's called an instructor aws01.

103
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:27.000
Great. So now let's apply our CR.

104
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.008
Again, we're going to use one in our config samples.

105
00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:35.008
And now very quickly, let's take a look at that.

106
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.003
So you'll see it's been created.

107
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:39.009
So it's gone through the pending, creating

108
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.000
and created state in the time that we've typed this.

109
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.005
If we jump over to our running console, you'll see

110
00:04:45.005 --> 00:04:48.002
that we get some info messages that we've created resources

111
00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:50.000
and things like that.

112
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.006
Let's validate by I calling our S3 call and there it is.

113
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:58.008
We've got a bucket that has been created based on our CR

114
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:02.002
and we can do one more thing here.

115
00:05:02.002 --> 00:05:03.009
You also see that we've got a config map

116
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.004
and we could describe that if we wanted to

117
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.001
to make sure that everything looks good.

118
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:14.000
So let's describe our config map

119
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.009
and there's all of our data.

120
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.007
So now our next step is we are going to do a delete

121
00:05:20.007 --> 00:05:24.008
of our object store.

122
00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:29.001
Now let's take a look first of all at S3.

123
00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:30.005
Our bucket is gone.

124
00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:35.001
We can look for our config map, they're gone.

125
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.000
And finally, we can look for our object store and it's gone.

126
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.006
That is exactly what we expected our system to do.

127
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:44.007
But now we can attach a bucket

128
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:46.007
with a config map describing it

129
00:05:46.007 --> 00:05:49.008
to a name space by simply applying ACR.

130
00:05:49.008 --> 00:05:51.007
And that's the benefit of the operator.

131
00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:54.006
Stay tuned next and I'll show you how to deploy this

132
00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:56.005
using Kubebuilder and give you some ideas

133
00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:59.000
on how to make this production ready.
