00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] Every journey must have a starting point.

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.000
Up until now, we have been loading the wagon, so to speak

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.002
for our proverbial wagon ride across the west.

4
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.005
Well, now it's time to take our first steps on our journey

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.000
by starting our project.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want you to open a terminal window

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and navigate to where you store your code.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I store my code in a directory called code

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.006
in my local route.

10
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.002
Again, I am doing this outside of the GOPATH.

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.002
You may find for your uses

12
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.007
that you want to do this in the GOPATH,

13
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.004
but that's your choice.

14
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:34.008
So in this directory,

15
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:38.007
I want you to create a directory called cninf

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.002
for cloud native infrastructure.

17
00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.000
So within my home directory,

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.005
I've now created a directory for my code

19
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.007
and then in there, cninf

20
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.006
and that's going to be the directory for our actual work.

21
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.007
Now within here, I want you to execute a command

22
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.008
but before we hit enter, I'm going to talk about it.

23
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.001
So let's type it out first.

24
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.000
So kubebuilder init --domain

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.005
and I'm going to choose a domain that makes sense to me.

26
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.000
And now I'm going to specify my repo.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.004
This repo is only a requirement

28
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:13.009
if you are working outside your GOPATH.

29
00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.003
All right, so let's talk about this a little bit

30
00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.008
before we hit enter.

31
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:19.006
So we're leveraging Kubebuilder.

32
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.005
Again, it's on your path as per the requirements

33
00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.009
and we're going to call the init operation

34
00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.006
to set up a new project.

35
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.008
Now within here, we will specify the domain

36
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.004
where our kinds and our APIs are going to live.

37
00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.002
This domain should be personal to you or your company.

38
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.000
Now I'm using lil for LinkedIn Learning

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then my personal domain.

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.003
I'm going to encourage you to do something very similar

41
00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.007
as part of this exercise.

42
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.009
Now again, because I'm working outside my GOPATH,

43
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.008
I need to specify the repo.

44
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.002
And this is the repo where my code itself

45
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:55.009
will ultimately live

46
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.009
and that's sort of go standard things.

47
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.001
I am storing this in a private GitHub repo

48
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.006
so I'm specifying that repo path to this operator code.

49
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.007
Now we can provide more options here

50
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.005
because we're going to need them later.

51
00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.008
But instead, I want to build this step by step

52
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.003
so we're going to stick with just the bare minimum

53
00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:18.007
and this is the bare minimum to generate a project.

54
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.008
So let's hit enter and go ahead and generate that project.

55
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.004
You're going to see a lot of things happening on your machine

56
00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:31.004
so be patient and let it run.

57
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.009
Okay, so what just happened?

58
00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.007
We're going to take a look at the skeleton here for a minute

59
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.000
but I want you to note that it downloaded

60
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.001
a whole bunch of code,

61
00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:42.007
and you'll see, kind of in the top third of my screen,

62
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:44.000
that there's a go mod tidy.

63
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.009
So it's building a go mod for us

64
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.007
and it's getting all of the dependencies

65
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.001
that we are going to need to build this operator

66
00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:57.003
in addition to setting up the structure of that operator.

67
00:02:57.003 --> 00:02:59.001
Now, we can't really do anything yet

68
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:00.006
and you see here the last line,

69
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.007
it tells us, build a resource, right?

70
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.005
Define an API.

71
00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.000
We'll get to that but for now,

72
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.007
let's take a look at our actual code.

73
00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.000
So I'm going to jump up a level here

74
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.002
and I'm going to open up my IDE.

75
00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:16.001
We didn't really talk much about IDEs.

76
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:18.003
I use GoLand as my IDE.

77
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.006
I use IntelliJ tools every day in my work.

78
00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:21.009
I feel more comfortable with them.

79
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.000
That's why I'm using them for this course.

80
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.007
These tools cost money, however.

81
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:29.002
You can do everything that I am doing in any IDE

82
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.005
because we're not going to be using any features of the IDE.

83
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:34.003
We're only using it to type code.

84
00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:38.005
So if you're using Visual Studio Code or VI or any tool,

85
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.009
you will be fine using that.

86
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.001
So don't get hung up on the IDE aspect.

87
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:46.008
This is just what I am using for this course.

88
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:49.005
So let's go ahead and open up our cninf

89
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:52.004
and you'll see we got a whole bunch of code.

90
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:53.006
Let's take a look at what we've got.

91
00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:55.003
So we've got a project

92
00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.005
that defines our project, where it lives.

93
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.004
These are the things that we put in

94
00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:03.003
when we built our operator through that init.

95
00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:04.009
We got a main.go file

96
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.002
and we're going to talk a little bit about what's in here.

97
00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:09.005
For now, just take a look through it,

98
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:10.008
read some of the methods.

99
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:15.003
You'll see what's going on with the actual main.go.

100
00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:16.008
We also get a make file

101
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:19.000
and this make file, we're going to use many times

102
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.005
though we're not going to modify it.

103
00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:25.009
So a lot of the actions that we do, utilize make.

104
00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.004
We got a go mod and right now,

105
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:29.006
there's only three dependencies listed.

106
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:33.000
That's fine, we're going to add plenty more as we go.

107
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.003
We did get a Docker file

108
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.008
and when we talk about deploying our code,

109
00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.006
we are going to leverage this Docker file.

110
00:04:39.006 --> 00:04:41.006
Now, a couple things that I want you to notice.

111
00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.007
In this Docker file,

112
00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:46.007
it's setting up the architecture to be AMD 64,

113
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:49.004
because I'm running on an Intel-based Mac,

114
00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:53.004
but I'm using a golang image that's similar to Alpine

115
00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:56.005
so it's going to be a Linux image with AMD 64.

116
00:04:56.005 --> 00:04:59.001
If you are deploying to an arm chip set,

117
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:01.002
you may need to change this go arch,

118
00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:03.008
but that'll be down the road if you're dealing with that.

119
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:05.009
That could be a problem of running it.

120
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.007
Just pay attention as you go.

121
00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:10.002
You get a couple ignore files,

122
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.005
you get some config with some default values,

123
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:15.009
and you also get this hack folder

124
00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.007
that just has a boiler plate.

125
00:05:17.007 --> 00:05:19.005
That's about all you get for free

126
00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:20.009
but that's actually quite a bit

127
00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.004
because we actually get a majority

128
00:05:22.004 --> 00:05:24.002
of our scaffolding already,

129
00:05:24.002 --> 00:05:27.003
with the exception of our CRDs and our APIs.

130
00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:29.000
And that's for the next video.
