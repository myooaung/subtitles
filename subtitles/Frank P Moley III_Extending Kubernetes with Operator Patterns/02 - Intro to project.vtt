00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] All right,

2
00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:02.002
we're almost done with the pre-work

3
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.006
so we can write some code, but before we get there,

4
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.006
it's time to introduce the project that we will be building

5
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.002
as part of this course,

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:15.001
s3 is an object storage technology from Amazon.

7
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.000
It is extremely reliable

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.001
and very easy to use.

9
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.000
As such it's often used in Cloud Native

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.009
and distributed systems.

11
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.003
Now every Cloud provider offers this similar type

12
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.001
of technology, which makes it even better

13
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.000
for uses by systems because everywhere you go

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.003
you've got this sort of technology.

15
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.001
The key is we need to provision it

16
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:43.001
before our deployments so we can use it within our apps.

17
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.003
Now there's multiple ways to do this

18
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.001
but what I am going to propose that we are going to build

19
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.006
as part of this course,

20
00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.007
is we are going to build an operator

21
00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.000
that will be responsible for creating

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.003
and essentially mounting an s3 bucket

23
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.001
for our applications to use.

24
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.005
We want to tie it to the same namespace

25
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.002
that our CR is created in,

26
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:08.004
As namespace isolation is a common security practice

27
00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:12.000
but our operator will definitely act on any namespace.

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.007
So when we do this, we are going to create the bucket

29
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.007
for each namespace as we go forward.

30
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.004
And this is really, really important

31
00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.000
when you're building applications,

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.007
because a namespace tend to apps

33
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.002
that share a common purpose.

34
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.004
So sharing an s3 bucket

35
00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:31.005
between all of those apps in a namespace is kind of okay.

36
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.007
And furthermore, having it defined in the namespace

37
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.009
means that your apps can get the configuration

38
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.008
from a central location.

39
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.005
But more on that later,

40
00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.007
I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself.

41
00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.004
The basic gist here is that our operator

42
00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.008
is going to be an API gateway for s3

43
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.007
but it's an API gateway for the creation

44
00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:56.002
and management of the bucket, not the objects in them.

45
00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.008
That is what the applications will do.

46
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.004
When you build an application, you're going to load the details

47
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.009
and you are going to put your objects and pull your objects

48
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.003
out of the bucket

49
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.000
but your app doesn't have to worry about the bucket

50
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.008
because it's going to be defined by our operator.

51
00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.007
So now we're going to expand and improve on this operator

52
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.005
throughout the next few videos,

53
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.004
but we're going to do this

54
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:22.001
in a very step by step methodical process.

55
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.000
So bear with me as we're doing this

56
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.002
because you may see something that doesn't make sense.

57
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:30.004
For instance, how we're going to manage credentials early on?

58
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.005
But it will make sense by the end of the course

59
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:35.005
I'm trying to give you this from the ground up.

60
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.007
But for right now, the important point is

61
00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:41.003
we're going to build an operator that manages s3 buckets

62
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.000
per namespace for our applications.
