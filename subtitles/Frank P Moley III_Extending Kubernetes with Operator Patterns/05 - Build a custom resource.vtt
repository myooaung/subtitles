00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] So we've defined our project

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.008
and created an API with a kind.

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.009
Now it's time for us to populate the CRD,

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.005
so we can start providing the custom resource

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.004
for our controller to handle.

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.004
Okay, in your IDE, I want you to start by opening up

7
00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:21.008
the API, v1alpha1, and the object store types.

8
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:22.009
Now here's where we're going to go out

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.001
and actually define our object store.

10
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.003
So in the object store struct, there is a value called Foo.

11
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.007
We are going to replace that with a string,

12
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:37.008
and you need to do JSON serialization here.

13
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:44.007
We're also going to put a value of locked as a boolean.

14
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.004
And once again, it includes your JSON serialization.

15
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.000
So now that that is done,

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.009
let's jump over into our terminal,

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:57.008
and I want you to type make manifests.

18
00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.007
So now back in your IDE, I want you to open up config,

19
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:06.006
CRD, bases, and then the object store YAML.

20
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.000
And you'll see that this is an actual

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.005
object store definition.

22
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.000
It talks about the group.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.002
It talks about the kind,

24
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.007
and as you scroll down, you'll see some notes.

25
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.005
There is a description of the API version.

26
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.007
That's something that you can configure.

27
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.002
There's a description of the kind,

28
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.007
again, something else that you can customize.

29
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.007
But we get down here into the spec,

30
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.006
and you'll see that we have a locked value

31
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:36.000
here on line 39, and on line 41, we have name,

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.004
but we have a description that doesn't really make sense.

33
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.006
So let's go back into our object types,

34
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:46.006
and let's actually change this comment to match name.

35
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.009
And we're going to put in a value here

36
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.002
that kind of makes sense.

37
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.003
It doesn't have to be specific too much,

38
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.000
but it should make sense to your users.

39
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.009
And now we're going to do the same for locked.

40
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.006
Okay, so now that we've done that,

41
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.009
we're going to go back into our terminal,

42
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.004
and we're going to make manifests again.

43
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.007
Go back into our IDE, back into object store,

44
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:13.003
and you'll see that now our description

45
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.002
matches the text we typed.

46
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.005
So that is something very important

47
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.006
when you're building a controller.

48
00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:19.006
You really want to be as specific as you can

49
00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:21.001
with your descriptions,

50
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.002
'cause that's what developers are going to see.

51
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.002
So back to the terminal once again.

52
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.008
We are now going to do a make install.

53
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.007
What this is going to do is it's actually going to

54
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.006
install the CRD into your Kubernetes environment

55
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.007
that you have configured in your kube config

56
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.008
as the default one being used.

57
00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.009
So now that we do that,

58
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.003
I'm going to create an alias for Kubernetes.

59
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.009
Now I've got this alias defined.

60
00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.008
Let me clear my screen here.

61
00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:56.009
The command I'm going to use is alias K equals kubectl.

62
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.004
And I'm going to use this everywhere.

63
00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:00.006
I've actually got this in my profile

64
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.005
but whenever I'm doing a K,

65
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.004
it's actually just kube cuddle is what I'm doing.

66
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:09.001
So I'm going to do a K get CRD, and you'll see

67
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.006
that we have a CRD defined in our infrastructure,

68
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:16.003
and that matches the values that we would expect.

69
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:22.004
So I can now do a K describe CRD.

70
00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.007
And I'm just going to copy this value here.

71
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:30.008
And you'll see that the CRD matches what we saw in our IDE,

72
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:31.008
as we might expect.

73
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:35.009
It's actually just been installed into here.

74
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.003
Now, having the CRD is great,

75
00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:39.000
but let's do something with it.

76
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.001
So jump back into your IDE,

77
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:44.000
and I want you to go into your samples

78
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.002
and open up this sample,

79
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:48.004
and we're going to modify this a little bit.

80
00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:49.006
The first thing that we're going to do

81
00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.008
is we're going to change the name of this.

82
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.009
And I'm going to encourage you to change this name

83
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.001
to something that makes sense to you.

84
00:03:56.001 --> 00:04:02.008
I am going to call this FPMLIL-01.

85
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:07.004
Now in my spec, I am going to create a name element.

86
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:11.000
And the name element that I am going to use is

87
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.009
FPMLIL live EXTK8S-01.

88
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.004
Now this needs to be very unique,

89
00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:22.005
because this is going to create the bucket with this name.

90
00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.003
As such, it has to be globally unique.

91
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:26.005
So this will work for me.

92
00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:30.005
I'm also going to set the value of locked equal to false.

93
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:35.003
Now, once that's done, I want to jump back into my console,

94
00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:41.001
and I am going to do a K create NS LIL.

95
00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:44.006
So I'm going to create a namespace in Kubernetes called LIL.

96
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:52.003
Now I'm going to do a K apply dash N LIL dash F config samples,

97
00:04:52.003 --> 00:04:54.006
and then this value.

98
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:57.000
We'll let that be applied to Kubernetes.

99
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.009
So now I can do a K get OBJ store,

100
00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.008
which is the name of my kind in LIL.

101
00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:04.006
And you'll see that I have have one out there

102
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:06.004
that I just created.

103
00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:09.001
So now what I want to do is I want to do a describe on this.

104
00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.005
So we're going to do a describe on object store

105
00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:18.003
FPMLIL-01 -N LIL.

106
00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:21.009
And you'll see that this matches what we just entered,

107
00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.003
and that's what we would expect it to do.

108
00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:27.009
So this spec down there has the name and the locked value.

109
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.005
And the final thing that I want to do is I want to do a delete

110
00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:37.007
on the object store -N LIL, FPMLIL-01.

111
00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:43.004
And now I can do a K get object store -N LIL.

112
00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:44.007
And you'll see we have none there,

113
00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:46.001
which is what we would expect.

114
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.000
So we've created the CRD.

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.006
We've created the CR to go with it,

116
00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:52.002
and we've applied it, viewed it, and deleted it

117
00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:55.000
from the name space that we're using.
