00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Frank] If you are building a platform today,

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.008
Kubernetes is most likely your runtime of choice.

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.001
Kubernetes is a wonderful platform,

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.000
but operations and repeated actions on those clusters

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
can sometimes be tedious,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.009
especially when you're dealing with hundreds of clusters.

7
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.005
This course is an introduction into the operator pattern,

8
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:26.007
and provides the basics of implementing your own operator.

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.005
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

10
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm an engineering leader, cloud native developer,

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.008
and constant student.

12
00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.003
I have been working with cloud native platforms

13
00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:36.009
for many years now,

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.001
both as a development runtime for enterprise systems,

15
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.006
as well as building global systems

16
00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.007
running on Kubernetes.

17
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:47.005
Operators have saved me countless hours,

18
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.005
and I'm excited to share the power of them with you.

19
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.001
Let's get ready for an educational journey

20
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.000
through the Kubernetes operator pattern.
