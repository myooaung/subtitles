00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] So I hope that this step by step process

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.008
got you excited about the possibility of operators.

3
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.005
Maybe even as excited as I am.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.005
In fact, if you ask the people that work with me

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.005
on a day to day basis, they hear the word,

6
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.008
"We can create an operator for that" all too often.

7
00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.009
Let's take a look at what we've learned

8
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.006
and where we could go from there,

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.001
just in case you're not quite as excited as I am

10
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.006
about building Kubernetes operators.

11
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.003
First, let's start out with the recap.

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:26.007
So we talked about and learned about

13
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.003
the operator pattern for Kubernetes.

14
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.003
We also learned about some common terms

15
00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:34.004
and definitions when we're talking about operators,

16
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.006
as well as Kubernetes as a whole.

17
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.001
We then built an operator from the ground up

18
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.002
based on a very specific use case.

19
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:43.003
Throughout our process,

20
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.000
we've been testing the operator,

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.003
but we've been testing it manually,

22
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.009
and we've deployed the operator

23
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.003
using the Kubebuilder framework.

24
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.002
Of course, we talked a little bit about Helm,

25
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.007
but we'll talk more about that next.

26
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.002
So let's talk about how you could take this operator

27
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.001
and extend it to learn even more.

28
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.001
Of course, you can do other resources.

29
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.006
Think about attaching a database or an QSQ,

30
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.008
or some other thing that you would use

31
00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.008
from Cloud Infrastructure to your Kubernetes cluster.

32
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.008
You could also extend the functionality for our buckets.

33
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.000
You could provide more bells and whistles in the CR,

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
or you could offer more ways

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.002
of flexibility across different name spaces,

36
00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.006
in case you want to share that across multiple name spaces.

37
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.000
You also could talk about building restricted IAM access.

38
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.004
So think about that.

39
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.003
A CR requests a bucket,

40
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:38.002
you build an IAM user specifically for that bucket,

41
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.002
you then build the bucket

42
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.007
and set up the permissions appropriately,

43
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.008
and then you provide a secret

44
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:49.002
with those IAM credentials alongside the config map

45
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.009
that the applications can use.

46
00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.000
That way, each name space gets its own secure bucket

47
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that only they have access to.

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.005
That would be a really powerful way

49
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.000
to extend this operator sort of

50
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.005
to the next level.

51
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.006
And you could build a home chart.

52
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:05.006
So we built a Docker file using the make,

53
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.009
and push that Docker image out to a repository,

54
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.009
and then you could build a Helm Chart

55
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.001
that deploys that along with all of those manifests,

56
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.001
and you can customize those manifests however you want.

57
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.008
That's really how you push a production operator,

58
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.002
is through something like Helm

59
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.005
or providing the manifest themselves,

60
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.004
but ultimately pushing that up to Docker Hub

61
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.002
or some other container repository.

62
00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.000
Ultimately, I would love you to get to the point

63
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.005
where you create your own operators

64
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.001
and maybe you will be as excited as I am,

65
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.004
where you tell your teammates,

66
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.008
"Hey, we can build an operator for that,"

67
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.005
but I would suggest that you go build one

68
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.005
on your own with Kubebuilder,

69
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.003
but I would also look at other operator frameworks.

70
00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.005
They're all close enough with concepts

71
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:51.000
that I think you should be able to pick up any of them

72
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
just from what we've learned in this course.

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.009
And then you will pick and choose

74
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.001
which operator framework you want to use

75
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.000
for your everyday work.

76
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.002
And the most important thing here

77
00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:04.007
is to find real world use cases that work for you.

78
00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.003
If you're working with Kubernetes today,

79
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.006
you probably have 20 things you can think of

80
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:12.006
right now that you would love to have an operator for.

81
00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.005
Pick one and go build one

82
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.003
and show it to your boss and your team

83
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:18.003
and see what they think.

84
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.004
Now I understand that learning

85
00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.000
is a very valuable skill that we all have,

86
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.007
and I'm a perpetual student,

87
00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.004
And I actually take pride in the concept

88
00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:30.005
of always learning and never stop learning.

89
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:32.007
But I also understand that your time is important,

90
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:34.004
and I want to thank you

91
00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.009
for you spending your time with me

92
00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.003
throughout this course.

93
00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:39.008
It really means the world to me

94
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.004
when I see all kinds of people talking about

95
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.006
what they've learned through my courses.

96
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.000
And I really appreciate that,

97
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Not only because of the time commitment,

98
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.009
because then it validates that

99
00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.005
we're all in this together,

100
00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:53.008
regardless of tenure in this industry,

101
00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.004
and I'm very active on Twitter,

102
00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:58.002
GitHub, Stack Overflow,

103
00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.007
LinkedIn Learning Questions

104
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:01.007
is associated with this course,

105
00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:02.009
and I provided my handle there

106
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.007
for Twitter, GitHub, and Stack Overflow.

107
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.007
But if you've got questions about this course

108
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:07.008
or any of my courses,

109
00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.006
or you want to talk about tech,

110
00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.003
feel free to reach out to me

111
00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:13.003
through these communication media.

112
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:14.009
My commitment to you doesn't end

113
00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.004
when this course ends, so please engage with me.

114
00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:19.003
Tell me what you liked,

115
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:20.002
tell me what you didn't,

116
00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:21.009
tell me what you would improve,

117
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.008
but most importantly,

118
00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:24.002
tell me what you're doing

119
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:27.000
with what you've learned through this course.
