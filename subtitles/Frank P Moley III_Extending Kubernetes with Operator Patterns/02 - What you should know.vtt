00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] In order to be successful in this course

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.001
there are a few prerequisites that we need to discuss.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.003
This course is about Kubernetes operators,

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:13.001
and as such Kubernetes is a key prerequisite.

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.008
You will need access to a Kubernetes Cluster,

6
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.007
either locally, on your network, or in the cloud.

7
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.001
You will find that kind

8
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.003
is a valid tool kit for local development.

9
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.004
Kind is very easy to install on most operating systems,

10
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.005
especially Linux or BSD-based ones.

11
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.004
Consider a VM if you are using Windows,

12
00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.006
but it will work on Windows Professional too.

13
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.001
I will be using kind for my local development.

14
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.008
Kind itself, if you choose to go that route,

15
00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.004
will require Docker.

16
00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.003
Again, there's very clear installation instructions

17
00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:51.001
for getting Docker running on your machine,

18
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.007
but I assume if you have used Kubernetes

19
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.004
then you've already got Docker running.

20
00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.004
Minikube will also work if you choose to use that.

21
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:04.000
The importance is Kubernetes, not how you get it.

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.009
And with all that being said you will need kubectl,

23
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.002
or Kube Cuddle, depending on how you say it,

24
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:14.003
either way you need this with an appropriate configuration

25
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.000
pointing to your Kubernetes Cluster

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.002
that you are going to be using for this operator.

27
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:24.005
Kubernetes and many of the tools are built using Go,

28
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.008
and our operator framework is no exception.

29
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.002
You will need to have the Go language installed

30
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.007
on your machine and a proper GOPATH set.

31
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.006
Now, I will be using Go version 1.17.5

32
00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.006
at the time of this recording,

33
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:44.000
but I tend to keep my Go version up to date at all times.

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.005
You will also need a basic understanding

35
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.003
of the language itself.

36
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.000
If you have not used Go before

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I would suggest you pause this course

38
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.003
and jump into one of the Go courses

39
00:01:56.003 --> 00:02:00.002
here on LinkedIn Learning so you can get up to speed.

40
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.005
We will be using Go mod for dependency management.

41
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.008
If you have not used it before it's pretty straightforward,

42
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:08.003
but it would be worth a look

43
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.003
before going too much further so that you could understand

44
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.004
how all of the dependencies are going to be managed.

45
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.008
And we will have several dependencies

46
00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:18.009
throughout this course.

47
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.001
Now, Kubebuilder is a software development kit

48
00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:25.000
that we will use in this course.

49
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.005
Kubebuilder itself uses the Go language

50
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:30.001
to extend Kubernetes.

51
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.006
This will be the SDK that we use to define our APIs

52
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.009
and CRDs for our operator.

53
00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.007
It isn't the only SDK for building an operator however,

54
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:43.003
but it is the most low level, at least in my opinion,

55
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.006
which makes it a great tool for learning

56
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.008
the ins and outs of building an operator.

57
00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:50.009
But you will need to install this tool

58
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.002
after you have Go installed.

59
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.009
The Kubebuilder website has some great details

60
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.005
on installing their software.

61
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.001
Since this is an advanced course

62
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm not going to walk you through these steps,

63
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
just know that you're going to need this tool

64
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.006
and have it on your path.

65
00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:10.000
Now, the final dependency for this course

66
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is Amazon Web Services.

67
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.009
You're going to simply need a free account.

68
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:18.004
We will use that AWS account within our operator

69
00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.008
leveraging the Go SDK that they provide,

70
00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:24.004
and we're going to use that to build cloud resources

71
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:26.002
as part of our operator.

72
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.004
But more on that project later.

73
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:30.002
The important thing here is that you need to have

74
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.002
an AWS free account.

75
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.000
Furthermore, I'm going to recommend you do

76
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.001
a couple more things.

77
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.005
I'm going to recommend that you install the AWS CLI

78
00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:40.009
because it's going to give you a quick and easy way

79
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.001
to actually check what's going on with AWS

80
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:47.005
and to really inspect the actual web calls

81
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.001
that you're going to need to make through the SDK,

82
00:03:50.001 --> 00:03:51.008
and I'm also going to recommend that you go ahead

83
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:55.004
and build an IAM user that has admin rights

84
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:59.001
and go ahead and configure that through AWS Configure.

85
00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.001
Again, this is just my recommendation to help you through.

86
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:04.004
It's not something we're going to use in this course.

87
00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:07.004
It's just my experience of using AWS,

88
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:12.006
sometimes that CLI makes figuring out the APIs a lot easier.

89
00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:16.004
Again, the important part here is the AWS account

90
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.000
that you're going to need.
