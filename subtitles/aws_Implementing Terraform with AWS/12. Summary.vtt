00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.660
[Autogenerated] all right.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.410
We covered a lot of ground in this module,

3
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.800
and I know it was probably a lot to take in.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.040
Let's just review some of the key points that you should bear in mind.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.750
First of all,

6
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.450
it's a really important for you to use source control

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.090
for your infrastructure is code.

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.120
The first thing I do when I start up a new project is I create

9
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.470
a repository and GitHub I clone it locally,

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.860
and I make sure that I'm always pushing my changes back up to

11
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.660
that remote repository so I don't lose anything.

12
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.340
And if someone wants to collaborate with me so much,

13
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.140
the better second thing is automate your deployment process.

14
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.620
Yes, you've got your infrastructure to find in code,

15
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.720
but humans are still fallible and make mistakes when

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.250
they're running terra form commands.

17
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.410
It probably makes sense to have something automating that

18
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.840
deployment that doesn't make those manual mistakes.

19
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.040
The last thing and this is more of a piece of homework that you could

20
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.800
do is look into ways to test your infrastructure,

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.550
to make sure the thing that you want to deploy is the

22
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.250
thing that was actually deployed.

23
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.940
And there are a number of different solutions out there,

24
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.950
that sort of bolt onto terra form.

25
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.490
The one that I'm most familiar with is Terra Grunt.

26
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.860
But I know there's other ones out there.

27
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.140
So do a little Googling.

28
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.480
See what you come up with coming up in the next module.

29
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.000
We are going to build on this infrastructure that

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.450
we've been deploying all this time.

31
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.890
So far.

32
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.110
It's just been V PCs and networking,

33
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.410
but there's more to life than just networking.

34
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.450
We're going to get Joshua Magee involved to deploy some

35
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.840
applications on the infrastructure,

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.220
and we're also going to see how you can use ______ form

37
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.680
to deploy a CloudFormation template, which seems strange when I say it out loud.

38
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.130
But you understand what the reasons are for doing

39
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.940
that once we get through the module.

40
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.000
So that's all coming up. Next, Stay tuned
