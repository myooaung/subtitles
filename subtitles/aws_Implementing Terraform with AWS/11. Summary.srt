00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,430
[Autogenerated] all right, I know that was an action packed module.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,360
We learned a lot.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,940
So let's just quickly review what we went over here.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,260
We talked about multiple A W s providers,

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,430
and the reason why you would need more than won a WS

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,610
provider in your configuration,

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,630
it would either have to do with a different region or a different account,

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:24,320
or we kind of saw how you can use an assume role setting

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,260
to use a different account if you have access to assume a

10
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,640
role in a separate account,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,740
we also saw how you used the aliases you create for those

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,270
providers in resources modules and data sources.

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,920
That was pretty useful coming up in the next module,

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,070
we are going to look into remote state.

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,300
How do we move all this local state,

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,120
which we know is not really best practice to use a W s native

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,140
constructs for storing that remote state.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,940
So we're gonna use S3 for that storage,

19
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,000
and then we're gonna migrate these existing state of our Deb vpc to use a

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
back end configuration that's using S3 and dynamodb. So that's all coming up in the next module
