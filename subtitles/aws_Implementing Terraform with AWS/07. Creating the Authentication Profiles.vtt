00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.620
[Autogenerated] all right, we're back in visual studio code,

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.700
and we're ready to get rolling with what's in three dash sec dash rolls.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.120
Let's go ahead and expand that out,

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.970
and the first thing we want to take a look at is

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.940
what's in commands .NET y-axis to.

6
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.180
And this will be important to understand what's

7
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.410
going on with the AWS credentials.

8
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.830
When we're looking at the Terra form configuration we're

9
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.140
gonna be using to AWS profiles here,

10
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.560
we're going to create an infrastructure profile and security account profile,

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
and the reason for that is because the infrastructure account

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.400
has no permissions in the security account.

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.440
So we have to create a profile for both,

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.930
and you're also going to have to go in and create a user in each account that

15
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.080
you'll be using for this portion of the demo I already have.

16
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.140
Those users created Elsie Vasquez and JSON Gibson.

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.540
JSON.

18
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.740
Gibson's user account has been created in the Security AWS account.

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.420
First, we're going to run a W s configure dash dash profile infra,

20
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.420
and that is going to create an infra profile in our AWS credentials.

21
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.940
So if I go ahead and run that bring up the command prompt.

22
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.910
It's going to show that I already have an access key set,

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.040
and I already have a secret access key set,

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.740
my region said to us East one, and I don't have a default output format,

25
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.160
and you can rinse and repeat for the SEC profile.

26
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.170
Those are the two profiles that we're gonna be

27
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.800
referencing in the terra form configuration,

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.850
so you need to have those set up already before you go

29
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.260
through the terra form initialization process.

30
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.370
So that's just a heads up.

31
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.440
So, you know,

32
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.000
let's go ahead and hide that command window and we'll go ahead and open up the main .NET e f file.
