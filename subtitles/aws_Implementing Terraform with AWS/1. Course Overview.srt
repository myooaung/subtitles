[Autogenerated] Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,820
My name is Ned Bellavance and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,910
implementing Terra Form with Amazon Web Services.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,960
I am a Hash Corp ambassador Terra Form certified associate

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,640
and founder of NED in the Cloud LLC.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,330
Has she corpse?

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,680
Terra form is a powerful tool to automate the deployment of

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,240
your infrastructure across multiple clouds,

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,040
both public and private.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,960
In this course,

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,760
we are going to learn about the nuances of deploying infrastructure

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,710
as code on AWS with terra form and leveraging the services in a W s

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,600
to improve your terra form automation.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,190
Some of the major topics that we will include cover using the AWS provider,

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,680
including authentication and modules using multiple

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,040
providers in a single configuration,

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,320
leveraging AWS S3 storage for remote state and automating

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,340
deployments with code commit CodeBuild and code pipelines.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,340
By the end of this course,

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,810
you will be ready to deploy and manage infrastructure in AWS

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,410
with terra form before beginning this course.

22
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,450
You should be familiar with a W s,

23
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,570
especially the infrastructure as a service components and have an

24
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,000
intermediate level of skill with terra form.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,040
I hope you'll join me on this journey to learn more about using terra form

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:30,000
to deploy infrastructure is code on Amazon web services with the implementing terra form on AWS course at Pluralsight
