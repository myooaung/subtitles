00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.430
[Autogenerated] In our real world scenario, you are working at Globomantics.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.320
Globomantics is a food delivery service.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.140
They specialize in all kinds of food, including my favorite tacos.

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.670
And how do they deliver that food?

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
Well, they have applications that run on servers,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.020
and today those servers are running on premises.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.550
But they do want to start moving those applications to the

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.440
cloud and the tool they want to use to do that.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.130
You guessed it.

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.740
It's terra form and the cloud is AWS.

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.290
So let's talk about a few different personas within Globomantics that

12
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.450
we're going to be Impersonating one is Elsie Vasquez.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.280
She's a cloud architect,

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.300
and she's the primary person that we're going to be

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.540
acting on behalf of through the demos.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.340
But she also has some other co workers, including JSON Gibson.

17
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.820
He's a security administrator, and he's got some concerns about moving to AWS.

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.240
He wants to make sure that his security tools can continue to work,

19
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.950
and we'll also be working with Joshua Magee.

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.200
He's a software engineer, and he's going to be Ri Plat,

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.870
forming some of the applications to run on a W s.

22
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.880
He's a newbie to terra form as well,

23
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.000
and we're gonna be helping guide him along the way. Now let's talk about providers for a moment and the AWS provider specifically.
