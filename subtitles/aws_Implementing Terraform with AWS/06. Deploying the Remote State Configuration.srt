00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,780
[Autogenerated] Let's go back to our commands and we

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,340
are going to run terra form in it.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,060
And initializer are configuration helps to be in the right directory now,

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,750
doesn't it?

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,930
Okay, let's go into the proper directory first.

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,700
There we go.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,240
And now run Terra form in it.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,410
There we go.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,250
It's downloading Are plug ins now.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,440
We're gonna go ahead and run.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,450
Terra form plan dash out ST dot t f plan that will generate our

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,340
execution plan for the bucket table and the I am groups.

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,940
All right, now that that is ready we can, go ahead and run, apply.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,270
And that will create the actual bucket the Dynamo db table

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,660
and the groups with the proper policy.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,150
And it shouldn't take too long.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,650
Usually buckets and dynamo DB tables don't take very long.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,230
There we do.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,220
That was pretty quick.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,110
All right, now we do need to make note of these two output,

21
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,190
so I'm going ahead and copy this and paste it into a Notepad file.

22
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,750
I have off screen and go ahead and grab this S3

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,840
bucket name and do the same for that.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,350
There we go.

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,720
Now.

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,310
I have those two saved for use later and we've

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,450
successfully deployed our bucket dynamodb table,

28
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,040
the groups and the policies that we outlined in the diagram.

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
Now, this is a fairly simple set up for a single account.

30
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,190
But how might you set this up?

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,000
If you have multiple accounts and environments, let's dip into that for a moment.
