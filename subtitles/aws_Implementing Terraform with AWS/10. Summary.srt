00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,290
[Autogenerated] alright in summary.

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,910
Just to give you a few key takeaways from this module,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,180
The first thing I'll say is that Generally speaking,

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,630
if you are going to be using your configuration for

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,640
anything approaching production, use remote state.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,060
Just do it by default.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,140
Make that part of your practice.

8
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,400
Yeah, If it's a dev throwaway environment, you can use local state.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,940
But generally speaking, you want to use that remote state whenever you can.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,820
Another key take away is that S3 and Dynamodb support locking in workspaces,

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,570
so they support both of those extended features that you might

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,750
want to use in a collaborative environment that's going to have

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,140
multiple deployment environments.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,390
The last thing is that migration is super simple.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,760
I mean, you saw how easy it was.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,210
We ran one command.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,670
After adding the configuration,

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,390
it seamlessly moved our data up to S3 and we were done.

19
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:52,880
Of course.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,560
Like I said before, I take that back up just in case.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,640
But migration itself is super simple.

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,060
Now, coming up in the next module,

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,250
we are going to get into the world of automation and we're

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,000
gonna automate the deployments of our VPC.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,150
How are we going to do that,

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,980
we're going to use the native AWS code tools like code

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,800
commit CodeBuild and code pipelines.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,000
So that's all coming up in the next module. Stay tuned.
