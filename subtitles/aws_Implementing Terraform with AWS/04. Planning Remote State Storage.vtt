[Autogenerated] at Globomantics u R L C Vasquez and you are

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.630
planning to implement remote state storage on S3.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.940
Let's see how we're going to do that.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.900
All right, So what do we need for that?

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.550
Stay storage.

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.800
Well, we need an S3 bucket and a dynamo DB table,

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.830
and we're going to create a bucket and a table for the

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.240
infrastructure account in a W s.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.360
Now we need to grant something permissions to write to this bucket and table.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.770
So we're going to create a group in I Am and grant that group full access to

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.690
both the infrastructure bucket and the infrastructure table so you'll be

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
able to write and read data to the bucket and also enable locking by

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.140
interacting with that infrastructure table.

14
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.850
Now, other teams might be interested in querying your state as a data source,

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.090
so they need some level of access.

16
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.230
So we are going to create a second group that has read only access,

17
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.020
and they only need that access on the infrastructure bucket and not the table,

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.340
because they're not gonna be locking the state.

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.940
They just need to be able to read some information out of the

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.650
state and then use it in their configurations.

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:21.000
So we've got a bucket, a table and two groups. Let's go over to visual studio code and get this all set up.
