00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.880
[Autogenerated] when someone talks about multiple providers,

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.840
it could have more than one meaning when it comes to terra form,

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.860
they could be talking about a situation where you have more than one provider

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.260
in your configuration that are different distinct providers.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.170
For instance,

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.470
you might have the A W s provider in your configuration

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.840
and a kubernetes provider in your configuration because

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240
you want to manage both aspects.

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.660
It could also mean that you have multiple instances of the

10
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.660
same provider and that is the case that we're gonna be

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.440
talking about when it comes to AWS.

12
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.240
Let's take a look at one scenario that would call

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.500
for multiple instances of the A.

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.240
W s provider.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.490
Now you'll remember at Globomantics we are setting up VPC s

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.960
for development and now we're also going to set up some VP CSS

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.710
for production and we want to V.

18
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.870
P.

19
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.860
C s in two different regions to handle production workloads.

20
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.430
The first is going to be in the US East one region and there are going to be

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.490
two availability zones with the VPC stretched across those availability

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.250
zones with two public sub nets and to database sub nets were going to do the

23
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.330
exact same thing over in us West one.

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.120
We're going to take those two availability zones plopped down our VPC and

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.530
then plopped down our public and database sub nets.

26
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.040
So that is the goal of the deployment.

27
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.100
Now, how do we go about specifying multiple AWS providers in our configuration?

28
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm glad you asked. Let's take a look at a code example.
