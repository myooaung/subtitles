00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.420
[Autogenerated] Let's briefly review what we went over in this module.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.940
Well, first we compared and contrasted Terra Form and CloudFormation.

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.930
Where are they different?

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.650
Where are they?

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.610
Like if you're familiar with CloudFormation and about to pick up terra form,

6
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.410
it's actually not that big of a leap.

7
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.940
That's actually the transition that I made, and I found it fairly natural.

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.890
We also talked about providers and specifically the

9
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.480
A W s provider for terra form,

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.610
and went over some ways that you can authenticate against that provider

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.320
and then actually went through a deployment process where we deployed a

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.910
development VPC coming up in the next module.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.700
We are going to get the security team involved.

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.150
Remember they were worried about using their security stack and AWS.

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.740
So we're gonna help allay those fears.

16
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.310
We're also going to get into how to use multiple accounts and

17
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.340
multiple regions in your configurations.

18
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.200
And finally,

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.750
we're going to delve a little bit more to how to use those

20
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.000
credentials files with multiple profiles. That's all coming up in the next module
