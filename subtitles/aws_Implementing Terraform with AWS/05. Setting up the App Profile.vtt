00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.520
[Autogenerated] all right.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.720
Here we are in visual studio code.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.770
And just for the sake of time,

4
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.360
I've actually taken the liberty of already setting up the state bucket

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.140
and dynamo DB table that Joshua Magee is going to use.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.230
If you're following along,

7
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.140
you can deploy the configuration that is an eight app remote state set up.

8
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.040
But in the interest of time, I thought I would just set it up ahead of time.

9
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.020
Now let's expand out eight app deploy.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.770
This is the application that we're going to deploy as Joshua Magee.

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.940
Let's start by opening up the commands dot txt.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.150
The first thing I want to point out is you're going to need to create

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.020
the Joshua Magee user in the infrastructure account.

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.550
So if you haven't done that, I recommend going and doing that now,

15
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.060
and we're going to configure Joshua Magee to be able to manage E c.

16
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.530
Two.

17
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.510
I am Dynamodb, Lambda CloudFormation and RDS.

18
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.700
He's gonna have a lot of permissions here, and that's fine in our context.

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.940
In a production context,

20
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.200
you might want to lock down what Joshua Magee would be able to do.

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.740
But remember, this is development.

22
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.510
Once you have Joshua Magee set up as a user.

23
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.280
The next thing to do is to generate access keys for him and then create a

24
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.140
new profile using the AWS CLI and call that profile app.

25
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.340
So those were the first to actions that we're going to go through.

26
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.310
Once you have that all set up, we can move to the next step,

27
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.740
which is to deploy the Terra form configuration.

28
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.000
Before we do that, let's examine what's in the terra form configuration, shall we?
