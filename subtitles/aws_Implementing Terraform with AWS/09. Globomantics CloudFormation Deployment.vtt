[Autogenerated] alright at Globomantics again,

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.150
we're working as Joshua Magee and we've got this awesome set up in our dead VPC.

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.640
We've got our Web servers and are low bouncing our database servers

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.620
and we have this other application that was developed by somebody

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.510
else and it's codified in a CloudFormation template and we're not

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.400
quite ready to unpack all that.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.360
So we like to deploy this CloudFormation template using tear form.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.590
What's in this template?

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.850
Will it deploys a lambda function and a dynamo db table that work

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.150
together Now you might look at that and say,

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.740
Well, why do we care about the Dev VPC?

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.510
Because Lambda and Dynamodb don't live in a VPC while

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.340
in this particular configuration,

14
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.820
the Lambda does need to talk to those web servers in the public sub nets.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.020
So as part of the template,

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.030
there's a VPC integration where Lambda puts network interfaces in

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.840
those public sub nets to talk to those servers.

18
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.030
So we're going to use our existing Deb VPC as a data source

19
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.000
to feed into this CloudFormation template. Let's go over to visual studio code and get that deployed
