00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.688
>All right, in this video
2

3
00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:07.998
we have a little assignment here
3

4
00:00:07.998 --> 00:00:10.890
to Create Reactive Repositories.
4

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.039
So what we wanna do is Create Reactive Repository
5

6
00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.070
implementations for the category
6

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.031
and recipe document objects,
7

8
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:19.821
I keep wanting to say entities but,
8

9
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:21.296
or domain objects.
9

10
00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:24.921
And so we wanna do a reactive repository for each,
10

11
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.581
and then like I did in the last video,
11

12
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.600
go into the bootstrap class,
12

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.619
get a handle on the repositories
13

14
00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.421
and go ahead and get an output of the count function.
14

15
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:35.458
Spit that out to the log
15

16
00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.540
just like I did in the previous video.
16

17
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.287
What I wanna do here is just get you acclimated
17

18
00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:42.290
to starting to work with these reactive types
18

19
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.123
and see how it works.
19

20
00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:46.362
And then, let's also create integration tests
20

21
00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:48.347
for these two repositories too.
21

22
00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.785
So let's go in, create a new object,
22

23
00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:55.235
save it, and then do a fetch all and get a count there.
23

24
00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:57.034
So there's a couple of different ways we can test it.
24

25
00:00:57.034 --> 00:00:58.706
So we just wanna make sure that these are
25

26
00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:00.755
in fact persisting okay.
26

27
00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:02.125
And in the next video,
27

28
00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.213
I will go through this little assignment
28

29
00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:07.024
step-by-step so you can see exactly what's going on.
29

30
00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:09.274
Just as a head's up, I forgot to mention it,
30

31
00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:12.064
we are in a new repository.
31

32
00:01:12.064 --> 00:01:14.671
I will have a link to the repository,
32

33
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.572
a source code in the GitHub repository for you.
33

34
00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.331
But this is a different repository,
34

35
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:21.830
so I started a brand new GitHub repository
35

36
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.103
for this segment of the course
36

37
00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:25.936
as we get into the reactive stuff.
