00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.420
OK I am going to step you through things step by step how to complete this assignment.

2
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:20.650
So the first thing we want to do is come in and add a controller for author comments a new Java class

3
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.810
called the author controller.

4
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.110
Typical class.

5
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.500
Add that to get three guys you can see I'm already on the branch display author so I'll be checking

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.020
that annotate this as a controller

7
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.990
and we're going to need the author.

8
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.590
So credit private property

9
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.930
control and create a constructor for that.

10
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.020
So spring will auto wire that and

11
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.610
a public method will turn a string for the view name

12
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.830
we're going to pass on the model

13
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.670
and we'll have him you name

14
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.810
and or this one take that model add in the attribute.

15
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.610
Author

16
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.460
and then we'll take the author repository you find all

17
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370
so just to recap what's happening here.

18
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:52.290
So we've gone in added the controller wired and the author repository and we have a method here get

19
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.820
authors and it's going to take out a model provided by Spring MVC we attach a list of authors to the

20
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.600
author's property and return back the view name of author one last thing to do is that in the request

21
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.780
mapping and we go to the authors Yarnell.

22
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.350
So when we go to slash authors for running to be 88 local US 1880 slash authors and it will render that

23
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.230
view.

24
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.810
Next thing do is come in and create a template.

25
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:36.890
Come over here and say new HCM I'll file and that's the way a spring and timely for resolving the templates

26
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.740
as long as the template name is matching that we put it in full where we put the folder name and then

27
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.380
the template name for the return value of the string so just a quick tip there we can definitely organize

28
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.280
things where the templates.

29
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.490
But for now we just have a single level under templates and say okay that to get now the default template

30
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.850
out of intelligence does not have a trailing slash here.

31
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.050
So if you use that with time leaf time is going to complain because it's not proper excel for the HCM

32
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.860
template.

33
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.520
So you'd need to do that to make timely happy.

34
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.820
But I'm going to exploit things a little bit you should not do this.

35
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.710
Copy that over

36
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.050
pay Saddam and then we're going to make the changes so just recap from the top.

37
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:38.820
So we have a document a type of HCM outraged and all five we're adding in the timely namespace that's

38
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.320
a small namespace here.

39
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:50.100
On line two and we'll leave the header as is will change the author list.

40
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.180
Just do First Name Last Name.

41
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.960
Did I add First Name Last Name of the model.

42
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.540
Chuck

43
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.680
the property that we're passing back from the model is now authors

44
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.150
call the author

45
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:30.210
is the first name property Mary Jo.

46
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.760
No sir we did canon case it so it will be lower.

47
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.520
But you do need to do the camel casing for first name last name but with a leading lower case for the

48
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.000
the dot dot finders to work.

49
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.910
We'll call him Joe Buck you watch NFL in the States.

50
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.970
Joe Buck is a.

51
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.230
ANNOUNCER I was gonna get a chuckle out of the name Joe Buck.

52
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.610
Let's take a quick look at our template.

53
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.680
So I have author list I.D. And there's Joe Buck.

54
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.830
It's exactly what we want.

55
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.410
So let's fire those up and tested startup spring

56
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.750
and right now that's pretty late project so spring is going to start start up pretty quick and Wiggins

57
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.050
is up and running on Port 88.

58
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.620
I'm going to toggle over to Chrome

59
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.890
and we want to go to authors

60
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.170
and there it is.

61
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.760
So there's our authors out of the H2 database so let me go in and just recap things real quickly we

62
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.680
added in the author controller auto Wired and author repository through a constructor.

63
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.320
We are passing in the model through Spring MVC so the Spring MVC model we are appending an attribute

64
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.360
called authors which is going to be a list of authors out of the author repository using the Find all

65
00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.910
method.

66
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.990
And we are returning the string authors to specify the view name that we want time leaf to render we

67
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.940
added in under templates which is the default template location for time leaf under Spring Boot we added

68
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:26.250
in the author's H2 AML file line to has the small namespace and then we created a table for the authors.

69
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:33.490
We take the property on the model of authors and create an iterator with author and we go through that

70
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.280
and write out three properties for our use.
