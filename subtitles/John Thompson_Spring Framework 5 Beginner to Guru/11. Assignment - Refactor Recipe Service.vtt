1

2
00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.571
All right in this video,
2

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.765
we have an assignment for you.
3

4
00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:11.435
So, we are going to refactor the Recipe Service.
4

5
00:00:11.435 --> 00:00:12.880
And you probably can predict,
5

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.642
we wanna refactor it to use the reactive types.
6

7
00:00:15.642 --> 00:00:17.650
So, what I want you to do is go in,
7

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.775
update the RecipeService to
8

9
00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:22.249
use the reactive repositories that we've created
9

10
00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.999
and also refactor the RecipeService
10

11
00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.640
to return reactive types
11

12
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.631
and of course as part of this,
12

13
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.859
we are going to be going in and updating unit tests.
13

14
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.583
And unlike I did with the IngredientService,
14

15
00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:38.007
I wanna remind you that every time you break the build,
15

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.194
somewhere a kitten is going to die.
16

17
00:00:40.194 --> 00:00:41.027
(laughs)
17

18
00:00:41.027 --> 00:00:42.126
Just joking around.
18

19
00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:44.441
So, I wanna point out that last time I did in fact,
19

20
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:46.022
break the build, which was bad,
20

21
00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:47.690
so watch your unit test.
21

22
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.130
You do wanna try to do a minimal amount and then
22

23
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.618
update your test and get those failing,
23

24
00:00:54.618 --> 00:00:55.676
get them compiling and failing,
24

25
00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:59.029
then update the rest of the code and you should be good.
25

26
00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.323
So, we want to try to follow test driven development
26

27
00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:02.756
as much as possible.
27

28
00:01:02.756 --> 00:01:06.447
As we go through the course here, that is a best practice.
28

29
00:01:06.447 --> 00:01:07.991
I want to remind you to not break the build,
29

30
00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:09.985
unlike what I did in the
30

31
00:01:09.985 --> 00:01:14.152
last time that we refactored the IngredientService.
