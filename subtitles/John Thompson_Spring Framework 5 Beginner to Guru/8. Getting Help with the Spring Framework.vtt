(light music)
1

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.930
Okay, I wanna take a moment to talk about
2

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.530
getting help inside the course.
3

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.550
As you go through any programming course,
4

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.760
chances are you're gonna hit a situation,
5

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.960
some type of error condition
6

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.170
that you don't know how to resolve.
7

8
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.280
So, the first thing that you wanna do,
8

9
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.290
if you encounter a problem,
9

10
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.900
is take a look at the course Q and A.
10

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080
So every lecture has a Q and A section.
11

12
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.360
There's a button right here that you can click on
12

13
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.360
to see the Q and A for that specific lecture in the course.
13

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.440
So there's a lot of people that have taken this course.
14

15
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.950
Over 40,000 have enrolled at this point in time.
15

16
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.470
So if you need help chances are somebody's already
16

17
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.550
encountered that problem and has asked a question about it
17

18
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.730
and posted a question and probably has gotten a response.
18

19
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.770
So, this is a good way to get you quickly rolling again.
19

20
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.910
Check that Q and A,
20

21
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.110
see if that question has already been answered.
21

22
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.590
If it has not I'm going to also leave a link
22

23
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.370
in the course resources here for the course wiki.
23

24
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.570
So I've got a bunch of information on the wiki,
24

25
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.690
and there's an entire section on FAQ,
25

26
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.770
so frequently asked questions.
26

27
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.960
So I see people asking the same questions a lot,
27

28
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.100
and I'll do a little write up,
28

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.000
put that into FAQ so you can refer to that.
29

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.780
So step one, check the Q and A,
30

31
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.620
step two, check the FAQ for the course.
31

32
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.560
And these are two ways that you
32

33
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.460
can get rolling again quickly.
33

34
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.430
Now on the next video, or in the next lecture
34

35
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.260
you will find an opportunity to sign up for a Slack channel.
35

36
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.598
Right now we've got about 8300 people in a Slack community
36

37
00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:34.840
dedicated to this course.
37

38
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.650
So this is an online community.
38

39
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.380
I watch it, my teacher's assistants watch it,
39

40
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.010
and other students watch it.
40

41
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.270
So if you run into a problem that's not addressed
41

42
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.720
by the Q and A or FAQ check out the Slack community
42

43
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.630
and ask your question there.
43

44
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.080
So a lot of times what's gonna happen inside of Slack,
44

45
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.400
believe it or not, every night I do go to sleep
45

46
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.390
and I wake up in the morning and I'll see somebody
46

47
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.660
has asked a question at like three a.m. my time
47

48
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.980
and I get up and somebody else has already responded
48

49
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.190
and gotten that person going again.
49

50
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.020
So this is a great way to help you progress
50

51
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.810
through the course and get back on track
51

52
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.900
if you hit a problem that you cannot resolve.
52

53
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.310
Now, when you do hit a problem
53

54
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.350
and you do need to ask a question,
54

55
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.550
a couple of things that you, some do's and don'ts.
55

56
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.610
What you do wanna do is be very helpful
56

57
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.320
as to the error situation that you've encountered.
57

58
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.770
I see, some people will say, hey, I've got this problem.
58

59
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.030
Did anybody else see it on this section?
59

60
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.550
That does not give us very much to go on.
60

61
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.020
So help us help you by being very clear
61

62
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.170
about the error condition that you're seeing.
62

63
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.733
So describe what lecture you are on.
63

64
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.500
Provide a stack trace.
64

65
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.100
So that stack trace is very, very important,
65

66
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.480
and if you're using IntelliJ
66

67
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.360
what you can do in the console you can do a right click
67

68
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.950
and say create gist, G-I-S-T,
68

69
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.010
and that is going to take that stack trace
69

70
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.830
and put it up into the web into GitHub,
70

71
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.460
and you can share a URL.
71

72
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.130
So you can create a gist and share a URL
72

73
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.380
so somebody can see that full stack trace.
73

74
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.900
A lot of times what I see people do
74

75
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.100
is they take a screenshot,
75

76
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.350
and they're gonna get this much of the stack trace,
76

77
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.420
while the root cause is actually somewhere up here
77

78
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.280
in that stack trace.
78

79
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.590
So when you share a screenshot like that,
79

80
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.020
a lot of times, it's not enough information
80

81
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.000
for us to determine what happened.
81

82
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.980
So having that full stack trace is very helpful
82

83
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.530
and beneficial for us to troubleshoot
83

84
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.020
what is happening for you.
84

85
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.970
Another thing that is very helpful
85

86
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.790
is to share a link to your repository.
86

87
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.060
So check in your code into GitHub,
87

88
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.290
commit it, and then share a link
88

89
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.830
so that we can take a look at your source code.
89

90
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.280
So it gives us a much better picture to help you out.
90

91
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.860
So these are very important things that you can do
91

92
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.840
to share a complete picture of what's going on.
92

93
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.180
And speaking of pictures,
93

94
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.770
another thing that you do not wanna do is,
94

95
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.080
I've seen several people do this,
95

96
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.510
is they'll take a picture of their laptop screen.
96

97
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.690
So this is even worse than a screenshot,
97

98
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.190
is to sit there and take a picture of your laptop.
98

99
00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.610
I've never been able to get any useful information
99

100
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.620
from a picture of somebody's laptop screen.
100

101
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.066
This is probably the worst way to ask for help.
101

102
00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.220
So, just remember,
102

103
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.258
be very clear on what you're asking about,
103

104
00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:21.550
share the stack trace, provide that stack trace
104

105
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.500
so that we can see what's going on there,
105

106
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.450
and also providing a link to your GitHub repository
106

107
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.070
where we can see your service code.
107

108
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.310
It's all things that can help us help you
108

109
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.600
and get you going much quicker.
109

110
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.090
Now as you grow as a Spring developer
110

111
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.900
you're gonna start working on your own projects.
111

112
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.320
Hopefully you'll start working for a company as well,
112

113
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.730
and then there's a lot of resources there on the web
113

114
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.950
that you can utilize.
114

115
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.540
One of them is Stack Overflow.
115

116
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.240
This is where you can post questions about Spring Framework,
116

117
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.640
and then Spring actually has a number of people,
117

118
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.730
number of committers, that monitor Stack Overflow
118

119
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.100
for questions and help people out.
119

120
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.130
So this is where you're asking the entire world for help,
120

121
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.220
and you can get answers to questions
121

122
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.450
that are not gonna be covered by this course.
122

123
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.800
Also, another great resource with Spring
123

124
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.960
is most of the Spring Framework projects
124

125
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.610
have what's called Gitter,
125

126
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.710
and you can look at the source code repository
126

127
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.970
or the homepage off of the Spring website,
127

128
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.930
and those usually have a link to a Gitter community.
128

129
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.330
And this is an online chat room
129

130
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.470
that's going to have committers behind that project
130

131
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.870
that are gonna be sitting there
131

132
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.260
available online inside a Gitter.
132

133
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.550
And also, people that are experienced inside the community.
133

134
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.900
So you start, let's say you get down the road
134

135
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.750
and start using Spring security.
135

136
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.310
You have a question about it,
136

137
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.910
Gitter can be a great resource.
137

138
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.430
Again, this is stuff for your own personal projects.
138

139
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.780
Within the course, just remember,
139

140
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.790
please utilize the Q and A, FAQ.
140

141
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.320
Slack community is a great resource.
141

142
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.070
And as you grow and start getting into
142

143
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.100
your own Spring projects,
143

144
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.530
be sure to use Stack Overflow.
144

145
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.860
It's a great resource, great community.
145

146
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.940
Or Gitter.
146

147
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.030
That is another great resource
147

148
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.853
for asking about Spring projects in general.
