00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.750
Okay. March of 2017, Docker came out with
two editions. It used to just be all Docker.
1

2
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.100
Now you have Docker Enterprise Edition
and Docker Community Edition. This is
2

3
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.220
starting to cost a little bit of confusion
in the marketplace, as to which is which.
3

4
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.240
So, I put together a little slide
deck here, to go through exactly what the
4

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
changes are and what that means to you
as a Java developer. Alright, we are here
5

6
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.829
to talk about Docker editions. Docker now
has two editions - the Enterprise Edition
6

7
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.190
and the Docker Community Edition. Now
this was just announced, at least I'm
7

8
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.550
recording it, it's announced on March 2nd
by Docker and that's roughly a month ago,
8

9
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.680
from when I was recording this course.
Now, Docker Enterprise Edition is
9

10
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.190
something that they're coining as a
Container as a Service platform
10

11
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.000
subscription. So, this is gonna be the
whole containerized stuff.
11

12
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.040
In docker Enterprise Edition, you're
gonna get enterprise class support. There
12

13
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.229
will be quarterly releases made of
Docker and you're going to get back
13

14
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.490
ported patches for up to one year after
that release is made. So if you're running
14

15
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.130
on release three, and it's six months
later, under this program, you will be
15

16
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
able to get patches going back for any
critical things that are affecting you.
16

17
00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.119
As part of Docker Enterprise,
you also get certified
17

18
00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.530
infrastructure, so you're running
certified containers and plugins, and so
18

19
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
all the stuff is certified. It's not
quite the wild west that Docker is or
19

20
00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.159
has been up until now.
Now, the Docker Community Edition is
20

21
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.969
gonna continue to be free. This is
free edition that can be used by
21

22
00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.530
developers and also in operations, as
well, where you don't need that critical
22

23
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.540
Enterprise support. Now in Docker
Community, there are gonna be monthly
23

24
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.470
they're calling them edge releases.
On edge releases, that's we're gonna
24

25
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.599
get all the latest features and
stuff that's just coming out in the
25

26
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.400
Docker community. This is where you gonna
get those cutting edge features. And then,
26

27
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.530
you also will get quarterly releases for
magic and using inside of operations.
27

28
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.510
I wanna point out that Docker Enterprise is a paid subscription from Docker, while
28

29
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.350
Docker Community is going to be free and
continue to be free. With this
29

30
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.080
announcement, there's a change in how
Docker is doing release number or their
30

31
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.030
version numbering. The last release
of just regular old Docker was 1.13.1
31

32
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.130
and the first release of Docker
Enterprise and Docker Community Edition
32

33
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.670
is 17.03. This is a change in how
Docker is doing their version numbering.
33

34
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.370
They're going to year, month, the
version, and Edition. So let me show you
34

35
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.739
what that looks like on my MacBook. So
I'm running the docker plug-in and we
35

36
00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.120
can see that 17 for 2017,
March 3rd 03 and it's the first
36

37
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.620
release and it's community edition for
for Mac. Just so you can help
37

38
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.430
visualize how Docker is planning on
doing their releases. This is a graphic
38

39
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.049
that Docker has published along with the
announcement. So you can see there, at the
39

40
00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.780
top, we have Docker CE and this is gonna be the monthly releases of Docker on
40

41
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.900
the edge edition, and then you also have
the stable edition, where for the not so
41

42
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.269
adventurous and they may need a quality
working software those stable releases
42

43
00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.150
will be done once a quarter. And then
again on the Docker Enterprise, down at
43

44
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.880
the bottom, there in green, that is also
going to be quarterly releases as well.
44

45
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.640
Now, the two operating system supported,
there's a little bit of a difference
45

46
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.750
there. You have Enterprise Edition, so
that's gonna be all your big
46

47
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.880
enterprise - Linux distributions, Windows
Server, they have like Oracle, Oracle
47

48
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.849
Linux, SUSE and of course Red Hat, and
then as well some other popular
48

49
00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.650
enterprise class Linux is such as CentOS,
Ubuntu
49

50
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.720
and Amazon has their own flavor Linux as
well. So Docker enterprise will run on
50

51
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
all the above. Then community edition
is going to continue supporting OS X,
51

52
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.680
Windows 10 and then popular flavors of
Linux as well. If you notice one
52

53
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.240
important difference there is paid Linux
distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise
53

54
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.490
Linux are not available under the
community edition. You may be wondering
54

55
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.900
why there's two docker editions.
Part of it is, Dockers have enjoyed
55

56
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.860
explosive growth over the last several
years. As a company, Docker has gone from
56

57
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.510
a couple guys probably working on a
garage, if not more, to more of a mature
57

58
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.750
company, and this is really a maturing of
Docker and the technology to allow
58

59
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.550
Docker to offer enterprise class support.
This is gonna give Docker a chance to
59

60
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.560
certify that the software, that they are
delivering to you, in the docker store,
60

61
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.700
the docker containers are certified to
be free of known critical defects and
61

62
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.630
anything that could cause you a security
concern. Stuff like this is gonna
62

63
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:40.180
be very important to companies, like
financial services or healthcare
63

64
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.160
companies, where they are under
regulatory compliance to certify that
64

65
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.410
their platform in the software that
they're running in their enterprise is
65

66
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.810
free of critical defects. This gives
those companies support, so if something
66

67
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.610
does go wrong, they have somebody call
upon - the Docker organization, as well
67

68
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.560
as having certified software, where all
known defects have been taken care of. If
68

69
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.419
you're running Docker itself, Docker
itself is still gonna enjoy this but
69

70
00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.599
it's the certified containers and
plugins that are gonna be missing
70

71
00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.260
from the stack. So you can go out to
Docker hub now and it's literally the
71

72
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.280
one of the best. You can throw anything up
there. As far as I know, to my
72

73
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.360
knowledge, there's no filtering of that.
So anything that you're pulling down
73

74
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.760
from Docker hub, it's really kind of a user journalist type thing, where Docker
74

75
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.440
Enterprise is going to certify things
for you. Now you may be wondering as a
75

76
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.110
developer, which one you want to use,
functionally, the two editions are the
76

77
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.990
same. There's no API changes. They are
gonna behave and function the same. It's
77

78
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.770
more of the certification and support that
you're gonna get with Docker
78

79
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.850
Enterprise, which you're not gonna
have in the community edition. A lot of
79

80
00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:00.400
people may or may not know this, so
CentOS and Red Hat are literally the
80

81
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.330
same, for all intensive purposes.
CentOS actually watches the Red Hat
81

82
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:13.840
repositories, strips out, copies down that
edition of Linux lesson a Red Hat
82

83
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.350
specific code and releases that. So the
two OS's are literally the same, but was
83

84
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.920
CentOS, you're on your own,
where Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you do
84

85
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.220
get Red Hat support and certification. So
that Docker Community and Docker
85

86
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.810
Enterprise are just like these two.
Generally, as a Java developer, as a
86

87
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.990
Spring developer, the community issues
should be just fine.
87

88
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:44.260
It still runs on Windows 10, it runs on
OS X, still runs on a lot of popular Linux
88

89
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.120
distributions. The only gachi
you might run into, is if you're running,
89

90
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.540
like Red Hat Enterprise, in the workplace
and then you'll probably need
90

91
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.010
Docker Enterprise Edition running on
that or revert to CentOS and you'll
91

92
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:05.590
be fine. So 95% of the time, I think
Docker developers are gonna be just
92

93
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.820
fine using the free Community edition and free which we've enjoyed all
93

94
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.680
this time. Okay, so now we have the two
editions of Docker - Docker Enterprise and
94

95
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.150
Docker Community Edition. As somebody
that develops applications for the
95

96
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.260
enterprise, I see this is a very good
sign because what we are seeing is
96

97
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.940
Docker as a company is maturing and
they're offering us better support,
97

98
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.510
certification. So companies are gonna
continue using Docker. I see this is a
98

99
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.500
great sign for Dockers growth especially
in another Enterprise. Dockers is not a
99

100
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.729
technology that's going away. So your
investment in using Docker is definitely
100

101
00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:44.050
a good investment. I see Dockers, as a
technology, it's gonna be around to
101

102
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:49.750
stay because you are seeing it mature in
the marketplace, as it is now. So we still
102

103
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.260
enjoy the free edition and
all the features and functionality a
103

104
00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:00.160
Docker, and now as a big company, and
I have my mission-critical apps. I have a
104

105
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.510
certified software that I can go to, turn
to, and get that support from Docker,
105

106
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.990
meet my regulatory compliance, so
companies are gonna continue using
106

107
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.120
Docker, and we as Java developers are
gonna have great toolset to continue
107

108
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.540
working with.
