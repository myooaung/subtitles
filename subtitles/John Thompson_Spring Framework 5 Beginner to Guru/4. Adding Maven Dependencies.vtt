00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.450
OK, you can see the issue that I had created for the last video as far as creating a Springboard project

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.500
is now closed.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.760
And I do want to point this out to you, that you can come in here to GitHub.

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.070
You can see that I've added in this initial ad from Spring Naturalizer Close's number one.

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.370
Then I can click on this and you can see a change log of everything that was added so that there's all

6
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.270
the stuff that's added.

7
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.850
Let me jump over to anthologized really quick.

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.940
I want to point out just a couple minor things.

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.490
One thing that's important about this is just how GitHub itself works by default.

10
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.200
So you can see here the spring project downloaded to resources and templates.

11
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.260
The problem is these are empty directories and empty directories by default do not get pushed up to

12
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.670
GitHub.

13
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.070
So those will be missing.

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.660
So when I look at resources, static templates that come back over to GitHub.

15
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.840
Me come up here and I did add this into Special Branch for it, so now that that doesn't create S.B

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.920
for spring boot at.

17
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.840
So if I come in here, look at the source, main resources can see that I just have application properties

18
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.610
toggling back over to intelligence, I can see here that have resources.

19
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.460
And there's these two folders are going to be missing.

20
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.700
And this list does trip up some people at times.

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.220
But don't worry when you need that, just go ahead and create those directory so you'll see this elsewhere

22
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.610
in the course.

23
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.260
And this is just one of those things as to how it works.

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.180
So I'd know there's a setting that you can override to force it to bring up empty directories that I

25
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.410
have not got into.

26
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.590
And then also the spring boot project does implement a ignore.

27
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.770
So you can see that it brings in this help.

28
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.600
And this is a a markdown file that gives you some links.

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.400
And I, I don't need this.

30
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.580
I'm just going to come in here and delete it from my project.

31
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.170
I saw it on the screen.

32
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.660
And that also is not going to be in GitHub because that is not going to be in GitHub, because that

33
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.490
has been marked as ignore.

34
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.080
So I'm just going to go ahead and delete those so we don't need that and close out this good.

35
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.470
No, I jump back over to Kronmiller, click.

36
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.950
And let's come in to the issues in this project, what we want to do is add and this Chuck Norris dependency,

37
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:39.440
so I've added in GitHub ticket and we need this dependency Goober's framework, Chuck Norris for Actuator.

38
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.490
And in this case, we want the two to four zero net as the most recent one at the time of recording

39
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.570
come back over.

40
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.940
And you I'm just copying over the dependency.

41
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.420
And let's come over to the Mavin Pub.

42
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.090
We can see here I scroll this up with the spring boot starter, timely spring boot starter web.

43
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.750
And what I want to do is go ahead and paste that and.

44
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.590
And depending on your settings, I'm just going to come over here and reload that you can't tell intelligence

45
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.650
to automatically re-import, just doing that for safety to make sure that it does get reimported and

46
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.200
hear what we can do it.

47
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.050
Let me expand this out a little bit so we do have the timely could see the springs in the spring boot

48
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.470
starter, timely, timely extras, then the spring boot starter web and you can see the sky and bring

49
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.760
in the Tomcat dependancy spring up spring MVC.

50
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:46.550
And then my Chuck Norris for later, and we can see here that this did have a dependency on spring boot

51
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.030
and that that has been admitted because that is coming in from others.

52
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.400
And then also by default, we do get the testing or we're not going to be dealing with a lot of testing

53
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.030
at this point.

54
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.360
Not on this application at least we will see that coming up in the course.

55
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.190
But we can see that we do have tests and and that has been given the test go.

56
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.700
So for the purposes of this lesson, what we want to do is focus on bringing in this dependency.

57
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.370
And this is the artifact that's up and moving central that I wrote that is going to give us the random

58
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.420
Chuck Norris jokes.

59
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.490
So I'm going to create a new branch, commit this in and close out that ticket cell reference to ticket

60
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.730
number so you can see exactly what was changed in this video.
