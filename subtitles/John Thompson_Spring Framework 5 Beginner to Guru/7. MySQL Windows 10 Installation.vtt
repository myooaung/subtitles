00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.170
Okay, I am on the downloads page for
MySQL for Windows. This link is going to
1

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.969
be in the course notes. What I want
to do is come over here is to the MySQL
2

3
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.250
installer. I'm going to click on that link,
and I want the MySQL server, and I want
3

4
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.529
the version of MySQL community server
5.7.21 is fine. As this
4

5
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
course progresses and gets older, it's a
early 2018 I'm recording this, I'm sure
5

6
00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
there's going to be additional releases. So,
consider 5.7 the minimal
6

7
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.200
release that we want to install. So, I'm
going to file here and go to the
7

8
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.550
download page
and scroll up. If you have a slow
8

9
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.989
internet connection, take this bottom
option, but I do have a fairly good
9

10
00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.519
internet connection here, so I'm going to
take this one. And now, it's going to ask you
10

11
00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.839
to create an Oracle account. You do not
need to do that. I'm just going to say no
11

12
00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.489
thanks. Go ahead and start my download.
12

13
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.750
We see that it is downloaded that
pretty quickly. I'm going to click that.
13

14
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.229
And now, you can see that it's asking me
if I want to allow access. We could see
14

15
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.820
that I have clicked on the MySQL
installer launcher. It is a verified
15

16
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.299
publisher, Oracle America. I'm going
to say yes. Got a little safety there. You
16

17
00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.770
do have some number of different options
here. I don't need a lot of stuff, so I'm
17

18
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.250
going to say and do a custom. Come down
here do custom and say next.
18

19
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.200
I want the MySQL server
19

20
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.230
and the x86 version is fine. And now, I want to
say applications and I want the MySQL
20

21
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.470
workbench. I got a strange
21

22
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.670
UI here. So, that's the two components
that I want to install. I don't need the
22

23
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.110
other stuff. Actually, I'm going to put
into the shell, as well, just in case we
23

24
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.560
need that.
24

25
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.310
Now, take a quick peek at the
utilities. I
25

26
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.790
don't think we need those. So, hopefully
not. I'm just going to go with the server,
26

27
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.410
workbench and shell. It should give us
everything that we need for working with
27

28
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.860
MySQL on Windows. Click Next and now I'm
going to click on execute. It's going to go
28

29
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.200
out and download these from Oracle. 
It's going to download them and install
29

30
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.489
them. I'm going to pause the video here for
a minute and then come back to it once
30

31
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.260
everything's downloaded and installed.
Okay, everything is downloaded and
31

32
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.700
installed normally. So, I wanted to pause
that. Didn't want to keep you waiting and
32

33
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.450
watching my computer download stuff and
install it. So now, I'm going to click on
33

34
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.519
next,
and now, it's saying that it's ready to
34

35
00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.430
configure that. So, say next. Now,
there's a couple different options. We
35

36
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.280
are not going to be getting into
database clusters, so no need to do that.
36

37
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.000
Standalone is perfectly fine for this
course. That is what we're going to be
37

38
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.040
focusing on, so that is what we want. 
Now, this is a different options here, so
38

39
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.959
we can come down here. Take a look at
this, and really, a development machine is
39

40
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.190
fine. These options will set up MySQL, a
little bit differently. So, if we did have
40

41
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.299
like a dedicated server, we do not. We are
all working on our own personal
41

42
00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.970
computers here. So, development machine is
fine.
42

43
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.510
TCP/IP, that is a network layer and we
will be connecting to MySQL over the
43

44
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.750
network using TCP/IP to port 3306. So,
this is fine and it's also asking us
44

45
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.319
open with the firewall. This is important
networking stuff. This is how we
45

46
00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.280
will be connecting to MySQL. So, this is
perfectly fine. We'll take the defaults
46

47
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.879
on that and click on next. And now, it's
asking for the root account. The root
47

48
00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.910
account is very important account. This
is like the master account, the
48

49
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.540
administrator account from MySQL. So, give
it a password that you can remember.It is giving me a
49

50
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.970
weak password, which is fine. I'm not too
terribly concerned about security on
50

51
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.989
this particular machine with MySQL. If
you had a commercial account or
51

52
00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.010
commercial great server, you definitely
want something stronger. But here, I'm
52

53
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.720
going to just going to cheat a little bit and
give something easy to remember. We
53

54
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990
are not going to get into user accounts
right now. We will do that later in the
54

55
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.220
course. The root account is going to be
fine for our initial purposes. Now, we
55

56
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.199
have a couple options. It's best to
run it as a Windows service, and what
56

57
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.000
this means, is that the MySQL database is
going to come up as a background process.
57

58
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.740
This is typically how I will run it on a
Windows machine as a service and then it
58

59
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.820
says started up a system startup. Now, you
might be worried about having a lot of
59

60
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.889
system resources on it. MySQL is actually
pretty light. It's pretty lean program,
60

61
00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.610
especially in the windows world. So, don't
worry about it having running in the
61

62
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.240
background. It's not going to consume
that that many resources, especially if
62

63
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180
you're not using it. That's just out
there in the background. It's going to
63

64
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.139
get pushed down by the operating system
and that you won't even notice that
64

65
00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.340
it's running, generally speaking.
65

66
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.789
Now here, as far as the document store, we
are not going to enable that feature. So,
66

67
00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.979
don't check off on that. No need for that.
And now, it says to apply this
67

68
00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.190
configuration. You can see a list of
things that it's going to do. I'm going
68

69
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.530
to click on execute and allow it to go do
it.
69

70
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.870
You can see that it does run through
this list pretty quickly. So, it's going
70

71
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.840
through the initialization of the
database right now. That's going to
71

72
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.909
take a few seconds starting the database
server, apply to everything, and now, we're
72

73
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:47.470
going to click on finish, and we can see
that there is a configuration. And now,
73

74
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.349
we just say next. I am not going to
start the shell and workbench. We will do
74

75
00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.560
those in a future video.
Now, I'm just going to click on
75

76
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.590
finish. At this point, MySQL is
installed on my Windows machine and
76

77
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.729
ready to use.
