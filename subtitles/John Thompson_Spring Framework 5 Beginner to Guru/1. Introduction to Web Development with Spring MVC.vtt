00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.250
Now in this section of the course, we are
going to focus on Web Development. The
1

2
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.940
Web Development environment with Spring
MVC. First we're going to go in and
2

3
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
create a brand new application. We'll use
Spring Initializr for that again. It's
3

4
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.699
going to be a simple Recipe project. Somewhere we can store recipes for meals.
4

5
00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.910
Now it's going to give us a little more
interesting and more realistic data
5

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.079
model to work with and we'll be able to
use that going forward and we're going
6

7
00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.160
to learn more about web development
using Spring MVC and how we process the
7

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
data using Spring data. But before we do
that we're going to take a closer look
8

9
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.180
at the HTTP Protocol. I get a lot of
different skill levels in this course.
9

10
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.250
Not everybody has a really good grasp on
the inner workings of HTTP and this is
10

11
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.199
very important. If you have a solid
understanding of the HTTP Protocol,
11

12
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.430
go and skip this session. It might be too
basic for you. But if you don't, if you
12

13
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.460
don't know what HTTP is and how the
inner workings, this is an important
13

14
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.390
section to take. We're going to cover
some of the inner workings of HTTP and
14

15
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
how it relates to web application
development. We're also going to take a
15

16
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.869
look at developer options in the major
browser. So we're going to examine how
16

17
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.159
web pages get rendered and what the
developer tools have for us. We're going
17

18
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.470
to take a look at Developer Tools in
Chrome, Firebug and Fox and Safari Web
18

19
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.530
Inspector. Next I'm going to show you how
to use an Axis TCPMon tool. This is a
19

20
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.860
tool that allows you to set up a proxy
and see exactly what's reaching your
20

21
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
server and this is a very handy to
building tool. I use it all the time
21

22
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.000
because you can look at your web tools
in the browser. That tells you what you
22

23
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.110
think the browser is sending. This
tool allows you to see exactly what's
23

24
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.619
getting sent to the browser. Now Spring
Boot has an optional module called
24

25
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.149
Spring Boot Developer Tools. When used
correctly, these tools can greatly
25

26
00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.829
improve your productivity as a developer. We're also going to take a look at
26

27
00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.729
Spring Boot support for WebJars. This is a handy feature you can use to
27

28
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.099
include web assets into your project. Relly cool feature. I'm going to
28

29
00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.690
show you how to add bootstrap and jQuery into
29

30
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.670
our project. I personally love bootstrap. It's crazy easy to make a
30

31
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.210
great-looking web application using
Bootstrap. That's probably why Bootstrap
31

32
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.500
is the most popular CSS framework out
there. Then at the end of this, I'm
32

33
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.980
going to give you a challenging
assignment to Display a List of Recipes.
33

34
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.690
I'll lay out the assignment and this is
going to allow you to take the skills
34

35
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.020
you've learned in this course so far and
re-apply them to a completely different
35

36
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.280
context. But don't worry if you're not
ready to do that yet. In the next video,
36

37
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.430
I'm going to step through that
assignment step by step and you'll also
37

38
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.700
have complete copy of the code in
GitHub that you can use for your
38

39
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.090
reference.
