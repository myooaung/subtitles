00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:06.575
- Alright, this concludes the portion
2

3
00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:08.415
of the course on Docker.
3

4
00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.795
Now this, these previous three sections
4

5
00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.564
were from my Docker for Java Developers course.
5

6
00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:17.162
If you jump down to the last section of the course,
6

7
00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:18.870
there is a bonus section where I'm allowed
7

8
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.989
to include promotional coupons,
8

9
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.091
so if you are interested in the full course,
9

10
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:24.465
go check that out.
10

11
00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:26.833
And there's a nice little coupon there for you
11

12
00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.977
where you can get the entire Docker course.
12

13
00:00:28.977 --> 00:00:30.120
Now inside that course,
13

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.976
we do go into Docker a lot more in depth.
14

15
00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.929
These three sections,
15

16
00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.361
we're just focused on getting your feet wet with Docker
16

17
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.201
and running it and you can see how you can
17

18
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.840
run Spring Boot and a number different technologies
18

19
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.860
inside of Docker.
19

20
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.431
The rest of the course is going to look
20

21
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.319
at running more complex applications,
21

22
00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:48.891
running Microservices inside of Docker,
22

23
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.725
how you deploy it.
23

24
00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:54.892
A really, really cool technology is Docker Swarm Mode,
24

25
00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.203
where you can scale up services
25

26
00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.711
like provision a whole cluster of services
26

27
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:03.543
and deploy Docker services across that cluster.
27

28
00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.783
So there's a lot of capabilities inside of Docker,
28

29
00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:09.086
like even doing private networks.
29

30
00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:10.868
You can do a lot of cool stuff in that.
30

31
00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:12.848
But that's what's covered in the rest of the course.
31

32
00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.534
This course is focused on Spring Framework.
32

33
00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:17.649
I introduced this content to this course
33

34
00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.069
because it's going to be useful as we go forward.
34

35
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.368
So it lays down the foundation
35

36
00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:23.982
of you have an interest in learning more about Docker,
36

37
00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:25.938
definitely check out that other course
37

38
00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:27.978
because there's a ton of great content in that.
38

39
00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:31.031
And coming up next, we are going to take a look
39

40
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:35.198
at using MySQL and connecting our little Spring application.
40

41
00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.945
We've been using a H2 in memory database,
41

42
00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:41.156
but coming up next, we're going to start looking
42

43
00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.892
at using MySQL as a database in the nuances
43

44
00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.832
with handling that technology
44

45
00:01:45.832 --> 00:01:47.582
and Spring Framework.
