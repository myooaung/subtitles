00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.880
In this video, I'm gonna step you
through setting up the embedded ActiveMQServer.
1

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.019
So, I'm gonna come over here to
our Spring Boot application. And, what we
2

3
00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.539
can do is we can do it right inside our
main method before we start up Spring. So,
3

4
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.869
I'm gonna start it right there. So, I'm
gonna come in and say ActiveMQ,
4

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.020
ActiveMQServer.
We'll just call that server like so.
5

6
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:44.880
It's gonna be ActiveMQServers like so. I'm gonna say newActiveMQServer, new ConfigurationImpl.
6

7
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.600
And, what we wanna do is come in here
7

8
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.149
and say .setPersistenceEnabled and we're gonna say
8

9
00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.500
false.
9

10
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.200
.setJournalDirectory
and we are going to use our local build
10

11
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.520
our build director. So, that's gonna be
11

12
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.140
target/data/journal like so.
12

13
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.560
We're gonna disable security.
13

14
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.000
So, disabled security and then finally, we needed to
give it a way to connect.
14

15
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.520
So this gonna enabled communication within the vm
15

16
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.880
and got a little typo it's Configuration. It
should be add.
16

17
00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.570
And, this configuration here, this is
directly out of the ActiveMQ
17

18
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.939
documentation about how to set up a
embedded server. So, this is right out
18

19
00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.590
there direct recommendations are the base
documentation for this. You can see here
19

20
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.119
that it's unhappy about the exception. So,
I'm just gonna go ahead and add that
20

21
00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.560
to the signature. And then, there's one
last final thing that we need to do here
21

22
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.530
and that's gonna be server.start()
like so. And, that is going to bring up
22

23
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.660
the server. So, what we've done here is we
set up a very minimal ActiveMQServer. This
23

24
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.019
is gonna start up with the Spring
Boot application and it's gonna run
24

25
00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.910
for us. I'm not going to go into this too
in-depth because right now, this really
25

26
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.349
just to give us a opportunity to do a
hello world without bringing up an
26

27
00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.489
actual ActiveMQServer. Most of the time,
you are gonna be running the separate
27

28
00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.319
and outside of Spring Boot. Here, we are
doing it here so we can learn within a
28

29
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.849
single Spring Boot application. So, now
what I can do is I can come up here and
29

30
00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.190
let's go ahead and we'll go ahead and
run this. We'll bring this up, make sure
30

31
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.840
that everything starts up properly.
31

32
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.400
And we got a fail to start.
32

33
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.720
I have a BindException so
address already in use. So, I got an
33

34
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.030
another one too. So, let me pause this
video real quick and find out what I
34

35
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.070
have running somewhere else. So, I found
the other application. Turned out to be
35

36
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.460
the beer services are still up and
running. So, I'm gonna go ahead and
36

37
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.370
restart this so it will restart this. You can
see there's a little chatter in there.
37

38
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.380
But we can see that the Apache MQ did
come up properly.
38

39
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.200
And this is an error here. So, I'm not
going to worry about this too much. That
39

40
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.209
we already have vm adapter already
registered. I am gonna say that is
40

41
00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.660
okay because I've tested this
configuration and this does give us the
41

42
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.610
ability in message. Again, this is not a
normal configuration. I'm not too worried
42

43
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.489
about having this absolutely perfect
because you normally don't run an
43

44
00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.110
embedded server like this. Here, we are
just setting things up to do effectively
44

45
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.650
a hello world so we wanna be able to
send out a JMS message and we wanna be
45

46
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.640
able to receive that before we start
worrying about actually setting up a
46

47
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.700
proper JMS messaging broker. So, we'll be
doing that later in this section. But for
47

48
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.680
now, the key takeaway is that we've added
in this ActiveMQServer. We're giving it
48

49
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.220
a minimum configuration so we're not
persisting anything. We're giving it a
49

50
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.450
general directory, setting security
enable to false so if anybody can
50

51
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.610
connect to our little JVM. And, we are
setting up by acceptor configuration
51

52
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.060
which seems to be tossing a little error
there. So, I'm not sure if it's not happy
52

53
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.810
about that but it's saying that acceptor
with our ID of zero is already
53

54
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.010
registered. So possibly, a duplicate
configuration. But again, this section
54

55
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.960
here, this is directly out of the
documentation for ActiveMQServer to set
55

56
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.760
up a embedded broker. So, it's perfect for
our needs but we'll be using this coming
56

57
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.950
up to start sending JMS messages.
