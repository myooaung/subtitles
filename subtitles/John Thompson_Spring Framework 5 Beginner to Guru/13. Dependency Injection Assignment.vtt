00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.309
Now one of the things I would like to do
to you is challenge you in some
1

2
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
assignments here and a lot of assignments 
are pretty straightforward and boring
2

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.220
and in this case I'm leaving you code
inside github that's knowingly broken so
3

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.859
I went in and broke the configuration so
when you start this up I know that it's
4

5
00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.910
not going to work on you and you are
going to see errors. So the assignment is
5

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.399
for you to go in and fix it so you need
to add in some configuration possibly
6

7
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
some other things to get this working so
this is going to require you to
7

8
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.110
understand how the Spring dependency
injection is working and how the
8

9
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.480
annotations are working and you'll see
some errors, work through those and
9

10
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
you'll be able to fix it and if you
can't if you get stuck don't worry in
10

11
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.239
the next module I'm going to show you
exactly how to fix things I'll take you
11

12
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.039
step-by-step I'll show you the errors
and we'll go through show the errors
12

13
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.149
show my solution to fix the errors and
we'll step through and get this
13

14
00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.830
completely working again with the new
components being managed by the Spring
14

15
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.460
context.
