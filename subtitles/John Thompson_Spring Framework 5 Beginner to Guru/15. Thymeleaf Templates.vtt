00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.600
OK.
1

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.870
Now as a Java developer you have several templating technologies to choose from.
2

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.460
Now if you're not familiar with templates that's the technology we use to generate dynamic hastening
3

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.190
e-mail when we're points up in our database and we put it on a web page.
4

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.280
In this lecture I'm going to introduce you to timely.
5

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.270
Now I want to point out that it is pronounced time leaf not famed leaf.
6

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.740
My first started using timely I was mistakenly calling it time leaf.
7

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.560
And you can go on to YouTube on my channel and I do have an early video where I was calling it timely
8

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.860
from the video and somebody called me out on it.
9

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.860
So it happens now time leaf is a Java template engine.
10

11
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.260
It's an alternative to Java server pages and there's actually a number of alternatives to GSP.
11

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.360
We can choose from.
12

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.930
And I'm guessing it's because Jay disputes are just so awful to work with I haven't used Jaspers forever.
13

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.180
So I hate them.
14

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.910
The first stable release of time leaf came out in 2011.
15

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.210
The current releases on Version 3 which includes some very cool features for reactive springs and spring
16

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.940
five.
17

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.770
Now time leaf is known as a natural template engine meaning you can view the templates naturally in
18

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.820
your browser.
19

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.590
This module we're going to take a quick look at running a simple HCM and page to show a list of books
20

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.710
we're only doing a quick introduction to time leaf in this video.
21

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.830
There's a lot more to it.
22

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.620
I actually have a whole course on timely and we're going to see a lot more of time live in this course.
23

24
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.670
But like some of the new reactive programming stuff in spring five I'm kind of excited to get to that
24

25
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.810
personally.
25

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.800
But for now that's a whole different subject.
26

27
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.320
I mean jump over to Intelligence.
27

28
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.560
And we're going to take a look at our first time live template can this video we are going to get timely
28

29
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.390
cooking.
29

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.030
And the first thing that we need to do is bring in the Spring Boot starter for time.
30

31
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.110
Now this is very important.
31

32
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.290
If you do not do this step this will not work.
32

33
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.240
So things will definitely not work if you do not bring in the starter.
33

34
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.970
So you can see here on the screen online 33 I've added in the Maven dependency for the Spring Boot starter
34

35
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.370
for timely and let's come over to the Maven window and take a quick look at that line expand this out
35

36
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370
a little bit so you can see here.
36

37
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.660
That's the Spring Boot starter for timely and it's emitting the Spring Boot starter but it's also bringing
37

38
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.670
in the time leaf jar for spring and then time leaf extra so which include some Java a time.
38

39
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.750
So again this is the curated dependency for timely from the Spring Boot folks to bring in the timely
39

40
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.120
dependency so it takes all the thought out of what we need to do.
40

41
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.960
Well let's go ahead and resize this collapse at so let's come over here to templates so by default Spring
41

42
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.430
Boot is going to look under templates for time leaf templates.
42

43
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.310
I've set up a directory called Books and list HDMI all and this list HMO.
43

44
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.280
This is the view that I want to render for a books list right now.
44

45
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.510
This is just a simple HCM old document nothing timely about it.
45

46
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.950
I'm going to add that in this video I'm just saving us a little time.
46

47
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.730
I don't think he guys wanna I sit here and watch me type out this entire e-mail document but you can
47

48
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.210
see just standard dating e-mail nothing particularly earth shattering here.
48

49
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.560
Let's toggle over to Chrome real quick and here is that list.
49

50
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.030
This is not a simple document in the book studies GMO and you can see it's just simple book list.
50

51
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.470
It's got a couple of Asian animal elements and then I am showing one thing and the list so very simple
51

52
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.650
Asian e-mail document.
52

53
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.610
We're not doing any styling or anything like that at this point.
53

54
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.700
So let's jump back over to ontology and I am going to start making this into a timely document.
54

55
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.090
I remember eating them out is a subset of X AML.
55

56
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.460
And what I want to do is come up here and I'm gonna pay something in off my clipboard and this is the
56

57
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.470
time leaf namespace.
57

58
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.040
So what I'm doing is I'm adding in the tag T H that's going to reference the time leaf namespace so
58

59
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.410
that's gonna give me timely extensions to this Excel document and that's how time life is gonna work
59

60
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.410
it's gonna work through attributes out of that X simple namespace which tells time leaf to do stuff.
60

61
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.870
So there's a number of things that time leaf does.
61

62
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.790
We will be getting into a lot of the future is a time leaf coming up in the course we are just going
62

63
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.110
to look at setting up a very simple thing here and what we want to do is under our table row here for
63

64
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:40.590
the the content we are gonna do a timely iterator and what we want to do is timely each.
64

65
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.430
So that sets up in each iterator and we're gonna say for book
65

66
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.520
1 and here I want to get the books attribute from model so I mean to say books.
66

67
00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.170
So this is how we are asking the model to give us the property of books and this is syntax or time leave
67

68
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.860
to say I want an iterator over books.
68

69
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.170
Now the next thing we want to do is come down here to these elements and what's going to happen is for
69

70
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.590
each book time life is going to render this element.
70

71
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.030
And so it's going to iterate through and render that element for each book that it finds and the list
71

72
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330
of books that we added to the model.
72

73
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.460
So now what we want to do is tell time leave to replace these elements.
73

74
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.280
So I mean it's a timely text.
74

75
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.180
And here I want to tell it the property that I want to do Dollar Signs squiggly I don't know what those
75

76
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.600
brackets are called officially I'm gonna say book I.D. and just copy this as speed things up a little
76

77
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.160
bit.
77

78
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:59.690
I'm back here pacer and I want the book Total and finally we want to show the publisher name and here
78

79
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.330
remember publisher is a.
79

80
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:10.090
An object that is on the book object so we want to say and we are going to navigate that object graph
80

81
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.340
through the dot notation and we'll see a name like so.
81

82
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:22.000
Now there's one other change that we need to make here to the code and right now until Jay is flagging
82

83
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.510
this because it doesn't understand what that property is we haven't told it about it.
83

84
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.580
There's some things that we can tell until Jay what.
84

85
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.720
We'll get to that in a future video.
85

86
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.000
So don't worry about until Jay flagging this it just doesn't know what that book property is.
86

87
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.570
Now we do need to make one change to the book controller because right now we are returning back to
87

88
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.270
books and actually we want top books list.
88

89
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.570
So that is going to tell it to look for the list template inside the directory.
89

90
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.210
Books now let's go ahead I think that does everything.
90

91
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.150
So let's go ahead and start this up
91

92
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:08.760
so we can see that we are up and running on port 80 80 toggle over to Chrome and here's local host books.
92

93
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.270
Let's resolve that and we can see here.
93

94
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.380
We are getting our book list now I.D. properties.
94

95
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.160
So remember these are the two objects that we had in the database domain driven designed and J to e
95

96
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.760
development without J.B. from the publisher S.F. G publishing.
96

97
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.400
So that is the values that we are having outside or from the database.
97

98
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.700
So I mean come in here and take a look at the view view page source and we can see here these are the
98

99
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:42.600
elements that timely generated dynamically so we had two objects in that list that we are returning
99

100
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:49.350
back to the view layer timely from whenever that was iterated and created these elements of a comeback
100

101
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:59.760
or two ontology and take a look at that list you can see that this element was created for every item
101

102
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.260
in the books list.
102

103
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.520
Now there is one thing that I do want to point out.
103

104
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.760
We made a small mistake here.
104

105
00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:13.800
We are getting into a circular reference and right now if we run our two string method we will get unhappiness
105

106
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:19.650
through a circular reference so we want to remove this book's property from our two string method because
106

107
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.210
if that runs right now that will get into an infinite loop.
107

108
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.810
And we also want to remove authors from that property.
108

109
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:36.190
So that is something I found a mistake that we made in our testing and I think publisher publishers.
109

110
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.920
OK so we're not iterating over the books properties some.
110

111
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.390
Sometimes when you get into circular reference on our two string method you got to be careful.
111

112
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.080
That can be problematic and it's very very easy mistake to make.
112

113
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:56.860
So just to recap what we've covered in this lesson first thing was to add in the time leaf starter very
113

114
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.650
important if you are following along and you forget this I guarantee it will not work because your project
114

115
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.760
knows nothing about timely and underneath the covers.
115

116
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.770
Spring Boot is doing configuration to support the time leaf template engine because once you add that
116

117
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:18.640
dependency on the class path Spring Boot will perform the auto configuration magic to make it work for
117

118
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.680
you and apply sensible default.
118

119
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.080
So if you miss that absolutely will not work.
119

120
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:30.520
Next thing was we added in this list ECMO.
120

121
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:37.660
So we added in this a document and we converted it to be a timely template so remember Time Life is
121

122
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:44.010
a natural templating engine works from an HMO document via the timely namespace.
122

123
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.350
So the T H cone those are timely directives to tell timely how to render this document.
123

124
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:57.790
And then finally because we put this under templates books list aging email we made a small change to
124

125
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.920
our controller and we are telling it to return back books list.
125

126
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:09.520
So that's going to tell the viewers over to look for a template under the directory books called list
126

127
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.440
and then you don't have say list a steam I'll just list is perfectly fine actually I think it might
127

128
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.910
break it if you do list out 80 miles so you definitely won't be doing that.
128

129
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:26.560
And that is how the viewer solver finds the time leaf template to render the Asian email to our client.
129

130
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.210
All right so that is a quick introduction to timely so you can see how nice it is to work with when
130

131
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:36.140
you have a natural Temple doing so and you can do your development on Easter email and toggle over and
131

132
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.570
see your changes right away inside the browser.
132

133
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.910
You saw what a clean language it is too.
133

134
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.850
We only went in about this deep onto timely footnotes capabilities but as a quick example I was able
134

135
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:53.500
to take an object out of the database using spring data JPA run it through Spring MVC to the timely
135

136
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.780
for you layer where we had a list of Po Joes and we rendered that list on a web page so you can see
136

137
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:06.410
it once once we got this down it's a pretty seamless process to develop web applications using the spring
137

138
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.800
framework.
