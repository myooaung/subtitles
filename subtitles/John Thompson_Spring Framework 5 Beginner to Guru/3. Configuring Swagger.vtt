00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.269
Alright! In this video, we are gonna
take a look at setting up Swagger or the
1

2
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.320
Swagger documentation for our project
here, and we are gonna be utilizing a
2

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.660
library from Spring Fox, and that is
going to basically give us a tool so
3

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.080
that's gonna inspect our Spring
Project, and then, generate the Swagger
4

5
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.650
documentation for us. So, the first thing
that we wanna do is come in here and
5

6
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.900
add in the new dependencies for it.
6

7
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.220
We want the springfox-swagger2.
It's the first dependency that we want.
7

8
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.660
You can see that there's several
versions there. We are gonna take the
8

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.760
2.7.1. And while I'm here, I'm gonna go
in also and add in, there's a separate
9

10
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.320
dependency for springfox-swagger2. I
actually want the swagger-ui
10

11
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.990
and you can see, we now have the two
dependencies here. And one thing that we
11

12
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.140
want to hear is I've checked, and
surprisingly, the version is not curated
12

13
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.030
by Spring Boot guys. I think there's a
competing documentation library out
13

14
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.280
there. But for some reason, that's not
there, and what I don't like about this
14

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.840
current setup is that we have the
version number defined in two spots. So
15

16
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.070
what we can do is come in here to
IntelliJ, and we'll go into Refactor and
16

17
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.399
say Extract. We're gonna extract that
property.
17

18
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.070
Try that one more time. What we wanna
do is come in here, and you got a
18

19
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.750
highlight. Get right on the number
there and go right click. Go to Refactor.
19

20
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.570
Then, we're gonna say, Extract and we
wanna extract that to a property. You
20

21
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.000
can see that it's giving us a suggestive
name there, so I'm gonna say OK, and now,
21

22
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
it's asking me if I wanna replace that
other occurrence. I would say replace,
22

23
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.300
and we can see that, now we have a Maven
property defined, and it actually is swagger-ui
23

24
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.960
and I'm gonna just change that a
little bit. Just swagger-version. We'll
24

25
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.210
come up here and rename that 
property. And now, we're happy. So, just
25

26
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.440
trying not to repeat ourselves there,
Just a good habit of that. So, now that we
26

27
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.070
have the Maven Dependency set up, what we
can do is come in and add in
27

28
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.300
configuration. Now, I don't have a
configuration class in here yet, so I can
28

29
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.600
come in and say New Package.
29

30
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.340
Now, I'm gonna come over and create
the configuration class. Do New Java Class.
30

31
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.599
Just call that SwaggerConfig. Now, we
do want this to be a Configuration class.
31

32
00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.459
So market it as that. Now, to enable Swagger,
what we need to do is come up here to
32

33
00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.129
EnableSwagger2 and that's gonna
bring up Swagger support in our project.
33

34
00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.849
So, let's start this up and take a look
at the documentation that we do get by
34

35
00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.900
default.
35

36
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.430
Now, we can see that there's a little bit
of chatter in their Swagger resources
36

37
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.440
has been configured, and this URL path,
the v2/api-docs that is a Swagger
37

38
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.410
documentation. So let's take a look
at that. So, I already have it up here.
38

39
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.800
We'll do a refresh. And now, we can see, we
get a lot of rich JSON information about
39

40
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.709
our API, that has been exposed inside of
Spring. Now, we can get a whole little
40

41
00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.720
more configuration there, and what we can
do, I'll just show you how to set up some
41

42
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.200
of the configuration.
42

43
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.200
Declare @Bean.
43

44
00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.890
We're gonna return back at Docket and
this is the Swagger configuration. We'll
44

45
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.900
just call it api.
45

46
00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.950
And say return new Docket.
And the DocumentationType, I'll show
46

47
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.970
you this real quick, if we we can jump
into that, and see how that there's
47

48
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.770
several different documentation types. We
do have support for older versions of
48

49
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.810
Swagger, and then, a Spring web version.
But, right now, we're gonna focus on using
49

50
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.769
Swagger 2. That is the most current and
most modern. We're not gonna look at the
50

51
00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.080
legacy stuff, and this just affects out
how the JSON output is formulated. So,
51

52
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:35.600
that affects this output. So, we'll
come back over here and leave that.
52

53
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.910
I'm saying any API's, any request
handler, so we're gonna allow that. Now
53

54
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.600
you could specify some here, some
additional information here.
54

55
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.490
And I'm just setting this up as an
example. We're gonna get the exact same
55

56
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.130
results. But if we had specific API's
that we wanted to expose, we could do so
56

57
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.250
here. If we wanna limit them, in some
ways, so there's a lot of rich
57

58
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.270
functionality. So, if we have like a
thousand APIs, we don't wanna expose
58

59
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.620
a hundred of them for uncertain set of
criteria. We can totally do it right here.
59

60
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.810
But I wanna show you this. I'll include
a link to the Swagger documentation.
60

61
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.840
There's a lot of really rich support
here. I'm not going to dive at that deep
61

62
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.680
into. But this is kind of the standard
Swagger configuration. I want to show you
62

63
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.480
how to set that up, and that is to return
back the Docket object into the Spring
63

64
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.970
Context, and that's gonna configure
Swagger. So, we'll go ahead and do a
64

65
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.990
refresh on this.
65

66
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.879
So that we restarted. Let's go ahead and
take a look and make sure that we are up,
66

67
00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.090
so we're still getting the same
information, which is exactly what we
67

68
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.830
want. I just wanted to show you that
Swagger configuration object. If you do
68

69
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.569
need additional control over the 
Swagger configuration, this is where you
69

70
00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.270
do so right in here using this Docket
API.
