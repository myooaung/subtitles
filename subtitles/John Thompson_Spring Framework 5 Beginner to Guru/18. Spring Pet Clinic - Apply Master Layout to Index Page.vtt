00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.490
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and apply that layout to the index page.
1

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
So I'm going to work on issue number 19.
We want to apply that master layout
2

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.640
to the index page so let's take a look
at what's going on here. So this is what
3

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
the Spring guys are using. They're using
a welcome.html file which is
4

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.970
perfectly fine. Mine is called index. 
Not a lot going on here to apply all
5

6
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
that. The biggest difference are they're
using this Thymeleaf replace tag to
6

7
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.270
bring in that layout template. I'm
going to copy that over. Let's come over
7

8
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.379
to our project. Let's open up our
index.html. That is going to go
8

9
00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.880
right here like so.
Then, they had this image here. You
9

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.700
know, we should change ours to h2 so
let's go ahead and implement that, like
10

11
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.640
so. And we want this to say, so now this
here's a pound welcome so that's going
11

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.540
to be a reference to a message
properties file. I'm going to copy that
12

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.229
over. I will make our index page
exactly like theirs, so now we have the
13

14
00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.869
pound welcome. We can see that it cannot
resolve that property. Let's see
14

15
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.810
where we said. We make that h2 as well.
See IntelliJ also updated the ending tag
15

16
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.600
for us, so I'll just change this over to
welcome. Just as to recap, what I'm doing
16

17
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.040
here is I'm putting a reference into the
layout. And remember we copied that
17

18
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.039
over in a previous video so that's layout.html.
Basically, what we are saying is
18

19
00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.820
telling Thymeleaf to do merge
these together. It's going to take
19

20
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.660
this in and then it's going to munge it
into this index file. We'll pick up
20

21
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.740
all the goodness in the layout template.
I'll show you that here in a second.
21

22
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.959
The biggest thing here is this th
replace command where we're telling it
22

23
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.160
to use that template file. Now let's come
over here and we will actually run the
23

24
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.030
application.
24

25
00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.530
Let's toggle over to Chrome. We just
back up over this and hit enter.
25

26
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.920
Now, we can see now we got everything
laid out here. These links probably are
26

27
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.650
going to work. If we go to
veterinarians, we can see that that's
27

28
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.700
bringing up an error page. We'll fix that.
But everything's here. We got that image
28

29
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.980
in there. We have this question mark
here. That is a message
29

30
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.930
placeholder. And what it's saying, this is
internationalization stuff that is
30

31
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.130
missing so we forgot to bring over some
message properties. This here is
31

32
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.820
saying find the welcome message and that
is missing because it can't find it.
32

33
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.290
That's why we're getting question marks.
We're saying hey welcome for English
33

34
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.750
US is missing. But right now, we are
getting the home page. We're entering
34

35
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.090
which was the objective of this. I'm
going to go ahead and commit that.
35

36
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.650
We'll go ahead and commit this in to Git.
36

37
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.060
You added the layout to index page
and that is going to close number
37

38
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.510
19.
38

39
00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.360
Go ahead and commit and push
that. This will get up to GitHub. Now
39

40
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.430
I do want to fix this problem here. This
is going to be a very simple one. I will
40

41
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.250
do that in a different video though. But
what I will do here is, you can see that I switched
41

42
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.670
to closed.
42

43
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.239
I'm gonna say add missing i18n. It's
an abbreviation for
43

44
00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.489
internationalization. And I am going to
go ahead and add in a bug,
44

45
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.440
so we're going to label that as a bug. 
Submit that issue.
45

46
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.390
If we come back to our issues, we can
see this is filed as a bug and we will
46

47
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.550
go ahead and resolve that in the
next video.
