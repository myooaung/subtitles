00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:06.194
Alright, in this video,
1

2
00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:07.686
I wanna look at some of the stuff that's going
2

3
00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:09.655
on behind the scenes for us
3

4
00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:11.708
in the Spring Boot configuration.
4

5
00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:15.916
So up on the screen, I have the ThymeleafAutoConfiguration
5

6
00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:17.513
shown on the screen.
6

7
00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:20.565
And this is what Spring Boot is using to configure it.
7

8
00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.101
We can see there's a @ConditionalOnWebApplications,
8

9
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:25.508
so we have type REACTIVE
9

10
00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:27.992
and then we also have type SERVLET.
10

11
00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:31.836
And we can see that we're having properties not found here
11

12
00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:33.711
and I've got a couple debug points in here
12

13
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:36.897
so I wanna prove to you that this is in fact running
13

14
00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:41.541
with the Thymeleaf SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine.
14

15
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.429
So this is specific for Reactive Spring,
15

16
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.629
it's in the new, latest Thymeleaf stuff.
16

17
00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.472
And what I'm gonna do is go ahead
17

18
00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:50.369
and start up the application
18

19
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.385
and we'll hit the breakpoint there.
19

20
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.641
So we can see that as we're going through,
20

21
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:58.808
we are in fact wiring up the SpringWebFluxTemplateEngine.
21

22
00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.262
Now I'm gonna stop this and let's jump over
22

23
00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.929
to our build.gradle.
23

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:10.033
And I'm going to comment out that and bring this back.
24

25
00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.152
And we can see IntelliJ down there at the bottom
25

26
00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:16.957
of the screen that's going through and re-scanning
26

27
00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:18.540
the project.
27

28
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.696
And now, if I come in and run this in the debugger again,
28

29
00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:26.057
we'll see that we get to a different breakpoint.
29

30
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:28.398
At least we should.
30

31
00:01:28.398 --> 00:01:29.555
There we are.
31

32
00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:33.662
So now we are back in the servlet branch.
32

33
00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:36.866
So it's @ConditionalOnWebApplications, so this is how
33

34
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.725
Spring Boot, under the covers, is detecting it.
34

35
00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.700
So by the container that we're wiring up,
35

36
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.704
Spring Boot is gonna detect if it's a reactive container
36

37
00:01:46.704 --> 00:01:49.954
or traditional Servlet container, as it did here.
37

38
00:01:49.954 --> 00:01:53.204
So I'm gonna stop this and return this.
38

39
00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.717
Come back over to build.gradle and I'm just gonna revert
39

40
00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:57.717
this change.
40

41
00:01:59.155 --> 00:02:01.987
And we'll see that IntelliJ will go through
41

42
00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.487
and pick up the changes again.
42

43
00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:08.830
And we'll go ahead and build this.
43

44
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.913
There we are.
44

45
00:02:11.455 --> 00:02:14.677
And now if I go back and run the debugger again
45

46
00:02:14.677 --> 00:02:18.844
we'll see it go back to the reactive configuration.
46

47
00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.953
IntelliJ didn't pick up the changes yet.
47

48
00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:27.544
So one problem I'm having there is, IntelliJ is not picking
48

49
00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:29.852
up the Gradle changes.
49

50
00:02:29.852 --> 00:02:32.374
So I'm gonna say come in here, sometimes it doesn't,
50

51
00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:35.737
I did a revert so it didn't see the file change.
51

52
00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:39.904
So now it's going through and should get it again.
52

53
00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:45.596
There, now we're back into reactive
53

54
00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.418
and what happened there is I made a change
54

55
00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:50.871
to build.gradle and IntelliJ didn't pick up the changes
55

56
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.157
right away, so it, the project was still configured
56

57
00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:55.603
to the old way.
57

58
00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:57.513
So sometimes you got to watch that when you're working
58

59
00:02:57.513 --> 00:02:58.485
with the IDs.
59

60
00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:01.206
But the core take away that I want you to have here
60

61
00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:04.602
is to understand if you start searching on the web
61

62
00:03:04.602 --> 00:03:09.018
about configuration for Thymeleaf and Reactive Spring,
62

63
00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:10.792
you're gonna see some stuff out there.
63

64
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:14.078
This area is evolving very quickly.
64

65
00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:18.461
Two months ago I'm recording this in August of 2017,
65

66
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.515
two, three months ago, this stuff wasn't there
66

67
00:03:20.515 --> 00:03:22.975
and you would have to have manually configure it
67

68
00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:25.689
but now this is all baked into Spring Boot
68

69
00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.046
and Spring Boot is doing that
69

70
00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:29.277
Thymeleaf Reactive configuration for us.
70

71
00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:31.573
And that configuration is getting picked up based
71

72
00:03:31.573 --> 00:03:34.752
on the Servlet container that is running.
72

73
00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:36.602
So if we have a traditional Servlet container,
73

74
00:03:36.602 --> 00:03:37.876
it goes Servlet.
74

75
00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:39.445
If we have a reactive container,
75

76
00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:41.914
it's going to pick up this type REACTIVE.
76

77
00:03:41.914 --> 00:03:44.825
So if you're not used to this, Spring Boot is making
77

78
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.206
these decisions based on the configuration
78

79
00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:49.063
of your environment.
79

80
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.955
And I also wanna point out there's no source code
80

81
00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:52.967
associated with this, this was just a demonstration
81

82
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.217
of Spring Boot.
82

83
00:03:55.187 --> 00:03:58.453
So there's no source code in GitHub for this piece here.
83

84
00:03:58.453 --> 00:04:01.057
But if you are looking for the class,
84

85
00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:03.617
it's ThymeleafAutoConfiguration if you wanna look at that
85

86
00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:07.108
in your own IDE and see how Spring
86

87
00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:11.839
is doing this configuration of Thymeleaf for us.
87

88
00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:13.029
Go ahead and take a look at that.
88

89
00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:15.249
Strongly encourage you to start taking a look
89

90
00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.246
at what Spring Boot is doing under the covers.
90

91
00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:21.417
Because it does do a lot of interesting stuff for us
91

92
00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:25.538
in making those choices for the sensible defaults
92

93
00:04:25.538 --> 00:04:27.455
in our configurations.
