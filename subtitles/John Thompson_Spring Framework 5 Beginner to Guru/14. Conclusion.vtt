Okay, this concludes the section of the
course on JMS messaging. As you can see,
1

2
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.840
we covered quite a bit of ground in this
section of the course about JMS
2

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.810
messaging. A number of different message
types there. If you're in a Java to Java
3

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.340
world, it's not uncommon to use these. But
more now, a Java Developers tend to focus
4

5
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
on being interoperable with other
languages. And that's why I focused on
5

6
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.219
using Jackson and JSON payload. Now,
your messages, this is more of a typical
6

7
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.620
use especially modern software
development. Because you can talk to
7

8
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.629
other technologies fairly easily. It's
not uncommon to have bridges that are
8

9
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.750
gonna be taking that messaging and
sending it off to a completely different
9

10
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.219
messaging system. So pretty common use case
especially in large enterprises.
10

11
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.449
That's why I kept this section of the course
focused on more typical use cases of
11

12
00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.960
messaging where you are exchanging a
JSON payload or an XML payload in text
12

13
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.159
so that you have that interoperability.
Now, you can go into serialize and do
13

14
00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.979
Java specific type messages. That is
where you're in a more closed ecosystem.
14

15
00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.650
But when you go with JSON or XML, it gives
you a much broader audience that can
15

16
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.740
consume the messages that you're
producing. So, I hope you enjoyed this
16

17
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.150
section of course. JMS, like I said,
once you get in an enterprise, very
17

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.560
common. It's been around forever. Widely
used, so not uncommon. So, this is happy to
18

19
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.060
add this content to the course. Because
it is so critical to have at least some
19

20
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.500
understanding of JMS and being able to
work with JMS messaging when you get
20

21
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.049
into larger enterprise application
development jobs.
