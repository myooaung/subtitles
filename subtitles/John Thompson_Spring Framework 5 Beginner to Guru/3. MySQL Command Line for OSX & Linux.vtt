00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.250
In this video, we are going to
take a look
at connecting to the MySQL database
1

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.549
using the command line. I am going to
be focused on OS X in this video and
2

3
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.350
also Linux. These commands I'm going to
show you should work the same for Linux
3

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.480
as well as OS X are very similar.
But, there may be a couple nuances along
4

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.720
the way. And now, the first one man that
we want to use is simply mysql. You
5

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.050
can see that I'm getting command not
found. That's because the bash shell
6

7
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
and inside of OS X cannot find that
command. This is kind of the way I
7

8
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.239
installed MySQL. You may find it ok,
but by default, it does not create a link
8

9
00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
to the MySQL executable. Linux
systems, I think the installer does do
9

10
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.260
this for you. So, it will add the MySQL
binaries into your past, so you should be
10

11
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:05.640
okay there. But if you run into this, what
you can do is create an alias and then
11

12
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.540
dupe in MySQL. This is going to create
an alias for that. So, if I hit enter, now
12

13
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.000
I can just use MySQL. You can see
that I'm getting a access denied here
13

14
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.100
for user JT at localhost, which makes
sense. I'm going to use a clear command to
14

15
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.710
clear this off there. Now, to actually
connect, what I want to do is mysql and
15

16
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.250
I'm going to do a - - user equals root. So,
that's the user. We don't have any other
16

17
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.579
user setup right now. We'll be getting
into that in the course further down the
17

18
00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.149
road. Now, I also want to do a - p to
prompt for the password. So now, you can
18

19
00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.049
see I have a little entry there for
password. Enter in the password for root,
19

20
00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.950
and now you can see that I am at the
command-line.
20

21
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.560
Now, there's a number of things that we
can do. I do a help. We bring up the
21

22
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.060
MySQL help for the command-line client
here. We can see like status. And here, we
22

23
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.750
can see the connection details and the
version that I'm running. You can see
23

24
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.569
that I have a connection via a UNIX
socket,
24

25
00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.980
so the client is going over a socket
connection at TCP/IP. But actually, a
25

26
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.219
socket into the server, and that again,
this again be UNIX or Linux or OS X. OS X
26

27
00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.629
is a derivative of a UNIX operating
system, so it's going to be specific to
27

28
00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.319
that. If you're watching this in using
Windows, you will be connecting either
28

29
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.560
via TCP/IP or a local pipe, I believe, or
named pipe. Now, let's take a look at the
29

30
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.239
database a little bit closer. We can do
the command show databases. It's very
30

31
00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.349
important to use a semicolon here. That's
the terminator for the command. We
31

32
00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.159
can see that I've got four databases in
there. We're just going to do a simple
32

33
00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.909
query. We'll be getting into this in a
lot more detail. So, let's go ahead and
33

34
00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:06.060
use mysql and semicolon. And now, by
default, I'm going to be using the MySQL
34

35
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.540
database. Now, I can do another command
called show tables. These are all the
35

36
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.840
tables there. Now, you might want to say I
could do show table name, but that would
36

37
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.840
be too intuitive for us. So, the command
is actually, if I want to describe a
37

38
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.099
table. And now we can see here, this is
all the columns in the user table. I had
38

39
00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.759
to scroll up a little bit here. You can
see the field, the type, whether it's
39

40
00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:41.759
allowed not to be null, if it's key default,
and some extra data. So, this gives you a
40

41
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:46.439
description of that table. Let's go
ahead and I'm going to issue a select
41

42
00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:57.599
statement. We will select host user
from the table user semicolon, and just
42

43
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.129
to recap, what we're doing is I'm taking
these two fields here, the first two
43

44
00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.129
fields: host and user. I'm saying select
those and we can see that there's three
44

45
00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.310
users created in my system. I am logged
in as the root user. The other two, those
45

46
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.699
are internal system accounts used by
MySQL. You'll never and should never have
46

47
00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.389
a need to log into those. We do have more
to talk about with users.
47

48
00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.280
For now, we are going to be using the
root user for convenience going forward.
48

49
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.439
So, I just want to give you a quick
overview of the MySQL command client.
49

50
00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:42.249
Now, when you are done using it to exit,
remember we got the help command, you can
50

51
00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:48.909
do quit or exit. All right. I think exit.
Yeah exit or quit. So, you see both are
51

52
00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.409
listed there. They do the same thing, so I
actually will use them interchangeably
52

53
00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:00.939
personally. So, do that and now we can see
it says goodbye. If I do a clear, I'll
53

54
00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:05.639
clear the screen and we are now out of
MySQL.
