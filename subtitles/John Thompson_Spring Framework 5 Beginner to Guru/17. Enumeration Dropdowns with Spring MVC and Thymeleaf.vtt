00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.700
Alright in this video we want to take a
look at adding a drop-down list to our
1

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.299
edit form for recipes for the difficulty. But first I want to show you a little
2

3
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.449
refactoring I did. Actually, on line 28 is  a mistake. You don't need that
3

4
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.050
there but on line 24, I'll bring up the old.
I was using GetMapping and Request
4

5
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.809
Mapping together and this is technically
not correct or not the most optimal. You
5

6
00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.980
could use them together but the GetMapping drill into that. It is
6

7
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.870
essentially a helper method over RequestMapping. So it's kind of redundant to be
7

8
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.840
using both. It is an alias for RequestMapping but what it does is it sets in
8

9
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.710
the RequestMethod to GET. So we could
do the exact same thing using Request
9

10
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
Mapping and then specifying the RequestMethod. This is really just a helper
10

11
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.199
annotation so having both of them
there like that was really kind of
11

12
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.950
redundant. We don't need to use both of
them so I've refactored both controllers.
12

13
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.750
The IngredientController and RecipeController for that change. So we'll go
13

14
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.130
with that going forward. So technically
not the most optimal thing there. It was just
14

15
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.369
kind of my mistake doing it that way. I
should have shown you the other way from
15

16
00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.900
the get-go but I'm kind of new to this
annotation as well. That's a recent
16

17
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.939
addition to the Spring Framework. I think it
was version 4.3 they introduced that
17

18
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.159
feature in. So sometimes I'm learning
stuff too as we go but here we want to
18

19
00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.640
get into displaying a drop-down list
using our enum Difficulty. So remember
19

20
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.439
this pretty simple enumeration that we
have here. And I'm going to show you a
20

21
00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.490
slightly different technique than what
we did with ingredients and this time we
21

22
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.780
are going to use Thymeleaf field for
Difficulty. And then on line 69 there we
22

23
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.640
are using an expression. This T is a type so within this
23

24
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.649
expression, it's saying give me a type of
Difficulty. So it gives the enum then
24

25
00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.540
we're calling the method values on
which is going to give us a list array
25

26
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.970
at the values. And then that's going to get passed back
26

27
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.270
into the variable difficultyValue and
we are going to say to just get the name
27

28
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.900
of that. Now if we wanted to have a more
pleasant text name on that we could
28

29
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.260
refactor our enum to have a more better
displayed text value because what's
29

30
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.250
going to happen now, is that we'll get
just all the uppercase values. So if we
30

31
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.760
want to do something different there, we
could refactor this and give it a String
31

32
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.660
property that we could display on the
web page. But you can do that for extra
32

33
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.610
credit if you would like but in here we
are going to iterate over that and come
33

34
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.130
up with this. And I am doing this slightly
different than I did before in the
34

35
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.450
ingredients with that dropped down
because we didn't have a good equals
35

36
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.459
implement, equals method implemented on
unit of measure. But here we do it so we
36

37
00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.980
can rely upon that and what's important
here is Thymeleaf is going to use the
37

38
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.459
equals operator. So when that field is
equal to the object, it will set that as
38

39
00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.690
the default. So we will see that in
action now. So I'm going to go ahead and
39

40
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.120
start up Spring Boot and we'll take a
look at what this tag is now
40

41
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.860
rendering for HTML. Look I accidentally
ran the test. I apologize. So now we'll
41

42
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.310
start up Spring Boot. Grab the wrong
option off the drop-down there. So we are
42

43
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.250
now up on 8080 and I'm going to toggle
over to Chrome, refresh here, we'll see
43

44
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.269
our application come up. Now I am going
to come in to update and we can see that
44

45
00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.870
this has been persisted. So I'm going to
change this to hard and submit it and I
45

46
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.900
just got an error, method not allowed. Class methods get not supported. Let's
46

47
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.040
back up and take a look at that.
47

48
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:20.989
So view the page source here and I think
it's because I don't have a form action.
48

49
00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.380
So it's going against recipe but it
should be a post. So let's change that
49

50
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.690
real quick. Just a simple update here, we
need to say method and post. It was I
50

51
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.150
think defaulting to get and when I
removed that annotation, it was
51

52
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.370
preventing the get method from getting
there as well.
52

53
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.530
So let's go ahead and and build this
just in case, make sure that gets updated
53

54
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.470
and come back over here and let's do a
refresh on that. Make sure that we are in
54

55
00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:06.389
fact getting a post. View page source
here. Now we can see that in fact on line 23
55

56
00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.080
there we are getting a method to post. So
let's go ahead and try this again and
56

57
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.650
we'll change it to kind of hard and
we'll submit it. Now we can see that it
57

58
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.620
is updated and what what we're talking
about in the equals method earlier, I
58

59
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:32.789
want to show you the page source on this. Where's that drop down? Oh, my bad. So let's
59

60
00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:42.960
go in back here and edit it. So I get
to this form here, the edit form and now
60

61
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.000
we'll come in and take a look at page
source. And here's our drop-down list and
61

62
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.260
the equals method, it gets selected,
getting that set selected which is
62

63
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.110
going to control which of these gets
displayed on default. So that's going
63

64
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.210
to be defaulted to selected. So if I
come back here and change it to easy and
64

65
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.680
submit the update and let's close this and
come back over.
65

66
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:21.410
And refresh that to view page source. Now
we can see that easy has been selected and that's
66

67
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:29.450
because in our Thymeleaf template, when
we're using this form command here,
67

68
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:35.120
I'm sorry the field command,
when the property, when the value is
68

69
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.640
equal that's going to set. I'm going to toggle over
here. It's going to set that selected
69

70
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.900
equals to selected which will cause the
web browser to position on that element
70

71
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.210
of the drop-down. So just recap the
changes that we did there. Come back over
71

72
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.610
here to IntelliJ and we added in this option value here. This is what we
72

73
00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:01.820
had in the previous source here, 77 to 79
and I did add and the Thymeleaf command to
73

74
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.200
remove that drop down. So this will
preserve the natural templating but
74

75
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.230
here, this block of code up here is what
we added for this section. So we take in
75

76
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.490
the Thymeleaf field of difficulty which is
going to be out the form object and then
76

77
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.640
we get a whole of the enumeration of
difficulty and grab the values. That
77

78
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.560
gives us an array to iterate over and
because we're using the Thymeleaf field
78

79
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.200
value when that enum is equals it will
also have the selected property set to
79

80
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.520
true or in this case, selected which
will preposition the drop down on that.
80

81
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.390
So that concludes this section. Dropdowns
can be a little tricky to work with
81

82
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.360
sometimes. So that's why I want to this
into a little more detail.
