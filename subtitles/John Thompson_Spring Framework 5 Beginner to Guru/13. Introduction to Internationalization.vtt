1

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.418
in this video, we are going to take a look
2

3
00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:08.676
at internationalization,
3

4
00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.426
and how it relates to Spring MVC.
4

5
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:14.105
Now,
5

6
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:18.412
internationalization is often abbreviated as i18n,
6

7
00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.011
and that is just the first letter of internationalization,
7

8
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:21.844
the i,
8

9
00:00:21.844 --> 00:00:23.724
then the 18 characters in the middle
9

10
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:25.506
of internationalization
10

11
00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:27.183
with the following n.
11

12
00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:30.408
We also see references to l10n,
12

13
00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:32.031
for localization.
13

14
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.929
And I want to point out
14

15
00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:33.874
this is a really,
15

16
00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:35.381
really broad topic
16

17
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:37.608
dealing with different languages,
17

18
00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:40.042
left-to-right, right-to-left languages.
18

19
00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.203
A lot of character sets and things like that,
19

20
00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:44.514
so it's quite a complex topic,
20

21
00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:46.621
especially when you start getting to different currencies
21

22
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:47.621
and layouts.
22

23
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.653
In a Spring MVC context,
23

24
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:54.132
we're generally looking at the support
24

25
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:55.669
for different languages,
25

26
00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:58.476
and what we're going to be diving into more
26

27
00:00:58.476 --> 00:01:01.366
is how we can customize the resource bundle
27

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.318
to find text strings,
28

29
00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:06.369
so it is a much broader topic
29

30
00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.963
when you start looking at all the nuances
30

31
00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.111
of different languages and character sets.
31

32
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:10.944
Here,
32

33
00:01:10.944 --> 00:01:13.567
we are looking at just setting simply String properties,
33

34
00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.479
so we can set up our application to be dynamic
34

35
00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.118
and sensitive to different language codes.
35

36
00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:22.041
So the main thing that we're going to be looking at
36

37
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:25.247
is the accept-language in the request header,
37

38
00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:28.580
and in that we have a scheme of language
38

39
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.038
where en-
39

40
00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:34.015
and my example on the screen there is for English
40

41
00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:36.406
and US is for the country code.
41

42
00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:40.348
And these are governed by a set of standards.
42

43
00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:43.600
And this originally came up around 2001
43

44
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.933
and I looked at the RFC 3066
44

45
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.390
and there's a lot of chatter,
45

46
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.589
and I didn't see when it was officially ratified,
46

47
00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.085
so I don't have a date for you there,
47

48
00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:54.473
but that did come out in the 2001,
48

49
00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:56.342
and generally the language codes
49

50
00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:58.342
are governed by ISO 639.
50

51
00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:02.480
And this sets up a standard of the language codes.
51

52
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.647
And then the region codes are governed by ISO 3166.
52

53
00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.826
And now the region codes,
53

54
00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:10.883
generally,
54

55
00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:13.967
probably 90% of the time they're looking at countries
55

56
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.981
from what I've glanced at the official list.
56

57
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:18.814
But,
57

58
00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:21.321
it can refer to specific regions and territories
58

59
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.869
and things like that, so,
59

60
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.169
it can be broader,
60

61
00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.832
but generally what we're seeing
61

62
00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:27.582
is that impractical use
62

63
00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:30.037
are going to be tied to countries.
63

64
00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:32.044
Now, locale detection:
64

65
00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:34.044
this is how we determine
65

66
00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.571
what locale to use.
66

67
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:42.373
And the default behavior is to use the Accept-Language
67

68
00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:43.206
header.
68

69
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.357
And this is passed in an HTTP header with a request.
69

70
00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:47.333
Now Spring,
70

71
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.815
it can also be configured to use a system.
71

72
00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:51.598
The system property from the JVM,
72

73
00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:54.686
a cookie, or some other custom parameter.
73

74
00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:56.147
Now the custom parameter,
74

75
00:02:56.147 --> 00:02:59.276
you'll see a lot of examples of that when you Google
75

76
00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.797
Spring MVC and internationalizations.
76

77
00:03:01.797 --> 00:03:03.499
Almost all the time they're going to be showing you
77

78
00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.325
how to set up that custom parameter
78

79
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.723
and they kind of skip over that Accept-Language part.
79

80
00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:10.986
And this is handy because you can set up a URL parameter
80

81
00:03:10.986 --> 00:03:13.715
on custom so that you can swap in and out.
81

82
00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.676
What you're going to see is your browser
82

83
00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:20.370
is normally tied to your operating system,
83

84
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.650
the configuration of your operating system.
84

85
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.637
So me being in the U.S.,
85

86
00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.793
mine is English-U.S. based,
86

87
00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:29.826
and that's kind of something when you first open up
87

88
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:31.489
your machine and you set it up,
88

89
00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.399
you're probably going to be selecting the language
89

90
00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:34.489
that you want,
90

91
00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.236
so as in Europe,
91

92
00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:38.678
I might be doing French, or German,
92

93
00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:41.600
or some other language depending on where I'm at
93

94
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.506
so that's something that you set up initially,
94

95
00:03:43.506 --> 00:03:45.900
and then as you use your system
95

96
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.053
and like install Firefox and Chrome,
96

97
00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:50.616
they are going to look at your operating system to pull
97

98
00:03:50.616 --> 00:03:51.449
that in,
98

99
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.910
so that custom parameter can be handy,
99

100
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.265
and if you have some requirements
100

101
00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:59.158
of like having an English site, and a French site
101

102
00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:00.218
and a German site,
102

103
00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:02.248
and allowing the users to swap that,
103

104
00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:06.598
that is another custom feature, handy feature of Spring MVC
104

105
00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:08.707
that you can leverage.
105

106
00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:09.540
Now,
106

107
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.779
we spoke about the different ways
107

108
00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:14.814
a specifically the AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver,
108

109
00:04:14.814 --> 00:04:16.020
that is the Spring Boot default,
109

110
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.983
so if you don't define anything else under Spring Boot,
110

111
00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:21.465
that is what's going to get configured.
111

112
00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:22.298
Now,
112

113
00:04:22.298 --> 00:04:24.022
you can set a system parameter
113

114
00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.552
in your application.properties file
114

115
00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:29.269
to use a FixedLocaleResolver,
115

116
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.641
and that's going to use the locale of the JVM.
116

117
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.792
And the JVM, most of the time,
117

118
00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:36.576
in most typical situations,
118

119
00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:39.213
is going to be inheriting the locale
119

120
00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:41.205
from your operating system.
120

121
00:04:41.205 --> 00:04:45.147
Now, you also have available a CookieLocaleResolver
121

122
00:04:45.147 --> 00:04:46.610
and a SessionLocaleResolver
122

123
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.661
where you can pull the locale from a cookie property
123

124
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:52.016
or a SessionLocaleResolver.
124

125
00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:53.563
Honestly, these last two,
125

126
00:04:53.563 --> 00:04:55.270
I don't see those used very much.
126

127
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.570
I'm sure they're out there,
127

128
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.821
so don't come back and say hey we're using this
128

129
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:00.654
all the time,
129

130
00:05:00.654 --> 00:05:01.767
I know there's use cases,
130

131
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.325
but to be honest I don't see those used too often.
131

132
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:07.163
The most generally accepted one to use
132

133
00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:11.463
is going to be the AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver.
133

134
00:05:11.463 --> 00:05:12.645
As I mentioned,
134

135
00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.408
changing the locale browsers are typically going to be tied
135

136
00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:17.520
to the operating system.
136

137
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.026
There are plugins available
137

138
00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:21.749
to allow you to easily change locale.
138

139
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:22.582
Now,
139

140
00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:25.571
some of the browsers are going to require you to install
140

141
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:27.396
language packs for the locales that you'll want to be using,
141

142
00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:28.774
so you will need to go in
142

143
00:05:28.774 --> 00:05:30.683
and do a little browser configuration.
143

144
00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:33.888
And that is going to vary by the browser
144

145
00:05:33.888 --> 00:05:34.821
that you're using, so,
145

146
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:37.255
Firefox is going to be different from Chrome,
146

147
00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:39.488
Chrome is going to be different from Safari.
147

148
00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:42.104
And, I'm guessing that anything by Microsoft
148

149
00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:44.785
is going to be different from all of the above.
149

150
00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.206
Now, the next thing we want to look at
150

151
00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:47.910
are resource bundles.
151

152
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.473
We've already seen the messages.properties
152

153
00:05:50.473 --> 00:05:52.585
and how we can use that,
153

154
00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:56.121
and what we have is a way to set up a hierarchy
154

155
00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.338
of messages,
155

156
00:05:57.338 --> 00:06:01.447
so we can define a messages for language,
156

157
00:06:01.447 --> 00:06:03.197
and then region,
157

158
00:06:03.197 --> 00:06:06.816
which in my example here would be English and U.S.
158

159
00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.733
So a locale of en-US would match
159

160
00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:13.900
messages_en_US.properties.
160

161
00:06:16.328 --> 00:06:17.793
Now what's important here,
161

162
00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:19.944
is if no match is found,
162

163
00:06:19.944 --> 00:06:23.146
you can default down to just a language code.
163

164
00:06:23.146 --> 00:06:24.728
And so for example,
164

165
00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:28.132
en-GB for Great Britain wouldn't match
165

166
00:06:28.132 --> 00:06:29.549
a messages_en_GB,
166

167
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.053
and in this case it would ignore a _US.properties file.
167

168
00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:37.555
But if that's not found,
168

169
00:06:37.555 --> 00:06:40.312
you can set up a higher level default
169

170
00:06:40.312 --> 00:06:42.479
of messages_en.properties,
170

171
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.179
so this can be important depending on the region
171

172
00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:49.730
because both the U.S. and Great Britain,
172

173
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.678
technically we both speak English,
173

174
00:06:51.678 --> 00:06:55.651
but there are a lot of different nuances in the languages,
174

175
00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:58.916
just like Spanish in Spain is radically different
175

176
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:00.648
from Spanish in Mexico,
176

177
00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:03.976
which is completely different from Spanish in Brazil, so.
177

178
00:07:03.976 --> 00:07:06.420
These are just different examples, so,
178

179
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.139
if we had Spanish, you could handle all the nuances
179

180
00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:10.969
of those languages.
180

181
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:13.771
Now, you can get a pretty complex hierarchy
181

182
00:07:13.771 --> 00:07:16.413
depending on the needs of your application.
182

183
00:07:16.413 --> 00:07:20.523
The last one would be messages.properties
183

184
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.000
so just keep in mind when you're working with this
184

185
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.031
you do have this capability of saying
185

186
00:07:25.031 --> 00:07:28.440
I want something for English in Great Britain,
186

187
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.777
English in the U.S.,
187

188
00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:32.777
Spanish in Spain, Spanish in Brazil,
188

189
00:07:33.914 --> 00:07:36.557
and then you can default down to just Spanish,
189

190
00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:38.951
and then you can default down to a general default
190

191
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:40.372
for that property, so,
191

192
00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:43.520
you can get pretty specific with this.
192

193
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.356
I've worked with it in the past,
193

194
00:07:45.356 --> 00:07:47.671
and this is a pretty versatile tool set
194

195
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:50.919
that you have to work with when you're defining properties.
195

196
00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:52.452
Now in the next video,
196

197
00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:54.468
we are going to take a look at setting this up,
197

198
00:07:54.468 --> 00:07:57.025
and we'll take a look at how it gets resolved,
198

199
00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:59.628
and how we can set up different message strings
199

200
00:07:59.628 --> 00:08:01.200
and have those displayed on our screen
200

201
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.925
through a Thymeleaf command,
201

202
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.644
and we'll see how we can change different strings
202

203
00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:10.811
depending on the locale that we have set in the browser.
