00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:03.312
(soothing music)
1

2
00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:05.891
All right
2

3
00:00:05.891 --> 00:00:09.848
in this video, we are going to review the recipe application
3

4
00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:12.348
as we port it over to MongoDB.
4

5
00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:16.164
So what I've done is I took that recipe application
5

6
00:00:16.164 --> 00:00:18.888
that we worked with in traditional SQL
6

7
00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:22.305
and I've ported it over and just for fun,
7

8
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:25.121
what I've done is I thought it would be fun
8

9
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:27.559
to do this using Gradle as well.
9

10
00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.726
So right now, with Gradle, I've gone in and added in
10

11
00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:34.662
these Spring Data MongoDB.
11

12
00:00:34.662 --> 00:00:36.682
So that's a primary difference that we have from
12

13
00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:38.182
the MySQL project.
13

14
00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:43.445
So we took out the Spring Data JPA and went to MongoDB.
14

15
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.673
So that's the primary change that I made
15

16
00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:48.181
in the project dependencies.
16

17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.526
And what I wanna also look at is
17

18
00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:55.252
under the domain, let's take a look at that.
18

19
00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:57.357
I've migrated the domain a little bit
19

20
00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.965
and still have a lot more work here to do,
20

21
00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:04.461
but we were using a Long data type for the id value
21

22
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.017
and that has changed to String.
22

23
00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:09.857
So I've gone ahead and made that change
23

24
00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:11.923
and it was a little bit of a type migration
24

25
00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:13.090
to update that
25

26
00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:17.331
and propagated that through the whole project.
26

27
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.043
Now I want to point out, we do have our CrudRepository.
27

28
00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.352
And what's interesting about Spring Data
28

29
00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:25.669
is we are still using that same interface.
29

30
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:26.950
So that did not change,
30

31
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.649
so that is Spring Data interface that we're implementing
31

32
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.454
and now we've swapped out the JPA flavor of Spring Data
32

33
00:01:34.454 --> 00:01:36.968
and we're now using the Mongo flavor,
33

34
00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:40.312
but if you take a look at this,
34

35
00:01:40.312 --> 00:01:43.408
actually let's take a drill into that.
35

36
00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:45.514
If you click on this here in IntelliJ will take you
36

37
00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:47.952
right to the class and we can see that
37

38
00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:51.013
this is out of the springframework/data package.
38

39
00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:54.267
So this is out of the Spring Data commons JAR.
39

40
00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.324
So this is a common component that works across Spring Data.
40

41
00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:58.848
So we didn't do any changes there
41

42
00:01:58.848 --> 00:02:00.459
which is a really nice touch
42

43
00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.477
when you're working with Spring Data.
43

44
00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:05.693
We're making a fairly painless transition over.
44

45
00:02:05.693 --> 00:02:07.215
I wanna warn you right now,
45

46
00:02:07.215 --> 00:02:10.728
this branch, the master branch does not run
46

47
00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:12.834
because we haven't done any Mongo configuration.
47

48
00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:15.059
We are gonna definitely get into that.
48

49
00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.329
We'll definitely be getting into setting up MongoDB,
49

50
00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.174
but this is just the initial cut bringing over this project.
50

51
00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.524
Now let's go back up to the project
51

52
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:26.048
and I wanna show you a couple other things.
52

53
00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:28.442
If we come back into the Recipe,
53

54
00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:31.982
notice that I've removed all the JPA-related annotations.
54

55
00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:34.543
So now we just have a simple POJO here.
55

56
00:02:34.543 --> 00:02:37.847
All our former domain models are just simple POJOs.
56

57
00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:39.993
We're still using Project Lombok for the
57

58
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:43.584
getters and setters and they still have the same
58

59
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:46.304
relationships that they did prior,
59

60
00:02:46.304 --> 00:02:51.204
but we've just removed all the JPA-related annotations.
60

61
00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:54.871
And the other thing is, if I come into test,
61

62
00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.898
I've set up the test now.
62

63
00:02:56.898 --> 00:02:59.047
I'm gonna run all the tests
63

64
00:02:59.047 --> 00:03:01.188
and I did have to ignore several of the tests
64

65
00:03:01.188 --> 00:03:02.798
because the Spring context right now
65

66
00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:04.042
is not starting up.
66

67
00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.530
It's not happy because we don't have
67

68
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.648
a Mongo database connection so that is failing.
68

69
00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.092
And plus, we haven't mapped any of these,
69

70
00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:13.115
so if it did come up in a context,
70

71
00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:14.640
even with a Mongo database connection,
71

72
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.993
I don't think the domain model would be happy.
72

73
00:03:16.993 --> 00:03:18.443
It would probably throw some exceptions there.
73

74
00:03:18.443 --> 00:03:20.629
But we are gonna be covering all that
74

75
00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.274
coming up in the course.
75

76
00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:25.833
Now the next thing I wanna point out is
76

77
00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.558
our Controller layer is all the same.
77

78
00:03:28.558 --> 00:03:32.149
Now we did migrate to a String for the id value
78

79
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.633
so the error handling for that NumberFormatException
79

80
00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.621
that we formerly had,
80

81
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.559
or we still actually have it in there.
81

82
00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.157
But now, everything is a String
82

83
00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:41.269
so obviously, we're not gonna get
83

84
00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.946
a NumberFormatException of a String value.
84

85
00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:46.930
So that is one change that we had to deal with
85

86
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.661
in the migration.
86

87
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.789
But, as you can envision right now,
87

88
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.479
the front-end is gonna stay the same.
88

89
00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.279
So our Controller layer is gonna stay the same.
89

90
00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:58.626
The Thymeleaf templates are gonna stay the same
90

91
00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:02.706
except for the type migration from a number of the id
91

92
00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:06.214
to a String, there's really no changes there.
92

93
00:04:06.214 --> 00:04:08.061
So our front-end is staying the same.
93

94
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.957
The service layer largely stays the same
94

95
00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:11.812
except for the type migration.
95

96
00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:14.079
And even getting into the repository layer,
96

97
00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.498
that, from our code standpoint is staying the same.
97

98
00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:20.980
So a lot of this is quite nice for us,
98

99
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.586
as far as migrating.
99

100
00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:24.647
So this is kind of a significant change
100

101
00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:28.066
because we're going from a SQL database
101

102
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:32.284
such as MySQL or H2 that we were using earlier in the course
102

103
00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:35.629
and now we are going over to a NoSQL database.
103

104
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.489
So we do have some work to do yet,
104

105
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.743
but our project as whole, we have a lot of code here.
105

106
00:04:40.743 --> 00:04:42.227
We still have a lot of tests.
106

107
00:04:42.227 --> 00:04:44.087
We have three tests that are ignored,
107

108
00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:46.887
but I'm gonna show you how to bring those back to life
108

109
00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:50.887
in future sections of this module of the course.
