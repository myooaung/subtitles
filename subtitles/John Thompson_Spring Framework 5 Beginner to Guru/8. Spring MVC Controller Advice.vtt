Alright now in this video we're going
to take a look at using Controller
1

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.320
Advice and this is a way to set up a
global type ExceptionHandler. And in
2

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.390
this example, I'm going to reformat this
NumberFormatException handler that we
3

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.510
had. And what I want to do here is I want
to set this up globally because
4

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.150
otherwise, we want to handle it in our
ImageController as well. So remember our
5

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.320
ImageController also is going to be
going by ID. So we have the same
6

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
vulnerability there to get a NumberFormatException. So we want to handle
7

8
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.219
this at a global level and using
Controller Advice is ideal for that. So
8

9
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.600
what I'm going to do is just completely
delete this from our RecipeController
9

10
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.070
and then I've created this new class
called ControllerExceptionHandler and
10

11
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.199
annotated it with ControllerAdvice. And I
also have the Project Lombok annotation
11

12
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.140
there for the logging framework. And this
is literally a cut and paste what we had
12

13
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.310
in the RecipeController. So I just moved
this whole thing over to this class. I'll put
13

14
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
a line break there, makes it a little
more readable. And now this is going to
14

15
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.689
handle it at a global level. But I also
wrote a new test here and if we run it
15

16
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.509
what's going to happen is it's actually
going to fail. And we need to, we're actually
16

17
00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.450
going to have two failing tests. Let's go
ahead and run those right now. I'll show
17

18
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.729
you the failing tests in Controllers. So
we're going to have these two failing
18

19
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.439
tests and I'll show you exactly why
because what's happened is we didn't set
19

20
00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.590
up our MockMvc correctly. So what we
need to do is I actually have it here in
20

21
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.310
the Controller, just commented that out. We need to wire in the ControllerAdvice.
21

22
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.950
So that's happening inside of our
setup for the MockMvcBuilders. So by
22

23
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
doing it this way, we're not relying on
the full Spring context. We're still
23

24
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.240
using the mocking framework keeping our unit tests very light and
24

25
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.730
fast. So now if I go in that and I need
to add that into the test for this guy
25

26
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.780
as well. So we're going to set the
ControllerAdvise on our MockMvcBuilders.
26

27
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.040
Now if I come in and rerun those tests,
we will get those passing. So I can see
27

28
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.110
those are passing now. I think I still
have this up. So let's go ahead and take
28

29
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.700
a look at it inside of here. So I still
have that one. I'll make sure that we're
29

30
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.310
still getting the proper view which we
are. So now we have a much nicer
30

31
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.060
implementation of that. So if our
application were to grow some and become
31

32
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.890
more complex, we're now going to be
duplicating code. So if we did not use
32

33
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.080
the global ExceptionHandler, we would
have to add this into every class. So
33

34
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.670
this is a nice way if you have a global
situation across your application that
34

35
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.500
you want to handle in a specific way. You
can handle this across many Controllers
35

36
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.000
that way. So it's a good refactoring and
it saves you from duplicating code and
36

37
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.989
multiple cCntrollers to handle the same
error message. So the ControllerAdvice
37

38
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.820
annotation is a real handy addition to
the Spring MVC framework.
