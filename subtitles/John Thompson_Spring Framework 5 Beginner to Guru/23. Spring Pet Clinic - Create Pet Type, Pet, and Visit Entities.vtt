In this video, we are going to go ahead
and tackle this one here, the Create Pet
1

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
Type, Pet, and Visit Entities. These are
three entities that we want to add into
2

3
00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.140
our project. We will accomplish them
with task number 26 here. So let's come
3

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.029
over here and we'll go into IntelliJ.
Let's open up source main Java. I'm
4

5
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
going to change back these settings here
to compact. Empty middle packages.
5

6
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.190
We'll come back here, and now, let's
create a new Java class called PetType.
6

7
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.270
Oh, my mistake. Cancel. We already had
PetType there. That was my bad. We do
7

8
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.920
have PetType. I got a hit myself. Sorry.
We do have PetType here. Base entity, so
8

9
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.079
that is already on the Pet. We are
good there. My mistake.
9

10
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.990
We do have Pet, PetType
and this is
10

11
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.820
not. Let's take a look at the owner, so
the owner does not have a pet yet.
11

12
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.530
Let's go ahead and add that with this
task.
12

13
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.060
We can see that, and now we come here
and say add in the getters and setters
13

14
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.140
for that. That accomplishes that.
Let's double check.
14

15
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.780
So pet. We want to also add in the
Visit Entity so if we come back here to
15

16
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.670
pet clinic, let's take a look at this guy.
16

17
00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.320
We have the visit entity. Their
visit implementation is pretty simple. It's going to have a local date,
17

18
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.440
description, and a pet ID. I'm curious why
they did pet ID. I'm going to change mapping.
18

19
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.670
We'll actually use the pet itself rather
than pet ID. That's kind of strange. I see
19

20
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.560
why they did that. Let's go ahead
and grab that local date. I'm surprise they
20

21
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.190
don't have a time component there.
Usually when I visit, they will have a time , so I
21

22
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.950
will do that. We'll add in Visit.
22

23
00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:54.209
We'll get the local date, description
and pet ID. We'll do private string,
23

24
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.370
like so and I will do...
24

25
00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.519
I'm just doing command N, getter
and setter.
25

26
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.440
I'll go ahead and add those in like so. so now,
we have a visit extends base entity. He
26

27
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.880
also has a pet. Taking a look at the
implementation there, we are deviating
27

28
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.800
from the reference implementation, where
they use a ID value, which is kind of
28

29
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.120
strange. That's going to cause us. It should cause us
more work. Hopefully, I don't regret this
29

30
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.100
decision by deviating. But let's take a
look at this. The task was to create the
30

31
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.450
pet, type pet and visit entities.
Right now, they were already existing so
31

32
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.560
we did have the pet. I made a mistake. 
I didn't realize it was there when I
32

33
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.350
planned it out. We do have pet their.
Pet type, which just gives us a name
33

34
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.280
of a pet type, which is quite nice. But
that is a singular attribute of pet. And
34

35
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.760
then, we are also adding in visit and a
visit as a date with its description and
35

36
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.959
associates a pet with that ID. I am
going to call that good and that was
36

37
00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.890
task number number 26. Let's go ahead
and call that good here. I'm going to go
37

38
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.180
ahead and commit that into Git.
38

39
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.740
I'm saying I added in visits.
39

40
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.370
Got a typo in the word. Then updated the owner
and added in updated owner with pet
40

41
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.980
relationship. I'm closing out task number
26, so we'll go ahead and commit and push
41

42
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.260
that up to GitHub and call this task
good. If I wish to use references, can I
42

43
00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.880
count on you to say nice things about me?
Be honest. Do you mean be honest or nice?
