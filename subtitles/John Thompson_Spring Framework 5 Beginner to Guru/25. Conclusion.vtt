00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.550
All right.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.790
This concludes our module on springs dependency injection.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.840
You saw a lot of different tools here.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.760
I don't know if you're familiar with dependency injection and other signs such as with angular J S or

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.680
something so springs model is quite a bit more mature than what I've seen in some of the javascript

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.110
frameworks so they do.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.910
Dependency Injection but not to the level of spring and we're only really scratching the surface here

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.710
we're going to see a lot more dependency injection because dependency injection and version control

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.500
are absolutely core concepts to the spring framework and it's really kind of what.

10
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.220
Why is spring and so popular.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.940
Because it gives you so much versatility in the enterprise.

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.280
So I'm kind of excited.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.380
We kind of threw a little dry stuff here I apologize it's hard to make it that exciting because they're

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.690
not really building World War stuff or we're just going to kick the tires but Dependency Injection is

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.860
so fundamental.

16
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.970
I hope you got a lot of this module and we got a lot more great stuff to come in this course.
