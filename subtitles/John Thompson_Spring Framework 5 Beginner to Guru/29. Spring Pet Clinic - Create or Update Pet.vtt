00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.420
Alright! In this video we are going to go in and work on number 56 and that's the ability to add and update
1

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.120
a Pet to our Pet Clinic.
2

3
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.930
Very important if we're going to have a Pet Clinic we should have pets in the system.
3

4
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.970
So that's what we're going to do is add that functionality now.
4

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.770
So I've gone in and I've added a couple of things here.
5

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.300
I set up some tests.
6

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:34.640
So before I do that, found one thing PetType. I implemented the Builder pattern so I didn't have this
7

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.680
constructor here.
8

9
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:43.520
I wasn't able to use the id property so now I created a constructor for the id and name so and this
9

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.660
is Project Lombok so I remove the Builder from the class level annotation and put it on the constructor
10

11
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.980
and set up a constructor because we're extending out that BaseEntity.
11

12
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.930
And I want to build use the Builder pattern with this as well so I was a little refactoring and I am
12

13
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.250
going to commit this
13

14
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.100
I'm just showing you a way of doing small incremental commits.
14

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.220
I'm just going to commit this guy now and then the next thing.
15

16
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.810
I also added in some views. We have two views for the pet form.
16

17
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.890
So we have the pet form and the visit form. We're not going to use a visit form at this time but I'm going
17

18
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.610
to go ahead and add these into Git as well. So we commit that.
18

19
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.880
Now again I'm just referencing the ticket that I'm working on. Now so that shows up in the commits. Commit
19

20
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.970
that. So we close that.
20

21
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.450
And now let's take a look at the test.
21

22
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.050
Now I'm looking at setting up the PetController to do all this.
22

23
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.500
And again we want to be able to create a pet and update a pet.
23

24
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.220
So I'm following that the Spring pattern here to create a pet.
24

25
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.600
We have a initializer which is going to return back an empty object to our Model so that displays the
25

26
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.530
form properly and the bind variables and whatnot and then that form will get posted and then we need
26

27
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.430
a controller method to handle that post and then the same for the update.
27

28
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.090
So the update is going to provide a populated Pet object back to the Model and then we need to accept
28

29
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.820
that Pet object back and save that.
29

30
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.040
So a couple of things that we need to do there and we need to implement this. I'm going to go ahead
30

31
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.370
and run the test and we'll see that they are failing because we have not implemented these methods.
31

32
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.320
And I got stubs so we've got some that are passing but they're just stubs to implement.
32

33
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.040
But let's go ahead and work on the add pet method.
33

34
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.600
I'm going to come over here to Pet Clinic and I am going to seamlessly steal from what they did there.
34

35
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.360
Let's take the code for the creating a new pet and we'll take that to our PetController.
35

36
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.580
And we'll go ahead and add that and then modify it as we need to.
36

37
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.410
I'm just go into doing the imports here.
37

38
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.460
A couple of things that we need to implement and see here.
38

39
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.680
I have Owner and I'm going to be consistent and just use Model
39

40
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.300
so they added a utility function to add a pet.
40

41
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.730
And in this case I'm not going to be utilizing that.
41

42
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.220
I'm just refactoring to use the model and add an attribute that addresses that.
42

43
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.750
And again here we have owner.
43

44
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.670
So you can see here that I don't have that get pet.
44

45
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.300
Let's take a look at that.
45

46
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.430
See what they've added here.
46

47
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.450
BaseEntity
47

48
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.000
Here we have getPets.
48

49
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.090
So we'll go ahead and implement this to our model as well.
49

50
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.730
So there's a convenient method. I'm going to go ahead and add that
50

51
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.710
and
51

52
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.350
It's an old code here.
52

53
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.810
So
53

54
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.820
It should work.
54

55
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.260
I'm just kind of changing this on the fly here so shamelessly stealing from them to duplicate their
55

56
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.280
functionality.
56

57
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.710
Now we have our getPet
57

58
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.070
And now we just need
58

59
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.260
So again I'm just going through in implementing that.
59

60
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.210
So now we have our pets new that's going to handle the form.
60

61
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.590
So we're going to return back the Owner.
61

62
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.520
So that's working.
62

63
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.270
That is double checking what's going on here making sure everything's at work right so let's run our
63

64
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.740
tests and hopefully two of them drop off.
64

65
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.080
Neither one was happy.
65

66
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.690
So
66

67
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.620
Ok so getPets owner
67

68
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.500
should not be null
68

69
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.970
ok what's happening is the builder passed in a null
69

70
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.080
so I do initialize it to a HashSet
70

71
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.930
But that is passing in a null value to the pet.
71

72
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.050
So what I'm going to do here is
72

73
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.370
so if our Builder pattern doesn't pass in something, that's not going to get overridden so that came
73

74
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.500
in as a null so let's try this again
74

75
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.900
So the creation worked.
75

76
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.960
but process did not work.
76

77
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.560
I have a problem in the tests that I wrote. There should be a redirect
77

78
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.510
where we run our failing tests
78

79
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.240
ownerId
79

80
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.840
Let's take a look at that PetController.
80

81
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.570
Yeah no should be that.
81

82
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.710
There we go. So now are we in the code for the new form.
82

83
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.080
And now let's handle the update and we'll come back over here to Pet Clinic and steal more of their code.
83

84
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.490
So we'll come to this,
84

85
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.700
petId petId so we can actually get rid of this.
85

86
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.400
So
86

87
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.350
I'm going to refactor this because we really don't need that pet object. We can just do that.
87

88
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.290
Get rid of that all together. Clean that up a little bit.
88

89
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.430
I'm going to be consistent and just use Model.
89

90
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.810
And that's addAttribute.
90

91
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.100
I can see different generations of Spring in some of this code here.
91

92
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.050
And Pet, BindingResult, 
92

93
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.010
Model. We can make that model.
93

94
00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.710
That looks OK and then owner.
94

95
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.500
And see it they named their PetService pets.
95

96
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.230
I think that's confusing.
96

97
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.510
So let's come in here and say our petService.
97

98
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.700
I think that's a little bit cleaner.
98

99
00:08:51.870 --> 00:09:02.290
And then again this is going to be owners plus owner dot getId().
99

100
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.660
Let's go ahead and run and run the failing test again.
100

101
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.760
Both are unhappy still.
101

102
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.930
For 404 so
102

103
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.380
take a look at that test. That should be
103

104
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.470
owners ownerId.
104

105
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.680
pets pets
105

106
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.080
pets petId.
106

107
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.600
So that's my mistake there.
107

108
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.240
I'm going to call petId 2
108

109
00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:04.010
and also here in this we are going to have to mock out the petService as well on our test. We minimize
109

110
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.280
this and let's split this.
110

111
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.490
We're having the same problem there with the pet builder.
111

112
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.660
Oh here
112

113
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.690
should be think.
113

114
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.080
So let's take a look at the Pet and we can see that we have to build around that.
114

115
00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.530
But it extends out the BaseEntity
115

116
00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.040
so let's come in here, add a constructor
116

117
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.910
like so. We'll get rid of the Builder.
117

118
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.960
Here we'll add the Builder.
118

119
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.560
like so. So that sets up our Builder pattern and now that is there.
119

120
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.250
So that property gets added.
120

121
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.760
And that's the update form and
121

122
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:40.820
controller and the petService will get saved there so here. So the process of update does save.
122

123
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.160
And this should be a redirect as well.
123

124
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.190
Now let's go ahead and run our test.
124

125
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.270
Ok.
125

126
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.410
You can see all the tests are passing.
126

127
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.240
Let's make sure that everything is passing and we have to run all tests.
127

128
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:16.570
Ok everything's in the green. Let's start up pet clinic and test out the application.
128

129
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.710
So we're up and running.
129

130
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.710
Let's go over to Chrome.
130

131
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.980
It's working.
131

132
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:47.820
Find owners. I get Michael. Let's add in new pet and kaboom. So let's take a look at that.
132

133
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:57.720
So here we're getting invalid type model Pet. Let's take a look at Pet. And I bet it's because I named
133

134
00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.440
it petType.
134

135
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:06.940
So let's go and fix that form.
135

136
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.140
Trying to find the line number.
136

137
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.750
It's not that big. We'll be able to find it here.
137

138
00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.110
Looking for the line number where this popped up.
138

139
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.110
So rebuilding the project here.
139

140
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.850
There you go. Let's try this again.
140

141
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.770
Owner null null
141

142
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.920
Another 500 error. This video is getting a little long.
142

143
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:20.490
I going to log these errors and address this in a different video so
143

144
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.180
yeah
144

145
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:30.110
So we got a couple of problems here. so I am going to log in the error.
145

146
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.310
So let's go ahead and commit this right now. We're going to call this done.
146

147
00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.220
So I'm going to say that we added the ability. I'm going to close out this video
147

148
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.390
and that's where will say that was number 56
148

149
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.980
and I'll say push that as well.
149

150
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.890
I could see I have three commits against this.
150

151
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.910
And then the last one actually closes it. So I'm 
151

152
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.490
going to go ahead and do that.
