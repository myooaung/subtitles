00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:03.847
(light guitar music)
1

2
00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:06.917
Okay, one thing I wanna re-factor here
2

3
00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:08.194
and I think it's a good opportunity for us
3

4
00:00:08.194 --> 00:00:11.480
to take a look at how the annotation @ModelAttribute
4

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.103
is being used, and this is an attribute
5

6
00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:17.447
that is being applied on an inbound request
6

7
00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:19.549
but we can also utilize this for outbound
7

8
00:00:19.549 --> 00:00:23.589
to provide a common attribute that we want in the model.
8

9
00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.551
And we have the UnitOfMeasureService
9

10
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.641
binding to uomList in at least three
10

11
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:29.893
different places now, so this has kind of become
11

12
00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:32.285
a common property that we want to utilize.
12

13
00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:35.640
So what we can do is set up a method for that.
13

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.032
Let's see here, public...
14

15
00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:40.282
This is gonna be a Flux,
15

16
00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:45.775
UnitOfMeasureCommand, if I remember right,
16

17
00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:50.176
let's double check that,
17

18
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:52.695
that is a UnitOfMeasureCommand coming back from that.
18

19
00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:55.695
I'm gonna steal this guy right here.
19

20
00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:05.791
So now we just have a method that's gonna return back that,
20

21
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.791
now we can annotate it with the @ModelAttribute.
21

22
00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:13.349
And we'll give it that name,
22

23
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.234
uomList,
23

24
00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.831
so now with every request this is gonna be bound to that.
24

25
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.954
And so we can go back here and clean this up,
25

26
00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:27.172
so we're gonna get rid of this code.
26

27
00:01:27.172 --> 00:01:28.422
Get rid of him.
27

28
00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.525
Just scanning through here,
28

29
00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:33.487
make sure that we don't have it anywhere else so
29

30
00:01:33.487 --> 00:01:35.136
we're getting rid of that duplicate code
30

31
00:01:35.136 --> 00:01:37.225
in three different places and replacing it with
31

32
00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:39.808
this one method here, so again,
32

33
00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:42.042
this is a property name that's
33

34
00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:44.469
gonna bind the output of this method too.
34

35
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.071
And this is gonna run with every request
35

36
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.997
so that every time we get a Model being returned
36

37
00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:52.038
to the view layer, we are gonna populate a property
37

38
00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:53.629
called uomList and it's gonna use
38

39
00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:56.346
that unitOfMeasureService, so let's go ahead
39

40
00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:58.679
and run our application now.
40

41
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.754
We'll make sure that it's still working.
41

42
00:02:06.237 --> 00:02:09.198
Let's toggle over to Chrome.
42

43
00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:13.365
We see that my failure is still there from the last video.
43

44
00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.402
So now we have that, let's go over here and view,
44

45
00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:20.574
View the ingredients, Update it,
45

46
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.804
and we can see that the UOM is still there
46

47
00:02:22.804 --> 00:02:24.510
so exactly as we expected.
47

48
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.194
That is now getting populated.
48

49
00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:27.622
So, we removed that redundant code,
49

50
00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:29.886
got it into a centralized method,
50

51
00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:31.941
so a little bit cleaner and if we had
51

52
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.667
more complex methods to utilize, we could do so.
52

53
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.917
So just a quick recap here.
53

54
00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:43.270
So we got rid of, in the individual controller methods
54

55
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.137
we got rid of this model.addAttribute, uomList,
55

56
00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:49.192
and now we are using the @ModelAttribute,
56

57
00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:51.502
same... same @ModelAttribute annotation
57

58
00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.220
that we're using here for things
58

59
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.194
coming in to controller methods,
59

60
00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:57.783
now we're annotating it at the method level,
60

61
00:02:57.783 --> 00:03:00.813
giving it a name, and it's gonna populate
61

62
00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.483
that property on the model uomList
62

63
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.260
a Flux of unit of measures,
63

64
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.618
so now this is one common place.
64

65
00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:09.799
A lot cleaner, and I also wanna point out that
65

66
00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.110
this is not WebFlux specific,
66

67
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.536
this also works under regular Spring MVC
67

68
00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:17.137
so if you do get a need where you have a common
68

69
00:03:17.137 --> 00:03:20.439
model attribute that you want to be adding to your Model
69

70
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.606
for your view layer, this is a real handy way to do that.
