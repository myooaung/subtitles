00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.610
Alright! In this video, we are going to go
ahead and implement the layout on the
1

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.809
owners page, the list page. And I'm not
sure if the Spring guys has actually
2

3
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.490
implemented this page but we'll use it
to go forward. And If I come here to our
3

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.890
pet clinic, if I go to source main 
resources templates. And We can see under
4

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.720
owners,
yeah, they actually do have an owner's
5

6
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.550
list. We're just going to go ahead
and take that template here. And again
6

7
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.660
this is that common layout, so we're
applying the common layout to that.
7

8
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.270
Let's go ahead and come back over here
to IntelliJ. Close down the messages
8

9
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.840
and fragments. We are working with
owners. Up here, let's go ahead and
9

10
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.699
add that, like so. So now, that's going to
tell Thymeleaf to apply that layout
10

11
00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.840
template, that common layout template
that we're going to be using. Let's come
11

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.840
back over here and take a look at this.
They are using h2 for owners. Let's
12

13
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.570
go ahead and we'll make this h2.
13

14
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.000
This time, they did not implement a
common message property there. You can
14

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.010
see that we could implement that if we
wanted to. I'm not going say that's wrong.
15

16
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.070
Table ID of vets.
That looks like a typo. It looks like
16

17
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.400
somebody did a cut-and-paste there. 
We'll let the Spring guys get away
17

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.090
with that one but we do want to steal
this class assignment, table and table
18

19
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.420
striped, those are bootstrap CSS classes,
so we'll go ahead and apply those. You can
19

20
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.520
see that goes to the table tag.
20

21
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.340
Let's see here. We're doing table head, table
row, and there's a some styling.
21

22
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.130
I'll follow their styling here. I'm
not a big fan of inline styles like that
22

23
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.130
but we'll go ahead and do what they are
doing there from the Spring guys.
23

24
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.899
We'll copy this. Okay, we don't have.
They're down is a little bit
24

25
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.390
different, so we'll have that as a
upcoming to do so. Let's make these. I'm
25

26
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.250
just going to implement these like that.
For right now, we might apply some
26

27
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.600
styling changes coming up.
27

28
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290
Let's see here.
28

29
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.920
You can see here, we're building a
link. I will get into that in a different
29

30
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.750
video. Right now, I'm just looking at
applying the styling. We do have some
30

31
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.349
address properties, which we do not have.
We have not implemented so we'll go
31

32
00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.519
ahead and plan on doing those. Then
you can also see here, we have not built
32

33
00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.049
up that pet relationship. We do have
more work to do on this page for right
33

34
00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.900
now, but I want to make sure I'm applying
the standard template, so let's go ahead.
34

35
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.659
I want to see if this works. If I
build the project.
35

36
00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.640
You can see that Spring is restarting
because we did change that template so
36

37
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.610
the dev tools are installed and working.
Let's come back over here.
37

38
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.150
Now, we can see that we have a list
of owners, Fiona and Michael. You can
38

39
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.440
see how this is formatted nicely. We did
pick up all the styling so that tells us
39

40
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.180
that it's working. That was the
objective of this issue was to get the
40

41
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.350
master layout working to the owners list
and obviously we do have more that we
41

42
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.760
want to be doing here. We'll evolve
that in upcoming videos, but right now,
42

43
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.390
I'm just going through the different
pages that we have in applying those
43

44
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.370
styles. I'm going to go ahead and
commit this. That was number 20.
44

45
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.930
I'll close that and push that up to
45

46
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.900
GitHub, and that is pushed.
