Alright! Earlier in this section, what
we did is we looked at setting up a
1

2
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.230
banner and let me run this application
real quick here. This are our Spring Pet
2

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
Clinic and the banner is this little
Spring moment that comes up. Let me
3

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.199
scroll back up there once it's done.
So earlier in this course, I showed you
4

5
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.480
how we can set a banner dot text
properties to provide that ASCII art. Now
5

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.430
we came a little bit more fun with that.
In the backdrop on this, I looked into
6

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
the actual issue request a little
comically. The Spring team they added
7

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.089
the capability to take an image file and
convert it to ASCII text. So I guess
8

9
00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.750
there's that actually tools out there.
They'll take any old image and convert
9

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.760
to ASCII text. I thought it'd be fun
to show you that little feature here.
10

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.940
I am going to use a picture of vizsla.
If you guys know me well, this is my
11

12
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
puppy here that is Jake. He's a little
grayer now that's a few years old but
12

13
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.890
I'm a little partial to the vizsla bread.
They are just striking dogs. And what
13

14
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.520
we're going to do is we're going to take
this image here and use that for our
14

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.180
banner. I'm going to show you how to
configure that right now. So let me jump
15

16
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.090
back over to IntelliJ.
What we want to do is we want to
16

17
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.530
take that image and put it in the
resources, so remember we have the Spring
17

18
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.909
Clinic Data. What we need is come down to
our web project. I'm going to open this
18

19
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.009
up and just take the resources. 
What I want to do is I want to take that
19

20
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.180
image. I'm going to drag and drop it from
a different window. I'm just going to
20

21
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.670
plunk it right into resources.
I'm going to say OK.
21

22
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.570
I'm going to add that in to Git so this
is just a small image file. That is the one I
22

23
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.170
just showed you.
To configure it, what we want to do
23

24
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.470
is come here and you can see right there
at the top
24

25
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.160
Spring Banner image location. Right
there at the top, I'm going to do vizsla.jpg.
25

26
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:10.869
Now let me go ahead and restart
this. We will see the Spring logo there
26

27
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.970
get replaced as it restarts
27

28
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.280
and now we can see it's been replaced
with a image or ASCII art of that image.
28

29
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.280
So not the best rendition there.
The very simple thing that we can do
29

30
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.230
obviously, it's very rudimentary on how
it does the conversions. You want a
30

31
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.010
pretty simple image to drop in there.
Obviously a picture probably isn't going
31

32
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.450
to do that much for you. But now we
have a picture of a somewhat of a dog
32

33
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.010
not as good as the original image.
Let's toggle over here, take a quick
33

34
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.459
peek so you can see how this image here
was converted to ASCII art. Not the most
34

35
00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.970
accurate thing because we are dealing
with ASCII art but it could be a fun
35

36
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.760
thing that you can do. Just something that you can
keep in the back of mind if you want to
36

37
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.330
change that start up banner for whatever
reason to customize a spring boot app. You
37

38
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.190
can either do a ASCII art text file or
you can take a jpg. Thanks to somebody
38

39
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.650
that wanted to add this feature to
Spring Boot.
