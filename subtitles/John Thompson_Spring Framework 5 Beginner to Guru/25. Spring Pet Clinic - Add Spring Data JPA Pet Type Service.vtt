00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.870
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and tackle the Spring Data JPA pet
1

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.219
service, our pet type service, I mean to
say so. Number 42.
2

3
00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.380
I'm going to toggle over to IntelliJ
and we'll start tackling this. I'm going
3

4
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
to collapse the model directory. What
we are going to do is PetTypeMapService
4

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.400
You know, I'm going to go
split-screen here, so I have the original
5

6
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.890
map implementation up top, and down
bottom, we are going to go ahead and
6

7
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
start working on the implementation. 
I'm going to come in here and say a new
7

8
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.100
Java class. We'll follow the same
naming conventions so PetTypeService PetType Spring Data SD
8

9
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.820
JpaService.
9

10
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.820
Again, I'm just going to follow this one
as a template. We'll grab the service
10

11
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.339
and profile.
I have a couple more of these to
11

12
00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.060
implement. It's large like cookie cutter.
If you want to skip ahead, I have no
12

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.090
problem with that at all. I'm kind of
showing the same things, but some people
13

14
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.409
like to to see everything coded out so
I'm going to code out all these on video.
14

15
00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.310
But if you're getting bored with this, it
will not offend me if you want to skip
15

16
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.520
ahead a couple videos. The next two or
three videos are going to be fairly
16

17
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.430
cookie cutter. So now, we want to come in
here and add in the repository, so I do
17

18
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.390
private final
PetTypeRepository
18

19
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.290
and add in the constructor, which is going
to take in single parameter. We want
19

20
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.560
to implement this PetTypeService, so
let's come down here.
20

21
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.320
That is the interface. Just a
reminder, we have variants of the CRUD
21

22
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.270
service for each of our domain types.
We are going to be implementing those
22

23
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.580
services and then later we'll be able to
allow Spring to pick which
23

24
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.490
implementation we want. So now, we want to
return back. Remember here, we have the
24

25
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.340
Set. Just create a new HashSet and then
we iterate over the result set from find
25

26
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.340
all. So let's go ahead and delete this.
26

27
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.670
Set PetType
petTypes equals
27

28
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.200
new HashSet, and now, we want to say
petTypeRepository
28

29
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.330
findAll
forEach and we are going to say petTypes
29

30
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:47.610
clinical add for a method
reference. Now we can return back pet
30

31
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.020
Types like so. Add a 
semicolon there and clean up some of
31

32
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.620
that wide space.
petType
32

33
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:04.290
Repository find by ID. That's going to take in
the parameter aLong or else
33

34
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.050
null. So if findById doesn't return back
a value, we are going to return back null
34

35
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.160
because the find by ID as a reminder
their turns back an optional.
35

36
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.970
Now we say petTypeRepository save.
We can implement
36

37
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.830
the delete method,
37

38
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330
and then finally
also implement
38

39
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.180
deleteById which is going to take an
39

40
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.270
ID value aLong and that implements
everything that we needed. You get
40

41
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.520
red squiggly there. Which aren't you
happy about?
41

42
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.730
Had extra equal sign there. So now, that
we'll be happy and that was issue number
42

43
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.660
42 so we'll go ahead and commit and
close out that issue.
43

44
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.970
I'll get this up into a GitHub
for you guys.
