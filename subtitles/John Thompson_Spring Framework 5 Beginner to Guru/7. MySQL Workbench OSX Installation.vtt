00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.139
Okay! In this video, we are going to look
at installing MySQL Workbench on OS X.
1

2
00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.500
I have brought up the MySQL website.
You can see there on the screen. This
2

3
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.109
is like the main page for MySQL
Workbench. Version 6.3 is current and at
3

4
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.680
the time of recording. If there's
something newer, go ahead
4

5
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
and use that. You might see some
differences in screens but it is a
5

6
00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.410
pretty stable product. So, I don't
expect this will again evolve too much going
6

7
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.920
forward. But, they may change things on us.
So, I'm going to come in here and click
7

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.770
on the Download Now button. You can see
this takes me to the downloads page.
8

9
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.180
I want to use macOS, or OS X, as I like
to say. This can bring down an archive
9

10
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.170
that I will be able to use. I'm going to
click download, and you'll see the screen
10

11
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.080
here, it's asking you to setup an Oracle
account. You do not need to do that. You
11

12
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.200
can come in here and say no thanks just
start my download. That kind of hide
12

13
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.290
it at the bottom, making you think that
you need an account, but you actually
13

14
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.990
don't. So, I'm going to go say no thanks just
start my download. You can see that
14

15
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.880
this is downloading. It goes by pretty
quick. I'm going to be able to click on
15

16
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
this guy right here, launch it. It
will bring it up and will complete the
16

17
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.710
installation process here, so it goes
through verifying the image. If
17

18
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.759
you're familiar with OS X, you can see
this is pretty standard stuff. So, I'm
18

19
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
just going to click and drag this into
applications. You can see that it
19

20
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.920
does should copy it over. You can see, I have
quite a few applications here. There
20

21
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.829
is the MySQL Workbench app. I'm going to
go ahead and launch that. You can see the
21

22
00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.610
first time that we launch it, we're going to
get a warning that says that we just
22

23
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
downloaded it from the internet. We know
that we did this. We can see that came
23

24
00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.550
from dev.mysql.com, and we can say
safely open that just a little security
24

25
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.370
warning from
my Mac OS, or OS X as many people like to
25

26
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.620
say. I still say OS X, but I think Apple is
official calling it Mac OS. Now, you
26

27
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.170
can see the initial screen here, and you can see
MySQL connections. You might not have
27

28
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.190
this. It's probably because I've used it
before. You may need to add a localhost.
28

29
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.550
So, I think you will. So, if you just go in
and add in a hostname of 127.0.0.1
29

30
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.160
and port 3306, username
of root and we'll go ahead and store it
30

31
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.610
in a keychain. Now, I'm going to cancel
this and use my existing connection.
31

32
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.590
It's asking me for that. I
believe this is going to be your operating
32

33
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.310
system password to take it off the
keychain. So now, we've gone ahead and
33

34
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.489
opened up the MySQL editor. A couple
couple things here, we can see we have a
34

35
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.230
variety of things to look at here. We
have the server status. You can see information
35

36
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.140
about the MySQL server and this is for
my system running the current version
36

37
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.420
and versions that I have installed. So,
yours might be slightly different. We
37

38
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.459
can see things like clients and
connections. There are connections
38

39
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.610
out there. These are processes that are
going to be running by the MySQL server.
39

40
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.920
One of them is ours. So, what you see may
be different depending on what's going
40

41
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.500
on in the system users. We just have that
root and then these two mysaql.
41

42
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.350
accounts, which you should never have to
log into, so don't worry about those.
42

43
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.090
We will be getting into data import and
export so later. Then, you have
43

44
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.310
administration functions, which we will
be exploring later in the course.
44

45
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.830
The important thing here is the
schemas. Only sys is shown. Remember, we
45

46
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.750
had a mysql schema displayed before. It
looks like that
46

47
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.380
in the GUI tool. They are filtering out
some of the low-lying schemas, so we will
47

48
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.039
be creating schemas in the future. 
Just a slight terminology change, when we
48

49
00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.530
were on the command line, they were
called databases. In
49

50
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.970
here, they're called schemas. So, same
thing. Slightly different concept but
50

51
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.220
just effectively the same thing. So, this
is going to be effectively a separate
51

52
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.270
database or schema that we will be
looking at. Don't don't worry if
52

53
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.590
you're confused. We will be exploring
this for you in the course going forward.
53

54
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.020
But here, we have the sys schema. We
can see here, if I expand out, this has a
54

55
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.520
number of tables in here. I can come in
here. We should be able to double
55

56
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.100
click on that. I thought I could. Select
rows. There we go. I just did a select
56

57
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.800
row. So, that shows me what's in
that table. And again, we do have a MySQL
57

58
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.250
schema but this is being hidden from us.
So, you can see here it did select star
58

59
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:25.720
from sys dot sys config. If I change
this to mysql dot users, remember we did this
59

60
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.320
from the command line before, run that,
60

61
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.200
it doesn't exist. I thought that
would work. I took a brief pause there
61

62
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.120
to look and see what it's doing wrong.
I'm actually doing user rather than
62

63
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.330
than users. So now, we get that data. I
also took a quick look at some of the
63

64
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:57.640
options here. Something I had not
noticed before, if we have this here, the
64

65
00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.320
system, only the sys, if I come up here to
file,
65

66
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.370
I'm sorry preferences, if I go to the SQL
editor, and we have show metadata and
66

67
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.039
internal schemas, I click there and say
ok, and then come over here and refresh,
67

68
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.479
now we see that mysql schema is actually
showing our database. As we said before,
68

69
00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.610
when we're with command-line. So, these
are internal schemas that are going to
69

70
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.930
be used by the MySQL database. There are
some useful things in there, but
70

71
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.729
generally, you should not be playing in
here for general databases. We will
71

72
00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.990
create our own schemas and utilize those
and kind of segment that off. So, these
72

73
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.710
are things that are internal to MySQL.
If you go in there and start
73

74
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.000
changing data, you can really cause
yourself a lot of headaches to the point
74

75
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.560
of corrupting the database and making it
unusable. So, definitely do not be playing
75

76
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.950
in the side of these schemas if you do
not know what you're doing. So, just a
76

77
00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:01.190
word of advise. These is
from experience. The would be honest. But, going
77

78
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.880
forward in the course, we will be
creating our own schemas and populating
78

79
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.680
data in those and using those. I will
show you how to use, do this step by step
79

80
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.000
coming up in the course.
