(gentle music)
1

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.503
Okay, in this video we're gonna look
2

3
00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:10.670
at the configuration to set up code coverage using Code Cov,
3

4
00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:13.480
I think that's how you say it, the website.
4

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.505
So what we want to do is in our CI builds,
5

6
00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:18.364
is to start generating code coverage.
6

7
00:00:18.364 --> 00:00:20.741
And it's slightly different than the Maven configuration,
7

8
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.492
because we are using Gradle here
8

9
00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:24.855
and we had to change a couple minor things.
9

10
00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.903
So the first thing that we need to do is in Gradle,
10

11
00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:31.987
on line 19 here, is to apply the plugin for jacoco.
11

12
00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:36.816
So that is going to give us the code coverage capabilities.
12

13
00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:39.541
And then the next thing that we need to do
13

14
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.548
is come down here and export the test coverage.
14

15
00:00:43.548 --> 00:00:47.909
So you do have a Gradle goal of jacocoTestReport,
15

16
00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.508
and this is gonna enable the reports
16

17
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.159
for the XML and HTML reports,
17

18
00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.301
so we want those getting exported.
18

19
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:57.221
Now the next that we need to do
19

20
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:01.388
is just a real small change here in our CircleCI.
20

21
00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.972
What's important here is that we are running the Gradle goal
21

22
00:01:06.972 --> 00:01:09.151
of jacocoTestReport,
22

23
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.789
and you can see that there on line 42.
23

24
00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.002
And then finally that's gonna run normally,
24

25
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.707
but what we wanna do here on line 57
25

26
00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:21.494
is call this comand here
26

27
00:01:21.494 --> 00:01:24.744
to get the test reports up to CodeCov.
27

28
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.728
So this is a command to do that.
28

29
00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:29.506
It's a little bash, it's a curl script,
29

30
00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.470
and it kind of is like a webhook essentially,
30

31
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.889
that says "Hey, go get the test results here."
31

32
00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.218
And then we can see that over here
32

33
00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.248
and this here is actually in CodeCov,
33

34
00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.002
I think that's how they say it,
34

35
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:47.033
codecov.io, however they say that,
35

36
00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.350
and then this gives us our code coverage
36

37
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.122
that we can see and right now
37

38
00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:55.380
we can go in and see our coverage.
38

39
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.852
So 100%, that's pretty solid.
39

40
00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:02.806
General rule of thumb, like to get in between 75% to 90%.
40

41
00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:06.294
You can go overboard with it, but obviously our services,
41

42
00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:08.048
they probably could use some help.
42

43
00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:10.913
Yeah, our ingredient and services could use
43

44
00:02:10.913 --> 00:02:12.498
a little better test coverage there,
44

45
00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:15.010
but overall, we've got pretty good coverage in our project,
45

46
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.372
so maybe we'll look at adding some test in that
46

47
00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:19.182
in the very near future.
47

48
00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:21.257
Now, the other thing is
48

49
00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:24.018
we do have the code coverage badge here.
49

50
00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:26.408
I'm gonna show you how to get that as well.
50

51
00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:30.575
You come in here, and go to project, and go to Settings,
51

52
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:35.246
and then you can click on Badge,
52

53
00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.226
and this gives you the different options there,
53

54
00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:39.574
so you can literally just copy to your clipboard
54

55
00:02:39.574 --> 00:02:43.407
and then come over and go to your README file,
55

56
00:02:45.892 --> 00:02:47.789
and it is this line on line 3
56

57
00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.288
that is giving the CodeCov badge
57

58
00:02:50.288 --> 00:02:52.955
there in your GitHub repository.
