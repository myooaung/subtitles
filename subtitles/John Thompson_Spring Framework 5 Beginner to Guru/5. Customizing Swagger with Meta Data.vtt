00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.210
Okay! You can see that we still have our
Swagger API documentation up here, and
1

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
there's a lot of control that we have
over to setting this up. So, let's add in
2

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
some, what I'm gonna call, metadata. So,
metadata is literally a phrase that
3

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.970
means data about data. So, we are gonna
add in metadata about our API. So what we
4

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.529
wanna do is customize this stuff up
here. That's a API documentation here. So,
5

6
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
we're gonna make that a little more
specific. And the way we do this, let me
6

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.450
come back over to IntelliJ, is we have two
objects that we're gonna be looking
7

8
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.960
at, one is the AppInfo, and this allows
us to set the title, description, version,
8

9
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.840
the termsOfServiceUrl, contact
information and whatnot. So, that gives
9

10
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.829
our API a lot more meaning, or the API
documentation a lot more meaning. And
10

11
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.949
then, this has an object in it for
Contact. Pretty simple object, just name,
11

12
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.210
url, and email. And I'm gonna show you
how to set that up in our Swagger
12

13
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.360
Configuration. So, I've actually typed
this out, and go over here and copy it. I
13

14
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.810
don't think you wanna see me type in
everything here. So, go ahead and paste
14

15
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.470
that in, and go ahead and import the
class. And one thing, you wanna be
15

16
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.020
careful of here, on this one, it's
actually several contexts here. And
16

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.329
within Swagger, we want this
documentation service one, not the model.
17

18
00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.549
I'm not quite sure why there's two of
18

19
00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.009
them.
Oh it looks like we have a older models
19

20
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.350
coming in. So, maybe a possible, some
possible garbage in our Maven
20

21
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.579
configuration, because we are getting a
1.5.3. So, it looks probably
21

22
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.590
deprecated. So let's take this one, and
bring that in, and we'll get him imported.
22

23
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.950
So now, we have this metadata. What we
wanna do is come up here, say apiInfo.
23

24
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.009
You know, just do the metaData and load
that up, so that that sets up our Swagger
24

25
00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.860
Docket with our metadata, the data about
our API application.
25

26
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.390
And now, let's go ahead and run the
Spring Boot application. Yeah he'd stop.
26

27
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.590
So, let's go ahead and start him back up.
And got an error.
27

28
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.290
oops.
Small typo there. Now that should
28

29
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.110
be happy. Let's go ahead and try to start this up
again. Now, we are up and almost running.
29

30
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.760
There we are. Come over here and do a
refresh. Now, we can see Spring Framework
30

31
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.430
Guru Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru and
we see that would take me back
31

32
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
over there. You can see that, it
actually sets up my mail, and then, we do
32

33
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.820
the Apache License on this one. And then,
we still have our setup for our various
33

34
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.860
API URLs, and we do have a lot more
control over that. We'll get into
34

35
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.709
configuring some of the data around this
in the next video.
