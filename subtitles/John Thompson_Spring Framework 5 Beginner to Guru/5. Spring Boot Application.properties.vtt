00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.189
Alright, in this module we are going to
go in and refactor our little
1

2
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.870
application or demo application
here to use the Spring Boot 
2

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
application.properties file. Now this is the
default properties file that is utilized
3

4
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.510
by Spring Boot. I'm showing the other
examples because I want you to see which you
4

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.830
probably see in legacy applications. If
you started off with the pure Spring
5

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
Boot application, chances are, you're
going to be utilising application.properties
6

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.500
and it's a pretty easy
refactor. We're going to refactor things
7

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
into it. Typically you're going to be
using this to set Spring Boot specific
8

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.430
properties that Spring is configured for
components but in our example here, we
9

10
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.840
can also set our own custom properties
inside of it. So that's very important
10

11
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.649
distinction. You are welcome to put
whatever properties you need in this
11

12
00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.329
file in addition to all the Spring Boot
stuff .So I'm going to toggle over to
12

13
00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.719
IntelliJ now and show you how to
refactor. So we're going to undo the
13

14
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.949
stuff that we did for the properties
files and move that configuration into
14

15
00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.700
the Spring Boot application.properties file. Alright I got our
15

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.790
application up here and what I'm going
to do is refactor it to use the
16

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.000
application.properties file and that
is the default application properties or
17

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.540
the default properties file that is used
by Spring Boot that is automatically
18

19
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.189
wired up for us. So I'm going to go in
and get rid of some of the configuration.
19

20
00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.250
So I'm going to remove this PropertySources. Now as you know that it's there
20

21
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.030
it's something that you can refer to if
you need to source in another properties
21

22
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.360
file. But for this exercise, I'm going to
remove this and we'll start utilising
22

23
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.140
the Spring Boot application.properties file which is automatically
23

24
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
brought in by Spring Boot. So I'm going
to get rid of that and I'm going to
24

25
00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.100
remove these Environment since we're not
using that anymore and we'll go back to
25

26
00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.829
using the guru. username and we need to
get rid of this environment here. Now
26

27
00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.700
that makes that piece happy
and what we can do is come in to our
27

28
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.510
resources. I'll start off with a datasource actually.
28

29
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.920
I'm going to cut that out of there and
I'm going to put it into applications.properties
29

30
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.829
and I want to point out,
as I'm doing this application.properties
30

31
00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.269
is used for all kinds of
Spring Boot configuration settings. It's
31

32
00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.060
quite a few options that we can set in
there but you can also add in your own
32

33
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.590
properties and you can see that IntelliJ
is not happy about because it's not
33

34
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.099
recognising that it's a custom property. So if I come in here, you can see some of
34

35
00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.609
the different things that we can be
setting in here. So these are all Spring
35

36
00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.840
Boot properties that can be set in. There's actually many many more than this.
36

37
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.849
So it's quite a suite of
properties and IntelliJ is giving us a
37

38
00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.690
warning that, hey I don't recognise that
and the application.properties is
38

39
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.260
where you're typically going to be
overwriting Spring Boot values but in
39

40
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.250
this example, we have some custom values
that we want. And now I'm going to go
40

41
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.329
ahead and run this and just to show you
my datasource is empty, my jms is empty,
41

42
00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.790
any PropertyConfig, actually I can get
rid of the PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigure. 
42

43
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.090
So we're going to
lose him as well and now we're going
43

44
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.500
to run this and see that these
properties are getting picked up out of
44

45
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.299
the application.properties file by
SpringBoot. So you can see that I'm
45

46
00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.209
getting the username of John and JMS user
and when we look at the application.properties,
46

47
00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:52.410
we'll see that there's John and JMS
Username. So this is a handy way. If
47

48
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.470
you're using Spring Boot, chances
are, this is where you're going to be
48

49
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.629
defining your properties. I showed you
the property files examples before
49

50
00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.190
because you might be encountering legacy
applications and you'll be defining your
50

51
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.900
properties there and other property
files but if you started a project that
51

52
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.739
is a pure Spring Boot project, chances
are you're going to be wanting to use
52

53
00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.329
the application.properties file. Alright that was a pretty simple refactor.
53

54
00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.979
Not too much going on there but just
remember that application.properties
54

55
00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.130
file is available there by default when
you're using
55

56
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.920
Spring Boot and I moved our custom
properties in there. Some people like to
56

57
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.740
keep things separate but I am okay with
mixing and matching. So I don't think
57

58
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.350
that the Spring Boot specific properties
are that special where you need to move
58

59
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.020
them into their own properties file or circumvent them somehow. So when
59

60
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.150
I'm doing a pure Spring Boot Application,
I'm putting my configuration values
60

61
00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.440
inside of the application.properties
file and not a custom properties file.
