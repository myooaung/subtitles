(mellow guitar music)
1

2
00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.573
All right, I think we've got our feet wet
2

3
00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.366
with Reactive Programming and the Spring Framework.
3

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.575
Now, at this point of the project,
4

5
00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:14.723
we've refactored to use the MongoDB reactive driver,
5

6
00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:17.045
and we're going all the way up to the web layer.
6

7
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:19.802
Now, what's important now, is that web layer,
7

8
00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:22.139
right now, we're still using a server locked container.
8

9
00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.865
Guess what? So I said before, that server locked container
9

10
00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:28.633
is blocking, so we need to refactor things.
10

11
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:30.403
The web tier, we've got a number of things
11

12
00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:31.468
that we're gonna have to take care of
12

13
00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.349
to get rid of the baggage
13

14
00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:35.821
from the traditional Servlet container,
14

15
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.894
and we're gonna move over to the Reactive container.
15

16
00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:39.714
So, we're still gonna stay on Tomcat,
16

17
00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:43.294
but we need to use reactive features inside of Tomcat,
17

18
00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:45.681
so we need to stop using those servlet API
18

19
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.175
which is blocking, which we do not want
19

20
00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.469
and we're gonna get into that in the next chapter,
20

21
00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.397
in the next section of this course.
21

22
00:00:52.397 --> 00:00:54.731
For now, I kind of wanna split things up
22

23
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:56.160
because there's a lot of fun stuff I wanna show you
23

24
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.417
in the next section, but right now,
24

25
00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:01.401
we really focused on the back end so we're going
25

26
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.718
from the database all the way up to controller layer,
26

27
00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:05.049
all that's reactive.
27

28
00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.054
So, we learned a lot in this section.
28

29
00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:07.947
We saw a lot,
29

30
00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:10.364
but there's a lot more to go.
