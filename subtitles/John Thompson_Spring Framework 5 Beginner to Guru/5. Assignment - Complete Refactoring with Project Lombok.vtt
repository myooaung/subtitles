Alright, in this section I have an
assignment for you.
1

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.469
We're going to refactor the project to
use project Lombok. So what we want to do
2

3
00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.600
is refactor the remaining classes to use
the project Lombok and we want to use
3

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.570
@Data on the entities. And I don't think
we have any special methods that we need
4

5
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.160
to watch out for as far as anything that
we modified there previously. But if you
5

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.719
do encounter them be careful with that. Make
sure that we don't do anything that will
6

7
00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.870
customize beyond a simple setter or
getter. Then go ahead and add in the
7

8
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.760
Slf4j annotation and I want
you to add that on the controller and
8

9
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.719
bootstrap class. I think we only have two
classes left there. I did the service
9

10
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.239
class in the last lesson and then we
also want to add in some debug logging.
10

11
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.160
Just add a debug statement just so you
can get used to using that log property.
11

12
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.260
And in the next video I will live code
this exercise for you. A pretty
12

13
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.920
easy one but I want to get you using project Lombok.
