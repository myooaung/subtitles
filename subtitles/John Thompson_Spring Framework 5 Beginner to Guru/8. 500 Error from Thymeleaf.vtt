00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.519
Alright, I'm taking a look at a student
project here. He is getting a 500 error
1

2
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.610
and doesn't know why. I just got a message
from him. It looks like he's having a
2

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
problem with Thymeleaf template, so
I've just forked his repository and open
3

4
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.230
it up and IntelliJ. That's as far as I've
looked at this point. So we're going to go
4

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.590
through a little live coding exercise
and see if we can figure out what's
5

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.029
going on here. So, let's go ahead and
actually run the application. See what we
6

7
00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.489
get. So IntelliJ is starting up right now.
7

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:47.489
Yeah, let's see here. I'm looking for
MySQL. So let's take that quick look
8

9
00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:04.710
here. That's root admin. So let's go ahead
and start up MySQL. Thought I had a MySQL
9

10
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:16.110
instance here, that I could use. Let's pause
this while I get MySQL cooking. Okay, took
10

11
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.509
a second to set up MySQL database in a
Docker container. I had to go in add in a
11

12
00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.520
database of a user, so now we have that
up, and let's go ahead and take a look at
12

13
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.140
the application. It doesn't have any
data loading. So let's take
13

14
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:46.380
a closer look. So it's not getting any
data initialized. Take a look and see why
14

15
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.009
that is...
15

16
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.670
Let's see if its categories and unit of measures got loaded.
16

17
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:07.560
Okay, so categories and unit of measures got loaded but he
doesn't have any recipes loading. Let's
17

18
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:25.110
take a look at the Controller. Recipe new... Create any recipe... okay, so now we have
18

19
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.739
a recipe.
19

20
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:42.239
Now it's problem with ingredients, so
we added ingredients on view. So
20

21
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.590
let's see. It doesn't have any functionality implemented right now for adding ingredients.
21

22
00:02:48.799 --> 00:03:04.079
So a recipe of one. We can go ahead and add
one manually. So we can see that I'm
22

23
00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.079
using Sequel Pro to go in and just
update the record so I'm connecting to
23

24
00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:15.930
the same MySQL database. So let's see if
we actually have that now. Okay, I think
24

25
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.630
this is it.
Line 97 column 41, so that's a problem
25

26
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.109
with the Thymeleaf template. So let's
take a closer look at this inside of
26

27
00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:37.230
IntelliJ now. Now I'm replicating the error that it reported. Property umo. Let's
27

28
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:46.010
take a closer look at this. domain, Ingredient.
28

29
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.730
umo but he has uom. So it looks like
that's a problem with the template. Let's
29

30
00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:12.050
go ahead and fix that. Looks like just a
typo. Line 97 so it's got to get him out.
30

31
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:27.210
Yeah let's go ahead and going to restart
this. I got that. Let's go here. See if we
31

32
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:40.230
can fix this uom. So he does have a getDescription there. No
32

33
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:53.580
property. Lets double check this on Ingredient. Okay, so he's got this. Problem
33

34
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.960
is that there's no getter or setter for
it, so just looking through there, so I've
34

35
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:09.180
come in. So now we have to getUom. Now
let's double check this template here. And
35

36
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.120
it should be, I'll just use
description. You shouldn't have to...
36

37
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.770
I think you can optionally use.
37

38
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.490
So you can use the dot navigation there.
And let's go ahead and restart this.
38

39
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.850
See if this works now. Back up and
running, so come over here, hit a refresh,
39

40
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.760
and there we are. So it's now rendering
properly. So ultimately the main problem
40

41
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.710
was two things, two faults, had a typo
here in umo
41

42
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.660
rather than uom and that getDescription probably would work too. But
42

43
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.150
I just preferred to use the no strict
dot notation. And then the other problem
43

44
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.470
was UnitOfMeasure,
I'm sorry, Ingredient
44

45
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.740
and the uom property but it didn't have
the getters and setters. So between that,
45

46
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.930
obviously, you can't access a private
property without getters and setters, so
46

47
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.860
that's why that was failing even
without the typo. So a couple of
47

48
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.120
minor errors there and now we're
clearing things up. I'm going to go in.
48

49
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.410
I'll commit this into GitHub and send
the student in a pull request so that
49

50
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.280
they can see the problem.
