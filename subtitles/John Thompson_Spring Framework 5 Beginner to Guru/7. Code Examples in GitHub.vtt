00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.269
Okay one thing I want to point out to
you as I do these code examples what
1

2
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.830
I'm going to provide you in the
course resources for every module where
2

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.289
applicable I will give you a beginning
and an ending source code and I think
3

4
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.220
this is important so you can see my
progress as things move along you can go
4

5
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
through and follow out the examples and
sometimes if you miss something very
5

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.960
simple like in this one if you missed
the application.properties setting
6

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.880
it wouldn't mess you up. So this way
you can get the two different
7

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
branches and do a compare on them and
see what's different and and you can
8

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.550
also compare it to your code as well so
we have compare tools of that so in
9

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
every example wherever possible I try to
give you both of the beginning and
10

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
ending and the way I do this, I am using
branches inside of git and you can see
11

12
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.789
down here inside of IntelliJ I
started off on branch but now I'm
12

13
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.960
working on a new branch called JPA entities and what I'm going to do is I'm
13

14
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.270
going to check this in right now into
Git for you and go ahead and Commit
14

15
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.150
Directory and I'm going to say add a JPA
example and we'll go ahead and commit
15

16
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.659
and push that and I'm going to be bad
and skip that. Wrong button.
16

17
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.860
Commit and push and I'm going to say it go ahead
and commit rather than review so I don't
17

18
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.180
go through that and I'm going to go
ahead and push it up there. I don't have
18

19
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.860
to do a pull because I am the only one
that has access to that repository. So
19

20
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.650
I'm using this all for you so that is
now pushed up to github and now we can
20

21
00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.040
see that we have the JPA entities has
been pushed there so a branch master and
21

22
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.970
that hasn't quite got caught up yet but
now I can click on here
22

23
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.610
and now this is the ending source code
from that last video that we did on
23

24
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.930
adding them to the JPA entities so this
way you can do compare and contrast and
24

25
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.520
get that so when you are following along
be very careful to make sure that you're
25

26
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.270
on the right branch what I'd like to see
people do is check out the starting one
26

27
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.480
and then try and go through the coding
exercise because you really do get the
27

28
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.430
the most benefit out of that but the one
problem that trips up people that are
28

29
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.209
new with git is not check out and what
happens is by default you get the master
29

30
00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.050
branch so you check out that and you
might not see all the changes if you
30

31
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.520
forget to switch over to the proper
branch so just one potential gotcha
31

32
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.070
using github once you get comfortable
using git and it's an old tool like it is
32

33
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.810
for me you'll be just fine but this way
that I think it's a pretty powerful tool
33

34
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.800
for you as a student learning spring to
see the beginning and ending source code.
