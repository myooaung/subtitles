Okay we are going to take a quick look at
Firebug. Now that this is a Firefox
1

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.340
extension that has been around forever
and I have it installed now and I am
2

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.170
going to go ahead and activate it and it
comes up to the HTML tag by default. You
3

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.439
can see as I'm going through, it's
highlighting the different sections of
4

5
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.820
the code. So just don't have too much
going on this page. So not a lot of
5

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.489
interesting activity there for us to
look at. This does also have CSS tabs,
6

7
00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.719
JavaScript, but we don't have a
JavaScript here. A DOM Explorer which is
7

8
00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.940
handy if we're doing a lot of JavaScript
stuff and then also the net tab. You can
8

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.780
see that is blank but if I come in and
refresh the page, we'll get some data. We
9

10
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
can see that it went out and made that
single request. Now I am recording this
10

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.649
in June of 2017 and took a look out at
the plugin page and it's interesting
11

12
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.019
that Firebug is ending as we know it. So
I know it's a very popular tool. That's
12

13
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.010
why I'm leaving it in for now but we are
going to a Firefox developer edition and
13

14
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.990
the developer edition has some cool
stuff in it.
14

15
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
Very. I mean it looks like some very
powerful tools for serious web
15

16
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.200
developers. So pretty cool stuff there
for that but just to quickly recap
16

17
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.150
the focus on this Firebug. This
plug-in is going to be around for a little while yet.
17

18
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.509
So I'm going to leave this in and the
course for now because it is such a
18

19
00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.520
popular tool set and you do get a
console view, HTML view, see CSS
19

20
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.090
resources. You can actually change CSS
on-the-fly here and stuff like that and
20

21
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.470
also I want to pay special attention to a
request here. So we can see a nice
21

22
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.360
view of what was sent to the server. The
response that we got back. So a simple
22

23
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.689
HTML document. Explore it in HTML mode
and then we can see cache and cookies
23

24
00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.979
and those are kind of advanced topics
that can both get you in trouble at
24

25
00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.890
times. So that is Firebug for
Firefox. Again that is a Firefox
25

26
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.050
extension which seems to be going away. So not sure how much
26

27
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
longer it is going to be around but it's
currently available for
27

28
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.750
current generation of Firefox as of June
of 2017. So it's probably going to be
28

29
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.640
available for a little bit. It's a very
stable tool. Very very popular and I
29

30
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.490
think it became the most popular web
tool for Firefox because Firefox itself
30

31
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.620
did not have native developer tools. So
now that created a whole developer
31

32
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.580
edition and I'm going to check that out
and report back to you on that.
