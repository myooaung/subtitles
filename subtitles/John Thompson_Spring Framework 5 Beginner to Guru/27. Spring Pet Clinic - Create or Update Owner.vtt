00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.620
Alright! In this video, we are going to go
in and add the ability to add or update
1

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.970
an owner. So we go ahead and implement
this. I will assign that to myself. To get
2

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.350
started on it, we're going to be working
with this. What I've done is come
3

4
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.400
over here. Quick code review. So we want
to do an add functionality and an update
4

5
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.820
functionality. Now we're going to be
using the same form. It's this createOr
5

6
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.489
UpdateOwnerForm that we're going to be
utilizing. Both of these actions have
6

7
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.820
they implement it a little bit
differently than what I've done in the
7

8
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.070
past but this will work out well for us.
So we have two processor, so we have an
8

9
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.940
initializer, which for a new situation is
just going to return back an empty owner
9

10
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
object. But in the update action, that's
going to return back the populated
10

11
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.250
owner object that's been requested. So
two different scenarios that we're
11

12
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.869
supporting. And then we both, we need to
do a save of it at the end of the day
12

13
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.210
also. We'll need to implement save
method as well. I've written these
13

14
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.790
tests so I'm going to come in here go
ahead and run this.  I'm expecting
14

15
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.640
that these will fail. Get rid of that
break point because we don't need it.
15

16
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.540
You can see that my update and
create methods did in fact fail as
16

17
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.430
expected. So what we want to do is go in
to our controller and implement that. I'm
17

18
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.550
going to close out some of these that we
don't need. There's are OwnerController.
18

19
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.670
Let's take a look at what Spring
guys did.
19

20
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.280
We have these here that GetMapping and the PostMapping. I'm going to
20

21
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.300
shame lessly steal this and we'll modify
it for this.
21

22
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.970
So let's come in here to IntelliJ OwnerController. Let's come in and add
22

23
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.690
these methods.
So we have the
23

24
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.930
GetMapping. I'm going to take an actual
Model. This is a change from what the
24

25
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.350
Spring guys did. We're going to add an
attribute called owner owner so we have
25

26
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.770
new Owner. I like the Builder pattern
a little bit better.
26

27
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340
I have the String here. Let's take a look
at that. This is the view name.
27

28
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.970
This is actually a habit I like and
probably it would be a good refactoring
28

29
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.300
to make these views static final String.
That's a good habit to get into it.
29

30
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.040
That is an approach that I like. We
could easily refactor some of those too
30

31
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.959
to utilize that. I'm going to change
this code a little bit. Clean this up
31

32
00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.900
because we don't need that
explicitly. We can just do that right
32

33
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.140
here. Get rid of that. I think that's just
a little bit cleaner approach. Then
33

34
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.939
let's set in this PostMapping.
34

35
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.680
And here,
you can see that they are doing a Valid
35

36
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.690
so we are running validation on the
Owner and the BindingResult. Let's
36

37
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.090
see here. If we have errors, what's going to
happen is this is going to return back
37

38
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.150
so that BindingResult will get returned
back as well in Spring MVC and then we
38

39
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.690
can just say
owner
39

40
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.209
Service save owner.
That should work. What I like to do
40

41
00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.770
here is Owner.
41

42
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.210
That's just a little preference of
myself because when you save it, when we
42

43
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.650
go through the save option, we are going
to return back the saved object and then
43

44
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.790
I'm just going to get the ID off of that.
It's really more of a personal
44

45
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.600
preference in how I like to do things.
So we have these here. Now the two
45

46
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.560
creations should drop off, so these two
here. so let's go ahead and rerun the
46

47
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.370
failing tests.
And they all failed
47

48
00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.939
so let's take a look at the creation.
48

49
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.000
So it's saying that we had a type 
conversion error. So owners
49

50
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.289
new. See here so.
I get a closer look at the Owner
50

51
00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.919
Controller.
51

52
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.730
Ah, I see what's happening. So again, I have
owners
52

53
00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:02.120
and what I need to do is get rid of that, like
so. So that is in the mappings. So now,
53

54
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.160
the two creations with the proper
mapping, those passed. Now let's go
54

55
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.160
ahead and implement the stuff for the
actual update. So let's come in and again
55

56
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.940
I'm going to go steal absolutely
shamelessly from what the Spring guys
56

57
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.930
did in theirs and we'll just modify
that. I'm going to show you a couple
57

58
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.930
tricks here as well as we go into that.
58

59
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.810
Again, we get rid of that because we are
declaring that at the class level.
59

60
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.360
So now we have the init form.
60

61
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.000
What we can do here. Going to make this a
little bit cleaner. Service.
61

62
00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:58.060
I really don't need that object so
I'll just get rid of that.
62

63
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.720
Come here.
63

64
00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.540
That's a
cleaner. We're just going to take the
64

65
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.750
model attribute and populate it right
from the ownerService which does in
65

66
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:17.350
fact return back the Owner object.
Let's see here. I believe that
66

67
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.510
is good for the update. Now as far as
processing the post,
67

68
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.160
we have valid Owner BindingResult.
That's going to be a Long as well
68

69
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.440
because our data types a little bit
different, return owners and again I'm
69

70
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.810
going to do...
70

71
00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:45.120
We're going to get rid of that. A little
bit different.
71

72
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.050
Spell that right.
72

73
00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.490
What's happening here is we're going to
come in, we get the ownerId bind.
73

74
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.039
Remember we have our init binder which
is preventing the Model from getting the
74

75
00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:09.219
ID. So there are paths or with the
form variables will all make the get
75

76
00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:12.580
bound to owner
except for ID so that's why we need to
76

77
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.039
explicitly set it which is coming out of
the path. We do that then we're going to
77

78
00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:25.030
save it and then we're going to redirect
to owners and then the ID property. So
78

79
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:30.169
let's go ahead and I think that changes
everything so let's go ahead and do that.
79

80
00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.460
Then there's couple. One more thing I
want to show you here. So that is
80

81
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:42.009
working. Now this PathVariable here, you can
see how we have ownerId. This ownerId
81

82
00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:51.700
ownerId ownerId. Now we can omit this
and also here I believe we can admit
82

83
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.910
that. As long as this String value
matches a property name, pretty sure Path
83

84
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.840
Variable is going to work so let's go
ahead and run this again.
84

85
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.730
You can see that all went through.  
It's a little shortcut. They did add that.
85

86
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:12.040
I think it was in a late release of
Spring 4, if I remember right. Initially
86

87
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.600
you didn't need to declare, if memory
serves me properly. Then again, I can
87

88
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.740
clean that up here as well.
88

89
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.700
Now let's go ahead and run all our tests.
89

90
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.490
You can see that that application test that
brings up the context. That's what's
90

91
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.780
taking so long there and then our
controller tests actually run fairly
91

92
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:43.030
quick, so we are building up our suite of
tests as we develop here. Now let's run
92

93
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.330
the application. Take a look at how that
runs.
93

94
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.649
In theory, it should work but let's make
sure that Thymeleaf is happy with
94

95
00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:56.209
everything being returned because this
is going to test the controller
95

96
00:08:56.209 --> 00:09:00.860
interactions and the views but we are
not testing the Thymeleaf templates here.
96

97
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.529
So let's come over here pet clinic
97

98
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.220
home find owners.
Let's add
98

99
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.470
an owner. Now we're getting a 500
error. That's why we go through the
99

100
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.130
functional test.
100

101
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.339
Let's see here.
101

102
00:09:26.259 --> 00:09:30.030
It was complaining about this owner
new.
102

103
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.450
Line 23.
103

104
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.810
I'm going to pause this a minute and
investigate further because I'm not
104

105
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:49.150
quite sure what we want to do there. So
hold on one second. I know. Give it a
105

106
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:55.390
second. I swear I'm not even moving it's
just doing this on its own. Okay. I took a
106

107
00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.030
moment to research that. This is a
test to see if the owner is new and to
107

108
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:06.730
refer back to the button tucks to show
add owner or update owner. That's why
108

109
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.220
it's blowing up that new property.
What they are doing here in Spring on
109

110
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:18.250
the BaseEntity is they have a is new
property and I did not implement that.
110

111
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.900
So let's come in and implement that
method. We need to implement that up
111

112
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.600
here in our model.
We can do that on our BaseEntity.
112

113
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.730
Now I'll just do like this. I
remember seeing that but I didn't know
113

114
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.269
what they were using that for. So now we
have discovered that so let's go ahead
114

115
00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.720
and build
115

116
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:43.209
which will trigger a reload of
Spring. We can see Spring Boot is
116

117
00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.540
on the class loader is now
reinitializing a Spring Application and
117

118
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:54.480
that is up. Let's come back over here and
see if this works now.
118

119
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.810
There we go.
Since its football season here ,we'll use
119

120
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.120
a Joe Buck, a well-known announcer.
120

121
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.670
We'll go ahead and add that. We can see
that is now there.
121

122
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:19.240
Now let's test the Edit as well. We'll 
say main street date owner and we can
122

123
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.440
see that that is working as well. So in
 just a short few minutes, we've
123

124
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.990
added in the ability to create
owners and update them. So let's go ahead
124

125
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:34.120
and do that. We can see that Joe Buck has
now been added to this but of course
125

126
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.820
I'll go away when I restart but now we
have that that ability. Coming up, we
126

127
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.140
will be adding in the add pet
functionality as well but we can see
127

128
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.520
that Joe does not have any pets but
that's going to be an upcoming video.
128

129
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:55.570
So let's come in here. All the test run.
That was issue number 55 so we'll go in
129

130
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.990
and close that.
130

131
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.100
and I'll commit and push that.
