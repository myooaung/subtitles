00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.400
Right in the previous video you saw that I created this issue number 10 to add an I.D. to the model

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.240
objects and I want to show you a little bit of why so many go to pet clinic and we can see that we have

3
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.390
our person Java I didn't implement that and you can see that person extends base Saturday so let's go

4
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
back and take a look at base identity and base entity.

5
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.230
This is a JPA concept where we can see we have JPA specific annotations on it.

6
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.950
That's what the Java X persistent stuff is.

7
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.210
This is all from the JPA API and we're not going to get into that right now we are just going to set

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.870
ourselves up to be working with these Po Joes.

9
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.380
We can see here that implements an integer I.D. I'm going to use a long value that gives us a larger

10
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.570
value to be working with or I.D. I'm not going to be worried about the annotations at this particular

11
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.360
point in time.

12
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.840
What we're going to do in this part of the course we are going to evolve this into using JPA so we're

13
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.900
not going to use it JPA right now but we will be evolving at some kind of like laying the groundwork

14
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.680
for us to learn from coming up.

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.550
So what I want to do is implement this base entity.

16
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.920
So let me jump over here to ontology and I'm going to come in here model and create a new class called

17
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.430
base entity and go ahead and add him

18
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.820
you may be wondering why I'm using the box type along rather than just using a primitive long that is

19
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.250
something that I could do.

20
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.750
But what we prefer to do is use box types and that is actually a recommendation of hibernate to use

21
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.630
box types being that box types can in fact be null where parents cannot.

22
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.760
So that's why we are going to be using that.

23
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.020
And you can see here like toggle back over we just have getters and setters.

24
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.220
I am not going to implement the is new right now.

25
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.270
So you can see that's just going to return back.

26
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.360
That's a functionality that I'm not going to implement for now but when we do want to do is implement

27
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.280
the getters and setters so we'll go ahead and implement those.

28
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.620
So now we can get and set that and we can also see that implement serialized liable so that is also

29
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.190
a good idea.

30
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.910
So I'm just going to steal that right from here as I type it out and we'll come back over here paste

31
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.210
that

32
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.930
so we can see that that implements serialized ball and let's come back over here

33
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.190
take a look at the model and we'll take a look at her person we can see that the person just extends

34
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.820
based do so that's exactly what we're going to be doing in our model.

35
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.720
So I need to come back over here and revisit those extends Person person extends

36
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:23.510
our base and doing get put he will extend base early

37
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.660
type as well

38
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.360
and that extends Person so person extends based entities so we don't need to change that.

39
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.460
So both an owner and that extend person person extends based D so we are all good there.

40
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.440
So come back over here to Chrome and this was issue number 10.

41
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.700
So I am going to go ahead and close out.

42
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.170
Issue number 10 here.

43
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.710
Right click get commit directory

44
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.290
make a comment there closes Number 10

45
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.790
and push the

46
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.140
C that is pushed back over here double check and that is closed already so that commit where when and

47
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.970
added that again we added an error base entity class which implements serialization so if we ever need

48
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.510
serialize it just has one long property of I.D..

49
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.480
So now we have getters and setters for I.D. and then we extend it out our model class where we needed

50
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:50.730
to to add in that extends base entity which will give us an I.D. property of a long on each one of our

51
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.860
classes that we use for our data model.
