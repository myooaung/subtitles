Hey folks! My name is John Thomson. I am the
founder of Spring Framework Guru. I want 
1

2
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.139
to welcome you to my Spring Framework 5
course. So this course is subtitled
2

3
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
Beginner to Guru. So I designed this
course to take you from not being
3

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.960
able to even spell Spring or Spring
Framework, if you really want to get
4

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
big and to being an expert. That's why
I'm calling it a guru. So I want you to
5

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.760
be an expert with the Spring Framework
by the time you finish this course.
6

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.410
That's exactly why I've designed this
course. Now I've been teaching Spring for
7

8
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.309
about two years now. Started off with a
Spring 4 course, Been working with
8

9
00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
Spring for over a decade. Even worked as
a Pivotal Spring source consultant with
9

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
several of their customers, I spoke at
Spring One. So I have a lot of experience
10

11
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.239
of Spring. I'll try to convey as much as
I have to you in this course. So going
11

12
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.980
forward in the course, there's a few
tricks that you can do. One of them is to
12

13
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.050
fork my repositories. You can
have complete source code access inside
13

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.610
github. There's a ton examples there. Everything is I used branches so you get
14

15
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.630
a starting branch and an ending branch for
in github. So you can see each step
15

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.460
of the way, exactly what was changed and
then you can check that out. And there's tools
16

17
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
that you can use to compare your code to
the branch that we're on. So you can see
17

18
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.020
all that stuff and I highly recommend
you to go in and fork that. Take my repository,
18

19
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.740
fork it and then as you work inside your
repository, you build up these great
19

20
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.840
Spring examples. When you go to get a job
as a Spring Framework Developer, guess
20

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.369
what? You have a whole github repository
of Spring Framework code that you can
21

22
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.520
share with your prospective employer. So
it's a great tool, a great way to
22

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.930
demonstrate your experience with the
Spring Framework. So there's a lot of
23

24
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.159
great content ahead in this course. We
get into a lot of different things. It's
24

25
00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.540
been a lot of fun for me to do this
course because I did my Spring Framework 
25

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.140
four courses almost two years ago.
I've got piped 13-14
26

27
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.469
thousand students have been through my
various courses at this point. So I got a
27

28
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.879
lot of feedback from students taking
courses and I was able to roll that into
28

29
00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.410
this course. I had a lot of things,
I saw common questions.
29

30
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.670
My previous course, I didn't cover
uploading a video, I'm sorry,
30

31
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.240
uploading an image to the database. That's in this course. We'll talk about
31

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.050
multiple data sources, different data
source configuration. So these are all
32

33
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.920
common questions that I see. People start
off with a Spring Framework and then they
33

34
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.510
get a job and then they start getting
more and more complicated scenarios
34

35
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.020
thrown at them and that's why
I'm also expanding out the amount of
35

36
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.170
technology that we're using in this
course. There's a lot of things that I
36

37
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.500
want to show you like MySQL, MongoDB. MongoDB is really cool because we can do
37

38
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.550
Reactive Programming with it. So this is
all the stuff I'm adding into the course so
38

39
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.850
you have a much broader understanding of
the Spring Framework and you can see how
39

40
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.960
the Spring Framework is used in the
enterprise. So I'm pretty excited about
40

41
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.060
that. Support for the course. If you need
help, please leave me a detailed message
41

42
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.530
on the course, the actual module. There's
a commenting system where you can leave
42

43
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.180
that message for me and then I can read
that and post my reply because your
43

44
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.310
messages your questions as you get
into trouble, others are going to see, may
44

45
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.570
see that same issue. So by posting there
that's a great way for them to see
45

46
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.530
it. If we really get stuck, I might not be
able to answer everything sometimes. I
46

47
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.300
need to see the whole project and again
that's why I said fork yourself
47

48
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.020
in github and then you can send me a
link to your github account. I will fork
48

49
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.600
it back to my github repository, fix it
and then send you a pull request with
49

50
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.010
a detailed explanation of what happened. Then sometimes I'll even video this and
50

51
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.790
I'll put it into troubleshooting Spring. That's kind of a challenge for me where
51

52
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.010
the students having a problem, I will go
in not knowing what to expect and jump
52

53
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.020
in and go through it and you can see me live coding, troubleshooting
53

54
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.080
something. And this is stuff when you go
through happy path, you're not going to
54

55
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.770
get that type of detail. So pretty
excited about these different techniques
55

56
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.970
that we can. So I really hope you enjoy
the course and if you hit any troubles
56

57
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.840
or just want to say hi go ahead and
reach out and contact me. Thanks!
