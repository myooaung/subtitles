00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.250
Okay! In this section of course, we do
have a fun assignment. We are going to
1

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.870
build a Jokes app. We're going to have
an app that's going to show a web page and
2

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.090
it's going to show a random joke. Now I have
a course on Spring Boot Actuator, and in
3

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.699
that course, I built a Chuck Norris jokes
generator. As part of that course, I
4

5
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
actually have that up on Maven Central,
so it's kind of cool. Spring Framework
5

6
00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
Guru is up on Maven Central right now.
I have my own jar up there. That was a
6

7
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.649
little bit of a learning curve too to get
get it up there. But I was like, "Hey, I'm
7

8
00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.690
somebody now. I got a jar on Maven
Central." So I'm officially made it on Maven
8

9
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
Central but it's a jar that just builds
up a random Chuck Norris quote, so we are
9

10
00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.030
going to take that jar and include it
into this project. Now the structure of
10

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.800
this lesson or this module, I should say,
is a little bit different. The next
11

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.940
section or the next video that you see
is going to be an assignment. That
12

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
assignment is going to challenge you to
build a Chuck Norris Jokes application.
13

14
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.350
So we've already seen how to build a
Spring Boot Web Application during a
14

15
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.450
little curve ball in there to you as to
bring in this jar and the assignment
15

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.229
will spec that out, and so it's kind of a
challenge to take for what you've
16

17
00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.530
learned so far and start applying it to
something new and building this little
17

18
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
jokes application. So it's a fun
assignment that we can do and we can see
18

19
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.040
some fun Chuck Norris jokes along the
way. Now after the assignment, the rest of
19

20
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.340
this section, I have a number of videos
that are going to take you step-by-step
20

21
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
through building it so I'm trying to
challenge you a little bit to take what
21

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
we've already learned in the course
through the assignment. But don't worry,
22

23
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.619
we are going to cover that assignment
step by step. I'm not going to leave you
23

24
00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.350
hanging.
You'll see see me do everything step by
24

25
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
step and we'll go through it from
beginning to end. Also in this section of
25

26
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.320
the course, we are going to continue
building out in the Pet Clinic application.
26

27
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.560
So we're still laying the found work. We have some basic tasks that we need to
27

28
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.520
do. It's going to help us reinforce some
of the things that we're doing. It's going to
28

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.829
be a lot of hands-on coding, so we do
have two applications going here. One is
29

30
00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.979
the Jokes application, which we'll build
completely through the assignment, and
30

31
00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.660
then we'll have our ongoing Spring Pet
Clinic Application,
31

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.280
so we'll build that out as well. So we'll
continue developing that so a lot of
32

33
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.260
great content in this section. Really
we're not going to learn a lot of
33

34
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.210
new stuff so to speak, but we are
going to see things that we've already
34

35
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.440
had and we are going to get to get our
hands on so that we learn the Spring
35

36
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.610
Framework even better and that would be
we're building solid skills and the
36

37
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.480
Spring Framework for you.
