00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.990
All right in this video we are going to address issue number 57 and that's the ability to add or update
1

2
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:18.880
a visit and I am going to change protocol a little bit in this. What I'm going to do is I'm going to
2

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.680
go ahead and implement it shamelessly steal from the Spring guys again just implement that Controller.
3

4
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.410
I think we've had enough Controller content you guys should be getting pretty darn good with it by now
4

5
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.400
so I don't think I need to cover it at the detail level that we have in the past.
5

6
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.140
So I'm going to come over here and this is the there's a Controller and I'm going to go ahead and implement
6

7
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.440
that.
7

8
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.100
I'm going to steal this content here from these guys and we will create our own implementation of it
8

9
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:55.780
over in our project so come back over here and mark this as saying to me saying that it's now in process
9

10
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.990
and what I want to do here is I'm going to implement it because we've seen a lot of control or examples
10

11
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.490
thus far in the course.
11

12
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.290
I'm going to implement it.
12

13
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.640
I believe that it's working.
13

14
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.620
I'm going to create a task for someone to go ahead and implement their unit test and accept that as
14

15
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.570
a pull request.
15

16
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.280
So let's go through and go ahead and get this implemented so we can come down here to that web project
16

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.340
and see that we don't have a VisitController so I'm going to go ahead and add that right so
17

18
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.140
I'm just going to go and paste this and
18

19
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.270
and I'm just doing option enter which is telling IntelliJ to go ahead and do then parts once we get
19

20
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.990
through this we will go ahead and modify this to how we like.
20

21
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.840
Now the first thing we need to do is @Controller
21

22
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.820
makes it that and I don't like the way they named these properties so I'm going to refactor that
22

23
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.750
as a Repository.
23

24
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.220
Same here refactor.
24

25
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.640
Repository.
25

26
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.660
OK.
26

27
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.470
That's refactor that as well.
27

28
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.020
May I've been on the pop up that I clicked here too quick.
28

29
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.090
I'm just coming to you.
29

30
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.420
Select and factor option.
30

31
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.170
I will tell IntelliJ to go ahead and do the refactoring soon. IntelliJ has some very powerful refactoring
31

32
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.980
tools.
32

33
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.110
Now let's take a quick look here to see what's happening.
33

34
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.700
Now the VisitController gets wired up.
34

35
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.880
We don't need autowired on there because there is a constructor.
35

36
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.770
Here are the two repositories so those are going to be the repository implementations.
36

37
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.460
And actually we should have a service for that right.
37

38
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.570
Yes.
38

39
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.760
So I want to switch over and not use the repositories directly.
39

40
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.070
So I'm going to wipe out.
40

41
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.960
Now I use the services so I need visit.
41

42
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.320
VisitService.
42

43
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.610
So.
43

44
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.040
And then the PetService.
44

45
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.100
You know that's a little bit of a stylistic thing on my part.
45

46
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.720
So I do like having that service layer and just from experience a lot of times this is a fairly simple
46

47
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.620
project but a lot of times handling those repositories directly.
47

48
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.370
I mean it's great for simple projects.
48

49
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.240
But as you get more complex projects you're probably going to have business logic and I don't like having
49

50
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.630
a lot of business logic inside the controllers.
50

51
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.460
So go ahead and now IntelliJ to create the constructor for us so that clears that up and then let's look
51

52
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.650
through here so ModelAttribute visit.
52

53
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.890
So again the ModelAttribute is going to run with every request against this Controller.
53

54
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:21.360
And what we want to do is petService and findById I'm going to take petId.
54

55
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.830
And that's actually going to be a Long because we chose to use a Long for ID on our main objects.
55

56
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.220
So that's just initializing pet and visit so we need to do it here.
56

57
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.090
So let's double check our Pet.
57

58
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:56.680
So here we we have the new HashSet and we ran into this problem before so what we want do is come in here and
58

59
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.440
say we saw this before so if
59

60
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.720
so I'm saying there's on our Builder pattern so if you don't set that explicitly our initialization
60

61
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.750
gets wiped out so we won't have an empty HashSet.
61

62
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.950
So we can do what I'm about to show you here.
62

63
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.330
So we're going to set this up and what the Spring guys do is they added a helper method for managing the
63

64
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.860
visits.
64

65
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.030
And I'm going to be working with the set directly.
65

66
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.210
And then you can see here that it is giving us a warning and I don't think there's a good one because
66

67
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.910
saying if visits is not equal to null , oh I should say equal to null. Here we go.
67

68
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.660
So visits equal null, is going to fall in.
68

69
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:53.710
Or if visits size is greater than zero so basically it will never get here if it's null.
69

70
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.100
It'll never get to this check.
70

71
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.510
So now that actually was a good check.
71

72
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.350
So first first look there I thought it was wrong.
72

73
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.550
So that updates are Pet Entity and now let's come back over here to our VisitController.
73

74
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:14.810
Now what I can do is rather than get visit as a helper method that they added what we can do is say getVisits().add,
74

75
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.960
like so
75

76
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.670
and again because we didn't add that helper method in,  we need to manage both sides of relationships.
76

77
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.920
So that's what we're doing right there.
77

78
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.440
And this is important common here so they're going to load load visits here and then return that back.
78

79
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.070
So that's initialising new visit form and that's going to give it the Pet object and that technically should
79

80
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.360
be Long.
80

81
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.190
So its going to be kind of interesting what they did there because we do have, this is initializing the form.
81

82
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.250
It's now just going, going through this.
82

83
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.130
And so you know we should always get a Pet and then that's putting in a new and new visit and empty visit
83

84
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.730
onto that.
84

85
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.760
So any existing visits should already be there and we're just adding it to adding in an empty visit
85

86
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.770
just in case.
86

87
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.880
So I'd like to settle.
87

88
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.740
That's kind of interesting the way they're doing that to be honest.
88

89
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.740
Then there's going to initialize the form.
89

90
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.660
And then here is where we're going to handle the post.
90

91
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.560
So I was going to take in the ownerId and the petId, and we are going to make sure that the Visit
91

92
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.250
is valid.
92

93
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.010
And look at the BindingResult as long as it has errors will be returned back to the form.
93

94
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:40.210
And then here we need to refactor this to our visitService and save save the visit to solve now.
94

95
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.040
Go ahead.
95

96
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.700
That should give us everything.
96

97
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.480
I am going to run this now
97

98
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:56.390
and our Spring Boot application is starting up. Once its up, we're able toggle over to Chrome
98

99
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.880
and come over this.
99

100
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.570
And let's go home.
100

101
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:18.070
See problem with the, some reason the resources aren't coming up so I've seen that happen sometimes.
101

102
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.340
So let's try stopping this
102

103
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.800
rebuild project.
103

104
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:34.160
And when you see something like that that's often the IDE is having a problem of loss of resources.
104

105
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.010
And we'll go ahead and let it rebuild now let's try to start it up again if it still fails.
105

106
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:47.650
Do a clean build inside of Maven. So something funky happened with the web resources and I bet it's
106

107
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:55.720
because somewhere along the line I accidentally did a clean so I remember the the resources actually
107

108
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.800
get built.
108

109
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.650
Was good reinforcement here.
109

110
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:07.030
Stop that and let's come over here to Maven and off the roof.
110

111
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:15.140
I'm going to do verify, what  is going to do is do a full build run all the tests.
111

112
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.680
And more importantly remember how we have that plug in that's generating the web resources so I was
112

113
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.750
going to go through and look at last documents generate our CSS.
113

114
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:30.920
And that's really what was missing is the CSS styling our custom CSS styling was missing.
114

115
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.930
And we should see some chatter for it here in the logs
115

116
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:45.810
but I can show you here in the target on their web what we're looking for is.
116

117
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:59.950
buildContexts.properties static templates so static resources as this petclinic CSS that is getting
117

118
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.480
generated for those wro.4j for J plugin.
118

119
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.410
So that's probably what was missing.
119

120
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:12.160
So now if I start this up IntelliJ is going to map it properly and find that resource for us kind of
120

121
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.650
funny how its working under the under the covers because what's happening is InelliJ is doing its
121

122
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.560
build but it doesn't know about that.
122

123
00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.350
wro4j plugin so it doesn't generate that CSS.
123

124
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.460
Let's take a look at our Web page it should fix it.
124

125
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.320
There we go.
125

126
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:40.130
So now our resources get generated properly lets do find owners do find all pick on Michael, l and see if we can a
126

127
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.590
visit.
127

128
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.900
And we are getting a 500 error so let's take a quick look at that createOrUpdateVisit form
128

129
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.380
type.
129

130
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.880
Alright.
130

131
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.760
Refactor type to petType.
131

132
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:06.790
So we have another form that is not happy with it and that is on createOrUpdateVisit form.
132

133
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.230
So come over here to our resources
133

134
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:19.160
Thats on line 25 and see here is its on the line 25 and column 11
134

135
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.750
updateVisitForm.
135

136
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:37.190
Try that one more time as in the petForm so I go down like a line 25 again
136

137
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:59.320
so let's go ahead and restart this project do a build build should have done it but because template
137

138
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.000
loading and DevTools enable them to have it.
138

139
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.400
I did a restart there so lets come back over here.
139

140
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.100
Refresh it should well display that now lets add a visit.
140

141
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.850
Now our type is working.
141

142
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.730
That works.
142

143
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:30.480
And our date is failing so we still need to look at validation some failing validation there.
143

144
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.120
Looks like the right format or so.
144

145
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.120
So coming up in the next section of the course are going to be looking at validation so let's see here
145

146
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.030
we'll say I should create a new issue.
146

147
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.760
Now label this as a bug.
147

148
00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.860
So we will track that
148

149
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.080
out.
149

150
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.860
Now we know that.
150

151
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.570
But for now I am going to call this good.
151

152
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.670
But we have not created any test for this.
152

153
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.630
So I am going to come out here to GitHub again create a  new issue.
153

154
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.760
And this one I am going to label help wanted.
154

155
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:28.180
So if somebody wants to submit the test for that which you can do is use GitHub challenge to anybody
155

156
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.300
who's taking a course if it's not been completed yet.
156

157
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:37.270
Take a look at the repository and if you some pull requests I will review it and merge it in and probably
157

158
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.000
record a video and give you kudos for doing that.
158

159
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.550
So let's go ahead and use.
159

160
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:53.930
So I'm going to close out number 57 here so we did add in the visit functionality come up here.
160

161
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:13.250
Number 57 Just double checking commit and push us and we will call this video done.
