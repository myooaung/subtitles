00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.200
Okay, we do have Spring boot running. It is now
listening on port 8080.
1

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.800
It's our simple index page and I'm going
to take a look at our page in Safari. So
2

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.779
Safari is very similar to Chrome. You
come in and right-click and say view
3

4
00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.220
page source and we can see that page
source now. This actually brings up the
4

5
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.470
page source in Safari development tools. So we can see that pretty easily. It's
5

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
kind of nice how that's consolidated. Chrome will open up a different tab and
6

7
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.489
I believe Firefox will also. So a little
bit different so that does come up in
7

8
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.940
their developer tools. Now to get to
developer tools, you have a developer
8

9
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.129
menu or develop menu option and what we
just saw was the web inspector. So we
9

10
00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.760
come in here and come into the web
inspector and that's going to come back
10

11
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.320
and default to that page there and
now we do have a network tab as well. If
11

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.600
I refresh this, we will see that activity.
12

13
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.960
So right away went back to the view
which I don't like and we can see that
13

14
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.530
we got this and for some reason, we've
got web events so I'm not sure why,
14

15
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.030
where that is coming from be honest. So
that's a safari extension that's coming
15

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
down from somewhere but this localhost
request, that is that they get against
16

17
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.470
our Spring boot server and you can see
different elements here. So this is a
17

18
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.509
nice view. Similar to what we saw in
Chrome and Firebug. So it needs stuff
18

19
00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.240
there. Timeline is another interesting
tab, so that's going to see, we'll see the
19

20
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.490
rendering of the page and so similar view inside of Chrome as well. Now you do
20

21
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.860
have a JavaScript debugger. We can also
see local storage. So a lot of people
21

22
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.390
don't realize that modern browsers do
have a little
22

23
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.079
SQL database that we can stash stuff in
when we need to. So this is a nice
23

24
00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.399
feature for web developers to do. Store-and-forward. And then of course we
24

25
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.110
do have the council so for you and
JavaScript emitting output messages. We
25

26
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.890
could see it on the console but the main
thing that we're going to be looking at
26

27
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.410
when we're doing web development
especially with Spring MVC
27

28
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.210
and Thymeleaf, we'll be looking at
what's coming down via the network and
28

29
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.230
then inspecting the page. It is probably one
of the most useful things of when you're
29

30
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.290
working on this. It is to be able to
inspect the page and also, I don't know,
30

31
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.310
can we edit here? Nope. You can tell that
I probably use, of the tools I use, Safari
31

32
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.380
the least. I'm just really happy with
Chrome and Firebug. Chrome is probably my
32

33
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.550
primary tool but showing you this
because everybody has their own personal
33

34
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.570
preferences and you can use any browser
you like, going forward in the course.
