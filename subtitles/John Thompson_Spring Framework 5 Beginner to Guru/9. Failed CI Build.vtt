00:00:00.392 --> 00:00:01.813
Alright, I'm going to take a little learning
1

2
00:00:01.813 --> 00:00:05.379
opportunity here to show you why we run CI builds.
2

3
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.846
So, after that last coding assignment review,
3

4
00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:12.825
I checked in the code to GitHub, of course,
4

5
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:14.466
and look what happened.
5

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.999
I got an email a few moments later
6

7
00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.145
telling me that the build had failed.
7

8
00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.526
So obviously there's a lot of detail here,
8

9
00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:25.565
and we can see that ... oh is it saying ...
9

10
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:27.206
We just say failed.
10

11
00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:30.864
Got a NPE, so I did something bad there.
11

12
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:35.503
And let's go ahead and take a look at this in CircleCI.
12

13
00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:38.926
Yeah, we can see here that the build did fail.
13

14
00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:41.731
Going to take a look at it.
14

15
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:43.564
73 tests, one failure.
15

16
00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:48.761
I got a NPE here on the delete operation.
16

17
00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.563
So let's go ahead and take a look at that
17

18
00:00:52.563 --> 00:00:54.670
inside of IntelliJ.
18

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.728
And I'm gonna come in here and run my test
19

20
00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:00.270
like I should've before committing.
20

21
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.645
I was bad and did not run my test
21

22
00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:06.078
before committing to the repository.
22

23
00:01:06.078 --> 00:01:07.577
And if I was in a development shop
23

24
00:01:07.577 --> 00:01:11.517
I'd be publicly shamed and humiliated.
24

25
00:01:11.517 --> 00:01:13.184
So here's that test.
25

26
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.607
So we wound up with an NPE here,
26

27
00:01:17.607 --> 00:01:20.024
so let's take a look at that.
27

28
00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:27.364
And that was caused inside of the controller.
28

29
00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:29.781
Let's see what this is doing.
29

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.150
So what's happening is our IngredientService
30

31
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.317
is returning back a null, so see here in the Controller.
31

32
00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:51.908
So now we were deleting by id and that was okay,
32

33
00:01:51.908 --> 00:01:53.457
we're expecting a void,
33

34
00:01:53.457 --> 00:01:56.456
but now we're coming back and blocking on that.
34

35
00:01:56.456 --> 00:02:00.623
So we need to modify our test to return back a value.
35

36
00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:07.344
So you need to say when 
36

37
00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:15.374
deleteById.
37

38
00:02:38.318 --> 00:02:40.985
And we're gonna do a Mono.empty().
38

39
00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:47.715
So again, our delete method previously
39

40
00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:50.916
was just returning nothing, void, and it was okay.
40

41
00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:53.536
But now, see in the Controller,
41

42
00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.414
we'll go to that line in the Controller,
42

43
00:02:55.414 --> 00:02:57.183
we're now expecting a value to come back
43

44
00:02:57.183 --> 00:03:00.370
and we're not returning that inside our test.
44

45
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.203
So let's go ahead and re-run this failed test.
45

46
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.538
And we ran into another problem.
46

47
00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:25.349
No, I need to,
47

48
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:30.098
actually put that up here.
48

49
00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:33.796
That won't work very good.
49

50
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.995
I clearly need another cup of coffee,
50

51
00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.662
so let's try this one more time.
51

52
00:03:40.071 --> 00:03:42.044
I bet this is gonna work a lot better.
52

53
00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:44.618
And there, our test is now green.
53

54
00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:48.368
So I am gonna go ahead and commit that again.
54

55
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.024
And watch this one.
55

56
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.857
Do a Commit Directory.
56

57
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:00.055
Do a Commit and Push.
57

58
00:04:03.796 --> 00:04:06.046
Jump back over to CircleCI.
58

59
00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:10.168
And we can see how quickly that happened.
59

60
00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:11.951
So I just committed that a second ago
60

61
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.701
and this test is already running.
61

62
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.907
And the new CircleCI 2 actually seems pretty darn fast.
62

63
00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:22.560
I'm gonna pause this video for a second
63

64
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.310
and we'll verify that the CI build does pass.
64

65
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.511
Okay, I paused it there for a second
65

66
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:29.783
while that build was running.
66

67
00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:33.506
We can see now that it is back in the green.
67

68
00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:37.413
We're gonna come back here, over to builds.
68

69
00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:39.895
And you can see that it had the one failed build
69

70
00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:43.174
and now it's fixed, based on that commit there.
70

71
00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:44.534
So everything's good.
71

72
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:47.493
Now if you're not using CircleCI at this point,
72

73
00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:49.130
highly recommend that you do.
73

74
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.220
It's absolutely free, integrates nicely with GitHub.
74

75
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.708
I did have some previous videos on CircleCI
75

76
00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:57.613
but I wanna show you this little learning opportunity,
76

77
00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:01.129
of where I broke my own rules, didn't run the test
77

78
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.844
before I committed, and I broke the build.
78

79
00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:06.379
So if you're in a development shop,
79

80
00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.798
there's usually a price to pay when you break the build.
80

81
00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:13.642
So my fault for not following my proper procedures,
81

82
00:05:13.642 --> 00:05:15.708
but I wanted to take a learning opportunity here
82

83
00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:18.755
and show you how CircleCI flagged
83

84
00:05:18.755 --> 00:05:21.838
that I did, in fact, break the build.
