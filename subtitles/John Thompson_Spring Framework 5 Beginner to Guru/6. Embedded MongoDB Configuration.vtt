(soft music)
1

2
00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.198
Okay, real nice feature that we can work with
2

3
00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:10.338
is a embedded Mongo database,
3

4
00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:12.462
because right now we don't have Mongo Runner,
4

5
00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:15.583
I don't have Mongo running on my system,
5

6
00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:18.527
and if I run it, run the application,
6

7
00:00:18.527 --> 00:00:19.884
it's gonna blow up right away
7

8
00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:23.196
because it's Spring Boot knows that it's looking for Mongo
8

9
00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:25.149
but it's not finding it.
9

10
00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.794
So what we can do is we can set up
10

11
00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.314
a embedded Mongo database,
11

12
00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:33.248
and to do this we need to add in a couple of properties
12

13
00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:35.488
so if we come over to our build.gradle
13

14
00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:37.324
and I'm cheating a little bit
14

15
00:00:37.324 --> 00:00:41.491
because I do have this copied over to my clipboard.
15

16
00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:45.216
So add in these two dependencies here
16

17
00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:48.729
and I'm gonna say import the changes
17

18
00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.538
and now this is gonna give us a compile dependency
18

19
00:00:51.538 --> 00:00:56.062
on the embedded Mongo and then also the Spring component
19

20
00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:57.520
for the embedded Mongo database,
20

21
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.399
so that will set up our embedded Mongo database
21

22
00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.811
and it wasn't too long ago
22

23
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.383
that you had to manually configured a bean, a Spring bean,
23

24
00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:08.775
but that has been migrated into more recent versions
24

25
00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:12.186
of Spring Boot, it was in the 1.5 series,
25

26
00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:13.961
I wanna say, I forget exactly when,
26

27
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:16.074
but it wasn't too long ago that Spring Boot
27

28
00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:18.442
did add in this feature.
28

29
00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:20.472
And the next thing we need to do is come over here
29

30
00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:22.972
to application.properties.
30

31
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.058
And under the Mongo port say zero,
31

32
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.274
and mongodb.host,
32

33
00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:38.806
and that zero, I believe it sets up a random port,
33

34
00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.308
so obviously not port zero,
34

35
00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:44.970
I don't think that's actually valid to use that.
35

36
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.548
Now we can say localhost for that.
36

37
00:01:46.548 --> 00:01:50.290
Now, if I come in and run our application
37

38
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.225
we should get a different result.
38

39
00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.396
I'm actually not sure because we don't have anything set up,
39

40
00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.364
we don't have any entities set up,
40

41
00:01:57.364 --> 00:02:00.636
yeah, so we're gonna get a pop here,
41

42
00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.748
so yeah, our data model is not happy right now
42

43
00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:07.967
and we are actually getting into a recursive error
43

44
00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:09.397
and that is a problem,
44

45
00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:12.173
we need to refactor our data model a little bit,
45

46
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.828
so it is not happy there at all,
46

47
00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:17.636
because what's happening is we set up
47

48
00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:20.255
those bi-directional references
48

49
00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.708
and we do need to change our data model a little bit.
49

50
00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:27.101
We're gonna get into that in the next video,
50

51
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.262
but in this video I just want you to be aware
51

52
00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:31.405
right now we are blowing up,
52

53
00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:35.631
but we have gone in and added a embedded Mongo database
53

54
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.798
so we are running, we're a step closer to being running,
54

55
00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:40.959
but we're gonna take this a step at a time
55

56
00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.176
I'm gonna show you step by step
56

57
00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:46.343
of reconfiguring this application to work with MongoDB.
