In this video, I have an assignment for
you. And what we want to do is create the
1

2
00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.799
relationship between Ingredient and UnitOfMeasure. So we need to establish
2

3
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.660
UnitOfMeasure as an entity and we want to
create a one-to-one relationship from
3

4
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.880
Ingredient to UnitOfMeasure. Now this
is kind of a unique case. So you know
4

5
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
measure is going to be like a reference
table that we'll use to define different
5

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.989
units of measure for our recipes and
it's really just to hold the different
6

7
00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.590
properties in for the Ingredient. So
what we want to do is allow Ingredient
7

8
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.420
to be pretty independent and in this use
case, as I'm thinking about the
8

9
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.230
application I can't think of a reason
why we would want to go from Unit
9

10
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.079
OfMeasure to Ingredient. Because really
we're referencing UnitOfMeasure from
10

11
00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.710
Ingredient to lookup properties for the
type of unit measure that it is and we're
11

12
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.729
creating it as a database table so that
our application would be like extensible.
12

13
00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.780
So if we wanted to add in additional
unit of measures at some time in the future,
13

14
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.610
we could just add them in through a
database record rather than hard coding
14

15
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.979
it like enum is. So in this particular
use case, we don't really have a need for
15

16
00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.810
a bi-directional relationship. So we're
going to create a unidirectional
16

17
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.009
relationship. So I have an assignment
here in keynote. So the assignment is to
17

18
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.740
create a one-to-one JPA relationship and
we want to create the UnitOfMeasure
18

19
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.009
entity and create a unidirectional
relationship from Ingredient to UnitOf
19

20
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.799
Measure. And we do not want to cascade
any persistence events from Ingredient
20

21
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.649
to UnitOfMeasure. So if you look at
our diagram here, we don't want to delete
21

22
00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.659
a UnitOfMeasure if we delete an
Ingredient. So that would be a undesired
22

23
00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.369
behavior of our application. So that's
why we're setting it up as a
23

24
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.750
unidirectional right relationship and
not doing any type of cascade operations
24

25
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.410
when we do persistence against
Ingredient. We definitely don't want to
25

26
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.819
be doing any type of alteration of UnitOfMeasure since it is
26

27
00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.639
just a reference table. So just to
recap the assignment. Go in and create a
27

28
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:25.909
UnitOfMeasure entity and then you'll want
to add that as a property to Ingredient,
28

29
00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:32.090
and then create a unidirectional JPA
relationship from Ingredient to UnitOf
29

30
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.439
Measure and do not do any type of
cascade operations from Ingredient to
30

31
00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.239
UnitOfMeasure. Now in the next video,
I'll step you through exactly everything
31

32
00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.590
that we need to do to get the setup.
