2
00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:06.766
Okay, this concludes the part of the course
2

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.564
on going full stack reactive with Thymeleaf and MongoDB.
3

4
00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:11.854
So we now have a web application.
4

5
00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:13.769
We went through something familiar.
5

6
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.121
We started off and you can see how we went through it
6

7
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:17.983
and adapted it for use.
7

8
00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:22.117
So we went from a traditional Web Servlet stack
8

9
00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:24.268
and converted it over to a full reactive stack,
9

10
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:26.900
and you can see how there was a couple little gotchas there,
10

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.669
a couple minor things that we had to tweak,
11

12
00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.869
but effectively, we are using the same API
12

13
00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:34.386
throughout the entire stack now.
13

14
00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:37.111
So whether we're using Spring MVC,
14

15
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.809
which is on the traditional server stack,
15

16
00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.346
or WebFlux, which is the full reactive stack,
16

17
00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:44.230
the API at the top level is still pretty similar.
17

18
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.121
And this is something that I expect that the Spring team
18

19
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:49.065
is gonna continue to mature, and I think their goal
19

20
00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:51.004
is to make it fully compatible,
20

21
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.031
and right now we're still kind of early,
21

22
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:55.097
but I will evolve the section of the course
22

23
00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:56.384
as we go forward.
23

24
00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:58.430
Coming up in the course, we are definitely gonna be seeing
24

25
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.747
more reactive stuff.
25

26
00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.828
I'm having a lot of fun with it in recording this content,
26

27
00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.350
so you're definitely gonna see more of it,
27

28
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.965
and we are gonna actually see a lot
28

29
00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.073
of the traditional stuff, too.
29

30
00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:08.326
So we'll be running both of them.
30

31
00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:10.376
So we're gonna learn about both going forward
31

32
00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:13.209
and keep having a lot of fun here.
