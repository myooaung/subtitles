00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.420
All right! We had our feet wet with a
Spring Boot Application mini website. Now
1

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.840
in this section of the course, we are
gonna get to the absolute core of the
2

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.070
Spring Framework. This is really where
Spring shines. We're going to talk about
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
Dependency Injection, the Inversion of
Control container, a lot of best
4

5
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.740
practices through Object-Oriented
Programming. Spring, like any other
5

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.630
language out there, you can write good
Spring and bad Spring, so kind of what
6

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
we're gonna do here is talk about
some best practices in Object-Oriented
7

8
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
Programming and really how that
dovetails with the Spring Framework. As
8

9
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.040
far as Dependency Injection and the best
practices of Dependency Injection, the
9

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340
Spring Framework does support a number
of different techniques for doing
10

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.600
Dependency Injection. You have a lot of
tools in that tool bag. It's a very mature
11

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.850
robust framework but you might not want
always use those tools, and we're
12

13
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.359
gonna explain the tools that you do have
available in that tool bag for
13

14
00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.610
Dependency Injection because you can do
a lot of great stuff with dependency
14

15
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.830
injection. Like I said, it is the
cornerstone of Spring Framework. You
15

16
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.020
absolutely need to understand Dependency
Injection and Inversion Control. If you do
16

17
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.689
not, I mean that this like 
blocking and tackling in football, the
17

18
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.400
swing in golf. If you don't like get
these fundamental stuff down, you're
18

19
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.460
gonna really struggle with as we go
out throughout the course because
19

20
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.850
everything Spring, Spring Framework 5,
Spring Boot, Spring Integration, Spring
20

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.299
Security, all the whole circle of world
of Spring projects really depend on the
21

22
00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.079
stuff that we're teaching in this module,
and that's right around Dependency
22

23
00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.229
Injection. By the time you get to the end
of this, you are gonna feel very comfortable
23

24
00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
with Dependency Injection, you will
understand what Inversion of Control is
24

25
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.530
and be comfortable using that, and in
this section of the course, we
25

26
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.530
are gonna start further developing
the Pet Clinic Application so we have
26

27
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.030
some lessons on that. Just start flushing
that application out. So some neat stuff
27

28
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.879
coming up on Pet Clinic and Dependency
Injection.
