Alright! In this video, we have an assignment,
and for this, we are going to implement
1

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.940
that POST action for vendors. So, the
details of this course assignment is we
2

3
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.500
are going to create one new endpoint in
our Vendor controller. That endpoint is
3

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
going to accept a POST action, and it
should be a POST of a vendor object, so
4

5
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.130
that's going to create a new Vendor with
the POST action, and we expect it to
5

6
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.610
return back an HTTP 201 created status.
And also, as part of this assignment, I
6

7
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.980
want you to go continue following
test-driven development and use Mockito
7

8
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.350
and also the WebTestClient. 
Actually, in this implementation, I've got
8

9
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.480
away from doing actual test-driven
development. But for the assignment
9

10
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.719
review, this time, I'll actually go
through and do test-driven development.
10

11
00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.199
I'll write the unit test first, and then,
implement the controller endpoint and
11

12
00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.129
get those tests passing. So, pretty
similar to what we did. Steps route just
12

13
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
in the course. But this gives you a
chance to do hands-on. So, I highly
13

14
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.900
recommend you go through and do the
assignments. In the next video, I'm going
14

15
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.830
to go through and I will file
test-driven development in this example,
15

16
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.310
and step through this action and show
you exactly how to code this up.
