Alright! This concludes part of the
course on content negotiation with
1

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
Spring MVC. As you can see, we got into
some pretty interesting stuff here. We
2

3
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.539
got to introduce JAXB. JAXB has been
around like forever in the Java community
3

4
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.330
so I'm glad I was able to work it in for
you. It's not as prevalent anymore when
4

5
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
you start researching JAXB, you're
going to be seeing articles from like ten
5

6
00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.570
years ago, but it is still very important
being able to render XML. So the Java community
6

7
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
being a strongly tech community, they
actually did really embrace XML so JAXB
7

8
00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.879
is a very robust toolset so we've
really just scratched the surface
8

9
00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.010
of what JAXB can do. But the
main takeaway here was how we can set up
9

10
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.219
Spring MVC to render alternative data
types through other than just JSON. Now
10

11
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.270
you can see how we can use content type
negotiation to allow the client to
11

12
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.940
specify what it wants from our API. So
personally, when developing API as I
12

13
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
believe this is a very friendly way to
allow the clients to say, hey I want
13

14
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.270
JSON or hey I want XML. So it is
important to have and as you get into
14

15
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
Enterprise, it is a very important upright
skill to have to be able to develop
15

16
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.340
APIs with XML.
