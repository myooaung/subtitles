00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.109
Alright! We talked about the Spring Pet
Clinic. Let's go ahead and run it.
1

2
00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.510
Take a look at it running. So if you come
out to the Spring Pet Clinic project
2

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.810
here, I'll include this as the starting
source in the course resources. Come
3

4
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.890
down here and you can see to run it
locally, we have very simple instructions
4

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.170
here. So let's go ahead and I'm going to
copy this link and toggle it on over and
5

6
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:37.760
click on that. Now we can see that it's
done. So if I do a cd petclinic/. We can
6

7
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.260
see there's the project.
I can literally just come right over
7

8
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.710
here. Copy that. Again, this is running
the Maven Wrapper, so that 
8

9
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.270
./mvnw spring-boot:run. I don't
have a Windows machine. The command under
9

10
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.470
Windows is slightly different to run
maven, but you do want to run Spring Boot
10

11
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.290
with the run option. That is going to
compile and run the project for you. So
11

12
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.490
I'm gonna go ahead and paste that in and
hit enter. When you do this for the
12

13
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.560
first time, I just ran this, so all the
dependencies are cached in my maven
13

14
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.130
cache. You're gonna see a bunch of stuff
get downloaded from maven central. So
14

15
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.590
your startup experience is gonna be a
little bit different than what I'm
15

16
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.520
seeing here. You'll see a lot of stuff, a
lot of jars and dependencies being
16

17
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
downloaded to your local maven
repository. Now, we can see that Tomcat
17

18
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.330
has started up. It's running on port 8080.
So let's come back over to Chrome. I'm
18

19
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.860
going to start a new tab in Chrome
localhost:8080.
19

20
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.350
And here is the Spring Petclinic
application. We have the HOME. We can come
20

21
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.930
up here and do FIND OWNERS. I'm just
gonna hit Smith there, and we can see
21

22
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.640
here's the Owner. Let's take a look at
George. You can see where he lives in
22

23
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.880
Madison. We can edit him. We can add a new
pet, seeing it's here. Here's a form.
23

24
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
Different types of pets. So a lot of 
 functionality here that we can go
24

25
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.530
through. Also, VETERINARIANS. This
here, just simulates an error. So, let's come
25

26
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.380
over here. You can see that we have the
initialization started up in 27
26

27
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.050
milliseconds. If I come here and click on
this, this is just gonna emulate an error.
27

28
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.940
So, the graceful handling on the website
of an error. We come back over here and
28

29
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.100
see now I have a stack trace in the
console of the application. So again, this
29

30
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.210
is just demonstrating an error and how
the error is handled and this is all
30

31
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.140
stuff that we're going to go through. So,
let's come back over to this guy.
31

32
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
We'll go home. So what I'm going to do
going forward in the course, you're gonna
32

33
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.120
see sections of the course that start
with SFG Spring Framework Guru PC for
33

34
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.650
Pet Clinic. These are going to be
step by step sections of me showing you
34

35
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.370
how to create this application. I'm gonna
start off absolutely from beginning from
35

36
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.110
scratch, and I'm going to add these into
the different sections of the course to
36

37
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.860
reinforce what we just learned. So, look
for content at the end of the each
37

38
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.220
section. We're going to reinforce
content that we learned in the course.
38

39
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.230
We're going to go and build our own
Pet Clinic application step by step.
39

40
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.610
Probably not gonna use all the Spring
branding but it will be step by step.
40

41
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.850
It's gonna be a little bit different.
It's my course, I have my own opinions
41

42
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.080
not necessarily in line with the pivotal
team at all times. But I do want to show
42

43
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.209
you the best cases and hopefully you'll
learn a lot from this. I'll show you what
43

44
00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.170
I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and giving my
opinion a follow why we're doing
44

45
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.670
that. We're going to cover quite a
bit of content in this and hopefully you
45

46
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.470
really enjoy it as we work through
things.
