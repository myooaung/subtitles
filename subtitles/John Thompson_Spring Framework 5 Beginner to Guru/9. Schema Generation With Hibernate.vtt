00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.540
Alright now, what we want to do here is
create the schema for our MySQL database.
1

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.929
There's a couple different ways we
could skin this cat but what I want to
2

3
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.580
do is I want to use Hibernate to
generate it for us. So I've gone into the
3

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
application-dev.yml file, so this is
only going to run when the dev profile
4

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.060
is active. And what we can do is set up
some properties there. And you can see on
5

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.320
line 12, I've modified the YAML file to
include some properties for JavaX
6

7
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.100
Persistence so specifically in the
schema generation. So we're going to do a
7

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.809
create source of metadata which is going
to basically do reflection upon our
8

9
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.750
domains. Our domain entities. And we are
going to do a create, and then the create
9

10
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.700
target we're going to say I'm going to call
it guru_database_create.sql.
10

11
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.289
What this is going to do
is generate that file and the project
11

12
00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.760
route for us and we'll get that SQL file
generated. And from that, we'll be able to
12

13
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.060
run that inside of MySQL and generate
the schema the database tables and
13

14
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
relationships. So let's go ahead and run
that. So what do I want to do is come up
14

15
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.110
here, edit configurations, I'm going to go
in and set the active profile to dev.
15

16
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.460
Apply that, say okay, and we'll go ahead
and run that, and we'll see some chatter
16

17
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.740
there. MySQL is throwing some
warnings there. You saw it go by just as
17

18
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.829
an FYI, and we're getting an establishing
a SSL connection without the server, so
18

19
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.350
this is just the security warning. They
did mock down more to the MySQL, so we
19

20
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.009
could explore some of the actual server
identity so that that's a wild card that
20

21
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.130
were using. So in case you see that and
wondering what that is, so now we did get
21

22
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.100
it. It did fail as expected because the
schema isn't there yet. So let's go ahead
22

23
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.369
and take a look at the script that got
generated. We can see that it was
23

24
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
generated right here in the project
route. If I go in here and take a look,
24

25
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.970
now we can see that it's got a series of
SQL statements. And the one problem here
25

26
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.230
is that it's missing the semicolon. So I can't run it as a script, so it's a
26

27
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.130
kind of annoying little I'm doing an
air quotes feature. So I'm going in and
27

28
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.590
adding semicolons to this. Wasn't just a
few statements I'd cut this out. So we do
28

29
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.240
need to terminate these properly with a
semicolon, so we'll run as a script. So
29

30
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.080
now, I have that there. I can control copy
that and let's jump over to Sequel Pro.
30

31
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.320
And I will select in the dev database.
Go to the query window. See that
31

32
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.900
some of my testing results there and now
now I'm going to paste that in, and if I
32

33
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.040
highlight everything, I can come down
here and say Run Selection. You can see
33

34
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.570
that it runs it and then it creates our
database tables. Now when I come back
34

35
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.510
over here and I would start the
application, we can see that it will in
35

36
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.500
fact start up normally. And we actually
saw see how we got some inserts there.
36

37
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.600
So this is the bootstrap data that we are
loading up in the database so that net
37

38
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.709
is still kicking off and we are creating
that that database in the tables and
38

39
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.510
inserting it. So at this point our dev
profile is up and running. We probably
39

40
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.200
want to apply this also to the
production database. I'm going to do that
40

41
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.910
right now. So if you come in select the
production database and run the
41

42
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.340
selection, you can see that now we've set
up the production database as well with
42

43
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.820
the same SQL script. So right now our
application, just as a recap, you can see
43

44
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.560
because I restarted that, what's going to
happen inside of this little create
44

45
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.269
script know the way it works is it's
going to append to it. So not necessarily
45

46
00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.170
the best feature but for the initial
database creation that's going to be
46

47
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.640
fine. We don't want to be doing that
all the time. So going forward, I'll
47

48
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.860
probably comment this out. Should I do
that right now. So I'm going to comment
48

49
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.140
that out but when you run this yourself
uncomment this from the source and then
49

50
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.560
you'll be able to run that and generate
the database schema and set up your own
50

51
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.639
schema. So just a recap, now we have an H2
in memory database
51

52
00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.479
that going to get created each time and here we're
asking Hibernate to give us the creation
52

53
00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.499
SQL. So it's got a couple of rough
edges there because doesn't give us
53

54
00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:40.219
termination characters and it will
just keep appending to file over and
54

55
00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.400
over. So that's why I'm going to comment
that out, so this little script file
55

56
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.810
doesn't keep growing growing every time
we restart our dev database. But this is
56

57
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.550
a very handy way for us to generate that
database schema for our use.
