00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.850
You guys want to give you an alert at the end of this video.

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.180
There's going to be an update.

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.610
And what happened is in this video here I'm showing you how to do a multi multi module maven built and

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.480
what happened is with Spring Boot and to dot Oh that you can figure the plug in one way to not repackage

5
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.620
when we transition to two down one those configuration settings have changed just slightly as not bad

6
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.930
but I don't know which version people are going to be running on as I go through this.

7
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.180
Plus it the continuity I do show upgrading Spring Boot to that one later and a later video.

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.270
So there's there's a couple of things as far as preserving the continuity of this development project

9
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.310
but what's going to happen here is I'm going to have an update at the end of this video so we're going

10
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.150
to go through this video was shot on Spring Boot Type 2 to 0 3 if I remember right.

11
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.030
And people that are going through the course with two doubt one are having problems due to that settings

12
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.950
change or they're seeing no main class found.

13
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.420
And at the end of this video I'm going to show you how to update that.

14
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.910
And I'll have an update that just want to give you a heads up so if you do hit an issue where there's

15
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.270
no main class found watch a short clip at the end of this video I'll show you exactly how to update

16
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.540
things and continue on with the project.

17
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.870
In this video what we want to do is we want go in and create a multi module project and this is something

18
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.450
I want to demonstrate and mostly from experience as you get into more complex projects.

19
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.300
It's convenient to split them out into multiple modules.

20
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.390
And what I want to do here is split out the data model.

21
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.760
Eventually we will evolve this to be using hibernate and JPA and spring that on top of that but until

22
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.310
we do that we do want to split this out into its own module and we'll get things cooking in this project

23
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.850
so you can see how to do a multi module build inside of maven.

24
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.500
So it does get a little tricky with Spring Boot and I'm going to go ahead and start working on issue

25
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.720
number one.

26
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:16.090
So I come back over to Intel's J and what I can do is come over here to pet clinic and say new module

27
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.440
and I got maven highlighted I am going to say next

28
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.090
and we have the reverse domain of my domain.

29
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.250
Google does spring framework and what I want to do is pet clinic I'm just kind of called Pet Clinic

30
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.520
data and we can see that we are inheriting from the group I.D. and the version.

31
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:47.160
So I'm gonna go ahead and create that and now we can see that it wants to create and Pet Clinic and

32
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.320
Pet Clinic data so we can see that is correct.

33
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.660
And I like to keep things matching.

34
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.050
And that's just my own personal preference.

35
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.440
So now we're going to have the pet dash clinic dash data.

36
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.190
So I'm going to go ahead and create that

37
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.000
of course we'll be adding that and to get and we can see here the things that were created for us.

38
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.430
And so nothing too much here.

39
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.720
Go Set head and say import changes.

40
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.770
And now I also want to set up a web project.

41
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.070
It's a new module again we're going to use maven and only name these advanced archetypes so I'm gonna

42
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.050
go ahead and do that again.

43
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.780
Good we're going to inherit everything so we'll say next

44
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.250
so we can say Pet Clinic Web In this module will be the whole web application.

45
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.960
So I'll go ahead and say next here Yeah this is just my convention I like having the dashes in there.

46
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.490
Now we'll say finish and we will say yes we'll go ahead and import the changes and now you can see that

47
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.860
I have two modules and what we want to do is move some of this stuff up here.

48
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:22.150
So we now have the model and I'm going to take this pet clinic application and move him expand that

49
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.940
out I'm going to move that to the java folder in the web because the model is not going to be a whole

50
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:40.580
spring Boot application but we are going to want all the model in the data that moves that refactor

51
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.920
the

52
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.810
it's going to take a second to run.

53
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.080
So now you can see that Nat has moved up there

54
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.460
No I copied that

55
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.540
and I did a refresh on those additional classes went away.

56
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.180
So sometimes when you're remodeling and clicking dragging stuff inside ontology the changes don't necessarily

57
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.040
happen right away.

58
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.610
So now we can see that I have the pet cleaning data I have the model.

59
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.140
The classes that we created already there for the model and then the application.

60
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.980
Now let's clean up this a bit.

61
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.770
And I am going to take away actuator and put that in to the Web.

62
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.680
And the JPA that is green and definitely be part of the model.

63
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.960
So I have to add that there.

64
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.670
And generally it's pretty easy to take these out.

65
00:05:50.360 --> 00:06:00.390
So we definitely want the project Lombok and the database so those oh and put those in to the clinic

66
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:11.670
data.

67
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.650
Now give me a warning on the application.

68
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.720
So I am going to come up here.

69
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.830
I am just going package model.

70
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.680
Oh come on guys

71
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.460
bad refactor there.

72
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.400
So what I want to do is come here create new package

73
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.840
I'm gonna refactor that

74
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.370
and see here.

75
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.140
I'm getting a maven projects to be reinserted.

76
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.430
I'm going to click on a enable auto import and that is a setting that generally works pretty good inside

77
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.210
of ontology unless you get a really big project and you're on so hardware and then you might want to

78
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.310
turn that off because of re indexing can really bog down your system if you're doing a lot of changes.

79
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.940
But I'm gonna go ahead and enable that.

80
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.800
So automatically re index

81
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.460
and credit package here

82
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.900
and we'll move that into a proper package.

83
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.800
Let's go back to take a look at those palm.

84
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.430
So this has gone to these two dependencies will definitely be part of the web

85
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:50.290
and what we want to do here is our Web We Want to give that a dependency.

86
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:57.710
So now I am making the Pet Clinic Web have a dependency on I grabbed the wrong thing there

87
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.550
should be clinical data my mistake

88
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:19.240
and then we want to change this one's packaging OK so we are not necessarily being packaged his palm

89
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.650
which is exactly what we want

90
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.840
and let's take these last two dependencies and move those to web as well

91
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:43.040
and I'm going to copy over the test dependencies move out into Dade as well.

92
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.570
Now the one thing that we want to do here with our impact click data module is we want to package that

93
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.640
as a jar.

94
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.870
So what we want to do is come over here and grab the build plug in.

95
00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:01.570
I'm just going to copy that for right now and take that up to the dead

96
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.070
and hear what we want to do is add in some parameters

97
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:23.910
in our executions execution and then the goals.

98
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.000
The goal of repackage what we want to do is give that a configuration stuff

99
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.760
so we can see their intelligently and total sense went along

100
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:49.010
super we're getting a warning it looks like it's okay now.

101
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.340
So let's go ahead and run this.

102
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.130
So I'm going to do a clean

103
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:03.160
and we can see that the pet clinic came first then data then web.

104
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.530
So let's go ahead and package this.

105
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.160
So we're running them having the whole package I'm running it right from inside of ontology.

106
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:17.990
And what this is going to do is first that's going to go in and compile everything and pet clinic and

107
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.100
then in data so pet clinics fairly empty now then Pet Clinic data.

108
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:30.580
That's where data types are and then web and we'll be building out the web module as we go forward and

109
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.440
then we can come in here.

110
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:39.660
If I go into the target folder of data we can see that it didn't build a jar and the whole reason I

111
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:47.190
did this configuration here is because by default Spring Boot is going to want to package a fat executable

112
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.450
jar.

113
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.980
So we'll include it in all the dependencies.

114
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.740
And in this example we want a jar with just dark classes in there.

115
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.780
And from this module without this we'd get a fat jar which it wouldn't do not want.

116
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.170
Now we have a lean jar with just our classes in it.

117
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:13.710
And what happens is when we build this project this jar is going to include in the jar from the the

118
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.640
pet clinic data.

119
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:25.080
So the pet cleaning Web is going to include the pet clinic data jar so just take a quick look here.

120
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.070
The new module resources.

121
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.520
We want to move those up to web.

122
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680
Copy that.

123
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.830
And also we don't don't really need.

124
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.070
Application properties up there just yet.

125
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:56.100
And then our one test we can go ahead and move that to our Java test folder just refactoring

126
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.460
factor

127
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:09.730
to the test got moved up to the pet clinic web folder

128
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.930
and actually did not

129
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.870
do the directory move this time

130
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.820
so that as the result that we wanted I was just moving a little too quick on the refactoring there.

131
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:53.520
And here in the the root directory we really no longer need the source.

132
00:12:53.530 --> 00:13:00.130
So when we have just a palm module that's best to just get rid of that so I'm going to go ahead and

133
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.310
delete him.

134
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.150
So now we can see that we have pet clinic data pet clinic Web

135
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.180
we're still declaring some properties in here.

136
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.670
We have empty dependencies tag I may refactor that.

137
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:22.690
Coming up in a future video but for right now I think this is looking pretty good so I am going to say

138
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.420
that we will refactor this coming up as needed.

139
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.310
But this establishes our multi module project.

140
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.260
So here you have a project top level is as a pet clinic.

141
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.300
Some people would call this parent as the parent Pom not.

142
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:47.980
I have two modules declared pet clinic data pet clinic web and see that the modules are here and not

143
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:56.690
as corresponding to this artefact I.D. and the dependencies I split up the dependencies based on what

144
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.740
we are going to need.

145
00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:07.790
So the pet clinic data is going to handle all the data and so we will need H2 Spring Boot starter data

146
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:14.440
JP A minus girl eventually Lombok to annotate our classes we'll be seeing that in an upcoming video

147
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:22.180
and then some testing and then we had to bring in the Spring Boot maven plugin explicitly because for

148
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:29.170
this module we want to go in and reconfigure it to not repackage and again that's what we're doing right

149
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:29.640
here.

150
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:37.360
And the executions configuration the pet clinic web we will be building this out for the web application

151
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:42.780
so we'll be putting all the web stuff in there and we can see here.

152
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:50.320
We have a similar palm built out the first dependency I'm saying I want the data then actuate our time

153
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.080
leave start a web dev tools and then also test.

154
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:59.480
So we bring in all our dependencies for a typical spring web application.

155
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.400
And this concludes setting up a multi module project.

156
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.390
I'm going to go ahead and commit this and to get home so I'm going to come and click and say commit

157
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.460
directory and we can see that we have a bunch of changes that we are pushing

158
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.650
and again I'm getting is GitHub command closes.

159
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.260
No one is getting close out.

160
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:28.730
Issue number one and I'm just going to optimize imports and we'll do a commit and push in one swoop

161
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:35.820
I can get away with it because I am the only person working in this repository can see that the push

162
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:36.660
was successful.

163
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.400
Now if I come back over here we can see that it already went close so that that happened fairly quick.

164
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.880
So that is done.

165
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.500
And in the next video we will tackle another issue.

166
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.720
Don't touch me.

167
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.850
Right.

168
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:56.400
This is the update for Spring Boot 2 that I told you about at the beginning of the video.

169
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.680
So I've got the spring pit Pet Clinic project up right now.

170
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:07.720
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to come up here and do a right click and go to get what I tell my

171
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.050
dogs quite often and get means go someplace else don't be here.

172
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:12.760
Let's see here.

173
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.160
And then we want to do show history on it.

174
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:24.520
And me try to expand this up a little bit and you can see the different chickens and I am on the pet

175
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.500
clinic data maven palm so just to orient you.

176
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:39.110
So we have the data web so we have the the parent palm and then I am in this Palm under Pet Clinic data.

177
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.920
So this is the one I'm showing the Maven history for.

178
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.500
And when I went and upgraded to Java eleven and this is in a future video where I show all the steps

179
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.470
to upgrade it a few things changed.

180
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:57.550
And one of the things I did and the parent as I update it to Spring Boot to that one and that changed

181
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:05.890
some things and in going through this also this configuration for the Maven SharePoint via plugin was

182
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:14.260
wrong and here this update here for the spring boot plugin.

183
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:21.090
What happened was we no longer needed to have this Skip configuration in here.

184
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.590
So let's see if we still have the plugin.

185
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:30.130
So we still have this and actually we can get a get rid of this section as well in hindsight.

186
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:36.820
So that this entire plugin configuration probably can go away but the key point is we were doing repackage

187
00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.620
and we had a configuration property of skip that is no longer taking effect.

188
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:49.380
But what we need to do is come up here Spring Boot repackage Skip and set that property.

189
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:57.130
So if we go into property set this to Spring Boot package skip what's going to happen as we will see

190
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.670
this and actually recreate the air for you just in case.

191
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:08.830
So I mean come in here and uncommon are common that out and let's come over to maven

192
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:21.020
and I'm gonna come up to the data and let's run the package go on the I want to show you the error that

193
00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.290
people have been seeing.

194
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:29.570
What's happening is what's maven is trying to do with Spring Boot is trying to do a repackage on it

195
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:37.550
and by repackage it's going to make that big goober jar or fat jar that's going to contain all the dependency

196
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.900
so it's trying to do the repackaging and looking for the Spring Boot main class to make an executable

197
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.610
jar and not finding it.

198
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:52.930
The problem is for data we want that to be a jar just a regular thin jar and not have to wait Goober

199
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.210
jar.

200
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:57.920
So by doing this by restoring this property.

201
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:03.630
And now if I run the package go on it and you'll see the piles normally.

202
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:10.070
So you can see that net comp. normally I'm gonna count this out one more time just to highlight the

203
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.550
error

204
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.370
so a lot of people have been running into this error.

205
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:25.720
You can see right here error failed to repackage and so on Harris was unable to find main class.

206
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.510
So in this section here unable to find main class and that's the problem that we're chasing down that's

207
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.550
what we are correcting in this video.

208
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:40.350
So by setting this property like so then we'll run that again mean I can complete normally.

209
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:47.550
So you just need to go into the palm if you're running on Spring Boot to doubt one spring in a new version

210
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.220
of the Spring Boot maven plug.

211
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.900
You need to set this property to skip the repackaging of it.
