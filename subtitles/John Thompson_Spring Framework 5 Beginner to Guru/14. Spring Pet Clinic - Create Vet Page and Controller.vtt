00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.000
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and implement the Vet Index Page and
1

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.540
controller. We're just going to put a
stub of the index page in for right now
2

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
just like we did on the main index page.
What we want to do is come over here
3

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.390
to IntelliJ. I'm actually going to
stop Spring Boot. I already had that
4

5
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.539
running. We'll shut that down. We can
see that we have the templates,
5

6
00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.279
index.html. What we want to do is
Vets. We'll convert a directory
6

7
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.790
called vets.
7

8
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.240
I'm going to go ahead and come in
here and say create New HTML File.
8

9
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.039
There's a couple school of thought
on this. You can do something specific.
9

10
00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.949
You could say that List is for the name
or index. I am choosing to use index. That
10

11
00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.480
is my personal style. It's perfectly fine
to use something named just in my head
11

12
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.780
the way it works if you go to slash out
of just the root of any web application,
12

13
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.840
the index.html traditionally what is
rendered. I'm going to the path
13

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.909
of vets and index.html is what's going
to be rendered. That's just my
14

15
00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.720
personal belief. You may do it any way
you want. But what I want to do here is I
15

16
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.460
cannot remember that whole xml namespace
tag so I'm going to grab that.
16

17
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.320
Point that into here.
17

18
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.800
You can say a List of Vets for the title.
18

19
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
h1
19

20
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.370
th
20

21
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.070
text and I'm going to say single quote
21

22
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.530
List of Vets
22

23
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.740
and say like so. I'll make a little bit
23

24
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.930
different there. So now, we can see that
get rendered and now what we also need
24

25
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.800
to do is create our controller. I'm
going to say a New Class,
25

26
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.920
VetController. Add that to Git.
26

27
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.700
Now, we'll make that a Controller.
27

28
00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.810
I'm just calling indexer, actually, let's call it listVets.
That will not take anything for
28

29
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.200
right now.
29

30
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.330
What we're going to return is
a string of vets/index.
30

31
00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.159
What this is doing is it's coming
back and it's returning that string
31

32
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.239
vet /index. That's kind of correspond to
inside of templates the folder vets and
32

33
00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.170
the Thymeleaf template file index.html
so that's how that's going to work.
33

34
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.360
The last thing that we need to do
here is come over here and say
34

35
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.379
RequestMapping.
35

36
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.600
We're going to do is /vets.
36

37
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.740
I'm just making this a little
friendly for our users. I'll say also
37

38
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.420
/vets/
38

39
00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.900
and that's just a little bit of polishing
down there. I could just map the single
39

40
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.489
path of /vets and just ignore if
somebody types in vets/index and
40

41
00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.340
vets/index.html. Just do the same
41

42
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.739
there, either is perfectly fine. 
Let's go ahead and test this. I got
42

43
00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.469
that. Let's go ahead and run the
application. You can see it start up and
43

44
00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.280
compile.
44

45
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.800
We'll see the pass that
45

46
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.930
maps going by, and now we can see here,
highlight this line here, we can see that
46

47
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.040
vets is now mapped as we expected. 
Let's come over here to Chrome.
47

48
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.700
If I come over here and do
/vets
48

49
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.230
I have Lists of Vets displayed in the
browser. Let's see here, that was
49

50
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:44.070
#seven. So now we'll go over and
close out #seven.
50

51
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.840
I will Commit and Push that.
Say Push.
51

52
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.670
Come over here. As soon as 
that pushes complete, we will see that
52

53
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.640
change to closed, and there's closed.
