00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.340
In this video we're going to go ahead and configure spring mock MVC to work with spring rust docs.

2
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.640
Now up on the screen I have the official documentation from Spring rust docs and want to point out a

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.020
couple of things because we're gonna go in and do something different from what's in the documentation

4
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.610
that's currently available.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.610
I show you a different technique that I think is a little little easier and a little slicker here.

6
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.600
What we need to do is we need to pass in this documentation configuration so this is going to configure

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.810
the spring rest docs to work with a spring mock MVC.

8
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.670
So we have to add that and when that mock MVC component is built our problem is is that the way our

9
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.360
tests are set up right now is we're asking the spring context to give us a pre configured mock MVC so

10
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.640
we would have to refactor our test to not do that or I'm going to show you a technique to do that but

11
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.460
I did want to talk about this and highlight it because this is one technique mock MVC there's actually

12
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.500
several different ways that you can work with spring Mark MVC.

13
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.600
I've shown a variety we are on one where we are using a test space within Spring Boot and the Spring

14
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.190
Boot test utilities and here this is now using Spring Boot to bring that in that's actually asking spring

15
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.780
for a web application context and is going to build it that way.

16
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.680
I'm going to show you a different technique for this.

17
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.270
And then here the other thing that we need to point out is we need to extend our J unit five tests so

18
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.260
we can see down here we are doing extend with the rest documentation class and optionally the spring

19
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.700
extension and we'll talk about that when I get over to Intel J as well because we no longer need to

20
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.050
do that in the setup that we have.

21
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.670
Now if you're using J Unit 4 you do need to bring in a rule and that is documented here.

22
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.450
I'm only going to be covering J Unit 5 in the course because that's kind of the direction the entire

23
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.470
industry right now is to start adopting J.

24
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.140
Unit 5.

25
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.520
But if you do have Geno for testing you need to work with a you can add in a role it's pretty pretty

26
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.250
straightforward so we jump over to Intel J now and show you this alternative configuration.

27
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.920
So here I am telling you I'm going to go open up that test.

28
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.660
So here's our beer controller test and what's happening here is we have the Spring MVC test and this

29
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.090
is bringing up the Spring Boot test place which is just going to be setting up the web environment for

30
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.010
testing.

31
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.490
You can see on line thirty one I'm asking for an order wired instance of mock MVC.

32
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.610
So what's happening here is Spring Boot is going to auto configure that mock MVC instance for this and

33
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.880
there's an addition to rest stocks what we can do is we've just come in and we do auto configure rest

34
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.970
docs like so and now that is going to auto configure what I showed you on the documentation that's going

35
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.930
to do automatically for us.

36
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.170
Now one other thing that we do need to add here is we'll come in and say extend with.

37
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.280
We need this robust documentation extension.

38
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.180
Now the documentation talked about the spring extension.

39
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.180
Let's show you here I'm going to drill into the web MVC test annotation.

40
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.960
So in here you can see that is already being done and this is a fairly recent addition to spring to

41
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.280
add in that extend with to the test annotations I want to say that right now it's May 2019.

42
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.970
I'm pretty sure this happened in 2019.

43
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.770
It was like release earlier this year where they added in the spring extension so it hasn't been there

44
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
for that long and you'll see when you start looking at June 5 and Spring Boot you'll still see a lot

45
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.440
of people recommending to put that extend within.

46
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.290
And you do not need to add that anymore and that is a recent addition.

47
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.340
So that is there now.

48
00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.910
So let's just recap what we've done here is we are taking in an auto wired mock MVC instance firm Spring

49
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.410
Boot and we are telling the framework online 30 to auto configure rest docs and then we still need to

50
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.120
add in the rest documentation extension.

51
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.930
So now what this has done at this point are Mark and B.C. is all set up for spring run stocks and we

52
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.510
can start adding test commands and we'll start covering that in the next video we'll get into how to

53
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.770
start documenting our endpoints and using a spring rest docs.
