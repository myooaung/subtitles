Okay I want to welcome you to a bonus
section of the course. Each module here
1

2
00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:13.090
in the course is a cookbook section, like
I'm kind of calling it a Spring Boot
2

3
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.680
cookbook because I'm taking a common
application, a simple web application but
3

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.660
showing you how to configure that
application for different databases,
4

5
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.769
different message servers. So I'm using
all kinds of popular stuff everything
5

6
00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.779
from MySQL to MongoDB to Oracle. I'm
hoping to give you a toolset in this
6

7
00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.879
little cookbook that you can have as a
go-to after taking the course. So if you
7

8
00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:44.470
have DB2, God, I hope you're not using DB2,
but if you have DB2 or even worse
8

9
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.409
something from Microsoft, hey you do have a
cookbook here of ready-made stuff where
9

10
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.949
you can see how to set up Spring Boot to
connect to these different technologies
10

11
00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.040
and work with these different
technologies. So I hope you enjoy this
11

12
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.150
little bonus section these are just, I'm
going to try to grow this with different
12

13
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.810
technologies as time goes on so if you
have a reference point to go to and
13

14
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.950
everything, you're going to get a code
review in each module and each module is
14

15
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.060
going to have links to source code and
GitHub. So you'll have a starting point to
15

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.800
build Spring Boot applications to
connect to a variety of different technologies.
