00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.179
Okay.
Installation of Docker. I got some
1

2
00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.310
challenges here because I run OS X. I do
not have the various flavors of Windows.
2

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.740
On Linux, Dockers are very simple to do
especially Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It's
3

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
a really no brainer to install. So in
this section of the course, I have an
4

5
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
assignment for you to get a Docker
installed on your particular operating
5

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.230
system. Now on Linux, Docker runs natively. No problems at all. Older versions of
6

7
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210
Windows will require VirtualBox be
installed for you to run Docker, so that
7

8
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
there are some workarounds on Docker with Windows because Docker does not run
8

9
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
natively under Windows. Now in Windows 10, that has changed a little bit, where I
9

10
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
believe, Docker will run natively in the
background, but it will still work with
10

11
00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.440
Windows to spool up VMs to run or Linux
VMs to run Docker Container. Some
11

12
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.159
limitations of the Windows platform,
where the Windows is not fully
12

13
00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
compatible with Docker and Docker
Containers. That's really a Linux thing.
13

14
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.840
Now OS X, if you're using OS X, underneath
the covers of OS X, is a flavor of
14

15
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.119
UNIX very close to Linux. There
is a native port for Docker to run Docker
15

16
00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.180
Containers on an OS X environment. So the
OS X guys, you're gonna have a real
16

17
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.829
easy time, Windows users, you're gonna
have a little bit harder time, and if
17

18
00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.750
you're a Linux guy, you have no problem
at all. So in this section my assignment
18

19
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.150
to you, to get Docker up  installed on
your system. Get that working. In
19

20
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.750
the next part of this course, we're gonna take a look at using Docker for Hello
20

21
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780
World.
