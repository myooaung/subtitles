Alright! In this video, we are going to
have an assignment. Get some hands-on
1

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
experience with Swagger. And what we wanna do is go through and customize that
2

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
vendor endpoint. We're gonna use the
annotations that we saw demonstrated in
3

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.510
the last video. And we're gonna go
through, and what I want you to do is use
4

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.630
these @Api annotations and customize that.
Just get comfortable using these
5

6
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.840
annotations to update the API data,
that's gonna be displayed on the
6

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.050
Swagger HTML. So, what I want you to do is
go through and use @Api to update the
7

8
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.940
overall description of the endpoint, and
then, our controller has several methods
8

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.640
there for the API operation. So obviously,
we wanna use @ApiOperation to
9

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.629
update some of the operations that are
available there, and go ahead and add in
10

11
00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
some notes, just so you can see how to
use that. Then finally, we have the
11

12
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.870
@ApiModelProperty, so we can use that
annotation to update some of the
12

13
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.489
descriptions of the properties, and go
ahead and give that a try. And in the
13

14
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.909
next video, I'll go through and
demonstrate the use of these one more
14

15
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.630
time, so you're comfortable using these
annotations, just in case you are
15

16
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.830
uncomfortable using them. So, we'll go
through, and in the next video, we'll do a
16

17
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.439
live coding operation and step through
each one of these.
