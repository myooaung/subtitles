00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.960
Alright, in this module of the course, we're
gonna take a look at KiteMatic. Now,
1

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.289
KiteMatic is a GUI tool for running
images Lena from Docker Hub. So the last
2

3
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.439
section of the course, or last
module of course, we took the.. what's
3

4
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.150
up on Docker Hub. KiteMatic is a GUI
tool. I'm gonna look at it in OS X. I
4

5
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.439
hear there's one available for Windows. I
personally have not used the Windows
5

6
00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.079
flavor of KiteMatic, but we're gonna
take a quick use look at KiteMatic for
6

7
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.000
OS X, and just see how easy it is to work
with Docker images. Okay, so what we're
7

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.649
gonna do is take a look at KiteMatic
for OS X. You can see, I'm still in
8

9
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.829
Chrome looking at the MySQL repository,
and what I wanna do is I've 
9

10
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.649
installed Docker natively for OS X. I can
see Docker is running. What I wanna
10

11
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.140
do is come in here, and I wanna open up
KiteMatic. Yeah, you can see that it
11

12
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.880
comes up, and this shows us a lot of the
available images here, so we can run
12

13
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.250
Jenkins, so we can run Postgres,
ElasticSearch, Solr, Ubuntu, CentOS
13

14
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.369
is out there too. So that there's a lot
of different things that we can run, a
14

15
00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.020
lot of interesting stuff for us Java
developers, think so can run. One
15

16
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.530
thing I wanna do is this hello world
for KiteMatic. What I'm gonna do is
16

17
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.340
I'm just gonna come over here and click
on CREATE, and it's gonna go out
17

18
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.610
connected Docker Hub, download it, and
start it up for me. And we can see that
18

19
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.970
it's giving us a little web preview.
I wanna show you a couple of settings
19

20
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.729
here, and what's happened here, is this
shows us the container ID, the name of it,
20

21
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.130
some environment variables, and if we
look here, now that we're gonna get into
21

22
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
this later into the course more in-depth,
but it has a Docker port of 80, that's
22

23
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.850
the internal container and that is
mapped out to 32770
23

24
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.700
at localhost. And this is important to set up
a little Linux server, web server that's
24

25
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.490
running for us. I'm gonna come back
over here to Chrome, paste and go,
25

26
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.550
that localhost port. And boom! Now I am
running a web page out of that local
26

27
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
Docker container. The important concept to
remember is that port 80 is mapped to
27

28
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.900
port 32770. If you try this at home, I've noticed experimenting with this, that port
28

29
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.860
is kind of random, so it just give you a tip if you're following along at home for
this. You wanna go out and set up
29

30
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.670
that port there. So, check out that port
mapping, so from here, click on the image,
30

31
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.700
go to Settings, and then Ports, you'll
be able to see that port there.
31

32
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.530
Alright in this module of course, you're
able to see how easy it is to use
32

33
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.940
KiteMatic - to go out and find a Docker
image, that we wanna use out of Docker
33

34
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.290
hub, and start it up on our local machine.
So just a few mouse clicks away, we can
34

35
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.580
have a Docker container running
something out of Docker Hub, almost
35

36
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.470
instantaneously on our local system. So a
very cool feature, especially when we're
36

37
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.340
developing stuff, we can spool things up
pretty darn quick, for our local
37

38
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.180
development environment.
