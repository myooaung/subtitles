00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:06.001
Alright, in this video,
2

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.856
we have an assignment for you.
3

4
00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:12.178
What we wanna do is refactor our Ingredient Service.
4

5
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.289
So, that stands between the IngredientRepository
5

6
00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.627
and our IngredientController.
6

7
00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:19.391
And what we wanna do is change it over
7

8
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.974
to use the Reactive Repository.
8

9
00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.290
Right now, it's using the regular Mongo
9

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.957
so we wanna go Reactive on it.
10

11
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:33.754
I also wanna refactor it to Return Reactive Types.
11

12
00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:36.416
So, we could stop there but we wanna get this
12

13
00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.419
whole stack going reactive so let's get this thing
13

14
00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:41.453
refactored to return reactive types.
14

15
00:00:41.453 --> 00:00:42.540
That means you're gonna have to modify
15

16
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.477
the IngredientController where this is utilized
16

17
00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:49.673
to put a block on the return types
17

18
00:00:49.673 --> 00:00:52.154
so we get the data out of there.
18

19
00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:54.587
And then, of course, we wanna update the unit tests.
19

20
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:59.202
I suggest you refactor the interfaces first and the types
20

21
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:01.537
and then update the unit tests.
21

22
00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:03.795
Make sure that those still behave properly.
22

23
00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:07.197
And then go ahead and refactor the service itself
23

24
00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:09.632
and also the controller.
24

25
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:12.718
So, go ahead and do that and in the next video
25

26
00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:15.023
we will go through everything, step by step.
26

27
00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:17.631
I think it might be a little bit of a challenge for you
27

28
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.034
because this reactive stuff is fairly pretty fresh
28

29
00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:22.149
but please give it a try.
29

30
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.533
Don't worry if it's too hard,
30

31
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.250
next video we are gonna go through it step by step
31

32
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.807
and start getting you more and more accustomed
32

33
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:31.807
to these reactive types.
