00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.490
Alright, we are going to look at Unit Testing or testing Spring Framework in
1

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.180
this section of the course. When I was
originally planning out the course, what
2

3
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.689
I was going to do is, I was going to
create a really beefy section on just
3

4
00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
testing. But as I start developing the
course, I kind of change my mind a little
4

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.519
bit and what I wanna do in this
section of the course is, give you a good
5

6
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
solid understanding and overview of how
we test Spring. And then going forward in
6

7
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
the course, what we'll do is we'll do a
methodology called test-driven
7

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
development. And through this, we will
generate tests as we go along in the
8

9
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
course. So what I wanna do in this
section is lay down a foundation about
9

10
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.430
testing Spring. And then as we progress
through the course, we will be bringing
10

11
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
in a lot of the advanced features. So
what we're gonna do is take a look at Unit
11

12
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
Testing. We're gonna be using JUnit
and then we'll get through some of the
12

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.220
fundamentals for testing Spring and at
the end, I'm gonna introduce you to
13

14
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.750
Continuous Integration build. So this is
all best practices. We'll do 
14

15
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.380
test-driven development and we'll get a
Continuous Integration builds going. So
15

16
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.820
this will give you some very real-world
enterprise-class development experience.
16

17
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
It is what we wanna do because this is
really best practices to be doing
17

18
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.369
test-driven development and having
Continuous Integration builds. We can
18

19
00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.829
utilize CircleCI for Continuous
Integration. So I think this is gonna
19

20
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.920
be a really good foundation for the rest
of the stuff we're gonna be covering
20

21
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310
in the course.
