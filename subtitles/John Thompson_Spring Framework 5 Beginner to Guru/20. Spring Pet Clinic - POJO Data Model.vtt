00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.540
Alright in this video what we are going to do is we're going to start implementing the pet clinic model and
1

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.840
this is a data model. So you can see here
2

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.410
issue number two here. I have implemented pet clinic pojo model. So POJO is a plain old Java object.
3

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.800
And what we're going to be doing in the course as we progress here is we're going to take the
4

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.810
POJOs and eventually we're going to get them to be entities that will store in the database. But for right
5

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.190
now we're just going to create them as plain old Java objects.
6

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.750
And the issue with tracker in GitHub is a little bit limited.
7

8
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.930
You can't mark things in process but I just checked this here.
8

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.690
What I can do is I can assign that to myself and this will help indicate to others if they're working
9

10
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.790
on a project that this is in process that I'm actually working on this.
10

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.480
If you're using a tracker like Jira, you can actually bring things in process so you can see who's working
11

12
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.850
out what. Jira is a much more robust issue tracker.
12

13
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.410
Actually I'm thinking about a whole course on Jira because it is a wonderful tool. But that's a sidetrack.
13

14
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.860
What we're going to do right now is we're going to take a look at implementing the pet clinic.
14

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.200
We're going to start the model. We're not going to flush everything outright now but let's take a look
15

16
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.660
at what this Spring Pet Clinic has done.
16

17
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.480
And we have a base entity called person. We're not going to get into the base entity. This has to do with
17

18
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.130
the persistence but we do want to create a person with first name and last name so let's go ahead and
18

19
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.010
do that.
19

20
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.720
And we do have inheritance happening here.
20

21
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.190
So we have a person in the pet clinic. That is extended to the vet and also the owner.
21

22
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.170
So we're gonna go ahead and implement that in our project right now.
22

23
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.700
I'm going to toggle over to IntelliJ.
23

24
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.860
Bring up IntelliJ and we can see that I have the project here. We see that we have the pet clinic
24

25
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.210
and I'm going to go in and create a new package. Spell model right.
25

26
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.430
Now in that, let's go ahead and implement a Java class and create a class called Person.
26

27
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.860
And I am going to add that to Git.
27

28
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.940
So we had two properties there our first name and last name. I got a typo there. So now I've got my POJO for person
28

29
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.600
first name last name and what I can do in IntelliJ is I can do a command N. Command if you're using
29

30
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:50.270
Mac OS X and then I can come down and say generate getter and setter and IntelliJ will self generate
30

31
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.820
those for us.
31

32
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.190
So there's my person class. I'm going to see here that we have that and now let's go ahead and implement the
32

33
00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.580
vet.
33

34
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.830
So we're gonna go ahead and extend the person.
34

35
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.980
I'm not going to add additional properties of that right now. And then we can also say owner.
35

36
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:34.390
That also extends Person. And now let's go ahead and implement the pet.
36

37
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.620
Let's take a look at how they implement the actual pet here.
37

38
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.390
So the pet has a birthday, pet type, and owner.
38

39
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.760
So let's go ahead and implement those properties.
39

40
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.650
I'm not gonna get into visits right now. I'll add those in the future video. So pet.
40

41
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.870
So you can see here that I'm implementing pet type and I just did an option enter there in IntelliJ and
41

42
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.460
I can say create class pet type which is exactly what I want to do.
42

43
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.940
And IntelliJ is asking me where I want to create that so I do want to create that on the model.
43

44
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.330
So we can see that that generate that.
44

45
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.990
So that pet type owner and also birthdate.
45

46
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:45.020
I'm going to do a command N and I want to generate getters and setters for that. So now we have a basic
46

47
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.470
POJO there that allows that.
47

48
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.890
And let's take a quick look at what we have here so we have pet type owner.
48

49
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.680
Let's take a quick look at pet type and that extends and named entity.
49

50
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.960
I'm not going to expand on that right now. Actually
50

51
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.980
I'll get the pet type a name.
51

52
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.170
Command N getter and setter.
52

53
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.280
This is our basic model. Toggle back over here.
53

54
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.120
You can see here we have a lot of annotations and these annotations are involving JPA mappings.
54

55
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.830
I'm not going to get into those right now. We will see that coming up in the course. I'm just establishing
55

56
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:39.020
the basic model. So this gives us her our basic model. So again we have a person. The person is
56

57
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.260
the base class.
57

58
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:50.600
So first name last name owner and that extend person and then we have a pet that has a property of owner
58

59
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.460
and it also has a pet type to name the type of the pet and like is this amount dynamic capabilities there.
59

60
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.440
So this is giving us a very basic model. Right now I'm just going to establish the POJO model.
60

61
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.270
This gives us something to work with coming up in the course. As we progress we are going to enhance
61

62
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.580
these classes to be entities that will persist to the database.
62

63
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.190
But for right now we're just going to hold those on as POJOs.
63

64
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.570
So I'm going to go ahead and commit this.
64

65
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.410
Adding POJOs.
65

66
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.860
These are just the initial add. What I can do with GitHub is I can say closes
66

67
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:42.470
Number two. I'm going to go ahead and before I do that one thing I prefer is to optimize imports and
67

68
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:48.360
turn off the code analysis and to dos that runs a little bit faster for me.
68

69
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.410
Some people like to put to do comments in their code to remind them to do stuff. That is a habit
69

70
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.350
that I'll do a part see me do that.
70

71
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.350
Coming up in this.
71

72
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.050
But for right now I'm going to say close is number two and I'm going to do a commit and push. This is going
72

73
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.720
to push it up to GitHub.
73

74
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:12.080
So here's the push action. I'm going to add in the POJOs and we can see down at the bottom I got a
74

75
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.060
little spinning spinning bar. It pushes successful.
75

76
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:22.330
Now let's come on over here and you can see that it's here.
76

77
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.450
That should be closed now.
77

78
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:32.850
You can see that number two dropped off like that because in the commit comment I said closes number
78

79
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:40.510
two. We can see that the commit happened because I reference that and in GitHub we can see that the
79

80
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.790
classes that I actually had.
80

81
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:50.570
So this gives us a change log of what happened and this is why we are using issues here because we can
81

82
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.720
see that I said implement the pet clinic POJO model.
82

83
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.460
And now I have a git commit ID that is related to the source code of what we actually changed here.
83

84
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.780
So that completes this task and I will have more coming up as we develop our Spring Framework Guru Pet
84

85
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.080
Clinic.
