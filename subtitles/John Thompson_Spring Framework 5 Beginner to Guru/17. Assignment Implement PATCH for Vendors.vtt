00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.090
In this video, we have another assignment
and this time we're going to go ahead
1

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.250
and implement a PATCH action for the
vendors. And obviously, we want to create
2

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.930
a new endpoint for the PATCH action and
add in some conditional logic for the
3

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.580
updating a vendor. I want you to use
test-driven development again, and we
4

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
want to implement the Mockito verifies
action. Make sure that, that conditional
5

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.340
logic is occurring properly. In the
last video, you saw me switch over to
6

7
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.090
static imports. Maybe you already did
this in your codebase, but it does make
7

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.149
the code a little bit cleaner. So, I'm
going to switch over to that going forward
8

9
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.960
using the static imports with Mockito
for the behavior driven development
9

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
stuff, that we've been utilizing so far
in the section of the course. I'd like
10

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.300
you to do that as well. And now, in the
next video, I'm going to implement this
11

12
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.320
and just as a reminder, the patch is a
pretty nebulous thing, as far as RESTful
12

13
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.480
API is there going. So, I'm going to do an
implementation of it. You don't have to
13

14
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
check all the properties. Remember, right,
the Vendor object has three
14

15
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.080
different properties on it. I'm more
concerned about you implementing the
15

16
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.150
business logic to go in implement that
conditional logic, and get the testing
16

17
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.830
around that. So, that's a primary goal of
this assignment. One is to be able to do
17

18
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.570
the PatchMapping, and then also, write
the test along with the proper
18

19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
verifications inside the test using
Mockito. And in the next video, I'll go
19

20
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.909
through and step through my
implementation of this for you, and we'll
20

21
00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.409
take that step by step.
