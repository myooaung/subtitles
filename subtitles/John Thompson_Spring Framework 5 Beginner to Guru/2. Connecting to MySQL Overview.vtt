00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.870
Alright! In this video, we are going to
take a closer look at how we connect
1

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.350
to MySQL, so there's a number of
different options there. I want to talk
2

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.930
about it a little more in-depth. So
there's two primary types of connections
3

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.919
that we're going to be dealing with. One
is what we call a local connection.
4

5
00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.539
You're going to be connecting to MySQL from
the command line on the machine that is
5

6
00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.909
running MySQL. So the MySQL server
software is running on the same machine.
6

7
00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.720
How it connects is really going to be
dependent upon your operating system.
7

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.140
There are different options for
different operating systems. I'm not
8

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.440
going to get into that rabbit hole right
now. But understand you're going to be
9

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.320
running in a command line talking to
MySQL directly on that machine. Now
10

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.420
you do also have the option of a remote
and client connection. This is probably
11

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.190
by the far the vast majority of how
clients are going to be connecting to
12

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.199
MySQL. They're going to be running on a
different computer, a different server,
13

14
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.769
laptop, whatever, and they will be
connecting to MySQL that way.
14

15
00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.640
This is a direct connection so don't
think about like using a web page as
15

16
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.619
connecting MySQL because you're
connecting to the web server and not the
16

17
00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.850
database server directly so that the web
server would be talking to the database
17

18
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.159
server on your behalf. This is talking
about getting a direct connection to
18

19
00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.409
MySQL. Now you can actually do this on
the same machine running MySQL through
19

20
00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.750
the network layer or you can connect to
the MySQL server from a different
20

21
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.299
machine over the network, so both are
very common use cases. Now we talked a
21

22
00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.890
little bit about the client protocols
that there are a number of protocols
22

23
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.579
that MySQL does support. TCP/IP is the
most common and that is what we are
23

24
00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.360
going to be looking at in this course.
Socket is a very Unix, so Unix, OS X and
24

25
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.640
Linux, they are all POSIX based
operating systems, so they will have the
25

26
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.960
socket option. Then, Pipe and Memory.
Those are going to be Windows specific
26

27
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.069
connection techniques. But the one that
spans everything and the one that we
27

28
00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.630
will be using inside this course is
TCP/IP. If you're a little bit new to
28

29
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.980
networking, TCP is Transmission Control
Protocol and IP stands for Internet
29

30
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.380
Protocol. Now this works in conjunction
with DNS, which is considered a domain
30

31
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.120
name service so this is going to
associate an IP address an Internet
31

32
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.900
Protocol address with a human readable
name. So like google.com it's actually a
32

33
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.480
human readable name for the IP address
of 216.58.218.110 so that is the
33

34
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.230
actual Internet address of google.com.
Now localhost's IP address of 127.0.0.1
34

35
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.740
and we will be seeing that in this
course, that's why I'm bringing it up.
35

36
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.220
The other thing that we need to
understand is a port. This is like a
36

37
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.900
logical connection endpoint of an IP
address. So a port is a way I'm going to go
37

38
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.030
to this address, I'm going to talk to you
with this language of X. It's kind of
38

39
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.780
like the protocol but you also have a
listener there, so you want to go to
39

40
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.110
this port and you're expecting Fred to
be there and Fred happens to know
40

41
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.240
Spanish so you're going to go to that port
and talk to Fred in Spanish. So that's
41

42
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.220
kind of like how the protocols and ports
work, so it's a little bit confusing. If
42

43
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.870
you're now very familiar with networking
technology, the main thing to remember is
43

44
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.120
that it is a logical. A port is a logical
connection endpoint on an address. So now
44

45
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:50.630
ports can range from 0 to 65535. There's
a number of ports in use. MySQL has the
45

46
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.570
default of 3306 for its port. We will
be using 3306 throughout the course.
46

47
00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.450
You can configure MySQL Connect down a
different port. Some people do this for
47

48
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.580
security purposes to obscure it. It is a
perfectly valid thing to do. But for this
48

49
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.160
course, we are going to be using the
default value of 3306. Now here's an
49

50
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.109
example. On the middle there, we have
MySQL. That is our database server
50

51
00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.750
that's surrounded by clients with TCP
connections into it and let's say that
51

52
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.350
server has an address of 127.10.10.4
and everybody's going to be
52

53
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.600
connecting on that IP address over port
3306. So that I'm hoping this will help
53

54
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.310
you visualize how your clients and
different computers are going to be
54

55
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.330
talking to the MySQL database
server.
55

56
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.510
Now connecting to MySQL in this course,
we really have two primary options. We
56

57
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
will be working from our own computers
with MySQL running on that computer. So
57

58
00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:04.700
we will be using either localhost on
port 3306 or the IP address of 127.0.0.1
58

59
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.160
on port 3306.
Now it's important to remember that the
59

60
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.350
word localhost actually will resolve to
127.0.0.1. As you do the
60

61
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.950
connections, I might switch between 
using localhost and the IP address. It's
61

62
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.170
perfectly fine to do one. There's really
no reason to do one over the other.
62

63
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.120
Neither is right and neither is wrong.
Now once you are in the enterprise
63

64
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.490
connecting to an actual MySQL database,
generally you're going to want to use that
64

65
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.919
name because if the IP address changes,
then what this allows your IT
65

66
00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.380
department to do is if IP changes, they
can update that name to a different IP
66

67
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.390
address so there's tools to do this.
So when you are doing, if you're like
67

68
00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:00.830
writing reports and stuff, you want to be
using the server name, not the IP address
68

69
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.930
In case for whatever reason that IP
address changes. Now coming up in the
69

70
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.620
course we are going to be looking at the
command line. We are going to be using a
70

71
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.360
program called MySQL handily enough.
Literally it's a program called MySQL.
71

72
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.680
We're going to use that connect to the
MySQL database and I have videos to show
72

73
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.470
you on this coming up in the course. 
This is actually a client program for
73

74
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.550
the command line. It gives you a shell to
work with the MySQL database and it's
74

75
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.540
got some nice features in it. We're not
going to spend a lot of time there. We're
75

76
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.340
going to focus on using MySQL Workbench. 
This is a graphical user interface we're
76

77
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.090
working with MySQL database. It's got a
lot more rich features. I'm going to be
77

78
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.310
doing the majority
do the course using MySQL Workbench. It's
78

79
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.630
a good tool. Now there are a number of
different tools available, a number of
79

80
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.950
different clients available for MySQL.
Obviously you know MySQL is wildly
80

81
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.550
popular so there are a lot of options
that you can use. If you want use
81

82
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.100
something other than MySQL Workbench, you
are absolutely welcome to. But going
82

83
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.510
forward MySQL Workbench is probably the
most popular one out there. Although I do
83

84
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.860
have my own personal preferences, we will
be using that throughout the course. Now
84

85
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.950
here's an example of the MySQL Workbench.
This is for OS X. This an example of the
85

86
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:22.350
UI that you get. You can see this is a
lot more rich of experience to work with
86

87
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.120
than just the simple command-line. So we
will be seeing this a lot more in the
87

88
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.870
course coming up. Coming up in the
remainder of this section, we will get to
88

89
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.880
see how to use the command line and then
we will install and bring up MySQL
89

90
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.890
Workbench and we'll be using it from
there on.
