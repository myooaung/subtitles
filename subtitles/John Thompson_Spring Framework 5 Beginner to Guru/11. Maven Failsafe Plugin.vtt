00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.759
Okay, we've got one bit of configuration
to do with Maven to run our tests. Now by
1

2
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.010
default, Maven is going to run anything
that's got test in it. Essentially any
2

3
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.189
class name that has tests. So that's a
convention that we do wanna follow
3

4
00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.449
when we are using the Maven build system
and Maven also will distinguish between
4

5
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.870
unit tests and integration tests. And
another default naming convention is IT
5

6
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.390
for Maven and the maven-surefire-plugin
is what runs the test and that is
6

7
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.550
configured by default. That will run unit
tests but the Failsafe plugin is what's
7

8
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.200
gonna run our integration tests. Now
you can see on the screen here on line
8

9
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.140
68 to 88, I've added in Maven
configuration for the Failsafe plugin.
9

10
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.379
It is not enabled by default so we have
to bring it in. And I am running version
10

11
00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.000
2.20 and what we are doing is we are
explicitly saying it includes everything
11

12
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.250
that ends with IT. So all our
integration tests will end with IT and
12

13
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.600
on line 76 this is very important, the
Spring team made a change in the class
13

14
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.710
path and now the Spring Boot jar is laid
out and it broke the Failsafe plugin.
14

15
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.689
If you do not include this you'll get an
error saying that Maven is unable to
15

16
00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.220
find some classes. So this is a
workaround. Right now this is still an
16

17
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.450
open issue at the time of recording. I do
not know if there's gonna be a fix
17

18
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.259
put in place but there's currently
a workaround that we need to add in this
18

19
00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.479
additional class path elements there on
line 76 to 78. So that is very
19

20
00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.220
important and now it's gonna run the
integration-test goal for us and
20

21
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.899
this is poor one. We do test just when
tests are gonna run, our true
21

22
00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.969
unit tests are just gonna run. But
when we do verify, this is what's gonna
22

23
00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.680
run the full test inside of Maven. So
now you can see it's gonna go through
23

24
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.060
two phases that's bringing up that one
Spring Context because that is marked as
24

25
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.910
a @Test. So Maven doesn't know the
25

26
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.520
difference so it still brings that up. So
now you can see we get a report here,
26

27
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.840
the results and this is from the maven-failsafe-plugin. So we got our two
27

28
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.630
integration test run from the IT and if
we scroll back up here, we can see that
28

29
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.900
we had seven unit test run. And the
reason they're doing this is they wanna
29

30
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.740
run through, the logic is to run
through real quick in your unit tests
30

31
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.420
and hopefully, if you pass all those and
then you're gonna get into the
31

32
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.040
heavier-weight integration test. So the
integration tests are much more
32

33
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.100
expensive to run not only in time but
system resources too. So the logic is to
33

34
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.480
fail fast so if you fail on the unit
test, you're not gonna get to the
34

35
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.140
integration test but if you're not doing
this, if you're not naming your test
35

36
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.920
properly everything is lumped together. So you're gonna be running your
36

37
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720
lightweight unit tests along with your
integration test. So now what you wanna
37

38
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.410
do here, you do wanna follow this
naming convention because when you do
38

39
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.400
get a larger project with hundreds of
tests, this does definitely make a
39

40
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.660
difference in the system resources for
your builds. And I just wanna recap
40

41
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.890
here I'm gonna hide this again, the
plugin configuration. So this is a
41

42
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.400
Failsafe plugin. Some people think it might be being sent
42

43
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.280
out to pasture. I think it's just a
mature plugin and there's not a lot of
43

44
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.090
development happening on it right now. But this is the traditional plugin so
44

45
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.590
you have the Surefire plugin which
comes in by default, the Failsafe plugin
45

46
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.660
is used to run the integration test and
it runs in the verify phase and not the
46

47
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.579
test phase. So just a recap there and I
am going to check us into GitHub so you
47

48
00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.650
have a full working example for it.
