00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.389
Okay! So the JSON, that we're looking at
here, that is gonna be used. That
1

2
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.309
gives us programmatic way to describe
the API, and that this can be consumed by
2

3
00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.840
a number of different clients. But a cool
thing that we can utilize is to take a
3

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.830
look at the Swagger UI. And let's go to
that now. And the URL is gonna be
4

5
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.309
swagger-ui.html so I'll go over to
that. Now we can see, we have our basic
5

6
00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.100
controllers, and just like before, we can
actually see examples here. So, we can go
6

7
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.340
in and see that a whole specification on
the API. We can do a Try it out. And
7

8
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.129
what's kind of cool is that we see some
of the data getting responded to our API
8

9
00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.250
call. We can also bring up Curl. If you're
running on a UNIX system, or a Linux
9

10
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.520
system, or OS X, which is a variation of
Unix, underneath the covers. You can come
10

11
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.260
in and run the curl command. Actually, I
think on Windows 10, there are starting
11

12
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.270
to include some bash support. That rumored to
be in a recent update. So, you can see
12

13
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.900
that we are getting a response right
away. It runs pretty darn quick on our
13

14
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.090
local host machine, so we can see that we
are getting back that data so we can
14

15
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.110
exercise different APIs there. I
couldn't come into the customer-controller.
15

16
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.810
Let's do a get a customers. You can say
Try it out, and let's come in and see if
16

17
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.960
we get Michale Weston back. Michael
Weston and Sam Axe.
17

18
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.060
So, we can see that we are in fact
getting them returned back. Now, one
18

19
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.450
important thing, if you do not see the UI,
if that is not coming up, what you can do
19

20
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.620
is I'm gonna put this in and show you
the configuration, so if you're not
20

21
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.430
running in Spring Boot, so a lot of this
magic is being configured by Spring Boot
21

22
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.920
for us. And I'll show you the
configuration here. Come back over here
22

23
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.090
to IntelliJ, and what we need to do is
change this. I'm gonna stop Spring
23

24
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.110
Boot on doing this.
24

25
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.230
Now this web configuration support,
25

26
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:25.560
what we wanna do is override and addResourceHandlers. I actually have this
26

27
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.209
copied over, so I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna type out everything here. What
27

28
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.150
we wanna do is override this and add
in our own resource handlers. And I'm
28

29
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.319
gonna comment this out for the check in,
but I want you to be aware of this. This is how
29

30
00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.939
you configure the Swagger UI, if you're
not on a Spring Boot project. So, Spring
30

31
00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.450
Boot is gonna automatically detect
these resources and configure this.
31

32
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.379
It will provide us in this configuration.
But there's two components, that we need
32

33
00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.549
to bring in. One is the swagger-ui.html.
That is in /META-INF/resources/ of one
33

34
00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.469
of the Swagger jars, of Swagger UI jar,
and then also, Swagger UI is gonna bring
34

35
00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:09.150
bring in some webjars for the styling
and whatnot. So, that's gonna provide
35

36
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.489
the web resources. So that's, if you're
not running Spring Boot, or if you do not
36

37
00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.639
see the Swagger UI, something's wrong in
your configuration. And if you add this
37

38
00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.540
in, you should be able to get the Swagger
UI to come up and display normally for
38

39
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.159
you. And again, I am going to comment this
out, right now.
39

40
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.360
So I'm gonna comment that out. Leave it
like that for you. I'm checking into
40

41
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.190
GitHub. But you'll have this, in case, you
do need to set up the Swagger UI
41

42
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.540
resources manually.
