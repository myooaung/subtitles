I have an optional assignment for you, in
this module of the course. If you have
1

2
00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.970
KiteMatic installed on your system, go out
and recreate the steps that I just did.
2

3
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.740
Stand up that a web container and go
to the port. So go through the KiteMatic
3

4
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.320
steps, find out what your port mapping is, go to
4

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
localhost and whatever that port mapping
is, and verify that you can get a web
5

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.329
page going. Now, this is a very simple
example. I just want you to get used to
6

7
00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.180
the concept of the container running, and
we're mapping ports inside the container.
7

8
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.320
Now, we're gonna get into that a lot more
depth, but just be aware that, that counts
8

9
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.219
up there. If you can, if you've installed
KiteMatic, it should be available for
9

10
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
Windows, definitely available for OS X and
some of that we can use and easily go
10

11
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.340
through the steps. But I want you to get
the hands-on experience of going through
11

12
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.600
and doing these steps.
