Alright. In this video, we have an
assignment for you, and that is to create
1

2
00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
a get API for customers, just like our
example here, and gonna give you a little
2

3
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
bit of a challenge. So I'm expecting you
to flush all this out. Because we've been
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.650
going through quite a bit of this stuff
in the course. So you should be
4

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.119
comfortable in doing all this. So, what
you do is go in and create the Customer
5

6
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.460
domain, a DTO object for it,
a repository, and then a Customer Mapper
6

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
as well, and a service, and also the
controller layer. So it's gonna be
7

8
00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
exactly like we did in this section of
the course for categories. But we wanna
8

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
do it for customers. And of course, we
wanna do a Bootstrap class to
9

10
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.219
initialize the data. I will leave it up
to you as to how to do that. And I'd like
10

11
00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.570
you to follow test-driven development. Of
course, provide unit test coverage for
11

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.230
everything that's involved here, and so
we'll have a very robust set of tests.
12

13
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.160
Wanted get you through that. And just to
recap, I'm going to come over here to
13

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.810
Chrome. And what we are going to
implement is the up the GET customers. So
14

15
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
don't worry about the metadata. We'll do
that at a future point, but we wanna
15

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.720
implement a JSON object of customers and
that is going to have a list of
16

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.060
customers. So here's an example value
coming back from the API. That's been
17

18
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.369
exercised here. And then, we also wanna
implement the get by id. And that's gonna
18

19
00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.229
return back a firstname lastname. And
as an extra challenge, actually, we don't
19

20
00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.810
wanna do the orders_url. But up here,
for the customer list, let's implement
20

21
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
the customer_url as well. So I think that
would be a nice touch and a small
21

22
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.000
challenge for us to work with. So, in the
next video, I will step through
22

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.189
everything. I'll probably do a code
review of most of it. But I'll live code the
23

24
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.170
controller portion and we can step
through that example real time and get
24

25
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.680
that up and working. So if you're
uncertain about anything, don't worry. We
25

26
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.159
will cover the entire assignment 
in-depth in the next video.
