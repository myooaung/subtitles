00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:06.192
Alright, in this video
2

3
00:00:06.192 --> 00:00:08.016
we have an assignment for you.
3

4
00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.032
And what we wanna do is go in
4

5
00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:13.756
and Refactor the Recipe and Ingredient Controllers.
5

6
00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:17.197
Now, what we wanna do is update the controller,
6

7
00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:19.732
the RecipeController, to return a reactive type
7

8
00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:22.394
for the 'show' url only,
8

9
00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.487
and also, we wanna do the same thing
9

10
00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:26.191
for the Ingredient Controller.
10

11
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:29.093
So if you remember, the index does
11

12
00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:31.149
the list of recipes for us,
12

13
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.443
the Index Controller does that,
13

14
00:00:32.443 --> 00:00:35.777
but the Ingredient Controller has a list function on that,
14

15
00:00:35.777 --> 00:00:38.719
so we wanna be returning reactive types for that.
15

16
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.215
And also do the show.
16

17
00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.140
And so these types, these controller methods
17

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.458
will have round trip, fully reactive from MongoDB
18

19
00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.702
to the timely view layer.
19

20
00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:52.773
So that will give us a full reactive stack
20

21
00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:55.417
for the show functions here.
21

22
00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.541
And the next thing we wanna do also
22

23
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:02.147
is, we are generating a UOM list from the Mongo database,
23

24
00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:03.441
and that's also a candidate where
24

25
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.387
we can use reactive types also.
25

26
00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.966
Let's go ahead and refactor that as well.
26

27
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.489
And I think by now you should
27

28
00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:11.869
be getting comfortable with reactive types.
28

29
00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.066
If you're not comfortable just yet, don't worry.
29

30
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.647
The next video, we are gonna
30

31
00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.466
go through everything step by step,
31

32
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.919
I'll show you exactly what to do
32

33
00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:21.625
in completing this assignment.
33

34
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.826
And we will get these controller methods
34

35
00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.659
going full stack reactive for us.
