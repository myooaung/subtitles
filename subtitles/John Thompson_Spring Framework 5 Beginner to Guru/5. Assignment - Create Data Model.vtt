00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.309
Now in this video, I have an important
assignment for you. I'm gonna give you a
1

2
00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.920
little bit of a challenge. And what we're
gonna do is create a data model. And in
2

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
this, I wanna point out that Spring
Boot by default is gonna use Jackson
3

4
00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.590
to bind JSON to Java POJOs. And what we
need to do is create the POJOs for the
4

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.960
data binding that we're gonna be
using in the future in the course would
5

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.849
consume this API using Spring RestTemplate. So what I want you to do is check
6

7
00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
out the new project. I'm gonna provide
you a URL to the project that we're gonna be
7

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.969
using it. So new repository inside of
GitHub. So check that out. And I want you
8

9
00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.680
to go in and add the model for users
from that apifaketory/api/user. And in
9

10
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.649
this, please use the package guru.springframework.api.domain. And that
10

11
00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.160
will follow along with what I'm gonna
do because I'm gonna go through in the
11

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
next video and show you how to do that.
Now
12

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.670
I do wanna escape out of keynote. And
let's toggle over to Chrome here. And
13

14
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.540
just to, actually, that's a go over to
postman instead. Come back over here to
14

15
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.250
postman. And here what we wanna do,
by this here object right here this
15

16
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.320
JSON object, that I'm highlighting on the
screen, that is a user object. So you
16

17
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.189
can see it has different properties in
there. So we're gonna create a master
17

18
00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.310
object called user. And then underneath
it, we'll have a name POJO. We'll have a
18

19
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.640
location POJO, a property for email, a
login POJO, so these are all different
19

20
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.299
POJOs that we wanna associate with the
user. So we'll create this data structure
20

21
00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.970
using POJOs. And coming up in the course,
I'm gonna show you how to consume
21

22
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.000
this API. And we're gonna leverage
Spring and Spring Boot to bind this JSON
22

23
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.170
data to our POJOs, and then that gives us
something to work with in the Java
23

24
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.920
environment. But first, we need to set up
those POJOs. So i'm giving you an
24

25
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.069
assignment to go out and do that. And in
the next video, I'm gonna show you
25

26
00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.060
exactly how I did it and just create
simple POJOs
26

27
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.349
and then we'll be able to use those for
the data binding, when we consume this
27

28
00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.940
API using Spring RestTemplate. And then
one other thing I wanna point out to
28

29
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.599
you, come back over here. This is the
project that we're gonna be working
29

30
00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.340
with. So I already set it up as just a
initial project and we are gonna go
30

31
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.780
through like usual, with the branches. So
right now, I want you to check out master
31

32
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.790
and complete the assignment against
master. And I will start on master myself
32

33
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.110
and I will add a new branch for the
completed assignment of creating the
33

34
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.150
POJOs in this. So I'm gonna be right here
with you each step of the way. You can
34

35
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.650
see that I've already got to set up. It's
actually shockingly passing in CircleCI
35

36
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.420
because I have one single test to make
sure that the Spring Context comes up.
36

37
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.340
But we will be going through this, and I
will enhance this at every step of the
37

38
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.349
way to show you how to use Spring RestTemplate. But the first step is to
38

39
00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.690
create those POJOs that we're gonna
be binding the data to.
