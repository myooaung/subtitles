(soft music)
1

2
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.944
All right, this a really exciting
2

3
00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:12.852
section of the course.
3

4
00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:14.548
We are gonna start working with Thymeleaf
4

5
00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:15.900
and the reactive types.
5

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.551
And we've been working with Reactive
6

7
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.806
for a little bit now on the course
7

8
00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:21.772
and to be honest right now,
8

9
00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:24.462
the annotations, all the controller annotations
9

10
00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:27.070
with Webflux, are supposed to be highly compatible
10

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.006
with Spring MVC.
11

12
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:30.123
There's a couple little gotchs
12

13
00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:32.035
that we're gonna run into in this section
13

14
00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:34.223
where we see some incompatibilities.
14

15
00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.628
And some of us do the nature of
15

16
00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:38.598
I'm not having the Servlet model anymore
16

17
00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:40.979
and the reactive stack which is WebFlux.
17

18
00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:44.153
But I think what we're gonna see it as
18

19
00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:47.410
additional releases of Spring and WebFlux come out,
19

20
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.788
I think this is gonna smooth out
20

21
00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:49.621
quite a bit.
21

22
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.322
The API is still very new.
22

23
00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:53.450
Just to caution you,
23

24
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.704
I'm working off a pre-GA release right now.
24

25
00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:59.410
I expect the Spring team is gonna smooth things out
25

26
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.303
especially as we get into 5.1, 5.2 and so on
26

27
00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:06.090
we are gonna definitely see the API smoothed out.
27

28
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.942
But we do get into some workarounds here
28

29
00:01:08.942 --> 00:01:10.863
and I'm taking it as a learning opportunity
29

30
00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:12.858
to show you some sayings a little bit more in depth
30

31
00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:14.172
with the Spring Framework
31

32
00:01:14.172 --> 00:01:16.100
so we are gonna learn here.
32

33
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.798
We are gonna get more accustomed to using
33

34
00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:20.656
these reactive types which you are gonna see
34

35
00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:21.874
is as we go in and start using
35

36
00:01:21.874 --> 00:01:23.599
the reactive types what is ideal
36

37
00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.046
is if we're making a request
37

38
00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:27.116
for a read and coming back
38

39
00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:29.620
now we're getting in that Publisher
39

40
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.284
going round trip to the database
40

41
00:01:31.284 --> 00:01:32.567
and it's gonna start getting executed
41

42
00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:34.042
in the Thymeleaf engine.
42

43
00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:35.456
So that's really cool.
43

44
00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:36.906
That gives us a full reactive
44

45
00:01:36.906 --> 00:01:39.411
of sweep through the system.
45

46
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.101
But when we start getting into saving and
46

47
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.482
persisting data, that's where we're gonna have to
47

48
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:47.502
do a block and actually get the data out of the database.
48

49
00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:49.867
Do our validations and then persist it so
49

50
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:52.140
a little hard to do full stack reactive there
50

51
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.716
but you'll see that as we work through this,
51

52
00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:55.556
we're gonna learn a lot on this section.
52

53
00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:57.042
A lot of cool stuff going on.
53

54
00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.370
I'm personally having fun with reactive types
54

55
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.635
so I hope you are too
55

56
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:03.567
because this is really, some really, really cool stuff.
56

57
00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.074
And we are gonna be working with a lot of reactive stuff
57

58
00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.561
coming up in this course.
58

59
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.656
But in this section, we are gonna be working
59

60
00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:12.409
with ThymeLeaf and the reactive types with ThymeLeaf.
60

61
00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.344
So we've got a lot of cool stuff
61

62
00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:16.511
coming up in this part of the course.
