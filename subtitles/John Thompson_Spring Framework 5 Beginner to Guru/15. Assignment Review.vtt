00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
In this video we are gonna go through and do a code review of the assignment and that assignment was

2
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.900
to add spring rest docs to the given project.

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.160
So up here on the screen I have my implementation.

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.100
Good to see the highlighting I have not committed this to get up but I will be committing it to get

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.940
hub under the branch.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.050
Docs dash ample and let's go through this.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.540
The first thing I did as I went in and started adding and the Maven dependency so I am bringing this

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.180
up here.

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.530
When I point out online forty eight the project was using J four so I wanted to switch over to J unit

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.320
five.

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.750
That's what I did here.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.550
So you can see in fifty two I'm excluding J unit and then on fifty nine I'm bringing in the J unit five

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.710
dependencies and you can see that the version there is not needed because this is a curated version

14
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.280
from the Spring Boot parent palm and then on line seventy five or seventy four I should say that is

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.190
where I'm bringing in the dependency for spring rest docs and again that is a curated dependency we

16
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.470
don't need to bring in that version no explicitly.

17
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.200
Now scroll up a little bit then on line 1 0 9 bringing in the ASCII Doctor maven plugin.

18
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
This is the plugin that is going to be assembling all the ASCII doctor stuff.

19
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.470
The dependency there on line one twenty six this is needed for rest docs and highly recommended to do

20
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.150
this spring rest docs version.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.960
So that is a curated version property from the Spring Boot parent which will keep things in sync between

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.850
the version that you're using of the jar that's being brought in to the jar that's being brought in

23
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700
for the ASCII Doctor plugin.

24
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.420
Now line 1 34.

25
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.660
This is the resources plug in this is a standard maven plugin.

26
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:54.330
This is the build plug and then it's going to copy the completed documentation on over to the target

27
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.570
directory that's gonna get ultimately built in to a jar file or deployment so it will copy over that

28
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.170
index HDMI all file into a static docs directory which will bring up the documentation for you when

29
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.690
you go to Spring Boot static slash stocks wherever the Spring Boot has deployed.

30
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.960
So setting everything up so that Spring Boot will have the documentation.

31
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.380
Now next thing we need to do is add in a directory for ASCII Doc and this index ASCII doc.

32
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.120
So this looks pretty familiar from what we did previously in the core some kind of following along with

33
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.690
that very similar snippets very similar capabilities.

34
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.130
You can customize this all you want.

35
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.070
There's a lot of customization capabilities to ask you to.

36
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.770
I'm not going down that rabbit hole.

37
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.730
We could spend hours on customizing as ask Doc probably not going down that road but this is a very

38
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.110
robust tool that we have to use.

39
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.200
I'm just showing you my primary thing is to show you how it takes us snippets assemble some together

40
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.840
into a final document.

41
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.910
Now the next thing we want to take a look at is the bigger controller.

42
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:08.040
So you actually get really to imports now very very very important but something you forgot to do this

43
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.010
online 32.

44
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.510
You need to change that static import over to the rest.

45
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.220
Documentation builders.

46
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.960
So that's what's going to control the.

47
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.920
The spring Mark MVC.

48
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.440
So very important stuff.

49
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.550
Very easy one to forget.

50
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.630
I actually forgot it when I went through it the first time and had to go back and add it now online

51
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.830
35 extend what we need that extend with Russ documentation extension that is a J.

52
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:43.660
Unit 5 extension which helps us run the documentation and the rest Doc documentation and then 36 because

53
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.810
we are injecting the mock MVC we are asking the mock MVC test that is a spring boot test place.

54
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.980
We need that annotation the auto configure rest docs.

55
00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.790
I'm not overwriting any of the defaults so this is going to come up to a [REMOVED] local host and port

56
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.670
88.

57
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.960
And of course I could override those as I showed you previously in the course and you can see it scroll

58
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.630
up a little bit here and see that before each.

59
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.900
That was a change from J up for to J you know five and then the test here.

60
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.010
We did have to change.

61
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.710
Remember you have to change this parameter to include the path parameter like so.

62
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.560
And then we went into the documentation so the request is in very very somewhere.

63
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.790
The object is very similar.

64
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.000
There's a few differences in property so you weren't able to do a complete cut and paste.

65
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.090
So that would have been some problems so if you did do that.

66
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.990
One other thing that I added as I added in this type so this is declaring the type.

67
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.560
So these were coming up normal in the documentation like so I'll show you the general documentation

68
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.470
here in a second and then that handles the beer

69
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.690
the sandals the post the beer the new beer.

70
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.390
So that is going to be the beer new documentation so we have the beer get the beer.

71
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.120
New and again very very similar except on the new.

72
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.830
You can see that I'm adding the ignored properties on these top three lines so those are not going to

73
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.740
be set by the client but the client will be sending beer name beer style and neat UPC of the beer.

74
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.700
I did not document handle update.

75
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.380
That is up to you if you'd like to do that.

76
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.840
And it's going to be very similar to everything else.

77
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.960
And then here's my static class my private static class that is going to give us this functionality

78
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.220
to document the constraints.

79
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.190
So that's where we're going to get the constraint documentation that is going to be a reflection from

80
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.390
the.

81
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.590
Being validation.

82
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.310
And let's jump over to Chrome and I'll show you the final resulting documentation so you can see here.

83
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.380
I've got the documentation scroll up a little bit and that type property that's what setting this here.

84
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.270
So previously that was normal.

85
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.000
There are some different strategies to setting that lets you explore that on the documentation it's

86
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.900
okay.

87
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.490
But the problem here is you need to set the type.

88
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.180
And sometimes it's a little difficult because you want to set a Java type or a javascript type and in

89
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.770
Jason I actually do not have an off site date and time actually don't have a date.

90
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.420
It's just a string property.

91
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.410
So some things that you need to do there.

92
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:30.680
As far as a format there's other API documentation tools such as Open API that has a lot more robust

93
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.400
functionality around describing data properties.

94
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.650
Also you can see here this table here that also changed a little bit so you can see that it does not

95
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.030
have all the properties ignore properties are not displayed toggle back over to intelligent this code.

96
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.230
I will check in on a separate branch again and it's going to be on the rest docs branch.

97
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.080
You avail to check this out and do a diff.

98
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.900
Like I said at the beginning how they recommend you fork the original property work off of master and

99
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.080
then you'll be able to do diff between the different branches to see if you missed anything.

100
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.190
Number of things that you had to put in place here to get all this functionality.

101
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.670
So hopefully this is a good exercise in gains value out of it.

102
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.930
And now you are quote unquote experts with spring rust stocks.
