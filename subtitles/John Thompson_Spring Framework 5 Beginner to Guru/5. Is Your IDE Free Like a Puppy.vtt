Hey folks! John Thompson Spring Framework Guru here.
1

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.730
So I wanna ask you is your IDE free like a puppy?
2

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.820
So this is my new puppy, Woody.
3

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.000
So he's a Hungarian Beesley. He's just three months old.
4

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.400
And what if I were to give you Woody for free.
5

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.530
Absolutely free.
6

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.240
Would he be really free for you?
7

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.830
I mean think about it? You're going to give him shots. You're going to have to take care of him.
8

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.730
You definitely are going to have to feed him.
9

10
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.160
Who's going to be going to the vet for different things.
10

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.510
You got to play with and keep him entertained.
11

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.000
So anything but free.
12

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.700
So you get to spending a lot of money on a free puppy. And that's what 
13

14
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.260
I mean about is your IDE free like a puppy?
14

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.820
So that's common say saying here in the States about being free like a puppy. Your IDE selection is
15

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.200
gonna cost you in different ways.
16

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.910
I get a lot of people say oh IntelliJ is way too expensive.
17

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.250
Well, is it really?
18

19
00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:02.910
So think about this case. About several months ago, let's get this guy down. So months ago, I was on a client's site
19

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.840
and working on a project and went through an upgraded versions of software like i do periodically. So I brought everything
20

21
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.970
up to current releases.
21

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.430
And when the project came back up and refresh or re-index, IntelliJ kinda lost the mind. I couldn't find
22

23
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.570
any of the classes.
23

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.340
All the spring classes just weren't there.
24

25
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.000
They weren't coming and they weren't importing. So I was like OK.
25

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.240
See some weird stuff in IntelliJ happen like this every now and then.
26

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.030
So I went in and I re-indexed the project. So you got to the file and validate caches and restart.
27

28
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.690
It tells IntelliJ to re-index project.
28

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
Usually when something weird starts happening, this will clear it right up and everything goes back to
29

30
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.130
normal.
30

31
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.460
In this case it did not.
31

32
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.440
So worked on this for 10 15 minutes trying to figure it out and it's like it was just bizarre because
32

33
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.230
IntelliJ just wasn't seeing any of the classes in the jars.
33

34
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.060
So I opened up a support ticket with Jet brains saying, hey this is happening.
34

35
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.660
And in three minutes, I got an email back. You can hear my puppy growling in the background. In three minutes
35

36
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.610
we had an email back saying, yeah there's a problem.
36

37
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.670
It's a problem with the latest release of Gradle.
37

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:20.910
It broke how IntelliJ picks up the classpath and all the jars in the class. So, hey! So, three minutes later, we had a
38

39
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.140
solution to my problem.
39

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.350
So things like this, not only the productivity features  inside of IntelliJ, it's that support. When you're
40

41
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.960
out at the client site working for a client and they're expecting results and you need to deliver, when
41

42
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.720
you do run into a problem in IntelliJ. It is pretty rare but it does happen.
42

43
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.550
You need that support they are right there.
43

44
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.750
So I had a solution in just three minutes. So IntelliJ support is outstanding.
44

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.580
Now think about it.
45

46
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.400
If I was on a free IDE. Where's my support? I'm going to be hosting in stack overflow. You are gonna be searching
46

47
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.270
Google, trying to figure out what's going on.
47

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.320
So that is gonna cost you. That's gonna be a hidden cost.
48

49
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.080
Another hidden cost is all all the productivity features inside of IntelliJ. Things that make you
49

50
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.130
able to work and produce code faster.
50

51
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.100
Again, free IDE isn't gonna be having the same pace of innovation that a commercial IDE is going to
51

52
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.660
have.
52

53
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.640
So the guys at Jet Brains are continually innovating.
53

54
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.890
They've got some really cool features coming up.
54

55
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.470
I enjoy it because I can say on the AP releases quite often just to see all the new stuff coming because
55

56
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.220
of their support for Java and Spring keeps getting better. Support for new languages, new libraries, keeps
56

57
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.130
getting better. Where if you're on a free IDE, you're at the whims of the community.
57

58
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.920
And also if you run into problems,
58

59
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.000
Good luck! Who you're gonna to call? Who you're gonna email? Who's gonna respond to you in just
59

60
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.140
three minutes.
60

61
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.820
So that's where a subscription to IntelliJ, when you are working in the field as a professional, it
61

62
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.380
is absolutely worth it.
62

63
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.630
So that's why I call free IDEs are free like a puppy.
