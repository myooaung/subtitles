00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.370
In this video, we are going to do some task
planning. You can see that our work
1

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
queue it's gotten pretty lean
right now. We only have two tests that
2

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.660
are out there and these are all things
that we are going to be implementing
3

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
coming up in the course. For right now,
what we want to do is start setting
4

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.269
things up so we can go in and do some
additional tasks that are going to be
5

6
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.170
tracking with this. You have some
notes here and we are going to go
6

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.739
through these and set up the issues. So
the first one is create a visit map
7

8
00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.370
service.
8

9
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.180
Set that up. Spell visit right, like
so. That's spelt better. By this, what
9

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.770
I mean is if I come back over to
IntelliJ, you can see that we added in to
10

11
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.540
Visit entity but we don't have a map
service nor do we have a JPA service for
11

12
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.129
it. So we are going to go ahead and
implement that. We also want to
12

13
00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.239
create the corresponding...
13

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.490
for a visit, so let's get that going
as well.
14

15
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.400
Let's see here. We'll do load visits on
startup
15

16
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.409
in bootstrap, so we'll load up some visit data
so that we can have some data in the
16

17
00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.860
database that will load on our
initialize program in the bootstrap
17

18
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130
program.
18

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.770
If we look, we are going to get into JUnit 5
but let's plan out some tests
19

20
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
because right now we haven't been doing
any testing. We kind of tracking along
20

21
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.380
with the course, so we'll create a new
test or tasks around testing.
21

22
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.920
We write CRUD test for the owner
map
22

23
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.159
service.
23

24
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.940
For the Owner Spring Data.
24

25
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.660
So these are going to be a little bit
different. I bring up this list
25

26
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.720
again.
So the CRUD test for the owner map
26

27
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
service, we'll be able to go ahead and
implement those as true unit tests
27

28
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.750
because those will be unity. The Spring
Data JPA Service will be doing an
28

29
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.040
integration tests and testing Spring
Data JPA, so a couple of different things
29

30
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.060
there that we can test for, or we could
even use Mockito on those two, so we have
30

31
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.730
couple options of testing that out for
us. Maybe we'll do both.
31

32
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.920
Now I have a note here. We want to add in
32

33
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.400
and refactor. It's a project Lombok. It
has some nice features. I think we see
33

34
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
that in the next chapter of the course,
so I won't get into that too deeply. But
34

35
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.800
just as a heads up, at the time of
recording, there's some known issues
35

36
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.440
between Project Lombok and I think Java 10.
I'm not sure if Java 9 is
36

37
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.600
working yet either. But at Java 8, you're
golden. Go beyond Java 8, you may have
37

38
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.830
problems with Project Lombok.
38

39
00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.930
We're also going to get into
some Spring MVC test.
39

40
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.190
So we will write in our MVC test for
that.
40

41
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.459
We had to bail. We're getting into
more MVC stuff, so display owner
41

42
00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.790
record.
42

43
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.300
So I was pulling on a record from the database, instead of HTML Thymeleaf and what not for
43

44
00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.160
that. I'm just putting HTML there as a
reminder that we want this on the web.
44

45
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.160
We're going to implement find owner
45

46
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.359
functionality. Like I said, we had
the display and owner record, so that's
46

47
00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.749
going to come ahead, and then we'll
implement find owner, which will
47

48
00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:20.769
redirect to the display owner so that's
why we are doing it in that sequence.
48

49
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.130
We had the ability to add in or update
an owner.
49

50
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.690
We also add in the ability to add
or update a pet.
50

51
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.380
And then finally, we also do a visit too.
So we get a number new functionality here.
51

52
00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.289
We're going to add in a Spring Boot
Error Page. This gives us a nicer
52

53
00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.789
error handling. In the upcoming section, we
will cover a number of different ways of
53

54
00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.719
handling exception handling. Spring Boot
does have an error page. We have
54

55
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.629
one out of the box that's kind of ugly.
Doesn't give us much information so
55

56
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.319
we'll add something a little more
graceful and I'm pretty sure I don't
56

57
00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.379
think I show you this technique in the
regular course as we talked about
57

58
00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.110
exception handling, so this will be
a little bit new.
58

59
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.699
Okay, I think this is enough
tasks for us to plan out. There's a
59

60
00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.360
number of things, so what we're going to
be getting into a couple different
60

61
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.110
objectives here. First, we want to get
everything working with either the map,
61

62
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.539
HashMap implementation, or the Spring
Data JPA implementation. To do that, we
62

63
00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.490
need to get the visit stuff working and
start with loading in bootstrap, so we'll
63

64
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.880
have everything implemented there. 
Then we'll bring up the context to make
64

65
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.810
sure that we can use active profiles to
switch between the hash map
65

66
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.639
implementation and the JPA
implementation. Then we are coming up,
66

67
00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.509
we are going to be adding Project Lombok.
It's a really wonderful tool. You'll see
67

68
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:29.430
how much stuff it will save you from
doing. We'll add that. That gives us some
68

69
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.539
capability so we'll pick up a couple
things with that. Then we have a section
69

70
00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:39.030
on testing and we'll go in and start
adding test to this. From the course,
70

71
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.889
I'm primarily using Spring, or I'm sorry
JUnit 4 in the course. We're going to use
71

72
00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.479
JUnit 5 here. It get you some exposure to
that. And this is in transaction, JUnit 4
72

73
00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.190
still dominates everything. JUnit 5
has been out for I don't think even a year
73

74
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.740
yet. But the industry is still largely on
JUnit 4. There's a ton of legacy code on
74

75
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.860
JUnit 4,  so as a Java developer learning
Spring, best to be have knowledge and
75

76
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.750
skills with either 4 or 5 just because
there's a ton of old stuff with 4 and
76

77
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.979
people are going to be implementing
JUnit 5. We'll get you exposed
77

78
00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.969
to both of those in the course. Then, we
are going to be progressing with Spring
78

79
00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.860
MVC, so we'll start getting into CRUD
operations with Spring MVC. This is
79

80
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.219
where we'll give you the ability to add
or update an owner ,add or update a pet,
80

81
00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:31.949
or a visit, and in there we are going to
get into the Spring Boot Error Page.
81

82
00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:36.870
Now, we still have additional stuff to
add to this, like validation. That is not
82

83
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.830
there. That's not even planned yet, but
that will be coming after we get this
83

84
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.909
next batch of work done.
