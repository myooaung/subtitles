00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.440
Okay, I got an assignment in this 
module for you and what we're going to
1

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.420
do is run a RabbitMQ instance or 
actually, you're going to do that. So we
2

3
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
want to bring up a container running at
RabbitMQ, and we'll probably make use of
3

4
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
this later on. So my goal here is a
couple things. One, to have you do some
4

5
00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.050
independent research. I'm bringing this
up. It's a good way to recap what
5

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
we've learned so far in the course,
because it's going to allow you to do
6

7
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.879
something different. Part of the
assignment is I want you to map all
7

8
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.920
ports for the rabbit instance with the
management console. So when we're done
8

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.670
with this, we should be able to bring up the
management console and also have the
9

10
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.620
port's listed. Now, to use multiple points,
I'm going to give you a little hint here.
10

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.920
The - p parameter, you can specify
multiple pair of names there. So what you're
11

12
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.040
going to need to do is look at the
Rabbit Docker file, and look at
12

13
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.630
the port that are exposed. So the Rabbit
instance is going to expose several
13

14
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
ports. What we want to do is take the
one for the management console, map
14

15
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.159
that to 8080 so we can go easily to our
browser on that, and then there's
15

16
00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:27.360
5671, 5672 if I'm remembering my naming rights. 71
is the TLS connection. 72 is a non
16

17
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.439
encrypted connection to the RabbitQ.
So we're setting this up so we could
17

18
00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.630
like use it in a Spring Boot or whatever
we want connect to Rabbit with. I'm a Spring
18

19
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.960
guy, so we're going to be using Spring
Boot, of course, to connect to Rabbit. But
19

20
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.079
we want to have a usable container with
RabbitMQ running inside of it. Also,
20

21
00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.060
pay special attention to the hostname
parameter. So that's another thing that's
21

22
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229
kind of unique about Rabbit. It does give
you some fits, if you don't set that
22

23
00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.750
hostname. By doing all this, we'll
have a usable Rabbit instance that we
23

24
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.729
can work with. In the next section,
I'll go through exactly the setup and
24

25
00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.239
get into this more, but I want to
challenge you, because the spirit this
25

26
00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.050
will help enforce everything that you've
learned up to this point,
26

27
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
in setting up the mappings, in setting up
the storage, and we're going to expand that
27

28
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.550
out on that, by doing like multiple ports.
So this is good little exercise, we'll just
28

29
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.900
go through. Later on this course, we
probably will use RabbitMQ.
