Hey guys! John Thompson Spring Framework
Guru here. So We got an exciting section
1

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.880
that's like one of the first sections of
the course and we are going to get our
2

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
hands dirty building a Spring Framework
application. Right out of the gate, we are
3

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
going to build a simple web application.
Now I'm gonna warn you right now we are
4

5
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.619
going to move a little fast through this.
I'm kind of like the type of guy that
5

6
00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
likes to get our hands dirty. This
is gonna be like a 'Hello World' on
6

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
steroids, so to speak, because we are
going to go in and we're going to use
7

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.410
Spring Initializer, which is going to
download a ready-made Spring Boot
8

9
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.670
application and then I'm going to show
you how to configure that and we're
9

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
actually going to be talking to an
in-memory database. Using Thymeleaf, I'm going to
10

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.710
show you a lot of best practices. Now I
am going to move fast through this. You
11

12
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
are gonna have a lot of questions. I'm
going to show you kind of like a
12

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
template that you're gonna see again and
again in this course of how we structure
13

14
00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
a Spring project, some common annotations.
I'm not going to go into a lot of depth
14

15
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
at this point in time.
The way I build my course is we kind of
15

16
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.210
lay down a foundation and I'm gonna
throw a lot of information at you in
16

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.420
this section. We are gonna get a good
baseline foundation. You're gonna see a
17

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.189
lot of stuff in this section of the
course. But don't worry, we are gonna move
18

19
00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.790
forward fast. You are going to go through
it. You're gonna get a Spring Web
19

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.630
application up and running on your
machine in just a few short lessons, so I
20

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
think it's a great hands-on section of
the course. Get your feet wet with Spring
21

22
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.350
Framework. Now like I said,  I do
build my courses, like I lay down a
22

23
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.259
foundation then we'll go a little bit
deeper and a little bit deeper and a
23

24
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.119
little bit deeper. We will definitely be
progressing into this, so I know we I do
24

25
00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.689
move fast in this section. Don't get
frustrated because as you progress
25

26
00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.450
through the course,
a lot of the concepts that I breeze over
26

27
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
here, we are gonna take deep dives on.
There's just too much ground to
27

28
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.130
cover to deep dive in each one because
that's what the whole course is on. A
28

29
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.040
second part of this course, a section of
this course, there's new content. I'm
29

30
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.329
adding and there is a reference
application that Spring creates called
30

31
00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.429
Spring Pet Clinic. A very classic
application. I think the JEE guys maybe
31

32
00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.700
probably J2EE if you wanna go back
a decade or so. I think those guys
32

33
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.739
actually started. The pet clinic spring
guys adapted it to show best practices.
33

34
00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.569
It's been widely used. I am going to take
that so we're gonna start building two
34

35
00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.860
tracks in this course as we go through
it. One is going to be the traditional. I
35

36
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.349
show you, do assignments, and then Spring
Pet Clinic is we are going to build the
36

37
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.670
pet clinic application from ground zero
all the way through. We're going to have
37

38
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.480
sections on it in each part of the
course. I'll have a little bit of pet
38

39
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.030
clinic, so we'll like do the learning
part and then we'll go into the pet
39

40
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.420
clinic and pick up on this application.
We're going to see me doing realistic
40

41
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.709
stuff building the pet clinic
application. It's a lot of hands-on
41

42
00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.079
coding. Some people like to see step by
step by step. If you like that, pet clinic
42

43
00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:04.209
is definitely for you, so a lot of
hands-on, a lot of best practices, and you
43

44
00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.590
get to see real world best practices
using the Spring Framework. So a lot of
44

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.920
cool content in this section. I'm excited
to show it to you. Welcome to the course
45

46
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.109
and you're gonna get to build a web
application really quick and get that up
46

47
00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.880
and running and we are going to lay the
initial foundation for our Spring Framework
47

48
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.319
Guru Pet Clinic App and you're gonna
see that a lot throughout this course.
