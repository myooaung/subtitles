00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:12.710
In this video we're gonna talk about configuring spring rest stocks to document a path parameter and

2
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.210
our ideal use case here is our actually our first test case here that get nearby I.D..

3
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.100
This has a path parameter in it so it's going to be taking the api v1 beer and then it's going to pass

4
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.810
into you it and this is a path parameter.

5
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.440
So we want to get that documented using this now one very very important thing that we need to do is

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.020
we need to change the import.

7
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.140
So we have these static imports for the mock MVC request builder so this get action.

8
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.170
So we're doing this get action.

9
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.030
This is a static import that's coming from this import.

10
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.880
And if you use the straight Mark MVC builders it's not going to work and it will cause you a lot of

11
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.680
headaches.

12
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.550
So you need to bring in this static import and comment this one out.

13
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.030
So this is a real real easy mistake to make.

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.510
And if you forget to do it you will cause errors.

15
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.900
And I am almost certain a lot of people are going to be posting on this lesson saying hey this isn't

16
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.190
working because of this.

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.260
So you really need to do this.

18
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.370
That's why I'm stressing this out a lot because it's a very easy thing to miss.

19
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.830
And it will trip you up if you do not do that.

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.830
So by changing out the static import this is now a different static import that's being brought in for

21
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.210
this good operation.

22
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.990
So now we can go ahead and start doing our our test scroll it's up a little bit.

23
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:42.220
Now what we want to do is come in here and after this and expect we're going to say and do so it's going

24
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.360
to do a to action and we're going to say document and that is gonna be another static import to bring

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.840
in.

26
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.720
So we're going to import static method and of course we want the mock MVC Russ documentation static

27
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.870
import.

28
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:07.690
And here we go to give a little configuration so I'm going to follow the V one slash beer as the end

29
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.710
point.

30
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.800
Now what we can do is we can start passing in our documentation configuration so what we want to say

31
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.730
is path parameters.

32
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.580
And finally if you type everything out and give it the prunes it helps ontology find it.

33
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.820
So we're gonna bring in that static import.

34
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.520
Now what we need to do is pass passes and some configuration so we're going to parameter with name like

35
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.370
so.

36
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.590
And here what we want to do is say beer I.D. and then we're gonna give a description.

37
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.560
So these are snippets that are going to be generating the documentation for us so I'm gonna say you

38
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.590
had a desired beer to get and right now this is going to fail.

39
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.800
So I'm going to go ahead and run this test and I'm gonna show you the failure and then explain why.

40
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.140
Because we do have to modify the test a little bit for this because we we do have a valid test in the

41
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.880
context of Spring MVC per say but you can see that the beer idea was not found so we need to modify

42
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.830
our test.

43
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.460
And this this actually.

44
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.930
So you're a builder so let's come in and modify that.

45
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.170
So we're gonna see a beer I.D. like so and then this.

46
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.230
We're not spending anymore but we are going to go ahead and pass that as a parameter.

47
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.720
So this is you can see here it's taking a your template and then object variable so it until you're

48
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.930
showing us a little pop up.

49
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.770
So if we had more than one path variable we could add additional objects to the method parameter.

50
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.930
But here we only have the one so what's going to happen underneath the covers is now this parameter

51
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.000
is gonna get bound with this value then pass to spring MBC.

52
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.190
So very important distinction we were already doing it but here this is going to tell rest docs about

53
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.460
that path parameter because it Rostock isn't really looking at a spring every seat per that is hooked

54
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.230
into the mock MVC implementation so that's why we need to go through and do the step.

55
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.490
So now if we go ahead and run this we will see that their test is now passing in the documentation is

56
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.930
getting generated.

57
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.580
So we do have a passing test now and I also want to demonstrate here if we are trying to run it with

58
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.930
we try to run it with the mark and we see request boulders comment out the rest documentation or requests

59
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:46.390
boulders and we'll rerun that test and if you do run this way and you forget that static import you're

60
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.560
going to see basically a not null blowing up here.

61
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.970
So it's a bad bet error so you might see it manifest that way.

62
00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.850
I've seen it manifest a couple different ways so it may not always be like this but the key point is

63
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.060
to remember that you need the proper static imports so otherwise other things will not work.

64
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.660
So get rid of the Standard Model MVC request builders and bring in the rust documentation request builder.

65
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.310
So that is a very important step.

66
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.570
Do not forget to do that.

67
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.880
I know somebody is going to forget and and ask about that in the course form so but with that changed

68
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.800
if we rerun this again we will see that our tests are back in the green so just to recap what we did

69
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:40.430
here is we changed those static imports very important and then we added in and do document and then

70
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.570
we said the path.

71
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.640
So this is identifier for the API endpoint then we said the path parameters and we are taking this path

72
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.160
parameter beer IP which is going to match this beer I.D..

73
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.830
So we had to modify the test to take that in and then we are passing into a description.

74
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.180
So this description will appear in our generated documentation for the point.
