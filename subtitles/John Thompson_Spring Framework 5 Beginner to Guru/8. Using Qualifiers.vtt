00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.950
OK.
1

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.840
Currently we just have one implementation of the greeting service.
2

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.010
But what if for our constructor property and setter injected controllers we wanted to inject a specific
3

4
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.320
greeting service.
4

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.530
So what we can do is use the qualifier annotation. What I'm going to do here is come in here and
5

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:35.090
refactor this. To make a little more clear, so I'm going to rename that constructor. So the constructor greeting
6

7
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.530
service.
7

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:44.580
We want to have that injected into the constructor injected controller. Let me refactor that. Now
8

9
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.370
let's modify him and we'll say a constructor.
9

10
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.440
So now if I run this everything's just going to run the same.
10

11
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.480
Takes a second to compile.
11

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.310
So now we can see that we are getting the same instance still injected in all three.
12

13
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.910
So let's go ahead and create new services.
13

14
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.740
So we'll do a property injected greeting service.
14

15
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.890
So it's going to the greeting service. Let's come in here and I'm just gonna steal that
15

16
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.700
property and then we also want to take this as a service and here now.
16

17
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.870
Now if we run this we are going to get some confusion because Spring isn't going to know which one to
17

18
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.530
inject.
18

19
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.960
So we're going to get an error here.
19

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.310
We're going to see here that use primary or qualifier.
20

21
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.010
So here I'm going to show you how to use qualifier and what we want to do here is the constructor we
21

22
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.300
are going to qualifier. Let's make sure that I have the right name here.
22

23
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.560
That's just going to be a lower case for the bean name.
23

24
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.890
So when we do annotated components like that, the bean name is going to be the class name but with a
24

25
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.550
leading lowercase.
25

26
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.040
So then we also have the property injected.
26

27
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.720
So I'm going to come back over here to property here and then I can say above the here that the qualifier
27

28
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.390
so that's setting up the qualifiers for that.
28

29
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.980
And finally let's also add in one of the services for a setter base.
29

30
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:54.590
So come in here new class.
30

31
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.360
That's correct.
31

32
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.470
Implement greeting service.
32

33
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.040
Now it's also going to be a service and again that bean name is going to be this.
33

34
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.850
But with leaving a lower case.
34

35
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.410
And when I come up here, I'll add a qualifier
35

36
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.730
like so.
36

37
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.610
And now when I run it I have qualifiers there.
37

38
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.800
So Spring knows which one of these beans to wire into which controller.
38

39
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:34.240
So now you can see the hello world property and I'm also getting property there on the setter. Oh I know
39

40
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.150
why. I didn't change that.
40

41
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.930
So the evils of cut and paste. I actually change that string and the setter inject it serves.
41

42
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.440
Thought this is gonna work out a lot better.
42

43
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.580
And you'll find that I always remind you not to cut and paste as I go ahead and cut and paste. So you
43

44
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.100
can see why and cut and paste can get you in trouble quickly.
44

45
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.670
So now I am getting the expected results. So property is getting the property greeting service. Setter
45

46
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.230
is getting the setter greeting service and constructor is getting the constructor greeting service.
46

47
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:16.070
Again this qualifier is just giving Spring a hint as to which bean you want to have injected.
47

48
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.820
So here we've created that greeting service interface. We have three Spring components that qualify for
48

49
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.150
this Dependency Injection because they all implement that interface. But Spring doesn't know which one
49

50
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.650
we want to be injected.
50

51
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.630
So I throw an error when it couldn't make a determination which one to add. We put in the qualifier hint
51

52
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.750
So Spring now knows which one of these controllers gets which instance of the service.
