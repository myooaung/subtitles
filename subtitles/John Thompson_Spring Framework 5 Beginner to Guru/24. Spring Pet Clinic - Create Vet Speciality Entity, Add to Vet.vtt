In this video, we want to do is come in
and add in the vet specialty in the
1

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
entity and associate that to the vet, so
I'm going to come over here and show you
2

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.609
that. Pet Clinic. We have the vet and
the vet has a specialty. The way this
3

4
00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.519
is set up, the vet is going to have a set
of specialties. We need to create that
4

5
00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.279
specialty object and it's not a very
complex object here, just has a specialty
5

6
00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
extends out a name entity. I'm not going
to implement the named entity. It's just a
6

7
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.020
single property entity, so we'll just use
a plain old POJO for that. Let's go
7

8
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.489
ahead and implement this. We'll come over
here.
8

9
00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.839
We're going to create a new POJO
9

10
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
called Specialty.
10

11
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.370
That's going to extend out our BaseEntity.
11

12
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.780
I'm going to just call that description.
12

13
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.120
I'm doing a command N. Implement getters
and setters. For the description and
13

14
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.290
the base ID, we already have getters and
setters for that. We can see that as
14

15
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.070
complaining that that is never used, so
that is okay. That class is never
15

16
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.630
used but now we're going to go ahead and
use it. Our vet doesn't have anything
16

17
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.970
right now. All we can say private set
17

18
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
Specialty, called
18

19
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.900
specialties, like so. Command N. Getters
and setters.
19

20
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.690
So now, our vet is going to have a set
of specialties on it, so we added in
20

21
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.770
getters and setters and that is that new
property. Let's come back over here to
21

22
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.700
our task. We're saying we want the vet
to have a specialty entity and associate
22

23
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.430
that with vet, so that completes that
task. Just as a recap,
23

24
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.390
pretty simple thing here, which is
setting in a set property of specialties.
24

25
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.770
As we progress in the course, we are
going to convert this over to JPA.
25

26
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.200
The way JPA works of course is to
have POJOs, Plain Old Java Objects which
26

27
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.080
exactly what we have here. We will be
enhancing those POJOs with JPA
27

28
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.500
annotations to set up the mapping via
Hibernate to H2 and MySQL databases. But
28

29
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.000
for now, we're just laying down the
groundwork. That was issue number 27.
29

30
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.260
Let's go ahead and close that out.
30

31
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.350
That closes that task.
