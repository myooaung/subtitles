In the Pet Clinic Project I've created a
couple tests with help-wanted and in
1

2
00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.590
this video we are going to go ahead and
review a contribution that George has
2

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.040
made here. You can see that I have
the issue up here on number 68. George
3

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.510
push to commit to that and I'm going to
come over to the pull request. Let's
4

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
come in and take a look at this fix for
number 68 from George. It's actually got
5

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
three of them. I'm going to do each in a
separate video. We can see that we're
6

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.269
doing a test for an empty owner on
search submit. We want to make sure that
7

8
00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.719
is there. So I can come here. I'm clicking
on files changed.
8

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.570
We can see here he just went in and
added in single test for it and that
9

10
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.690
looks fine. We are setting up Mockito and
then using MockMvc to run the test. So
10

11
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.900
exactly what we want. So I am going to
come back over here and I can say merge
11

12
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.290
this. So I can do this right from GitHub.
Merge that in and we can see that this
12

13
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.930
has now been merged into the 
main branch so or the master branch. So
13

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.950
you can see that this commit was
merged into a springframeworkguru
14

15
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.510
:master. Now to get that, I need to
come over here into IntelliJ. If I
15

16
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.680
do right click I come down to Git
and I can do a pull. That is going to
16

17
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.360
pull down that change to my local
repository.
17

18
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.460
We can see that this is run.
One handy feature that we can do within
18

19
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.860
IntelliJ
so we can come in here and right click
19

20
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.090
on that and say show differences. And of
course it opens up on my other window.
20

21
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.300
But now very similar to the diff,  I can
see exactly what was changed from
21

22
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.980
pulling down the code from GitHub. So we
can see that we now have another test
22

23
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.280
there. So I am going to call that good.
We'll just go ahead and make sure that
23

24
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.710
our test run.
24

25
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.880
Double check that everything runs
locally.
25

26
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.230
And see that all our tests are still
passing. So I'm going to call that good
26

27
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.780
and now come over here.
27

28
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.450
That is completed. I come to
this.
28

29
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.430
You can see that now GitHub is showing the
merge that I did and I can just go ahead
29

30
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.610
and close out the issue saying that this
is now closed.
