00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:05.760
All right.
1

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.360
In this section of the course what we are going to do is we're going to go in and build a functional
2

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.920
web application using Spring Framework.
3

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.400
So we're going to cover a lot of ground in this section.
4

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.680
And I want to go back when I first started getting introduced to Spring and Hibernate and Java, all
5

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.440
this stuff.
6

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.650
I had a mentor early on in my career.
7

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.030
There aas a guy from Russia, spoke of a real thick accent but one of the smartest guys ever worked with and
8

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.250
at that point in time I was a Junior Developer so I was pretty fresh to Java.
9

10
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.800
I knew ask you out pretty good. There's some technology but I was a pretty early developer at that point
10

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.210
in time and we took an early version of Spring.
11

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.520
We used Hibernate and I watch this guy work and he was just very very skilled, very comfortable with
12

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.560
the tools and we built a web application in the afternoon. That was actually functional and had some
13

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.990
really cool functionality.
14

15
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.810
And at that time in my career I was blown away. I was like wow this guy created this whole application. I just
15

16
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.150
did this this he knew exactly where to go for it and that and that and it just all came together and
16

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.260
it worked.
17

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.330
So that's what we're gonna do.
18

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.690
That's what I want to accomplish in this section of the course.
19

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.780
It's going to be a very quick overview of Spring and what I want to show you is how we can use Spring
20

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.960
in a very productive way how Spring is going to save us time to build a web application. By web application,
21

22
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.980
what we're going to do is we are going to be generating  HTML with dynamic content from a database.
22

23
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.940
So we'll be using an In-memory database.
23

24
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.170
We'll be using Hibernate.
24

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
We'll be using Spring Data JPA and we will be configuring everything so that we can display some data
25

26
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.160
from the database onto a web page and we will go through this step by step.
26

27
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.580
But I do want to set some expectations.
27

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.150
We are going to be I'm going to show you how to use this stuff but I'm not gonna be going into a lot
28

29
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.140
of depth.
29

30
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.490
So we are going to kind of go broad in this.
30

31
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.300
Show you a lot of stuff and get a functional web application because I want you to see just how easy
31

32
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.280
it is. I'm not going to explain everything fully in detail.
32

33
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.720
We got a lot of content on this course so I'm going to give you a broad picture of like how easy it is.
33

34
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.840
And we have entire chapters on some of this stuff coming up in the course so we will go deep. But here
34

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.790
we're going to kind of go broad. Give you a broad understanding of what we can do with the Spring Framework.
35

36
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.760
And then some stuff that you have questions about,
36

37
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.410
we will definitely be going deeper and explaining those things and exploring those more coming up
37

38
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.280
in the course.
38

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.330
So here we're gonna have a lot of fun.
39

40
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.920
I will be going step by step and you're going to see just how easy is, how quickly we can build a functional
40

41
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.770
web application using the Spring Framework. So we'll be bringing tools together: Spring Framework, Spring
41

42
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.000
Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, which has Hibernate.
42

43
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.750
I will use an H2 in memory database.
43

44
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.790
So we're gonna bring a lot of these technologies together quickly and you'll see just how
44

45
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.810
easy it is to build a functional web application using these technologies.
45

46
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.510
And let's go over and get started building our first web application using the Spring Framework.
