Hey guys! John Thompson Spring Framework
guru here. So today we're going to take a
1

2
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
look at using the IntelliJ debugger and
this is an example that is working on
2

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.420
for my Spring Core course and showing
how to use Thymeleaf and some validation
3

4
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.769
technology of Thymeleaf and how it
works with the binding properties and in
4

5
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
Spring. So let me just step you through
in IntelliJ. What I was looking at and
5

6
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
toggle over here to IntelliJ now. Okay. So
for my course, I had a Customer domain
6

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
object. I've refactored that to use a
command object for CustomerForm. I've
7

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.739
put in a validation in here for not
empty end userName and in the Customer
8

9
00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:48.090
Controller, down on line 56,
I've passed in the @Valid annotation for
9

10
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.829
CustomerForm and the BindingResult to
check to see if that that binding has
10

11
00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.370
any errors. And if it has any errors, I
want to return back to the CustomerForm.
11

12
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.890
So let's take a look at the behavior of
what's going on right now. So I have the
12

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.570
web application up in Spring Boot
already. I'm going to go into a new Customer
13

14
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.680
and I'm going to hit submit, and my
expectation was to see an error
14

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.330
displayed on screen there, but I'm
getting this error message here, about
15

16
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.360
evaluating the Spring expression. So
let's take a look at the console on this.
16

17
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.909
Going to toggle back over to IntelliJ
and bring up the console here. I'm
17

18
00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.869
getting an neither BindingResult nor
playing target object found for bean
18

19
00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.100
named Customer. It's available as a
request type attribute. So now I'm
19

20
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.840
looking at my code here. I'm expecting to
go back to customerForm and bind an
20

21
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.820
empty value for customer to this.
And this isn't happening for some reason. So
21

22
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
I need to take a peek under the covers
and see what's going on and I can do
22

23
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.460
this through IntelliJ. What I've done
is I've put a breakpoint in the
23

24
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.159
Thymeleaf template engine. I got line 1060
here. I just have a debugging breakpoint.
24

25
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.300
So let's take a look see what's going on with that. And to do that, I need to
25

26
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
shut down Tomcat.
And I'm going to bring it back up. So if you
26

27
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.010
look in the top right of IntelliJ, I have
my normal run configuration. I have my
27

28
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:29.130
debug configuration. So I'm going to bring
it up in debug. You can see it's a little
28

29
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.280
bit slower to startup when we're running
a debug. There is additional
29

30
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.520
overhead there. So I'm going to go back over
to Chrome now. Let's go back to the
30

31
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.730
list and refresh that. That should
trigger the breakpoint. I'm just
31

32
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:52.200
going to go ahead and scroll by that new
Customer. That's also going to trigger the
32

33
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.610
breakpoint. We're going to go by that one.
Now let's do submit. This will also
33

34
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.940
trigger the breakpoint. But I want to see
what's going on in the context. So I'm
34

35
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.920
going to bring up bring this up and take a
closer look at it. And if I go to the
35

36
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.690
context, variables, you can see I have an
object here - WebVariablesMap. And I'm
36

37
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.400
going to scroll through here. The way
Spring binding, so we have a Spring
37

38
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.860
BindingResult customerForm. I'm
inspecting this object. I can see that it
38

39
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.380
does have the errors property of one. So
it's complaining about userName. May not
39

40
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.220
be empty. So let's take a closer look at
my application code. So the property
40

41
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.420
comes in is customerForm and it returns
back to the view. Let's take a look at
41

42
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.019
the Thymeleaf view. Now I could see where
my problem was. So i refactored from
42

43
00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.450
customer to customerForm. Thymeleaf is
looking for customerForm as the object,
43

44
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.800
not customer. So it was looking for
customer versus customerForm. This is an
44

45
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.640
error that I introduced in the
refactoring of it. So let's go ahead and
45

46
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.780
run this again. I'm going to shut down
the debugger and bring it back up
46

47
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.410
normally.
47

48
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.400
Go back to the list. I'm up normally.
We're not in debugging anymore. I'm going to
48

49
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.030
go to new customer and I hit an error.
Let's take a closer look at the error.
49

50
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.630
Now we're getting customerForm
not found. Let's take a quick look at the
50

51
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:42.900
controller. And when I do the new, I also
need to set customerForm here, as well
51

52
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.390
as an attribute. So I'm binding an empty
customerForm object on the new. So let's
52

53
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.810
take a closer look at that. Actually
53

54
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.380
since I I should be able to
rebuild a project here, you see that
54

55
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:06.060
Spring Boot is restarting. I'm going to go
back to the list new customer. That's not
55

56
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.090
working. I'm going to bound Spring Boot
now. So I do have the Spring Boot
56

57
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.400
developer tools implemented. Sometimes
the restart doesn't work quite right. And
57

58
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.610
you actually do have to balance it. So
that's what I'm doing now. So we are back
58

59
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.070
up and running. Bounce over here. Back to
my list so I can display the list
59

60
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.190
normally. There's my customer submit.
There's my errors object. Okay, so this is
60

61
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.120
an example of using the IntelliJ
debugger to take a look to see what's
61

62
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.620
going on in the cover. So this error was
caused by me. I refactored some things I
62

63
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.780
went from customer to customerForm ,and
the way the whole binding error stuff
63

64
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.460
works is tie it off that bean name. So I
was getting couple values in there for
64

65
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.710
customer and customerForm. And because
the customerForm1 is the one that had
65

66
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.050
the binding errors on it, when Thymeleaf
was looking to display, the errors
66

67
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.729
information, it couldn't find it because
in the template, I was binding to
67

68
00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.539
customer and customer was just a new
empty object without any errors. I didn't
68

69
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:13.710
see that error originally. I wasn't quite
sure but what was going on. But through
69

70
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.570
the use of the IntelliJ debugger, I say
well take a look see what was in the web
70

71
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.229
model all the properties and the
attributes in that web model. And do
71

72
00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.160
figure out what was wrong with that.
So hopefully if you ever get in the
72

73
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.120
situation where you need to debug and
see what's going on
73

74
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.510
in the Spring model that's being
presented at a Thymeleaf view layer you
74

75
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.470
can use the IntelliJ debugger to bring
up a list of all the objects and go
75

76
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.220
through that and see what's really going
on and why Thymeleaf might not be happy
76

77
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.669
about something.
