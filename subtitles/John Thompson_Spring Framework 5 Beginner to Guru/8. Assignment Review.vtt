00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.000
Alright! In this assignment review, we are
gonna go through and customize the
1

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
Swagger documentation for the VendorController. So, let's come over to Chrome
2

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.230
real quick, and hide all this. So we are
gonna be looking at the vendor
3

4
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.189
controller. Right now, everything is being
done from reflection. So let's see here. All
4

5
00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
the documentation, but that's all being,
all the data there is being done from
5

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.690
reflections and a little bit of
formatting there. So, they could grab
6

7
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.870
Vendor Controller because I named it
Vendor Controller, and they just break
7

8
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.309
that out. So nice handy way to get it
started, but let's go ahead and use those
8

9
00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.180
annotations and make this a little more
interesting for our consumers of the
9

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.350
documentation. So come back over to
IntelliJ, and let's bring up the 
10

11
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.570
VendorController. The first annotation that
we wanna use is @Api.
11

12
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:04.330
Go ahead and import him.
That's alt enter, on a Mac at least.
12

13
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.950
I'm just saying this is my vendor API.
Let's go through and annotate these
13

14
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.030
@ApiOperation. You can see IntelliJ is
14

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.880
showing a long list there of different
options. So, I'm not gonna be able to go
15

16
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.470
through all these to show you what they
do. But, I suggest checking out the
16

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.990
documentation. And again, some of these
may or may not work with Spring 5 on the
17

18
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.290
2.7 release of Swagger, that we're on. So,
they are working on 2.8 right now. And
18

19
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.380
hopefully, in the following release, we'll
have better Spring 5 support.
19

20
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
I'm gonna add in some notes.
20

21
00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.079
Should be @ApiOperation.
21

22
00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.760
So I'm saying that the post
operation is going to create one. Then, @Api.
22

23
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.780
Update an existing vendor.
23

24
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.600
So, @ApiOperation. For the
patch, we're gonna update a property
24

25
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.200
and let's spell vendor right.
25

26
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.019
And then, finally, we'll do a deleteVendor. Then also, let's update the
26

27
00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.879
models. So, here's our VendorDTO.
27

28
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.690
So there, I'm changing the name of the
vendor to required = true. Let's go ahead
28

29
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.640
and restart Spring 5. I'll go over in
Spring Boot, I should say, and we'll go
29

30
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.630
over and take a look at it once it
started.
30

31
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.910
You can see, we are back up and happy.
Let's go take a quick look at the API
31

32
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.770
documentation generated by Spring Fox. So,
you can see here, this is my Vendor API,
32

33
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.980
and let's expand these out. So, see here,
now I have a view list of vendors. Create
33

34
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.570
new vendor. Delete a vendor. Get vendor by
id. So, these are all the descriptions
34

35
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.750
that I added in there. It's no longer,
remember here, I annotated that one, but
35

36
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.290
this one does not have it. So, it's just
using the method name for the controller.
36

37
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.000
So not necessarily the best thing to be
using. But now, we can see that our API
37

38
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.660
documentation looks a little more
professional and it's more friendly. So,
38

39
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.560
these are very nice things that we can
do with the Swagger Documentation to
39

40
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.760
make our API documentation more friendly
for people that are gonna be
40

41
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.350
consuming APIs that we develop.
