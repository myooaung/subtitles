00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.650
In this video we're going to go in and configure maven to support spring rest stocks and there's just

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.190
a couple of things that we need to do in this video.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.120
I'm going to cut and paste some things in for us just to speed things up I don't think you guys want

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.860
to see me type out every dependency.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.560
So the first thing I can do is grab end the dependency for spring rest stocks and this is going to bring

6
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.650
in the main dependency of this what's going to give us the testing capabilities that we need and want

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.120
to point out that this is curated by the Spring Boot team so that we are going to inherit the version

8
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
number of that from the parent Palm.

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.980
So if I scroll up here to the top remember we are working from the Spring Boot parent POM just like

10
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.380
all the other spring dependencies where we're not explicitly saying version numbers we are going to

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.200
be getting that version number from the Spring Boot parent poem.

12
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.320
Now that only brings in the dependency what we need to do is also add in the ASCII Doctor maven plugin

13
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:16.470
so I'm going to grab that now and let me minimize the compiler plugin and I'm going to put it right

14
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.640
underneath that so let's go through what we're doing.

15
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.080
Bring it up a little bit here and you can see on line one 30 of the Palm.

16
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.740
This is the ASCII Doctor maven plugin that we're bringing in.

17
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.340
We do have to specify the version current versions of 1 5 3 and then on 133 what's going on there as

18
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.740
we are configuring this maven plug in to run in a specific phase so we are giving it a name identification

19
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.950
of generate dash docs and it's going to hook into the Maven phase of prepare package.

20
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.660
So this is going to happen just before maven goes and packages the project.

21
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.060
Now the goal the process ASCII Doc that is a goal a plug in and then there's a couple of configuration

22
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.610
values I'm going to be honest I'm not terribly familiar with this plug in this configuration is right

23
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.790
out of the spring rest docs documentation this is how they say to configure it for use and then finally

24
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.900
the dependencies there you can see that we are bringing in a jar of the spring rest docs ask you Doctor

25
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.370
dependency so that it's going to work in conjunction with this plug in so that that is important.

26
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.910
And then I want to point out on line 1 50 the version number there for spring rest docs.

27
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.890
This is a maven property.

28
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.580
So this property is getting set.

29
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.440
We're not setting it explicitly.

30
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.620
This is being set in the spring boot parent Palm.

31
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.370
So this guy right here what's important about this this is a maven property is being inherited from

32
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.020
the spring boot parent palm and it's also being used for this.

33
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.590
So if you were to go upstream and look at the parent palm ultimately when you find this dependency declared

34
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.050
there's going to be referencing this version number so that is important because we don't want to have

35
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.720
Version 1 spot on version and the other and have the potential for these to get out of sync.

36
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.000
So we definitely want these two to be on the same release versions if you got on different release versions.

37
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.670
It would probably cause you some pretty strange and hard to troubleshoot errors.

38
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.070
So definitely could have there to make sure that these are running on the same thing.

39
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.730
Now the one additional piece that we need to pick up is for the ask your doctor.

40
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.510
So what we need to do for asking Doctor is we need to come up to the main folder and we're going to

41
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.180
create a new directory and we are going to call that ASCII doc.

42
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.810
Just like that.

43
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.310
So this is a default location that is going to be looked for by the ASCII Doctor plugin.

44
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.840
So then we also need to add in a file and we will call this index that a doc like so.

45
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.500
So that's Shaffer ASCII doctor and I have on my clipboard a basic template.

46
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.070
Go ahead and paste that in.

47
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.910
And what this is going to do is remember how we talked about in the introduction here how breast Doc

48
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.680
creates these snippets.

49
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.720
What's gonna happen is that's a process that's going to go in and replace with these snippets.

50
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.550
So these little snippets will get replaced.

51
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.370
And that's what I ask you doctor is going to do so the test documentation is going to go out and generate

52
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.250
snippets and then ask you doctor is going to assemble things into a single document and then ultimately

53
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.070
use this to produce an HDMI document.

54
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.670
So it takes the many little pieces of code snippet and then assembles them into a single document.

55
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.070
Now when you're developing multiple endpoints and a lot of documentation this is where you're going

56
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.130
to be doing a little bit of work to configure things.

57
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.490
Now ask Doctor itself is very very capable and I'm not going to be going into a lot of detail on Ask

58
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.460
ASCII doctor.

59
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.780
You just can't cover everything but ask your doctor does have a lot of capabilities the spring rest

60
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.850
our documentation has a little bit on it but it is a pretty large and robust project so we're just using

61
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.690
some of the capabilities here to assemble our documentation.

62
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:23.110
The key takeaway that I want you to remember here is that we are going to be using spring rest docs

63
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.680
to create snippets and then this ASCII doctor this index here that is basically going to assemble those

64
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.890
snippets together into a single document and the build process and we'll look at that as we get further

65
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.970
down in the section of how things get assembled because I'm pretty sure we're gonna have to make some

66
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.440
changes here to this but we'll do that in an upcoming video.

67
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:52.310
So just to quickly recap what we did as we added in the rest docs dependency and then we added in the

68
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.730
ASCII Doctor maven plug in and that's what's going to be running after our test run the tests will generate

69
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.170
snippets and then this this plug in here is going to assemble those snippets into a single document.

70
00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.310
So in this configuration is very important.

71
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:13.700
And if you look at the spring rustic documentation this configuration is directly from there.

72
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.570
So very well laid out and it's pretty straightforward as to what it needs to do.
