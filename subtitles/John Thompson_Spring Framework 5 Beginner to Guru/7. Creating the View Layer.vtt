00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.980
In this video, we're going to go through and create a template to show the joke that we've been working

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.510
on, so this is going to be the timely view later that we're going to be implementing here.

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.130
So remember, we need the timely template that as the movie in MVC.

4
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.800
So we'll go ahead and jump over to anthologized and we'll start adding in this template to show the

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.170
joke.

6
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.850
So I'm going to go ahead and close the controller here and I'm going to come over here to resources,

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.510
templates.

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.710
And if you've checked out of GitHub, you probably don't have the template folder.

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.580
So go ahead and create that.

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.880
And again, that's default behavior of GitHub to not check in empty directory.

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.030
So let's go ahead and come in here.

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.930
I'm going to say create a new HTML file and we'll just call this index.

13
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.770
Go ahead and add that so and then the first thing that we want to do is come up here, so we have the

14
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.260
DOCTYPE, Tommo, we need to add in the timely namespace.

15
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.010
And I've cheated a little bit of that to my clipboard and I'm just going to paste that.

16
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.760
And so we can see remember, the HTML is an extension of Ximo.

17
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.940
Here we are using the XML namespace, so we're giving it the, the timely.

18
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.620
This gives us the extensions that timely it works on.

19
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.170
So let's come up here and call this.

20
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.250
So the title of the page to Chuck Norris jokes.

21
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.730
And then what we can do here is we'll just do, say, H1, we're not going to get to elaborate here.

22
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.710
So we'll just do that, then we can come here and we'll use a paragraph tag and I'm just going to do

23
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.720
so.

24
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.070
Show joke here.

25
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.750
So this is just regular e-mail right now.

26
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.690
So now what we want to do is add in the timeless magic.

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.290
So come over here to this tag and we're into timely that again, this is, remember, up at the top

28
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.010
there on line two, we're bringing in the timely XML namespace.

29
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.970
So T.H..

30
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.300
And we want to do text now in this text, but we want to do is we're going to use an expression to get

31
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.080
a hold of the model.

32
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.370
So here's our model and what we want to do is joke.

33
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.380
Very simple expression, so this is basically telling time, if I want the property off a model joke

34
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.630
to be inserted into this paragraph tag.

35
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.740
So this show joke here, that text at runtime is going to get replaced.

36
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.110
So let's go ahead and start up our jokes application.

37
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.980
Again, I'm just clicking on start, alternatively, you can come in here on our intelligence and say

38
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.620
run, that will also start it up.

39
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.560
And we can see here that while I was showing you that in the background, we could see that Tomcat started

40
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.820
on Port 80 80.

41
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.510
With context patha nothing, so we'll go right to the root.

42
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.640
So now let's come over to Crome.

43
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.820
At Newtown.

44
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.440
Well, host and get rid of that, so I'm just going to go to localhost aviating.

45
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:27.010
And we can see here, there's my heading one Chuck Norris joke, and we could see that we have one of

46
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.420
the Chuck Norris jokes there.

47
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.670
I'm not going to read each one here.

48
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:38.590
And then if I do a refresh, I can see that now we are getting our random jokes displayed here upon

49
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.550
each refresh.

50
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.850
So let's jump over to anthologized real quick.

51
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.100
And I'm going to go ahead and stop this.

52
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.270
We don't need that running, minimize this window and let's go from the bottom up.

53
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.110
So we implemented an interface for the joke service, simple method of joke.

54
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.510
We created an implementation of that service.

55
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.890
So this is going to get hard wired in the Chuck Norris quotes.

56
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.930
And again, to remember, I said that normally I'd make this a spring Manesh component.

57
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.750
We really haven't covered that in the course just yet.

58
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.240
We will.

59
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.800
Coming up.

60
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.170
So how to handle an external property like that?

61
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.240
But here we are wiring in in the constructor, expand this out.

62
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.680
So it's not so confusing.

63
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.870
And the constructor, we are going to initialize the Chuck Norris quotes to a new instance and then

64
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.380
I get joke.

65
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.640
It's just going to be calling a method to get a random quote or joke and use those interchangeably.

66
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.550
I apologize for that.

67
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.290
And then this service, because we annotated with ServiceSource class, is going to become a spring

68
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.190
managed being, so spring is going to create an instance of this in the spring context.

69
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.620
Likewise, the controller that also becomes a spring manager component.

70
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.720
So that controller is going to get wired up.

71
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:05.260
And because we have a construct around that, the joke service is going to get injected into this class

72
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.190
by spring.

73
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.310
We provided one method here to show the joke.

74
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.130
Again, this is the controller.

75
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.240
So when we have a request coming into the root of the context, this method will get invoked.

76
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.770
We are passing in the model from the that's the M and Spring MVC.

77
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.600
So we are passing in the model here.

78
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.780
We are pending a joke from the joke service to the property of joke, and then we are returning back

79
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.440
the index, a string just simply index and that tells time leave to look for a basically a template

80
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.670
file under templates called index.

81
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.780
So this gets called by the spring MVC to display the joke.

82
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.550
The main things that we had to do here is we had to add in the XML namespace for timely.

83
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:57.150
And then in our paragraph tag we are using the time leaf tag of context and then requesting the joke

84
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
property to be added here in the template.

85
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:07.180
So at runtime one time, which processes this template, the show joke here will get replaced with the

86
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.320
string value of joke and come back over to Chrom real quick.

87
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.750
And I will commit everything against issue number five, for your reference, so you can see exactly

88
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.340
what was changed in this lesson.
