Alrighty, guys! Had fun playing with the
RestTemplate and Webflux inside of
1

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.450
Spring.
These are RESTful clients that can use.
2

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.980
So we do have a standard RestTemplate
that is the traditional, and then, we also
3

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
have the Reactive one. So we will
definitely be getting more hands-on with
4

5
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.980
these, as we go forward in the course.
These are real handy tools to have.
5

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.179
In this part of the course, I just want to
get you introduced to actually consuming
6

7
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.590
RESTful APIs. And now, we now that we've
consumed them. In the next part of the
7

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.770
course, we're gonna actually look at
building them. Between now and then, I
8

9
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.430
challenge you to take these and play
with RESTful API. So look at the
9

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.030
programmable web, which is actually where
I found the API that we're dealing with.
10

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
There's literally thousands
of RESTful APIs out there that you can
11

12
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
work with and play with. So I encourage
you to do that and get used to this
12

13
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.510
because consuming RESTful API is a big
part of writing Spring Framework
13

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.320
applications.
