00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.009
Okay, we need to talk about environment
variables and I'm going to do this
1

2
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.279
through an assignment. So MySQL is
probably one of the most popular
2

3
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
databases out there, and what we want to
do is we're going to run MySQL in a
3

4
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
container, in a Docker container. What
we want to do is we want to use some
4

5
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
environment variables, to help enable
this. So this is a good exercise, so we
5

6
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.879
can remap ports, we can map storage. Now
we're going to introduce environment
6

7
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.610
variables. That's a very simple
parameter. We do a dash E, name, value so
7

8
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.190
and if we look at the MySQL Docker
documentation for the instance. Open Docker hub.
8

9
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.480
It tells us exactly how to do this.
So what I want us to have is a MySQL
9

10
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.799
container running and persisting to
storage, on the localhost, where it's
10

11
00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.869
going to set up and map the ports for
MySQL. 3306 remember right? And so
11

12
00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.799
we'll map out the ports and the MySQL
image has environment variables that we
12

13
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.110
set. And what I want to do is enable a
null root password. So this is a very
13

14
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
common in the MySQL community,
unfortunately, but it is very bad habit
14

15
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.299
to do. But, this is a little development
instance, we're just playing with and the
15

16
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.829
goal of this exercise is to get you to
set an environment variable. Now these
16

17
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.670
environment variables are extremely
important, and from experience in working
17

18
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.540
with a lot of Docker containers, you're
going to be setting environment
18

19
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.579
variables, mapping ports, and mapping
storage. So these are the big three when
19

20
00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.170
we're dealing with Docker containers in
a development context. Now that there's
20

21
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.990
more to Docker than it just is but
for you as a Java developer the big
21

22
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.329
three are mapping ports, environment
variables, and mapping storage. So this is
22

23
00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.360
the stuff that you're going to be
worried about in your day to day use with
23

24
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.670
using Docker. So that's good exercise.
Just to recap, create a MySQL container,
24

25
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.959
open up the port 3306 for for MySQL
so we can connect to it ,and storage, you
25

26
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.770
know why I have a persistent storage, and
then we also want a null root password,
26

27
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.750
and that is done through an
environment variable.
