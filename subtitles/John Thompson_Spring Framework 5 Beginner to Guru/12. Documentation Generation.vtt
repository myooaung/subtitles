00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.120
In this video we're going to look at the actual generation of the documentation.

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.770
So we've been setting up to generate a lot of the snippets we've looked at the snippets but we haven't

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.750
looked at the final product yet.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.010
And let's start setting that up.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.160
So the first thing I want to do is just go ahead.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.370
I'm gonna run a clean and then we'll do a package so can get a first set of resources generated through

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.560
maven and we want to take a look at what's being generated and also some of the MAVEN output because

8
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.350
there's some errors here I've intentionally left them here so that we can go in and see the problems

9
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.860
and then address them.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.290
So there's actually a couple of things happening right now we can see that.

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.040
Ask your doctor is saying hey we didn't find these files so you can see that we have snippets orders

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.610
curl requests and so on.

13
00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.080
These are not getting generated because if we come in here and take a look at the target and the generated

14
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.960
snippets we can see we have one beer and then also the problem is we have one folder.

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.680
This is a complete setup of the documentation.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.610
But if you go in here you'll notice that we have two endpoints that we're actually generating documentation

17
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:27.090
on and we are getting the get requests but we are not getting the new request for the post I think was.

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.270
And what's happening here is we are overwriting each other.

19
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.490
So this is not not quite right.

20
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.060
And our template is wrong.

21
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.020
So two things wrong one we are not generating all the documentation that we want and two if we look

22
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.950
at their index this is not functioning correctly.

23
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.710
So let's go ahead and we'll go in and fix the documentation generation and what's controlling this is

24
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.700
this identifier.

25
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.750
So this is going into v 1 beer so I'm going to change this.

26
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.870
So I just do V1 beer new and there's actually several strategy says that how to deal with this.

27
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.420
As far as setting this up this does need to be unique to the operation.

28
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.330
So here I may have misspoke earlier in the.

29
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.590
And one of the videos but this does need to be unique to the operation.

30
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.680
Otherwise what's happening is we don't get the proper documentation generated.

31
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.370
So we do need a folder generated for that.

32
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.320
So that V1 beer new and then here for the update.

33
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.050
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.380
I misspoke there should be V1 get and then the

35
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.320
this one I want to be new since we are creating a new object and you can call this anything you want.

36
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.650
You might want to do a post get to keep things matching the operations but here I'm just doing new as

37
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.490
far as I know there is no convention here.

38
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.790
I'm sure companies have developed conventions around this so if there's something in place you definitely

39
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.750
want to be following that at an organization that you're working for.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:13.980
So then go in here and clean this and let's go ahead and do a package and examine that documentation

41
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.940
that gets generated

42
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.090
so I can see that they weren't found it again towards our index.

43
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:32.130
But let's take a look at the generation themselves now in the generation snippets we have V1 beer get

44
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
and V1 beer new I have updated the index

45
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.330
and cut and paste into here because I don't think you guys want to see any type all this out they size

46
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.550
is a little bit so you can see here.

47
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.270
Now I have to get beer and new beer and we are bringing in the get request and then the new request.

48
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.840
And here we might want include additional properties so you can see these snippets are getting generated.

49
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.030
I'm not teaching ASCII dark as to how it assembles everything there's a lot of capabilities here I'm

50
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.700
not getting into there's a lot of things that we can do with ASCII Doc I just want give you some fundamental

51
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.030
understanding to see how this generates documentation.

52
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.630
So now let's go ahead and clean this again and we'll do another package and this is going to assemble

53
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.690
things and we shouldn't get a errors in in the logs.

54
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.040
No that should clean up those red lines that we saw previously and we'll get properly I'm using air

55
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.280
quotes properly generated documentation and see that ASCII doctor just ran there and there's no longer

56
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:52.430
any warnings in the council so we can come in here and this is going to be going to the generated dock.

57
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.230
That's where the ASCII dock output is.

58
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.120
So just to recap the generated snippets these are getting assembled.

59
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.970
So I ask you docks looking at this index a dock and ultimately creating this index file.

60
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.400
So let's go ahead and take a look at that inside of chrome.

61
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.060
So here in Chrome This is the index documentation that was created.

62
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.690
And we can see very very simple documentation.

63
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.570
And these are some of the things that are being generated for us as far as a response field so we can

64
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.230
go in and add in the type information for these guys and see some additional things.

65
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.710
And one thing I'm going to do here is I'm going to make a little change this documentation to show you

66
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.800
how simple it is.

67
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.260
We're not getting the property so notice these response fields.

68
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.440
This is not where we're we're doing that custom constraint validator.

69
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.790
So let's go ahead and add that and I'm going to come in here I'm going to jump over to ontology and

70
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.410
we want to get these requests fields.

71
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.620
So let's go in here and I'm going to say

72
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.970
and this time we're just going to copy that include.

73
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:13.470
Now we want to come in for the new and we're gonna replace this little a duck snippet with the request

74
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.630
so if you remember a few videos ago we talked about creating these requests fields where we added in

75
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.790
the constraint information.

76
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:32.310
So let's go ahead and packages up again and this is going to cause a rewrite not generate anything a

77
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.470
anything new or different here so I'm just going to allow it to rewrite rather than do a clean and package.

78
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.550
So make sure that everything's happy as we go through the build process

79
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:52.160
so we're getting a warning about a legal reflective access so that that is a Java 11 thing.

80
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.820
So let's jump back over to Chrome and do a refresh on this file

81
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:08.590
and now we can see that we do have the request fields there and happy with how it's looking so I'm going

82
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.410
to pause this and see if I can get the formatting correctly so I went in and took a look.

83
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:20.660
I am not the expert in a dog by any means but I took a look to see what was different.

84
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.870
So we have formatting differences between what we had and it's actually should be.

85
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.440
So we did have things different before ups should be like so

86
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.390
so everything should be aligned to the margins.

87
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:45.210
So before we we had a bunch of spaces out there some download to show you what was there before.

88
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:52.110
So again this is in the resources request field snippet one that we created during the one of the previous

89
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.710
lectures on the documenting constraints we added in the snippet.

90
00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.640
So this is a template for the snippet and that was generating incorrectly so when I did that and refreshed

91
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.250
the Chrome browser so it can't jump over the chrome.

92
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:14.360
Now we can see that the request fields we have a properly formatted table and here we can see that we

93
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.490
are actually getting the type information.

94
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.110
There is an additional property for these where we could give it the type information that differences.

95
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.530
Remember we built that helper method to go in and do it the reflection to get the constraint information

96
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.980
that is also gathering type information for us.

97
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.990
So we do get a couple of benefits to doing that.

98
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:39.680
So again there's a number I mean you literally have like a swiss army knife of options here as to how

99
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.280
to generate your documentation there's a lot that you can be doing with it.

100
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.700
So I'm just trying to give you the basic tools I'm getting your rest documentation going with spring

101
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.480
rest docs here.
