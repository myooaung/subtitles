Alright. In this video, we are gonna
take a look at MapStuct support for
1

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.469
IntelliJ and this is a plugin that was
just released. You can see here, I've
2

3
00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.270
got the blog post up from the MapStruct
announcement from their website for this
3

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
new plugin. This is like just six or
seven days ago, probably not not even a
4

5
00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.900
week that I'm recording this that this
was released. Now we can see here, I just
5

6
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.619
wanna go over. You can see here, as we
setup the mapping. What its gonna give
6

7
00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
us is autocomplete for the
mappings and the targets. So a nice
7

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.340
feature there. And we'll be able to go to
the declaration. So a nice little be able
8

9
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.149
to jump right from that to the class. And
then finally, it's gonna show the find
9

10
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.800
usages. So some nice features and
functionality for gets our id playing
10

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.280
with MapStruct. A little nicer. So I'm
gonna go ahead and show you how to
11

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.940
install that. So, jump over to IntelliJ. If
you come up to the settings, go to
12

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.650
Plugins. And what we wanna do is Browse
repositories. Come up here and do
13

14
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.680
mapstruct. Here we are MapStruct support.
And then, just click install. And we're
14

15
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.070
gonna need to do a restart of
IntelliJ for this but I'm not gonna step
15

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.549
through that. Actually, I'm gonna pause
this. I'm gonna restart IntelliJ and
16

17
00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.170
restart and I'm gonna pause the video
while IntelliJ restarts. Okay, jumped ahead
17

18
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.060
and I've got the MapStruct plug-in
installed now. Let's go ahead and
18

19
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.509
take a quick look at the functionality
of it. I do @Mapping. I'm gonna say source.
19

20
00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.590
Now, if I just do control, you can see
that I get the property names there.
20

21
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.130
I actually need to be inside the.. now we
can see name. And if I do a command click,
21

22
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.350
it'll jump over to the actual
property for us. So nice functionality. If
22

23
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.180
you are an Eclipse user, there is also a
plugin for Eclipse provided by MapStruct
23

24
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.349
that has similar functionality. I
do not have Eclipse even installed on my
24

25
00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.990
machine, otherwise, I'd demo it. But for
those of you that using
25

26
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.440
Eclipse, you do have some other
functionality through a plug-in there.
