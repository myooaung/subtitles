00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.049
Alright. In this section of the course,
we are gonna have a lot of fun. We are
1

2
00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.130
gonna start building our own APIs.
We're gonna be following this guy's
2

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.310
prescribed method of developing APIs.
We're gonna be looking at resources.
3

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.869
We're gonna be looking at developing our
own API. So remember the last section of
4

5
00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.230
course, we're looking at the RESTful
clients. This time, we're gonna take those
5

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.529
clients and we're gonna use the exact
same thing. So we're looking at Swagger
6

7
00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
documentation there, and in this part of
the course, we're gonna implement the
7

8
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.420
API's that we were previously working
with. So this should be some fun for us
8

9
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.910
to do. We're gonna go through it step by
step, and it's gonnao give us a chance to
9

10
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.489
leverage some really cool stuff that
we've been working with in of course
10

11
00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
all along. So we're gonna continue
using an H2 in memory database. We're
11

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.100
gonna continue using JPA and Hibernate,
and we're gonna leverage everything that
12

13
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
we did. But now, we're gonna take all that
knowledge that we have before. We're
13

14
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
gonna build a RESTful front end onto it,
and we'll go through a step by step.
14

15
00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
Right now, in this part of the course,
we're gonna be focused on Spring MVC.
15

16
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
So Spring MVC is probably the most
popular technology, as far as Spring
16

17
00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.950
Framework goes for developing RESTful
endpoints. So the Webflux is brand new.
17

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
I'm gonna dedicate a whole section of
the course on Webflux and developing
18

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.900
API's that way in a reactive style. But
here, we're gonna be covering
19

20
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.799
traditional Spring MVC and developing
RESTful endpoints for that. So we've got
20

21
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.740
a lot of really cool content in the
section. We're gonna see stuff that we've
21

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
been working with in the past. But I'm
gonna throw you citing some new ones.
22

23
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.380
So like Project Lombok, we've been using
that too, as an annotation processor to
23

24
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.470
enhance their classes. In this part of
the course, I'm also gonna introduce
24

25
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.049
you to a project called Mapstruct, which
gives us an object mapper. So you can in
25

26
00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.560
fact expose your entities to a RESTful
client. That is perfectly legal to do and
26

27
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.729
actually quite often done. Spring
actually has an entire project called
27

28
00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.579
Spring Data Rest, which will expose your
entities directly to a web layer. So it's
28

29
00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.590
perfectly fine to do that. From
experience, almost as your project goes,
29

30
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.730
you'll often outgrow and just
exposing your entities, and you'll have
30

31
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
some type of data transfer object. So
we're gonna introduce data transfer
31

32
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.600
objects in this section of the course, and
I'm gonna show you how to set up Mapstruct
32

33
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.830
to make our type conversion really
easy. So coming up, we have a lot of
33

34
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600
really cool content. I'm excited about
this. There's a lot of content in this
34

35
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.080
part of the course and we are gonna
go through and build our own RESTful API.
35

36
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.790
We'll go step by step, and by the end of
this section of the course, I think
36

37
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.120
you're gonna be pretty confident in
developing RESTful API's with the Spring
37

38
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.330
Framework.
