00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.769
Alright, we're going to talk about
externalising properties in Spring and
1

2
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.859
Spring Boot. So there's a number of
different options that we can use here
2

3
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
and as the Spring framework is evolved,
there's actually a number of different
3

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.560
ways of externalising properties inside
of Spring. It's actually a very robust
4

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.510
area. We're going to look at several of
them in this section of the course.
5

6
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.149
Externalising properties are something
very important especially when you're in
6

7
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.930
a big enterprise application because
you're going to be doing externalising
7

8
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.149
things like database connect URLs,
database users, passwords, things like
8

9
00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.309
that. So where all this other
enterprising stuff is, is going to be put
9

10
00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.010
into externalised property. So your
deployment artifact should be able to be
10

11
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
deployed in any environment and what
changes about that environment, you want
11

12
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.510
to have externalised. So you can move it
from development, to QA, to production and
12

13
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.820
have these different environments. That
same artifact should move all the
13

14
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.040
way through and to enable this or to
help us out in the configuration of this,
14

15
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.090
we use a lot of external properties and
we're going to take a look at wiring
15

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.570
some up now in this course and by the
time you get done to the section you're
16

17
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.290
in see that we do have a number of
different tools that we can use to
17

18
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.090
define externalized properties.
