00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.690
In this video, we are going to take a
look at getting MySQL installed on OS X.
1

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.860
Now, if you are not using a Mac system,
please check out one of the other
2

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.369
installation videos. This going to be very
OS X specific video. I am a developer
3

4
00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.260
on OS X by choice. I prefer that for most
of my own personal development. I've been
4

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.449
doing OS X since 2008, I think. Okay,
so the first thing I want to do is go
5

6
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.110
out and download MySQL. So, if you go out
to www.mysql.com/downloads
6

7
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.600
you'll see the page for MySQL downloads.
What we want to  do is come all the way down
7

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.379
to the bottom and look for the Community
Edition. So, we'll go ahead and follow
8

9
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.010
that to downloads. We want the MySQL
community server, which is perfect for us.
9

10
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
We're not going to get into cluster
router or utilities right now. So, let's
10

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.320
go ahead and download that. We can
say this is available as sever download
11

12
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.920
and I want to select OS X. I'm going to
bring down the dmg archive. We could
12

13
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.610
see, I've actually already downloaded, so
we didn't have to wait for it to
13

14
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.380
download. Now, in the other tab here, I
actually have an overview of the
14

15
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.970
installation options, so there are
installation instructions. I will leave
15

16
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590
this link in the course resources for
this video lecture, where you'll be able
16

17
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.700
to get to this link and for using these
native packages. I'm going to use the
17

18
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.610
package installer for MySQL, which
is going to set it up. We'll click on
18

19
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.930
that. We'll go through this. Typically, not
a fan of this type of installer because
19

20
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.880
it has a lot of clicks to get through it.
But, we'll step through that. The one
20

21
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
thing that we do want to do is set up
the MySQL Server, Preference Plane and
21

22
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.560
Launchd support. So, these two are kind
of important. They're not mandatory, but
22

23
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.310
they are going to give you an icon under
system settings to work with it.
23

24
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.219
Launchd support is going to, if your
system restarts, MySQL will automatically
24

25
00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.110
be restarted on it, so you don't have to
go and start it. So, you can see here,
25

26
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.810
this is going to go through the summary.
We're going to step through this in just
26

27
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.370
a moment here.
The other thing that want to point
27

28
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.840
out here is at the bottom of this MySQL
is installed as an application
28

29
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.240
within your operating system. So, a lot of
OS X applications are just going to be
29

30
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.260
under the application directory ,where
you can just go delete them. MySQL is a
30

31
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.760
little bit different than the typical OS X
applications. It's more like a Unix
31

32
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.340
application, where it's going to be
installed in under user local and then
32

33
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.620
number of directories are
going to get created there. So, important to
33

34
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.060
understand, if you ever have to peek
underneath the covers we're OS X
34

35
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.850
was got installed. So, I'm going to come
over here and start the installation
35

36
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.240
process now. It's here. It's going through
verifying it and I should get the
36

37
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.910
installer popping up. Go ahead and double
click on this. And now, we can see here, do
37

38
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.150
this. Make this a little clearer for us.
So, in this introduction, I'm going to click on
38

39
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.070
continue. So, you can see, remember, I
mentioned that it is under the GNU
39

40
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.900
public license. So, I'm going to click
continue there, and of course, we have to
40

41
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.030
agree on that. So, in the install notes
that does say, you can change install
41

42
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.130
location. The install note say that that
does not work, so trying to change your
42

43
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.180
install location will not do anything
according to install directions. So, we're
43

44
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.180
going to go ahead and click on that. I'm
going to use my touch ID to authorize it
44

45
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.070
to go in and install the files to my own
operating system. You can see it
45

46
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.320
actually goes by fairly quick. It is not
my modern day standards, a very large
46

47
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.950
program. We can see here that it is
set up a password here. So, I'm going to copy
47

48
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.540
that and make note of it. So, this is
important message. So, root@localhost,
48

49
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.510
that is the most powerful password on
MySQL. It does create a temporary
49

50
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.810
password for it, so when you're going
through it, definitely, make note of that.
50

51
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.220
But, you can always reset the root
password as well. So, there's a couple
51

52
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.960
workarounds for it, so don't worry if you
forget it, there's a way to get around
52

53
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.620
that.
So, I'm going to say okay here, and now, the
53

54
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.080
installation process is done. You're
going to go ahead and close that.  I am
54

55
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.949
just going to say move it to trash, because
I am all done with that Installer, and
55

56
00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:43.419
that closes down. Now, I want to come up
here to system preferences. You can
56

57
00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.030
see now that I have a MySQL icon at the
bottom here. So, in this bottom plane
57

58
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.639
here. So, go ahead and click on that,
and you can see that MySQL Server
58

59
00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.500
instance is stopped. So, let's go ahead
and start it. I'm going to use my
59

60
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.819
touch ID again.
We can see that it has started up
60

61
00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.039
normally. Typically, we're going to be
working with it a lot. I will leave this
61

62
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.719
selected. MySQL server running it in
the background as your system is running it.
62

63
00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.479
It really doesn't take up a lot of
resources. Not a modern hardware.
63

64
00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.080
Especially, you won't even notice
there. But, if you're doing development
64

65
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.649
against it, kind of nice to have it up and
running, so you don't have to go out and
65

66
00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:28.509
start it manually. So, kind of a nice to
have, and again, just to remind you that
66

67
00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.729
it was under system preferences. So, I
come to system preferences, and you'll
67

68
00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.469
have a new MySQL down there. Now,
make sure that is running and
68

69
00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.969
automatically start MySQL server on
startup. So, at this point MySQL is
69

70
00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.800
installed and running in the background
machine. Now, in the next section of the
70

71
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.189
course, what we're going to do is look at
getting connected to MySQL. So, the
71

72
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.639
primary goal of this whole section of
course is to get MySQL installed and
72

73
00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.649
set up on your local machine, and then we
will start looking at connecting to MySQL
73

74
00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:04.259
and using MySQL locally on your server.
