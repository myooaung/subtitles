00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.340
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and implement the Owner Index Page and
1

2
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170
controller. This is going to be task
number lucky 13. I actually
2

3
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.080
assigned lucky 13 to myself. Let's
toggle over to IntelliJ. What we want
3

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.510
to do is come in here and now I'm going
to create a New Directory inside of
4

5
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.590
templates called owners
like so. I'm going to go ahead and stop
5

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.790
Spring Boot while we're here. 
I'll create a another HTML File.
6

7
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.239
Go ahead and add that to Git.
7

8
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.340
I say List of Pet Owners. I'm going back over here
to grab the Thymeleaf namespace. Copy
8

9
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.500
that over. Come back to owners. Put that
in the tag.
9

10
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.140
I'm just changing the strings a little
bit so I have list of owners. They're
10

11
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.540
rendered in Thymeleaf. This sets up the 
Thymeleaf template for us to use. Now
11

12
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.530
let's come over here. We need to create
the controller. Remember we need to
12

13
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.640
have the Spring Controller because
basically, that's going to be the traffic
13

14
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.080
cop. Remember when a request comes in,
Spring is going to be handling it
14

15
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.710
through a controller. Come up and add a
New Java Class. Add in OwnerController.
15

16
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.950
Yes, add a file GitHub.
16

17
00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.280
I'm going to turn back list of owners.
This time
17

18
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.230
we will do
18

19
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.719
owners/index.
19

20
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.760
Remember in the request mapping here,
for the..I'm sorry. In the
20

21
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.209
controller, we did these. I'm just going to
copy that right over so I'll be
21

22
00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.330
consistent but we want owners
22

23
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.120
like so. Now one thing. Let me show you
a little trick here. What we can do here,
23

24
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.050
in this, I'm going to show you something
with RequestMapping what while we're on
24

25
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.200
this.
That's just going to be a variant.
25

26
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800
A lot of times inside of Spring, there's
more than one way to do things.
26

27
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.920
Because everything in this controller
is going to go to Owners, what I can do
27

28
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.700
is RequestMapping, now I can say
28

29
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.319
/owners.
I can get rid of that.
29

30
00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.099
Get rid of that,
30

31
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.239
as well as that, and that should do it so
now, anything goes to owners. I'm not
31

32
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.650
sure. Let's see it. I'm not entirely sure
if we can go there without just a slash.
32

33
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.299
Let's go ahead and test that. See how
Spring reacts to that one, so I'm going to
33

34
00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.170
start up Spring. Just to clarify what
I did there is I'm prefixing at the
34

35
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.060
class level. If I do a RequestMapping
annotation at the class level, this
35

36
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.519
is going to be prefixed to everything, so
now this value at the first value become
36

37
00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.129
owner/ that become owners/index and that be owners /index.html.
37

38
00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:56.750
You can see here in the log output, I'm
outputting owners/index and so on.
38

39
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.160
Let's go ahead and test that. Come
over to Chrome
39

40
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.630
and let's come over to owners.
40

41
00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.209
We can see that we are not getting that
so double-check owners and so we do need
41

42
00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.090
to have that empty string.
So now let's go ahead and bounce that.
42

43
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.840
This would
pick up the fresh mapping.
43

44
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.880
That is back up. Let's go ahead and do this. So now we have List of 
44

45
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.210
Owners. It came in here with a /.
45

46
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.889
That still works by doing index.
If I actually spell
46

47
00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.280
index right.
47

48
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.980
So now I have List of Owners and of course if I did
html that would work as well. Let's
48

49
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.820
go ahead and close this.
I'm going to come up here. Right click
49

50
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.610
Commit Directory. I can't remember my
issue number. That was a number. Oh yeah.
50

51
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.149
Lucky number 13.
51

52
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.330
Add 13 like so. I'll go ahead and
Push that.
52

53
00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:31.940
That is pushing and we could see that is now closed on GitHub.
