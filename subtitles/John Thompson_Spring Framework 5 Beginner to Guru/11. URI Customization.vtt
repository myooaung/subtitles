00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.720
This video going to show you how to customize the your eye properties.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:13.210
So this is part of the configuration for spring rust stocks and in our generated snippets let's go take

3
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.660
a quick look at what we are building so let's take a look at the curl request and you can see here this

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.650
is generating a sheet DP local host 80 80 and let's say I have a use case where I have a development

5
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.510
server and I want these commands to go against that development server.

6
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.240
I'm going to show you how to set that up right now.

7
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.900
And if I come over here and take a look at the auto configure rust docks the sanitation actually has

8
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.080
so properties that we can set so we can change the output or I'm going to leave that for the default

9
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.810
right now but the yard scheme host import we can change that we can update that.

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.280
So let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:52.330 --> 00:01:00.890
So I'm going to come in here and set the so the yeara scheme so the default goes to EDP.

12
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.800
So I want to do change that age to us then the host start a local host.

13
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:18.200
Let's say I'm hosting this at my site and I do a so domain dubbed spring framework that guru.

14
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.280
So let's say that I'm having the API at development subdomain on my site and now I can say port your

15
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.520
iReport.

16
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.750
We can set that to 80 like so now let's go ahead and do a clean on those.

17
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410
Now we can do a package

18
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.620
and then the package will go ahead and regenerate the docks.

19
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.730
And once this completes we'll go in and take a quick look and verify that these are updated properly.

20
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.500
So it should be building pretty quick here.

21
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.400
Let's go into the target directory again.

22
00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.990
And these are going to be under generated snippets you want beer and I'll just take a look at the curl

23
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.680
request again and now we can see that it is a sheet DP us and then dove spring framework and that guru

24
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.710
and the Cohen is the port and then there's the you are all for the API.

25
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:23.150
So this does set things up customized for us so we can see that this is should be carried out throughout

26
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.840
the documentation so you can see that this is doing a get.

27
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.660
Then there's the host.

28
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.110
So you can't see if that's going to be HDB s it doesn't seem to be showing here is as far as HDP.

29
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.000
But the GDP pie.

30
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.180
I think it's out said this is a different flavor of kernel if I remember correctly.

31
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.880
So you see that this does get carried throughout the documentation.

32
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.390
So again just to recap if you need to customize your hostname on the documentation that you're producing

33
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.220
this auto configure rest docs will take in the YA scheme the host and port and you can also customize

34
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.930
this output directory and I don't see a need to change that from the default at this point but this

35
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.390
is pretty common to set to adjust the hostname that you documentation is going to be referencing.
