(quiet music)
1

2
00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:06.396
Allright, when we converted the application
2

3
00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:08.286
to use WebFlux, we had to take out
3

4
00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:12.130
some of the stuff that was specific to the Servlet API.
4

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.282
So if you remember, if we come in and do a View here,
5

6
00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.082
and now if I come in, and I'm just gonna modify this Id
6

7
00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.890
so I know that's not gonna get found,
7

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.737
we're gonna get a 500 error.
8

9
00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:25.805
And that is kind of expected because we are
9

10
00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:28.529
not handling the error at all anymore,
10

11
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.964
so really what's happening is that,
11

12
00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.908
it's not getting found and that Mono is getting passed
12

13
00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:36.059
with a empty interior to it,
13

14
00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.500
and the reason we changed this,
14

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.368
we need to actually go in
15

16
00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:43.705
and refactor the controller because we had this
16

17
00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:45.242
ExceptionHandler in here,
17

18
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:47.239
and that was working,
18

19
00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.956
when we were using the Servlet view
19

20
00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:52.493
and this works out okay.
20

21
00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:55.326
And that exception works out okay.
21

22
00:00:57.694 --> 00:00:59.748
But it's this Model and View,
22

23
00:00:59.748 --> 00:01:03.778
that no longer exists because that is Servlet specific.
23

24
00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:06.224
What we can do is refactor this @ExceptionHandler
24

25
00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:09.184
to return back a view name
25

26
00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:11.851
and we are gonna say a String
26

27
00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:16.471
and now we can also say, return back,
27

28
00:01:17.955 --> 00:01:21.145
so that's the view name we were returning back
28

29
00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:25.213
and, obviously, we can't add in the view name here,
29

30
00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:27.715
anymore or the modelAndView,
30

31
00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:31.856
but what we can do is pass in the Model.
31

32
00:01:31.856 --> 00:01:33.162
So the Model is available,
32

33
00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:36.662
it's just the Model View that is specific.
33

34
00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.680
And we can just change this to,
34

35
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.964
add the attribute to it.
35

36
00:01:43.964 --> 00:01:45.530
Pretty simple refactoring here
36

37
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.940
but it's still important.
37

38
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.870
So now we're gonna have this
38

39
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.925
and then the other thing is that
39

40
00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:53.856
if we wanted to do the NotFoundException,
40

41
00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:55.364
that's our own custom exception,
41

42
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:57.879
we'd have to execute that Mono
42

43
00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.891
and get a subscription to it
43

44
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:01.806
but we actually want the template doing that
44

45
00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:04.334
and right now, we could have our handling
45

46
00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.337
into the reactive type
46

47
00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:08.659
but we're gonna do it right here.
47

48
00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.297
I'm gonna scroll up here to the top.
48

49
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:12.944
And we are getting a TemplateInputException.
49

50
00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:16.595
And that's because we're getting a null object
50

51
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:18.168
being sent to the template
51

52
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:19.509
and he's blowing up,
52

53
00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.202
so I'm just gonna overload this
53

54
00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:26.369
and add in that class to the method signature here.
54

55
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:31.981
So now this @ExceptionHandler
55

56
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:33.446
is gonna work for that NotFoundException,
56

57
00:02:33.446 --> 00:02:34.985
should we use that
57

58
00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:37.110
and also the TemplateInputException
58

59
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.869
because we know we're gonna toss that error
59

60
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.908
when the model attribute is null.
60

61
00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:43.728
So Thymeleaf can't get that,
61

62
00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:46.480
so it throws that exception.
62

63
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.230
So let's go ahead and bounce this real quick.
63

64
00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:55.337
We are back up and running with Netty.
64

65
00:02:55.337 --> 00:02:58.688
Let's go back over here and now just refresh that
65

66
00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:00.644
because I know that's not gonna be there.
66

67
00:03:00.644 --> 00:03:02.600
Now we have a nice 404 page again,
67

68
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.576
rather than that ugly 500 error
68

69
00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.497
so we're saying 404 Not Found
69

70
00:03:07.497 --> 00:03:11.150
and actually we got an error message saying here,
70

71
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.109
but we could customize that if we want to,
71

72
00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.068
the main thing I wanted to show you
72

73
00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:17.679
was how to modify that ExceptionHandler again
73

74
00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.602
to have that, to get that up and working once again.
74

75
00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.887
So just to recap,
75

76
00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:26.781
so we're doing the ResponseStatus, that's still available,
76

77
00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:29.006
or using the @ExceptionHandler
77

78
00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.428
but now we have two exception classes that we're trigger out
78

79
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.712
and handle this error.
79

80
00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:36.992
We're just gonna come in, log it
80

81
00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:39.385
and we'll add in that attribute at the exception
81

82
00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:42.199
and toss our 404 page there.
82

83
00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.366
And remember we added in the 404 error page for our use.
