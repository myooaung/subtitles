00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.160
Alright in this video we are going to
take a look at hacking IntelliJ a
1

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.230
little bit. What we need to do is change
a setting inside IntelliJ system
2

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.070
registry. So really kind of a hidden
feature of IntelliJ but it gives you
3

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.910
access to a lot of things that the folks
at JetBrains probably don't want you
4

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.960
messing with. But in this case we are
going to override a compiler setting
5

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
that's going to allow IntelliJ to
dynamically compile files on save and
6

7
00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.200
that's going to trigger the reload
functionality that we're looking for. So
7

8
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.010
personally, I'm a little bit on lazy side
because I found it annoying it being in
8

9
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.440
IntelliJ and having to go in and click
build each time that I wanted to trigger
9

10
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.700
a reload. So I want that to happen
automatically, so as I'm going in working
10

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.899
with the IDE and changing my class files
and whatnot,
11

12
00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.789
I want IntelliJ automatically rebuilding
the project to trigger that dead load. So
12

13
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.650
my changes are immediately reflected on
the running application. So I'm going to
13

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
jump over to IntelliJ now and show you
how to change that property. If you're an
14

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.330
Eclipse user you're all set. Don't worry
about this. But this is just a minor thing
15

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.860
that we have to do for IntelliJ. Alright
I am inside of IntelliJ. We do have the
16

17
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.250
application running. You can see it running here. I'm
going to do a refresh and resize this a
17

18
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.299
little bit so we can see the IntelliJ
output. So now as I have refreshed this we
18

19
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.390
can see that IntelliJ is in fact
refreshing for us and let's go over to
19

20
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.880
IntelliJ now and what we need to do is
access the registry. So what we want to
20

21
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.890
do is if you are on a Windows machine,
you will need to do ctrl+shift+A. If
21

22
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
you're on a Mac and you want to do
command+shift+A. So ctrl+shift+A for
22

23
00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.469
Windows, command+shift+a for OSX. So it's
going to be command+shift+a for me and
23

24
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:07.170
you want to pre type in registry and
then just select that off the menu. So
24

25
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.599
it's going to bring up a number of
different things. So we're going to go
25

26
00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.590
into the registry this is the easiest
way to get there and now
26

27
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.300
what you want to do is find the key
compiler automate allow when app is
27

28
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.400
running. Okay so this is important
overwrite. So I'm going to select mine
28

29
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.319
here and it's going to allow the
automate to start even if the develop
29

30
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.700
application is automatically running. It
gives you a warning there and clearly
30

31
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.269
JetBrains doesn't want us in here,
changing a lot of these properties. So a lot
31

32
00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.870
of interesting stuff in here that we
probably shouldn't be messing with. But
32

33
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.549
in this case it's important because if I
come into the project settings and under
33

34
00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.000
build tools compiler in the Java
compiler, see this, we can build a product automatically.
34

35
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.130
We can select that but
35

36
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.440
because we are running, it's not going to
take effect. So it's not going to rebuild
36

37
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.709
a project because down here we are
running at real time. So now if I
37

38
00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:21.630
make my changes, this triggers a
refresh. That did not. But did do that so
38

39
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.530
what I'm going to do and you probably
have to do this as well,is stop it and
39

40
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.010
restart IntelliJ. I'm going to pause it
while that is restarting and come back
40

41
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.879
live in a minute or two here. Okay I have restarted and you do need to
41

42
00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.870
do one additional thing. It is to come into
settings and that build project
42

43
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.980
automatically, you do need to select that
and have that selected and the property
43

44
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.410
that we overrode, overrides this only
works while running and not debugging. So
44

45
00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:01.069
this will override that. So now we'd say
okay and I come in here and change this,
45

46
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.810
a bunch of fives there. Now I want to
click out of that. We can see that it is
46

47
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:16.760
restarting. If I come over here to the
web application and and do a refresh, you
47

48
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.340
can see that I'm getting all my fives
there. Add and some fours just so we can
48

49
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:30.229
see it and see that it restarts right
away and do a refresh and now we can see
49

50
00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:37.100
that the fours are being refreshed and
let's double check the template. Adding
50

51
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:45.979
that in and my library load wasn't
enabled but now it is. That is not
51

52
00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:56.780
working. So that works. Okay so still
have to build for the template changes
52

53
00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.130
to take place it looks like. So
unfortunately. Alright so that actually
53

54
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.979
is picking up so I was mistaken there. So
I was impatient with the reload. So if I
54

55
00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:18.500
come in here, put 333, toggle over. Sometimes IntelliJ it doesn't save right
55

56
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.530
away for you. Okay I forwarded ahead a
little bit. I ran into some problems with
56

57
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.150
how IntelliJ is behaving with the Thymeleaf templates and finding some
57

58
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.349
inconsistencies there. It might just be
on the newer version of IntelliJ that
58

59
00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.389
I'm running, it might be OS specific, but it's a
little bit flaky because I can come in
59

60
00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:44.510
and sometimes get the change right away. Especially I saved out of it, see that's changing
60

61
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.440
there right away and if I change it
to something else,
61

62
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.250
you know sometimes it doesn't
come through. But you can see it's
62

63
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.630
working there. I saw a couple examples
where it did not work and I had to go in
63

64
00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.100
and do a build project and then every
time I do a build project, it works
64

65
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.760
normally. So pretty good integration. Most of
the time it seems to be working
65

66
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.050
sometimes it's a problem. Not quite sure
what's going on there. These are kind of
66

67
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.300
new tools and IntelliJ
and Eclipse are definitely going to be
67

68
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.120
behaving a little bit different. So just
be aware if that does happen to you, it
68

69
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.850
it might not come through right away. We
can see that it did in that fact but
69

70
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.010
just a second ago it wasn't working for
me. So then it kind of typical these
70

71
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.800
things are going to make you a liar. It
wasn't working, that starts working and
71

72
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.580
you think it's working then it doesn't
doesn't work. But these dev tools, they do
72

73
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.690
speed up your development. Sometimes they
do hiccup on you so just be aware of
73

74
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.900
that.
