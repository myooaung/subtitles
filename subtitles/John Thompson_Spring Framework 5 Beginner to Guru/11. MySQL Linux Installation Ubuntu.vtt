00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.760
Okay! I'm logged into Ubuntu at the
command line here. You can see from
1

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.719
my screen that I'm actually logged in as
root. The commands, I'm going to show you
2

3
00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.570
can either run them as root or a user
that has sudo authority. Depends on how
3

4
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.990
you set up your system and how you want
to be working with it. The commands do
4

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
need to be run as the root user though.
So, as root directly or sudo is going
5

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.740
to work for either one. The first thing
that we want to do is update the
6

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.500
packages on the system. We can do that
with apt get update, and later versions
7

8
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
of Ubuntu, I think you can do it with
just app, apt update. So, I'm going to go
8

9
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.190
ahead and do that. You can see that
it Ubuntu's package manager in Ubuntu
9

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.559
is going to go out and get updates
for all of this. I'm going to go do it
10

11
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.440
clear here, get back to the top of screen,
and now we can do apt get install, so
11

12
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.969
that right here, we're going to do an apt
-get install mysql -server.
12

13
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
Now, if there's a specific version that
we wanted to do, we can include the
13

14
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.030
version information here. I think 5.7 is
the latest release at the time of
14

15
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.500
recording. The latest version is going to
be fine for us, so we'd really don't need
15

16
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.009
to specify that version number unless
you really want a specific version
16

17
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.939
number. So, I'm going to go ahead and hit
enter there. You can see that it's
17

18
00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.979
going out and it's got to say a we're
going to take up another 243 mega disc
18

19
00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.189
space. Like I said, MySQL is pretty
lean. So, I'm going to say yes, and now, the
19

20
00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.200
Ubuntu installer is going to go out and
download these from the internet in a
20

21
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.759
variety of packages. I'm going to pause the
video here while this installation
21

22
00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.540
completes and then pick it back up when
we're done. Okay, so we're now in the
22

23
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.140
setup portion. You can see that at the
bottom of screen, we have configuring
23

24
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.110
MySQL server 5.7. It's not mandatory to set
a root user. Being that this is
24

25
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.640
development, I am going to leave it blank.
If this was an important database that
25

26
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.750
we were not using for development,
subnetworks or for production, definitely
26

27
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.629
bad habit to not set a root user
password. But, for development, that is
27

28
00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.049
fine.
I'm just going to hit enter, and now the
28

29
00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.819
installation process is going to
continue. We are being asked for it
29

30
00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.569
again. So, I'm going to leave it blank, and
now, the installation script is going
30

31
00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.129
through and doing some final config. 
We can see that this is all done. I'm
31

32
00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.000
going to clear the screen again. I'm just
using the command clear. Now, what we can do a
32

33
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.430
service mysql status and we can see that
as coming back as stopped. I can
33

34
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.010
change that to start and we can see that
that is now up. Just hitting the up
34

35
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.700
arrow, I can bring back these commands. So,
I'm going to hit status again. Now, we
35

36
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.530
can see that MySQL is up and running,
It's happy. We get some status
36

37
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
information on that, so you do want that.
If you're not able to connect to MySQL
37

38
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.319
on your Linux installation, go ahead and
make sure that it is up and running.
38

39
00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.720
I'm not sure.  I don't remember for this
installer, we'll have it set it up so
39

40
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.189
that it restarts on system reboots. So, that
may be an additional step here. I'll have
40

41
00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.449
to look into that. I'm not positive about
how the MySQL installation on
41

42
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.560
Ubuntu handles that.
