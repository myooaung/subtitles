00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.730
Alright! We are now getting into some
of the really cool stuff of Spring
1

2
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.150
Framework 5. We are gonna start looking
at Reactive Programming. Now you may not
2

3
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.480
have even heard of Reactive Programming
or may not have any idea what Reactive
3

4
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.350
Programming is. Don't worry. We're gonna
start off talking about just what is
4

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.620
this whole thing called Reactive
Programming and why it's such a big deal
5

6
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.450
and some of the common terminologies and
how it's been implemented. So reactive
6

7
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.710
programming has been around for a little
bit. It's actually some very old concepts
7

8
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.850
but now we're seeing some new modern
programming paradigms come into play
8

9
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.350
that makes it more appealable so you can
do some pretty interesting stuff with it.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.129
The first few videos in this section
are gonna just be informational about
10

11
00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.550
Reactive Programming and then we're
gonna start getting into actually
11

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.449
setting up a Reactive Web Application
using MongoDB.
