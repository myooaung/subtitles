00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.150
OK we've gone back over to the joke application and I'm going to refactor this to use Java configuration
1

2
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.010
and key thing that we can target is the Chuck Norris quotes class.
2

3
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.470
Now that is being brought in by an external jar.
3

4
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.360
And what we can do is declare that as a spring being and refactor this class.
4

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.740
So what we want to do is we'll change this up.
5

6
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.480
And rather than having this constructor do that we are going to do this
6

7
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.690
we just do this.
7

8
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.260
What that all new instructor.
8

9
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.510
So now this is going to be constructor based injected and this time just for clarification I'm going
9

10
00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.550
to leave off the auto weired so because it's a single property and it's constructor we now we have to
10

11
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.620
provide a Chuck Norris quotes being in the context.
11

12
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.100
Now what I like to do is with in my application I'm going to come in and create a folder called config
12

13
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.190
or package
13

14
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.780
and that's where we're going to create a class new Java class.
14

15
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.110
We'll just call him Chuck configuration and we will add that to get so you guys can get that
15

16
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
and we want to add in the sanitation configuration.
16

17
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.430
And because because this is in the same path because we just talked about components scans.
17

18
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.740
So it's in the package structure of the joke application.
18

19
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.760
It's going to get picked up as a spring component.
19

20
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.610
And what we want to add in that property there.
20

21
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.380
So what was eco
21

22
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:23.510
Chuck Norris quotes.
22

23
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.160
OK so we have a single class here are a single method in the class.
23

24
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.590
And all he does is return back a new instance of Chuck Norris quotes.
24

25
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
Now I'm not done yet because that's not going to do the trick because we've declared the configuration
25

26
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.520
but we haven't told spring that we want it as a bean
26

27
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.020
will import that.
27

28
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.910
So now we have a configuration class being to return back Chuck Norris quotes and let's see this in
28

29
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.240
action.
29

30
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.360
I'm going to go ahead and run it now.
30

31
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.240
And we'll verify that our Chuck Norris quotes are still working.
31

32
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.070
So we can see that everything came up and started up normally and let's go over to Crome and see if
32

33
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.550
we still have him up.
33

34
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.660
It was.
34

35
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.280
So we can see the applications up and running again working normally.
35

36
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.130
So just to recap what we've done.
36

37
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.340
So I added a package for config.
37

38
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.770
No Chuck Norris configuration or Chuck configuration and returns back a single bean and we refactor
38

39
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.170
the implementation.
39

40
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.260
We still have the private property but I replace the constructor here.
40

41
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.550
That takes a single parameter of the Chuck Norris object.
41

42
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.080
Or Chuck Norris quotes object.
42

43
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.730
So that gets wired up and our our little application is continuing to function as before.
43

44
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.610
But I actually think it's a little bit cleaner implementation of it.
44

45
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.900
Even though this is a hard class and this is a good situation of where we're using a Java configuration
45

46
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.240
because this class is coming from an external jar and you will use this a lot when you're programming
46

47
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.610
in the Spring Framework when you're dealing with external jar's from an open source project or possibly
47

48
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.650
from another team that you don't control the source code.
48

49
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.030
So you bring in another dependency but you want to utilize that dependency within your application.
