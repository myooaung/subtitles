Alright! In this video, we're going to
talk about your options for installing
1

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.240
MySQL.
2

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.860
The system requirements for MySQL
are really really light. Ideally,
3

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.689
you're going to want to install MySQL on
your local computer. If you have a modern
4

5
00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.600
hardware, it should easily support him.
Modern, I mean. You think the last 10
5

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.619
years is going to handle it. The
operating requirements of MySQL are very
6

7
00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.750
very modest. They recommend a minimum of
256 mega free memory, and to be honest,
7

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.530
if your surfing Facebook in your favorite
browser, that's probably going to use more
8

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.170
memory than MySQL is going to. That
is a minimum amount of memory and it's
9

10
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
just going to be us on the system, so that's
for a single user doing development,
10

11
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.430
you're going to be just fine as far
as your hardware requirements. Obviously,
11

12
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.680
I've talked about servers and scaling it
up. If you have dozens or hundreds or
12

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
thousands of connections into the
database, you're obviously going to need
13

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.460
much more memory. So that's something
that we can tune and we will look at
14

15
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.619
that in a much future lesson so when we
start getting into administration type
15

16
00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070
stuff.
Now, let's talk about
16

17
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.290
installing MySQL natively, so native
installation. That means that MySQL is
17

18
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.000
installed on your operating system.  MySQL
supports native installations for all
18

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.770
major operating systems. Ahead in the
course, I'm going to look at installing
19

20
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.390
MySQL on Windows 10, OS X and Linux.
Each of these are going to have two
20

21
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.290
sections. I created a QuickStart
because I get a lot of different skill
21

22
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.580
levels coming through this course. This
is just text instructions of how to
22

23
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.810
install MySQL. That's just kind of just
the facts so you can get in there,
23

24
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.619
install it, and move on. Then I'm also
going to do a video lecture where I'll go
24

25
00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.770
through the installation
step-by-step so depending on what you
25

26
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.020
need, go ahead and do that. This is
kind of an odd section of the course
26

27
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.650
because go ahead and obviously
if you're running Windows,
27

28
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.640
don't go watch the Linux videos. Go
ahead and skip to the next session of
28

29
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.390
course. The whole purpose of this section
of course is just gets you up and
29

30
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.450
running on MySQL. Then another option
that we can look at is running MySQL
30

31
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.739
inside of a container. This is 
technology that's been around for some
31

32
00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.510
time, but Docker has been on fire the
last few years. Docker is a container
32

33
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.010
technology, very popular Google like runs
billions of containers probably. I
33

34
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.459
personally use Docker containers for my
development so this is my personal
34

35
00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.250
choice.
I even have a course about using Docker
35

36
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.239
for Java developers, very popular course.
I'm not going to be able to get too deep
36

37
00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.110
into the Docker here. If it's something
that you want, please check that out. I do
37

38
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.269
a deep dive on Docker technology in
that course. Docker is pretty easy to
38

39
00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.799
use. Effectively, you're going to use
pre-built image from Docker hub. Through
39

40
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.459
a docker command, you'll be able to pull
down that image and run it locally. It
40

41
00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.540
will behave exactly like it just happens
being a container. It's nice and
41

42
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.890
self-contained that's why I personally
choose it. MySQL is not
42

43
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.970
going to be installed on my local
operating system. It's in a container so
43

44
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.630
it's just a nice way to do development.
Depending on your skill level, you
44

45
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.420
might want to skip this. That's
absolutely fine. That's just my choice.
45

46
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.590
But if you're a little more comfortable,
give Docker a try. I highly recommend it.
