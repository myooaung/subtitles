00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.000
Alright! We're going to start getting into
adding the ability to add and update a
1

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.099
Pet. I'm going to sign this issued to
myself to indicate that I am working on it
2

3
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.119
now. Now there's a couple things I want
to do in this video. Specifically, we're
3

4
00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.050
going to look at using Model attributes.
Let's take a look at the
4

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.050
implementation here. Specifically,
this is a PetController that they've
5

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.059
added. There's adding in a couple
things here. They're using the Model
6

7
00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.780
Attribute annotation. I didn't show this
in the course. I don't think I showed
7

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.710
this in the course. I could be wrong on
that but I don't believe I did. But this
8

9
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.489
is a way to basically, whenever I come in
to this controller, I want to be able to
9

10
00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.110
add in these attributes to the Model so
it automatically adds it in. So it's a
10

11
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.559
special annotation inside of Spring. 
What we want to do here is I'm going to
11

12
00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.480
actually and then we also have an InitBinder. We will talk about the Pet
12

13
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.689
Validator in a future video. So I'm going
to add in these three methods here. Again
13

14
00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.740
I'm going to shamelessly cut and paste from
the Spring stuff here. Let's come over
14

15
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
to IntelliJ. You can see that we
don't have a PetController yet so let's
15

16
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.259
go ahead and create him.
16

17
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:37.170
Say okay and now we're going to add in
these here so bring ModelAttribute in
17

18
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.720
PetType, Owner.
18

19
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.100
Collection is
okay. PathVariable, InitBinder. So now
19

20
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.430
let's come back over here. We need to
finish mapping this over. We'll grab
20

21
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.280
that from the Spring guys. I'm just
creating a stub of the Controller at
21

22
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.840
this point. Primarily in this video, I
want to talk about this Model
22

23
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.080
Attribute. So that's a little 
unique. We have not seen that yet.
23

24
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.650
Did I create a service for pets? Yes, we
do.
24

25
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.120
Our PetService. So here, we want. I'm finally a
little bit different model. So rather
25

26
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.680
than bringing the repository directly, I
do have a service layer which is a very
26

27
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.549
common thing to do.
27

28
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.780
You can see that that is unhappy so
let's go ahead and add the constructor
28

29
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.260
as well.
29

30
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.490
And our models using a Long not an int .
30

31
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.569
Our petService does not have
findPetTypes. Let's take a look at that.
31

32
00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.740
Actually I double checked this.
We want Collection PetType and what
32

33
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.560
we can do here is rather... Don't know if
we're going to need PetService but we
33

34
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.910
do have a PetTypeService.
34

35
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:41.769
We do it we'll findAll their on our PetTypeService 
so let's do this.
35

36
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.670
Let's double check our
implementation of it. The PetType
36

37
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.190
Service.
We do have the findAll so
37

38
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.450
that is going to go through and return
the petTypes.  I don't think
38

39
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.530
I can explain it clearly. What this is
going to do is we're going to get a
39

40
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.380
Collection of PetType to types.
That attribute is probably going to be used
40

41
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.500
by Thymeleaf. Otherwise, I'd rename
it to pet types which make a little more
41

42
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.070
sense to me. But, we'll go ahead and
follow what the Spring guys have done
42

43
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.910
here. You can see that IntelliJ is
highlighting petService because it's
43

44
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.200
not being used. Not yet. We may need it
and an implementation if we don't use it
44

45
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.910
as we implement these various methods.
So I may refactor it up. But our forms
45

46
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.690
that we are working with pets for petTypes, we're going to have a drop down
46

47
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.040
list so we're populating that as a
reference. There's a pretty common use
47

48
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.150
case for model attributes where when we
are working with pets we're going to want
48

49
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.790
petTypes available to our view layer so
that this automatically puts that list
49

50
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.550
out there for us. And then also, the
way this is set up for the mapping, we
50

51
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.680
are going to go in owners ownerId. So
whenever we come in here, we know that we
51

52
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.180
are going to want an Owner object also
available to the view so that is going
52

53
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.830
to also make that available. So again,
just to reiterate, I just wanted to show
53

54
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.800
you the ModelAttribute. Basically,
whenever we hit any controller method,
54

55
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.540
you can see I haven't implemented anything yet.
Whenever we hit any controller method on
55

56
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.840
this, this is going to get populated to that
Model. so these are four common themes.
56

57
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.160
As we're working with controller methods
inside the PetController, we're going to
57

58
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.980
want petTypes all the time and then
we're going to want the Owner object all
58

59
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.200
the time. So, rather than having to repeat
these operations and each controller
59

60
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.260
method, now Spring MVC is going to
provide that to us. So this does not
60

61
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:49.330
complete this GitHub issue but I am
going to commit it under issue number 56.
61

62
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.020
So I come in here and add that.
62

63
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.830
Now if I just do pound 56,
so will reference this
63

64
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.760
issue. And when I do a commit and push,
now this commit will be associated with
64

65
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.700
that GitHub ticket. Now coming up, we are
going to start implementing the options
65

66
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.720
for the PetController as well. So we'll
start getting those mappings cooking so
66

67
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.270
we can maintain pets in our pet store.
