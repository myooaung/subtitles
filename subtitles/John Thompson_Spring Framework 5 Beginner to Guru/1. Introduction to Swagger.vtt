Alright! In this section of the course, we
are going to get into looking at Swagger.
1

2
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.820
So, Swagger is a very powerful tool set.
We've already seen it used in the course.
2

3
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.420
We've been looking at the API
documentation deck generated by Swagger,
3

4
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
and what we're gonna do is show you
how much more powerful Swagger is. We're
4

5
00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.300
gonna start off and take a look at
generating our own API documentation for
5

6
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
the RESTful API that we've been working
with and generate the Swagger
6

7
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
documentation for it. So, we'll add that
to our Spring Boot Application so it
7

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.730
gives a nice RESTful or nice API
documentation. So, it's a very very nice
8

9
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.629
thing to have, when you're documenting an
API. Then, I'm gonna show you how
9

10
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.430
you can customize that and really
enhance the API documentation for your
10

11
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.449
particular needs. So, there's a lot of
extensibility here. A lot of really cool
11

12
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
things that you can do with the Swagger
documentation and it's much larger
12

13
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.020
standard. So, by the end of this section
of the course, you're gonna have a
13

14
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.070
much better understanding about what
Swagger is and its capabilities.
