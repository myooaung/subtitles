00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.830
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and plan out some tasks for our Spring
1

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.809
Pet Clinic project. What we want to
do here is start building up our backlog.
2

3
00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
I could call this an air quotes a Sprint
planning session but we don't really
3

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
have the backlog at this point, so we
can't decide what tasks we want to be
4

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
pulling forward. Right now, there's a
number of things that we do need to do.
5

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.300
Do we need to do. That's good English,
John. What we want to be doing is
6

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.369
building up our work queue. We do have
a project in its infancy. I like the
7

8
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.820
way things are progressing with it. 
The development is tracking along pretty
8

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.360
well, but there's a lot that we need to
add to the project. We need to take a
9

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
step back and start thinking about what
we need to be doing here. Now you can see
10

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
here, on number nine, I had this add web
jars from task out there. We no longer
11

12
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.590
need it, so I'm just going to say
not needed anymore
12

13
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.820
because when we brought all the
resources in from the official pet
13

14
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.110
clinic project, we did bring in the web
jars and bootstrap CSS. We're now
14

15
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.890
using those web resources, so I just
closed this task out.
15

16
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.250
We can see that it is now closed.
Let's come over here and create a new
16

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.219
issue.
We have some additional entities
17

18
00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.479
that we want to do, so we will do Create
Pet Type,
18

19
00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.720
Pet and
19

20
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.640
Visit entities, like so. That's
actually three different entities that
20

21
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.649
we need to add into the project. I'm
trying to make these video length tasks
21

22
00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.490
that we can accomplish. Usually, when I'm
planning out tasks, I try to do something
22

23
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.030
that's going to give me like a day of work
or so. We're getting a little more
23

24
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.429
granular than typical here. Let's see 
here.  I made some notes when I went
24

25
00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:00.209
through it. Though this, I'm working for
from some notes. So create...
25

26
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.100
We're going to start building
associations. We're going to create a
26

27
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.460
Vet Specialty and we'll associate that
to a Vet.
27

28
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.280
We had some contact info properties
28

29
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.890
that are missing from owners, so we'll go
ahead and add those.
29

30
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.580
We want to create a Pet Type.
30

31
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.209
We are going to create a pet type
service and the implementation, just like
31

32
00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.859
we did for the others. We'll go ahead
and add that.
32

33
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.260
We'll create a pet service as well.
33

34
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.189
Remember, those are two
different things. Pet and pet types. We'll
34

35
00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.310
need a specialty service.
35

36
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.450
Now, let's go ahead and add...
36

37
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.050
We want to be populating pet types.
37

38
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:38.810
We want to be adding owners. As we had
the owners with contact info and pets.
38

39
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.690
That's going to increase the complexity
of what we're doing in our bootstrap
39

40
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.930
class.
40

41
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.120
And then, let's go ahead and
41

42
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.310
let's do... Common on GitHub. You can do it.
We want to be creating some specialties.
42

43
00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.930
That's giving us a variety of things
that we want to be doing there. I'm
43

44
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.739
going through. We're adding in the
entities and then we're going to add in
44

45
00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:21.130
data on bootstrap, as well, once we get
the services created. Now we have some
45

46
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.960
mapping things that we want to do.
46

47
00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.979
We're going to go ahead and implement
the base entity, that's going to be a JPA
47

48
00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.499
type. We'll be getting into the JPA
mappings.
48

49
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.600
By converting owners to JPA entities, we
will be enhancing those types with JPA
49

50
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.440
annotations.
50

51
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.220
We want to do the same to vets.
When we convert the vets, the
51

52
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.630
owners will be picking up most of the
entities. Let's see here. I'm not adding
52

53
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.610
in visits yet. I do need to add that in
yet. Let's see here. Create entity.
53

54
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.940
Create Visit Entity.
54

55
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.820
That's going to visit, works with the owners
and vets. I'm sorry, owners and pets. I'm
55

56
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.480
misspoken there.
56

57
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.510
Let's go ahead and add
57

58
00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:51.110
Spring Data JPA Repositories.
We are going to be using Spring Data JPA
58

59
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.399
coming up. This is the most common way
of modern Spring development, so we
59

60
00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.089
definitely want to be utilizing that.
We do use a fair amount of Spring Data
60

61
00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.569
JPA.
So I'm going to go ahead and add that.
61

62
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.910
Now we want to create Spring Data JPA.
62

63
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.030
Create a Spring Data JPA Service for
Owners.
63

64
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.460
A service for vets as well.
64

65
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.629
And all the other services, we need
to add as well. We're going to need a
65

66
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.070
Pet Type Service.
66

67
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:51.760
We'll also need one
for just Pets.
67

68
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.090
I don't think I said
68

69
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.190
specialty yet.
Pets
69

70
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.020
pet type. Yeah so
we'll do that.
70

71
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.770
Let's go ahead and review this now. We're
up to 21 issues. You can see we have
71

72
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.940
quite a list here. We have a couple other
ones down at the bottom, so the equal
72

73
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.260
methods, we're going to hold off on that
till we implement project Lombok. Upgrade
73

74
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.790
to JUnit 5 and a couple sections from
the course. From now in the course, we're
74

75
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.590
going to be getting into testing. I'm
going to, I think most of course I did
75

76
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.820
JUnit 4 and we didn't really touch on
JUnit 5. But in the pet clinic, I'm going
76

77
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.110
to upgrade that to use JUnit 5, so the
guys can see the contrast between four
77

78
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.700
and five. I think that's going to be really
valuable for you guys. Right now, this
78

79
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.840
is getting a lot of the functionality in
here. You can see all the stuff that
79

80
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:04.030
we have to do as far as all the backend
stuff. We're implementing data entities
80

81
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.740
and now we're going to implement the map
based services. We'll continue having
81

82
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.230
the maps and we're starting to plan out
tasks we're bringing on JPA and so we'll
82

83
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.040
be using h2 and Hibernate. We'll be
bringing that ends of course. But you can
83

84
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.880
see, we've got quite a bit of legwork. We
have things that we have to do first.
84

85
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:27.820
This gives us a nice work queue to
complete. We got a lot tasks here and
85

86
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.940
we'll be tackling these one by one
coming up in the course.
