Alright, in this video I have an
assignment for you. In this assignment we
1

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.929
are going to create a Recipe Project. We're going to be working with this going
2

3
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.400
forward in the course for a while. Just
one of several projects that we're going
3

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.359
to be creating. And what I want you to do
is use the Spring Initializr like we
4

5
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
did before and we're going to create a
new Spring Boot project and we want to
5

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.570
use Spring Boot v2 or higher. So
we get the Spring Framework 5 in there.
6

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.460
The Spring Boot v1 series is Spring framework 4. So we definitely
7

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.350
want to be running on Spring framework 5
and then as we go through the options on
8

9
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.840
that, we want to add in "DevTools" and
that's under the core category. We'll
9

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
head in Web. That's under Web and that's
what's going to be bringing in tomcat
10

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.379
for us and Spring MVC and all that
goodness. And then we are going to be
11

12
00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.270
continuing to use the Thymeleaf template
engine. So under template engines, add in
12

13
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.350
the option for Thymeleaf and then under SQL
we'll be using JPA, of course which gives
13

14
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.960
us hibernate and Spring data and also
we'll be using the H2 in-memory database
14

15
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.189
for our needs in creating this project. So go ahead and create that project. If
15

16
00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.659
you're unsure what to do, don't worry. I'm
going to have an assignment review in the next
16

17
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.070
video and we'll go through all this
step-by-step and we'll get you up to
17

18
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.220
speed.
