00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.870
Alright! What we wanna do with CircleCI also, it's really handy. So we're
1

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.929
gonna go in and add in a build badge. So
I'll assign this to myself number 64.
2

3
00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.250
What I wanna do is set up a CircleCI
Build Badge. It's like really really easy
3

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.269
to do but when you're looking at GitHub
stuff it is kind of handy to have it
4

5
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.910
also to show the status batch. So you can
see here, we just fixed the build again
5

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.910
so that is now up and running. And now I
can come here and come over here to
6

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.200
Status Badges. There's a couple
different ones there. I am using markdown.
7

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.300
So I'm gonna go ahead and copy that.
It's gonna give us this little PASSED
8

9
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.510
or FAILURE. Let's make sure. I'm gonna
say master explicitly. Make sure that should be okay with all
9

10
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.840
that. So hopefully I'm gonna just leave
it on default in the Markdown. Let's
10

11
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.370
come back over to IntelliJ and now what
I wanna do is edit the README file.
11

12
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.610
You can see that IntelliJ is
12

13
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.630
giving me a little preview there. I'm
just gonna come in here and paste this.
13

14
00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.520
So you can see the preview here so I'm
gonna get the Spring Framework Guru Pet
14

15
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.289
Clinic and then I have this build badge
here. That's what's gonna show up
15

16
00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.439
in GitHub. So I am gonna go ahead and
commit this. Actually remember the
16

17
00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.600
last time I made a mistake there so this
was
17

18
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.130
issue number 64. I'm gonna show you how
to overcome my mistake here from the
18

19
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.490
last one. So I'm gonna go ahead and do a
commit. Note that I'm not
19

20
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.909
closing it. I'm just doing a reference
every pound 64 for the issue number. I'm
20

21
00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.800
gonna commit and push. In this case,
the reason I'm doing this is I wanna
21

22
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.110
make sure that this actually is working
as expected. I'd don't have to tweak it. So
22

23
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.030
come back over here to pet clinic. Now
you can see that this is displaying up
23

24
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.310
nicely. I'm kind of happy with that.
Actually, in hindsight, let's move that up
24

25
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.160
above that. So rather than have it there,
let's just do
25

26
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.060
this
26

27
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.730
like so. We'll get that up at the top
so let's just do that. Let's see how that
27

28
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.030
works.
28

29
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:57.000
I'll go ahead and commit and push that.
And almost there. There we're up. Now let's go
29

30
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.250
ahead and refresh that see how that
looks.
30

31
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
I like that a little bit better so
our badges at the top and then our title
31

32
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.460
so I think that looks a little bit
better. And now, I'm gonna come back to
32

33
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:20.230
issues. I do the CircleCI Badge. What we
can see here is that I have two commits
33

34
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.870
there and also notice that I'm getting a
green checkmark there so that's saying
34

35
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.920
that passed. This one's actually still
running so CircleCI is running.
35

36
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.080
I got really nice integration with GitHub
and technically I shouldn't close this
36

37
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.630
until it is done. Let's take a look at
see if that job is done.
37

38
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.180
So he is happy and you can see it just
happened to change out whilst it's off the
38

39
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.500
screen. So nice feature there. You can
see that your integration tests are
39

40
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.000
running and now I could say okay 
this is done. So I go and say done and
40

41
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.910
Close and comment, and that issue is done.
So again, now that we have continuous
41

42
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.180
integrations running because I did a
reference to the issue, we can see that I
42

43
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.550
have this issue here. I had two commits
against it. I can see that I had two
43

44
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.630
different builds that passed inside a
CircleCI. I've had one that failed
44

45
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.190
and then I corrected it. It would be
listed here. This is really nice showing
45

46
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.940
you how an issue tracker can be
integrated with source control and also
46

47
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.590
on top of that I see information about
your continuous integration build. So a
47

48
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.800
lot of information here when you're
doing a very large project, a lot of
48

49
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.370
people on it, a lot of moving bits and
pieces, you can get quite a bit of
49

50
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.410
history here. So a lot of stuff, a lot of
value of having your project set up like
50

51
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.620
this.
