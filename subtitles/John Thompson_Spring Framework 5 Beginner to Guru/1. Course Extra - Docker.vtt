00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.290
Alright. The next three sections of
this course are right out of my Docker
1

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
for Java developers course. I'm adding
this to into the Spring course because
2

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.969
there's a lot more interesting things
that I wanna be doing, and I feel that
3

4
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
you might be able to leverage Docker for
this. So we're gonna get into working
4

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.830
with things like MySQL, Mongo,
specifically, Mongo because we want
5

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.099
to do that fun reactive stuff.
Unfortunately, we can't do that with a
6

7
00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.949
relational databases because, at the time I'm recording this, the JDBC
7

8
00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.579
specification doesn't support reactive
program. So it's not there yet.
8

9
00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.940
But, Mongo does have a Reactive driver, so
we're gonna have a lot of fun with that.
9

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
As I was developing this, it's like, I
know you guys are gonna have to run
10

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.610
MySQL, Mongo, and Docker is the ideal tool for that.
11

12
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
Docker isn't just a technology for
deploying your applications into
12

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
production, and some that you can use, as a developer, to easily bring up a MySQL
13

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.579
database or a Mongo database. So, the next three sections of this course are kind
14

15
00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.129
of like a little added bonus because I
know I'm a big fan of Docker technology.
15

16
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.619
Because of all the different
technologies we have to work with. So if
16

17
00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.820
we get into doing something like
Cassandra, or need a RabbitMQ database, or
17

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
message broker, not a database. That
RabbitMQ is a message broker. Further
18

19
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
down the road, we are gonna get
into working with RabbitMQ. Docker
19

20
00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.780
is a fantastic technology for that.
This isn't mandatory. Docker works
20

21
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.530
great on Linux, OS X, Windows 10, I think
it's Windows 10 Professional. Previous
21

22
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.000
versions of Windows are a little flaky.
You do have to run Oracle VirtualBox to
22

23
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.130
get Docker up and running because it
runs inside a Linux container. So, kind of
23

24
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.570
optional for that. So going forward, you
don't need to use Docker inside of this
24

25
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
course for everything.
I, personally, I'm a fan of Docker. I'm
25

26
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.710
running on OS X, so it makes it crazy easy
to spool up a Postgres database or MySQL
26

27
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.990
database or a RabbitMQ message broker so just makes that stuff super easy.
27

28
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.380
That's why I'm including it in this
course. As we get into these other
28

29
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.459
technologies, where you need some type of client like that, you will have the
29

30
00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.450
option of using Docker or you can install it for your native
30

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.900
platform. So whether you're running on
Windows, I hope you're not one in a
31

32
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.780
Windows, I'm not a big fan, but if you're
running on Windows, OS X or Linux, most of
32

33
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.960
the technologies we're gonna be
getting into, are supported on those
33

34
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.960
different platforms. Worst case, you can
use VirtualBox from Oracle. That's
34

35
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.670
completely free, so is Docker to run
these different technologies. But in this,
35

36
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.670
I hope you enjoy the next three sections
and get a lot of benefit out of it
36

37
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.440
because I am a huge fan of Docker. I use
it for development all the time, and the
37

38
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.860
next three courses are gonna take you or
the next three sections of the course,
38

39
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.190
I'm gonna take you through what is
docker, all the way to the point where
39

40
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.940
you can take a Spring Boot application,
and deploy that in a Docker container.
40

41
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.470
You'll get to see a lot of different
technologies along the way in the core
41

42
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.450
so I think it's gonna give you a good
foundation with Docker and a lot of fun
42

43
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720
to do.
