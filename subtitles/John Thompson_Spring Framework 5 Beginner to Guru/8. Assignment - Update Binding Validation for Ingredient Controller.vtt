2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:05.924
All right, in this video,
2

3
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:07.682
we have a little assignment for you,
3

4
00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:09.053
give you a little bit of a challenge.
4

5
00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:11.259
And what I want you to do is go in
5

6
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.794
and Add Data Validation to our Ingredients object.
6

7
00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:16.935
So we have that Ingredient Command Object,
7

8
00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:18.660
and we wwanna to add validation to it.
8

9
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.848
So let's take that command object
9

10
00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:23.699
and we'll make the description not blank,
10

11
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.014
and for the amount, we want it to be a min of 1
11

12
00:00:27.014 --> 00:00:29.138
and also Not Null, so you can't.
12

13
00:00:29.138 --> 00:00:31.266
You need to pass a null, or if you do pass a value,
13

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.949
it's got to be a minimum of one.
14

15
00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.370
And we could add an upper bound there.
15

16
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.522
If you're an overachiever, go ahead and do that,
16

17
00:00:37.522 --> 00:00:40.716
but for now I'm just gonna say, no max on it.
17

18
00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:41.863
I'm not too worried about that.
18

19
00:00:41.863 --> 00:00:43.368
And then Unit of Measure, we wanna make sure
19

20
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:44.977
that is Not Null.
20

21
00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.817
And then, just like in the last video
21

22
00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.529
where we looked at data binding,
22

23
00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:50.335
we wanna to update the Index Controller
23

24
00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:52.268
for Data Binding.
24

25
00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:53.632
So we're gonna have to apply that little
25

26
00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:56.556
work around there that I showed you in the last video.
26

27
00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.334
And then, of course, we wanna update the form.
27

28
00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:01.596
So I did show you how to display the errors
28

29
00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.646
some time ago, but that is happening
29

30
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.791
on the recipe form, and we wanna carry that forward
30

31
00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:08.667
over to the ingredient form.
31

32
00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.934
So little bit of a challenge for you to pull things back
32

33
00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:13.416
from a while back in the course.
33

34
00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.604
If you are a little concerned about that,
34

35
00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:16.480
don't worry.
35

36
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.582
As usual, I am going to go through this
36

37
00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:20.699
step by step in the next video,
37

38
00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:23.051
and we will get validation cooking
38

39
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:25.801
on our Ingredient Command object.
