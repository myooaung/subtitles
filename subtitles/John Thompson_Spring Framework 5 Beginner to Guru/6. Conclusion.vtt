00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:07.109
All right, this concludes the section of the course
1

2
00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.874
introducing you to reactive programming.
2

3
00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:11.771
Now, I'm sorry, I hope this wasn't too boring.
3

4
00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.690
We didn't have a lot of hands on coding to sample,
4

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.250
but really, we need to transfer a lot of information
5

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.551
about reactive programming and just try to lay down
6

7
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.621
a foundation of the concepts and stuff
7

8
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.011
that we have to deal with going forward,
8

9
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.917
so it takes a lot of getting around, your head around it.
9

10
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.400
It is definitely a different programming paradigm.
10

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.244
It's gonna feel pretty clunky at first
11

12
00:00:30.244 --> 00:00:32.320
when you're working with it, but remember,
12

13
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.505
reactive is all about dealing with streams of data.
13

14
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.417
So streams are gonna be coming through these libraries,
14

15
00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:41.714
so it's really quite a different programming paradigm
15

16
00:00:41.714 --> 00:00:44.429
because you're dealing with basically a future object
16

17
00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.336
that you're passing, passing, passing, passing,
17

18
00:00:46.336 --> 00:00:48.772
and then something is gonna ask for that data,
18

19
00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:51.201
and then it's gonna trigger all that logic
19

20
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:52.898
into your code all at once,
20

21
00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:56.731
so it does take some getting used to for sure,
21

22
00:00:57.622 --> 00:00:59.988
but coming up, we're gonna be looking
22

23
00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.684
at some more concrete examples
23

24
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:03.481
and we'll be stepping through it slowly
24

25
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.563
and getting you more and more acclimated
25

26
00:01:05.563 --> 00:01:09.730
to reactive programming with the Spring Framework.
