00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.919
Alright! In the previous video, you saw
that we were missing the
1

2
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
internationalization properties. So I'm
going to go ahead and sign this to myself
2

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.960
to say hey, I'm working on it,
even though I'm a team of one. I'm just
3

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.650
going through good work habits here. 
You can say I label this as a bug
4

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.910
because we saw that occurring here where
we're getting all these question marks.
5

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.920
We haven't covered this in the course yet,
but we will be. This is part of
6

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.790
internationalization, where Spring MVC is
looking for a properties placeholder and
7

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.300
it's not finding it. That's why we're
getting the question marks here. What
8

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
we need to do is I'm going to come back
over here. This is a copy of the
9

10
00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.960
Spring Pet Clinic that we brought down.
We can see under resources, we have
10

11
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.239
this messages folder. And these are
properties files with all the messages I
11

12
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.020
have. So I'm going to just go ahead and
copy this. Again, this is going to go
12

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.800
under source main resources. Let's come
back over to IntelliJ. We will go to
13

14
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.720
source main resources. We are going
to go ahead and paste this in. Now we can see this
14

15
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.600
as a resource manager bundle and see how
we have to welcome property, so that
15

16
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.950
is there now.
We can see that this is empty. Let's
16

17
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.420
see what else we have here. We do
have a German version. The way it
17

18
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.180
looks like they set this up. We do
have some German properties.
18

19
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.680
No English properties. We could implement
other ones. Actually, if you guys want to
19

20
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.320
submit a contribution to this, I'll 
bring in other properties because I only
20

21
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.670
speak English. Sorry. I know there's a lot
of different dialects out there. If you
21

22
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.030
speak a different language and want to
submit something, please do so, that'd be
22

23
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.510
awesome to give you more message properties
files going in here. I'll add those to
23

24
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.770
the project, so as you're watching GitHub,
if you see more than just German and
24

25
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.090
English in there, that's contributions from
other students taking this course. But
25

26
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.360
the way this is going work, its going to
look at the language settings on your
26

27
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.429
browser and try to make a match to it.
 We will be covering this
27

28
00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.530
coming up in the course. But you can see
here, it's saying English US. If I had
28

29
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.600
a file EN and underscore US, that
would override it, so it's going to go to
29

30
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.880
the most common one. And here, messages.properties is like the overall
30

31
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.190
bottom of the line. If I define
something in English or English US, those
31

32
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.459
would override this property. So pretty
slick way of  how the
32

33
00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.380
internationalization works. I am going to
go ahead and restart Spring Boot at this point.
33

34
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.950
Just make sure that gets picked up. I do
have to have dev tools running. Just from
34

35
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.610
experience, when you add in resources
like this, sometimes things go wrong. It
35

36
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.659
doesn't quite work right, so that's why I
went ahead and bounced it. You can see
36

37
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.650
that we're loading our owners and vets.
Now let's come back over here.
37

38
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.770
We should have a much different
result
38

39
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.320
and we do not. I think what happens is, this is not building properly.
39

40
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.860
I'm guessing right now. I'm going to
come in and stop this. Let's go in here.
40

41
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.240
Like I said, the resources can be a
little strange. I'm going to go come into
41

42
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.200
the root and do a clean, and then a
package. This will make sure that we
42

43
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.490
are getting these resource properties
brought up, so we're going through the
43

44
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.880
whole build process now, and then once
that is done, I will go ahead and start
44

45
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.720
the Spring Boot again.
45

46
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.390
Okay, so the build completed. So now, I'm
going to go ahead and run this. You can see
46

47
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.250
if that does in fact change for us.
47

48
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.110
Again, this is from experience,
sometimes those things do not load
48

49
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.920
properly. Let's go ahead and refresh
this again.
49

50
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.400
That is still a problem, so I'm going to
pause this for a second and investigate
50

51
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.640
it further.
51

52
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.490
Okay, coming back to this. I looked around a
little bit. And what happened was they
52

53
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.510
overrode. The Spring guys overrode the
messages property, so they're in messages
53

54
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.360
messages. Let's take a quick look at
where we are actually at. We're under
54

55
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.640
resources' messages and then there's a
bundle called messages. What we need
55

56
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.670
to do is come in here and I copied it over
already and restarted and tested it, so
56

57
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.040
this is overriding it. I want to say
I think it's just messages as a default
57

58
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.570
value. I could be very wrong on that. I'm
going by memory on this, but this
58

59
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.550
property here overrides the
internationalizations folder name. So
59

60
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.570
here, we are specifically saying the
messages messages. There's resource bundle
60

61
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.370
here. The way IntelliJ is showing
this, is showing it as a resource bundle
61

62
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.590
but on the disk disk or guess we don't
have physical disk anymore but on the
62

63
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.420
drive, physically, the file is there's
three different files there, so
63

64
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.710
IntelliJ is showing you into a single. Kind of like a
single entity. In this, what I
64

65
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.720
highlighted in blue, that is an IntelliJ thing.
But we can see the different message
65

66
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.450
bundle there. This is telling Spring
where to look for it, so that this is the
66

67
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.320
location of it. So now, if I go ahead and
restart it.
67

68
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.350
Let's see that we are bouncing Spring
right now. It's going to come back up in
68

69
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.470
just a second, and this time, what's
what's going to happen is we are looking
69

70
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.520
for this welcome.
The index.html, this welcome property.
70

71
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.170
You can see that the little squiggly
line went away, so now, we can resolve it.
71

72
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.360
If I come back over here
72

73
00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.800
and I'll go ahead and see how we got the
question marks. I do a restart there. We
73

74
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:32.189
can see now that we are properly
resolving that. So this is number 25.
74

75
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:37.560
We'll go ahead and close out that
because we're now properly resolving those
75

76
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.100
properties.
76

77
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.210
fixed i8. Again, that's an abbreviation for
internationalization.
77

78
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.270
Closes
78

79
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.870
number 25. Lucky 25.
Go ahead and close
79

80
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.250
that. We will tackle something else
in the next video.
