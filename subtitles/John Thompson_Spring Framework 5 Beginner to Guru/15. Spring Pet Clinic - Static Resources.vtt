00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.620
Alright! In this video, what we are
going to be doing is bringing in these
1

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.900
static resources from the official
Spring Pet Clinic application. So I'm
2

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.039
just going to go ahead and sign this to
myself for right now. So what we want to
3

4
00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.029
do is bring in the images, JavaScript
and whatnot. All the static resources
4

5
00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.170
that we're going to be using. Over
here, this is the pet clinic reference
5

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.189
application that we've been using. 
One thing that we can do, I think I've
6

7
00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
actually cloned to somewhere, but we can
also do a clone or download. And you can
7

8
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.309
do a download zip file which is what I
did a few minutes ago. I'd really
8

9
00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
just want to be grabbing stuff out of
here. And let me toggle over to the finder.
9

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.930
Here's the downloaded file. I
explored it out, installed CSS in
10

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.000
my downloads directory, which is really
right now a great dumpling land of
11

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
a lot of different stuff that I've
downloaded. I need to clean that up. But
12

13
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.290
here, this is a standard Spring structure.
We can see we have source main Java. We
13

14
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.299
got some less stuff going on here. We may
get into that in the future, but for
14

15
00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.640
right now, what I'm going to be doing is
keeping the front end of this very much
15

16
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.729
in line with the pet clinic example. 
One thing that Spring Boot does is it
16

17
00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.950
defines a static folder. This is
standard to Spring Boot. All your static
17

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.130
resources are going to go within that
folder. In this, what we have is a
18

19
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.220
static resources. These are going to
be served. Spring Boot will configure the
19

20
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.549
application server. In this case, 
typically Tomcat to serve static
20

21
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.060
resources from these locations, so that
is all handled by Spring Boot Auto
21

22
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.290
Config. We don't have to do anything
there. We get it for free. What we want
22

23
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.840
to do is start copying the stuff over to
our application. I'm just going to say
23

24
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.610
copy the fonts over.
I want to see what we have here. I'm just
24

25
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.340
going to say copy fonts. Now I kind of come
back over here to our project.
25

26
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.340
Actually, I like to close out this
stuff. I'm just going to say close all.
26

27
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.620
We don't need to be working with that. 
What we do need here is we can see here
27

28
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.170
that we do have the static folder. And If
you're following along with the GitHub
28

29
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.870
commits, one thing that Git does not do
is that does not publish empty folders.
29

30
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
There is an option to do this but it's
by default behavior does not publish the
30

31
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.690
empty directories or folders, which every
terminology prefer. In GitHub static
31

32
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.790
probably is not there. But coming over
here, what I want to do is create a
32

33
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.350
resources and then paste the fonts into
it, so I come in here. I'm going to create
33

34
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.540
a new directory. That was going to be
called resources, static resources
34

35
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.650
like so.
35

36
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.870
Now I want to go ahead 
and paste that item in.
36

37
00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.640
You can see that saying fonts.
I'm going to say ok. Now it's asked me to
37

38
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.550
add these to Git. I'm
just going to say remember don't ask me
38

39
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.459
again. So we are always going to be doing
that. Now you can see these have been
39

40
00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.569
added. One thing that's tricky about
IntelliJ, this is an option to show you a
40

41
00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.599
little thing inside of IntelliJ. Right
now, I have this set up to flatten Compact
41

42
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.049
Middle Packages. Let's go ahead and
expand that out. So now, rather than
42

43
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.030
because everything is all on one line,
now I can go to the resources. If I
43

44
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.490
come back over here to finder and now
I'm going to copy the images. Copy images.
44

45
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.080
Toggle back over and now I'm going to click on
resources right click and say paste that.
45

46
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.220
It ask me to do
images. You can see that the image is
46

47
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.940
there so I have all the images. I
have been, now brought over. Let's
47

48
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.930
compare this side-by-side.
48

49
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.890
Go so you can see the fonts are listed. As well as
49

50
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.169
all the images so these are images that are going to be
used in the web application that were
50

51
00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.850
developed by the guys behind Spring 
for the Spring Pet Clinic. I'm gonna
51

52
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.479
go ahead and use in their web
application. Kind of what I want to
52

53
00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.650
do is show you as we progress through
this web application. The look and
53

54
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.690
feel of the user interface is going to
be pretty similar or hopefully very
54

55
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.060
similar to what they do. But the
underlying implementation I am going to
55

56
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.470
take some liberties there and apply my
own style, my own preferences, as we
56

57
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.090
progressed there. Just kind of setting
things up a step by step. But here,
57

58
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.289
we'll go ahead and use the same 
fonts and images that they'll be using.
58

59
00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:04.570
If I come back over to Chrome, you can
see this was number 17. I'm going to
59

60
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.660
go ahead and commit this.
Just come up here Git commit directory.
60

61
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.740
Closes number 17 like so. Do a commit
and push.
61

62
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.010
Toggle back over. You should see that
close. There it goes. So that issue is now
62

63
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.550
closed. And we will tackle another one in
the next video.
