00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.010
In this video, what we're gonna do is
configure Spring Boot to connect to that
1

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.839
local broker. So, let me toggle over to the
command line real quick. And here this, to
2

3
00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.640
continue with this video, you wanna
make sure that you do in fact have
3

4
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.060
ActiveMQ running locally on your
machine. So, you can see here that I do
4

5
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.920
have a Docker container up and running
and that we are listening on 8161 which
5

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.980
is the web console and then 61613
6

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.239
that is the port that will be sending
messages over. So, this is up and ready to
7

8
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.739
go. All we need to do is configure our
Spring Boot project to support this. So,
8

9
00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.649
let's come back over to IntelliJ. And the
first thing I wanna do here is I'm
9

10
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.520
going to comment this out. So, we will get
rid of that server definition and
10

11
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.500
actually, in developing this video,
this configuration actually isn't
11

12
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.460
necessary because if you do have the
server on your class path, Spring Boot is
12

13
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.500
going to automatically bring up a
configuration for us. So, I showed you how
13

14
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.420
to set it up explicitly. But when you
have these two dependencies here for the
14

15
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.250
server Spring Boot like everything else
is going to auto-configure it. So, we are
15

16
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.770
gonna comment those out so that we
don't have that. And so we do not have a
16

17
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.799
server. And now if I start this
application up, I expect I'll get
17

18
00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.799
an error because we are gonna try
connect to ActiveMQ without a user ID.
18

19
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.520
And you can see here "Unable to validate
user". Exactly as I thought. So, I am going
19

20
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.820
to steal this from off-screen and if I
come over here to application.properties,
20

21
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.740
I'm gonna paste these values in. So,
remember I showed you the home page for
21

22
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
that Docker image. And on that page, they
have the default user ID and password.
22

23
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.130
Now if you want, you can override that.
Directions that are on that page. I'm
23

24
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.170
just gonna be using the two defaults
here. And actually, I'm gonna I'm on
24

25
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830
the screen I'm gonna copy that that
value to the clipboard. So, that is a
25

26
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.160
password value on my clipboard now. Now,
when I start up,
26

27
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.270
we now have the proper credentials. And
you can see here that it is going
27

28
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.480
through and we're getting the output now.
So, this is now talking to ActiveMQ
28

29
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.110
running inside the Docker container
which is exactly what we want. And if I
29

30
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.599
come over to Chrome.
This is why I copied the password.
30

31
00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.999
and use artemis and paste that in. Now,
if I login,
31

32
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.520
we can see that we have these queues. Come
back over here.
32

33
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.490
So, you can see  there's my-hello-world queue and whatnot. And if I come
33

34
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.140
let's see here. replybacktome.
34

35
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.600
So, it has an auto-refresh going which is kind
of annoying.
35

36
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.560
Try this one more time
36

37
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.340
replybacktome.
37

38
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.840
So now, we can see number attributes that
are happening here. And see if I can
38

39
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.470
browse this. So, not seeing any messages
there so I'm gonna come over here.
39

40
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.750
Let's come back over to IntelliJ and my
listener.
40

41
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.660
I'm going to comment this out so it does
not come up. So, I'm just commenting out the
41

42
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.300
@Component and this is gonna basically
stop us from listening to the queue. So,
42

43
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.870
I am no longer be listening to the
queue. So, now you can see that's just
43

44
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.460
sending hello. And we're not getting any
type of response back and that might be
44

45
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.230
waiting forever for a response. I'll
probably time out eventually. But it's
45

46
00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.380
fine for our purposes because what I
wanna do here is do a refresh. Now, you
46

47
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.850
can see that we are getting messages on
the queue. And I want to show you this here,
47

48
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.820
we can actually bring up attributes
about that message and see different
48

49
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.650
properties about that message. So, very
nice console here. Again Artemis, well, it
49

50
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.640
used to be a Red Hat project. So, that Red
Hat really supported it. So, there are
50

51
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.620
some really nice tooling around it. So,
you can see quite a bit here. I remember
51

52
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.880
our reply queue and then that
property that we set for the type. You
52

53
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.440
can see that this is a JSON payload. So, a
lot of nice features here. So, we can sit
53

54
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.720
here and browse the queue. We can
actually do a refresh. Now, if we still
54

55
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.820
just have to there.
And take a look at the hello-world.
55

56
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.530
So, I've got a couple messages there as
well. So, all interesting stuff here as
56

57
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.930
far as the things that we can bring up
and browse. And then finally, we also have
57

58
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.270
a dashboard here. So you can see the
resources being used. So, keep in mind, we
58

59
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.850
are just using this to demonstrate some
message sending in an organization. You
59

60
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:12.120
could literally have a very large server
and be sending tens of thousands of
60

61
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.580
messages on the server. So, that can here have a very
very complex operation. So, not unusual to
61

62
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.580
have a fairly sizable messaging system
and dozens if not hundreds of senders
62

63
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
and receivers in large complex
organizations. So, here we're just showing
63

64
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.670
a very very small portion of its
capabilities. And so just to recap, what
64

65
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.510
we needed to do here let me jump back over
to IntelliJ. So, the main thing is
65

66
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.510
comment out the dependency so Spring
Boot auto configurations does not
66

67
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:49.860
kick in. And then, in the application get
rid of any dependencies on the ActiveMQ
67

68
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.490
servers and for the embedded server
since we're not using that anymore. And
68

69
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.460
then, we need to set up in the Spring
artemis user ID and password for us to
69

70
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.810
authenticate and connect to the ActiveMQ
server running and docker container. And
70

71
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.370
this listener actually, I can right. I'm
gonna revert that. So, we don't have
71

72
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.860
that committed when we when I check this
in so that this will come up with
72

73
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.670
listeners. But if you wanted to get your
hands on and try this out, highly
73

74
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.410
recommend it. And go ahead and if comment
out this component for the listener. So
74

75
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.910
you can actually go into the console and
take a look at messages and explore. You
75

76
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.320
can find some pretty interesting stuff
in there. Really helps to get hands on
76

77
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.940
when you start going through this stuff.
