00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.843
All right, this video is a coding review of
2

3
00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:11.975
the assignment to add validation to our ingredient form,
3

4
00:00:11.975 --> 00:00:13.236
so what we wanna do is go over here
4

5
00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:16.258
to the IngredientCommand, bring that up
5

6
00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.008
and now we wanna do @NotBlank.
6

7
00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:23.724
So that will handle a null situation as well,
7

8
00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:26.136
so that makes sure, this will handle a null
8

9
00:00:26.136 --> 00:00:28.603
and also make sure that it's not just an empty String.
9

10
00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:30.743
So you have to have some type of text there,
10

11
00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.700
so we are requiring a description here.
11

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.117
Now next up we want to make this NotNull,
12

13
00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.940
just NotNull, and also @Min of one.
13

14
00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.853
So we have to have at least one for the amount,
14

15
00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:53.108
and then finally we also said UnitOfMeasureCommand,
15

16
00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:56.414
we wanna make that NotNull as well.
16

17
00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:59.097
So now this sets up the annotation-based
17

18
00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:01.014
validation constraints.
18

19
00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:06.351
Looked like we were highlighting that for some reason.
19

20
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:10.018
I'm wondering why IntelliJ is flagging that.
20

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.852
Don't know why IntelliJ was highlighting that,
21

22
00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:17.048
but I'm gonna let that slide for right now.
22

23
00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:18.742
Wanted to double-check that, but these here
23

24
00:01:18.742 --> 00:01:22.269
are pretty standard validation annotations, and next
24

25
00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:26.459
what we wanna do is update our IngredientController.
25

26
00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.628
So let's go over to our IngredientController,
26

27
00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:29.892
and we need to do the same thing
27

28
00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:31.886
that we did for the RecipeController.
28

29
00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:34.851
So if you remember we had to add in this WebDataBinder.
29

30
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.506
Now I'm gonna show you a little trick here,
30

31
00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.173
what I can do is come up and say split this,
31

32
00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:45.473
and now down at the bottom, down at
32

33
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.979
the bottom I have the RecipeController,
33

34
00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.682
and I'm gonna be doing the exact same data here.
34

35
00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:56.116
So now I have a split view inside of IntelliJ
35

36
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.866
and I want this exact same thing.
36

37
00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:04.058
So we're gonna go ahead and add that in,
37

38
00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:08.058
and then we also wanna add in this Data Binder.
38

39
00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:13.572
So that sets that up there, and then really we wanna do
39

40
00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:16.405
the exact same thing here, almost.
40

41
00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:23.423
Right here on, where's our @PostMapping, there we are.
41

42
00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.567
So now of course we need to get that URL,
42

43
00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:37.734
so we need to calculate the URL for this basically.
43

44
00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:42.170
So in this case we're not gonna be able to use
44

45
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.337
a static String because the Id values are changing.
45

46
00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.433
And we should be able to get the command.get
46

47
00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:57.600
the RecipeId, then we also need the ingredient id here too.
47

48
00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:08.561
So you can see how we have to build up that,
48

49
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.978
and we also want to do that, if I remember.
49

50
00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:15.738
Nope, I don't need to do a redirect there,
50

51
00:03:15.738 --> 00:03:19.782
so we're just gonna return back that URL and then finally,
51

52
00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.786
finally what we need to do also is update the form for
52

53
00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.988
the output, and I've gone in and done that already.
53

54
00:03:26.988 --> 00:03:30.321
So I'm gonna just go fullscreen on this.
54

55
00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:34.454
So you can see that I added in,
55

56
00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:37.456
and I copied a lot of this over from the recipeform.
56

57
00:03:37.456 --> 00:03:40.088
So I'm going to add in this conditional here
57

58
00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:42.591
to show that if we have errors,
58

59
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:43.829
if there's any errors we're gonna show
59

60
00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.902
this little alert dialog saying, hey,
60

61
00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:47.905
please correct the errors below,
61

62
00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:50.058
and then we've also restyled this,
62

63
00:03:50.058 --> 00:03:52.009
so this is a lot of Bootstrap stuff.
63

64
00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:53.517
I went through this previous in the course,
64

65
00:03:53.517 --> 00:03:56.502
I'm not gonna go through it in detail as to what it's doing,
65

66
00:03:56.502 --> 00:04:00.887
but effectively we can have multiple errors on a property
66

67
00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:03.004
and I will list out those errors.
67

68
00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:04.680
So I am gonna go ahead and start this
68

69
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.097
and see if it works properly.
69

70
00:04:10.564 --> 00:04:12.762
And you see that we are up and running,
70

71
00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:15.845
jump over to Chrome and do a refresh.
71

72
00:04:16.865 --> 00:04:19.659
Now let's come in and view it and we are dealing with
72

73
00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.066
the Ingredients, and what we wanna do
73

74
00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:24.863
is update this, so if I try to make that blank,
74

75
00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.976
I should get an error message,
75

76
00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:28.864
and we ran into a kaboom.
76

77
00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:32.614
Let's take a look, see what's happening here.
77

78
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.034
Expand this out a little bit,
78

79
00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:41.017
the Reactive stack traces are quite big.
79

80
00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:43.640
So we got a null there on the Id so
80

81
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.072
that's why it's unhappy, so the recipeId coming back on
81

82
00:04:46.072 --> 00:04:48.892
that command object was null.
82

83
00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:53.627
I'm gonna pause this for a second and troubleshoot that.
83

84
00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.140
So taking a quicker look here,
84

85
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.497
surprisingly the IngredientCommand has
85

86
00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.911
a null recipeId on it, so what we can do here
86

87
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.661
is pass that into the controller.
87

88
00:05:06.788 --> 00:05:09.662
So we can use the @PathVariable,
88

89
00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:13.079
oh, that is a String if I spell it right.
89

90
00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:17.909
So we're just gonna match up the property name there,
90

91
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.430
and now what we're gonna do is use that value here.
91

92
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.774
So we're definitely passing the recipeId
92

93
00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:26.794
and the URL value, so now we'll just take
93

94
00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:28.757
that right out of the path variable.
94

95
00:05:28.757 --> 00:05:30.862
So just as a recap, just to remind you,
95

96
00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:33.715
this is a path variable and I'm saying PathVariable,
96

97
00:05:33.715 --> 00:05:35.967
so just like what we're doing up here.
97

98
00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:38.042
So we're doing @PathVariable recipeId,
98

99
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:40.919
so we're just gonna pass that into the controller method,
99

100
00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.879
and then we'll use that to build up our redirect URL.
100

101
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.379
So let's go ahead and restart,
101

102
00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:52.915
and we'll jump on over to Chrome.
102

103
00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:57.349
Of course our Id changed 'cause we did a restart there.
103

104
00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.306
Let's do a View, go and view the ingredients,
104

105
00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:06.010
now let's update that, try to blank out description.
105

106
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.177
Submit, got another error, let's take a quick look at that.
106

107
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.257
The given id must not be null, so let's take a look at that.
107

108
00:06:20.243 --> 00:06:22.479
So the command object is not getting updated with
108

109
00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.646
the recipeId, so we got a bug there somewhere else.
109

110
00:06:29.592 --> 00:06:31.177
And we probably could go ahead
110

111
00:06:31.177 --> 00:06:35.344
and since we are looking for this as a bind variable,
111

112
00:06:36.997 --> 00:06:40.448
what we could do here, let's see if we have
112

113
00:06:40.448 --> 00:06:42.698
a hidden property for that.
113

114
00:06:49.485 --> 00:06:51.345
So this is another way to get around it,
114

115
00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:55.017
so we're gonna do a hidden field of the recipeId.
115

116
00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:58.229
So as long as we have that value being populated on
116

117
00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.264
the command object going to the form,
117

118
00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:01.701
we will get that posted back.
118

119
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.118
So let's go ahead and restart this again.
119

120
00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:13.743
Now let's go ahead and View him,
120

121
00:07:13.743 --> 00:07:17.910
View the ingredients, let's try to Update, Submit,
121

122
00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:23.919
and it did not catch our error logic, which it should have.
122

123
00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:32.936
I'm gonna pause this and troubleshoot it a little more.
123

124
00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:34.658
All right, what I wanna do here is I'm gonna bring
124

125
00:07:34.658 --> 00:07:38.994
this up in the debugger to see what's going on here.
125

126
00:07:38.994 --> 00:07:42.098
So I'm gonna set a breakpoint here,
126

127
00:07:42.098 --> 00:07:46.265
stop this and now I wanna bring this up in debug mode,
127

128
00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:49.330
and we'll go through it and see what's,
128

129
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.497
we'll take a closer look as to what's happening here.
129

130
00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:02.329
Come in here, do the Update, and that should trigger it.
130

131
00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:08.573
So now we have our binding result, and for some reason
131

132
00:08:08.573 --> 00:08:12.156
it thinks that there are zero errors there.
132

133
00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:16.898
Now the objectName of "recipeId",
133

134
00:08:16.898 --> 00:08:19.481
that's interesting because here
134

135
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:25.552
in RecipeController I'm actually giving it a name.
135

136
00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:26.802
@ModelAttribute.
136

137
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.552
So we're looking at ingredient,
137

138
00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:37.719
so let's go ahead and give that a name of ingredient there.
138

139
00:08:42.072 --> 00:08:43.989
I'm gonna restart this.
139

140
00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:50.812
I'm gonna go over here, to view,
140

141
00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:56.766
View, Update, blank him out, again zero errors.
141

142
00:09:01.864 --> 00:09:03.370
So we are expecting errors there,
142

143
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.450
so I'm gonna pause this and figure out what's going on.
143

144
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.766
Okay, I did a little more debugging
144

145
00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:11.720
and I figured out what was going on here,
145

146
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.148
so we are getting a Data Binder for each of these properties.
146

147
00:09:16.148 --> 00:09:17.903
So like I said, it's a little workaround
147

148
00:09:17.903 --> 00:09:20.446
that we are working with here.
148

149
00:09:20.446 --> 00:09:22.607
So we have two properties, and each one of these guys
149

150
00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:25.871
is getting a Data Binder, and you can see 
150

151
00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:27.846
that we have the recipeId here,
151

152
00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:29.786
but we actually want the ingredient.
152

153
00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.101
So what we can do is come up here
153

154
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:35.827
and you can actually wire in multiple Data Binders.
154

155
00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:38.614
If I come in and update this to ingredient,
155

156
00:09:38.614 --> 00:09:40.559
now we're being more specific,
156

157
00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.681
and we were just accidentally giving
157

158
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:44.164
the wrong Data Binder there.
158

159
00:09:44.164 --> 00:09:47.115
So now let's go ahead and restart this,
159

160
00:09:47.115 --> 00:09:49.033
and I wanna point out that this gets set
160

161
00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:53.461
with every web request, so that is effectively thread-safe,
161

162
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:55.964
so we don't have to worry about weird things happening.
162

163
00:09:55.964 --> 00:09:58.964
Let's go ahead and restart this now,
163

164
00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:03.341
and this time we should get the expected behavior.
164

165
00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:06.508
Go ahead and come over here to Chrome,
165

166
00:10:08.493 --> 00:10:10.753
and let's go ahead and View this,
166

167
00:10:10.753 --> 00:10:13.000
go into the Ingredients and View,
167

168
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.262
now I wanna do an update, and we wanna blank that out.
168

169
00:10:17.262 --> 00:10:19.512
Do a Submit, we hit our breakpoint,
169

170
00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:22.937
now we can see that we are getting, okay,
170

171
00:10:22.937 --> 00:10:24.747
so actually amount got rejected too,
171

172
00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:27.700
so let's go ahead and allow this to go,
172

173
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.698
and verify that our view.
173

174
00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:33.865
Oh, we got another 500 error, so let's see what that is.
174

175
00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:40.639
We need to add a slash here.
175

176
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.301
So we have a problem in our URL,
176

177
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:44.968
let's go ahead and restart this.
177

178
00:10:46.608 --> 00:10:47.928
So that error message was saying
178

179
00:10:47.928 --> 00:10:49.911
that it could not find the template,
179

180
00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:53.994
and sometimes those little slashes are important.
180

181
00:10:56.117 --> 00:10:59.534
We'll come and View, view, do an Update of
181

182
00:11:01.196 --> 00:11:04.696
the Ingredient, try to blank out Cilantro,
182

183
00:11:05.692 --> 00:11:07.834
we are gonna let the debugger continue on.
183

184
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:12.001
Come back over to Chrome and we got another error.
184

185
00:11:19.433 --> 00:11:21.183
So that is out there.
185

186
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.138
I don't like how this is outputting here,
186

187
00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:32.221
I'm gonna debug this a little bit and pause this.
187

188
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.947
Okay, I figured out the problem that I was having here,
188

189
00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:39.275
and just a real simple mistake on my part,
189

190
00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:41.029
it happens to the best of us.
190

191
00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:43.142
On line 99, that's what I was returning,
191

192
00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:45.456
I was returning back the url value rather than
192

193
00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:48.319
the template name, so that's what I need to do
193

194
00:11:48.319 --> 00:11:51.553
is the actual template name rather than the url value.
194

195
00:11:51.553 --> 00:11:54.417
Kind of a, definitely a mistake on my part there,
195

196
00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.521
but it does happen to us, so let's go ahead and run this now
196

197
00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:01.021
and we'll see if this is actually working,
197

198
00:12:02.541 --> 00:12:04.356
which I expect it will be now.
198

199
00:12:04.356 --> 00:12:08.523
So we are up, let's come back over here to Recipe.
199

200
00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:12.991
Can see that, let's go and view, View,
200

201
00:12:14.386 --> 00:12:17.219
and we'll come in and Update this.
201

202
00:12:18.228 --> 00:12:22.228
I'll delete that, and we ran into another error.
202

203
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.493
And we are looking for name.
203

204
00:12:31.902 --> 00:12:34.554
Okay, I had one little error in my template there
204

205
00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:36.303
and I'll show you exactly what.
205

206
00:12:36.303 --> 00:12:39.531
I had this value here, I mistakenly cut
206

207
00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:41.542
and paste it to the spam block.
207

208
00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:43.865
Actually needs to be on the input type,
208

209
00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:46.682
so let's go ahead and take a look at this now.
209

210
00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:48.808
Just a first time running through that template
210

211
00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:53.548
in live mode, so let's go ahead and refresh this.
211

212
00:12:53.548 --> 00:12:57.409
We'll come in and view, View the Ingredients,
212

213
00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:00.101
we'll Update these so I know the .5 is going to blow up.
213

214
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.684
Actually we'll delete this too.
214

215
00:13:04.364 --> 00:13:06.697
So now we see that our error handling
215

216
00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:09.379
is working as expected, so that is good.
216

217
00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:11.831
Unfortunately it looks, our UOM
217

218
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:13.725
did not get populated, so that's something
218

219
00:13:13.725 --> 00:13:14.968
that we need to fix real quick.
219

220
00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:18.239
I'm gonna pause this and fix that.
220

221
00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:21.588
Now we can see what I did here is I added in the Model,
221

222
00:13:21.588 --> 00:13:24.371
and then we are adding in the uomList,
222

223
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:26.216
and I'm going to show you a trick in the next video,
223

224
00:13:26.216 --> 00:13:28.110
how we can clean this up a little bit.
224

225
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.118
So we have this uom service consistently putting a uomList
225

226
00:13:32.118 --> 00:13:35.229
on our model, so we can reduce our redundant code
226

227
00:13:35.229 --> 00:13:36.828
here pretty simply, but I'll show you
227

228
00:13:36.828 --> 00:13:40.226
that in the next video, and now let's go ahead
228

229
00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:42.377
and demo this actually working.
229

230
00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:46.544
So we'll come in, refresh, view the Perfect Guacamole,
230

231
00:13:48.845 --> 00:13:50.804
and let's go ahead and we'll take this one here,
231

232
00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:53.155
and that's .5, which I know it would fail.
232

233
00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:55.494
If I do a Submit, now we can see that
233

234
00:13:55.494 --> 00:13:57.589
the UOM list is being populated
234

235
00:13:57.589 --> 00:14:00.063
because before we hit that error,
235

236
00:14:00.063 --> 00:14:01.995
and you can see that we weren't populating
236

237
00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:04.692
that UOM model, so we needed to add
237

238
00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:06.475
that to the model being returned to the view,
238

239
00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:10.642
otherwise it was null and nothing was getting updated.
