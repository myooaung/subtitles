Alright! In this video, we have an
assignment. I wanna get you some
1

2
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.280
hands-on working with WebFlux, and what
we are gonna do is create the GET
2

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.220
endpoints for vendors. So, what we want is
two new endpoints. And by endpoint, I mean
3

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.949
a URL that we can hit. One of them is
going to list all vendors, and then, the
4

5
00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.990
second one is going to get vendor by ID.
And we wanna do this just like we did
5

6
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.700
before, exactly like we did in the last
video. But I want you to get the hands-on
6

7
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.000
experience with this. So, develop the
controller methods, and then, also create
7

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.079
unit tests for each one of those. And I
want you use the WebTestClient, like we
8

9
00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
demonstrated before. And also, set up so
we get complete test coverage here. So,
9

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.219
pretty simple assignment. It's just a
repeat of what we did previously. But I
10

11
00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.050
want you to go through it and get your
hands on it and get used to working with
11

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170
the reactive types and the WebFlux client, or WebFlux coding inside of
12

13
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.310
Spring Framework. Because remember, this
WebFlux is a completely different web
13

14
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.570
framework than what we have with Spring
MVC. So, this is like a whole new thing.
14

15
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.280
But, you can see, there's a lot of
similarities between that, but I want you
15

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.070
to start getting your hands on, because
until you'd really get your hands into
16

17
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.939
the code, you're not gonna see these
little small nuances. They're still there.
17

18
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.450
But getting used to working with these
reactive types. I think it's important for
18

19
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
you get your hands on. And in the next
video, I'm gonna go through this step by
19

20
00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.030
step. We'll create the VendorController.
We'll set that all up. We'll go ahead and
20

21
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.590
create the unit tests using Mockito and
WebTestClient. I'll step you through
21

22
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.610
that. But first, I hope you take this as a
challenge. Go through it and work for
22

23
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
it yourself, and if you have problems,
you'll have the next video to look at
23

24
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.250
and see me do it step-by-step.
