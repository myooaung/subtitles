<v Man>All right.</v>

2
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.436
In this video, we have an assignment for you.
2

3
00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:09.269
One more assignment.
3

4
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.118
We are going to refactor the image service.
4

5
00:00:12.118 --> 00:00:14.991
So this is the last service that we have that is
5

6
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:16.143
a non-reactive type.
6

7
00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:19.145
So we want to get this going and using the refactor types
7

8
00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.902
and the reactive repository and get it returning
8

9
00:00:22.902 --> 00:00:24.503
to the service layer that way.
9

10
00:00:24.503 --> 00:00:28.030
So again, we are going to refactor the image service
10

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.418
to use the reactive repository.
11

12
00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.661
We also want to refactor it to use return reactive types.
12

13
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.531
And of course, we want to update our unit tests.
13

14
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.556
And now, in the next video, I am going to go through
14

15
00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.896
those all step by step, so we'll get hands on.
15

16
00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.417
So I'm really taking my time in this section getting
16

17
00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:47.636
you used to the reactive types.
17

18
00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:49.394
So you'll be able to see us go through things
18

19
00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:50.584
step by step.
19

20
00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.571
And then one final reminder is one simply
20

21
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.243
does not simply break the build.
21

22
00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:57.818
So one for the Game of Thrones fan at the time
22

23
00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:01.391
of recording this, we are upcoming on the final
23

24
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:04.216
episode of season seven of Game of Thrones.
24

25
00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:07.208
So I am a big fan and quite a series there.
25

26
00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:11.677
But as a quick reminder, one does not break the build.
26

27
00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:13.189
So I'm still playing on myself.
27

28
00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.078
A couple of videos ago where I did, in fact,
28

29
00:01:15.078 --> 00:01:16.064
break the build.
29

30
00:01:16.064 --> 00:01:18.684
So we do not want to get in the habit of breaking the build.
30

31
00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.985
So watch those unit test as you proceed through this.
31

32
00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:23.200
And in the next video, we are going to go through
32

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.783
and refactor that step by step.
