Okay, let's take a look at Firefox
developer edition. So I have it newly
1

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.360
installed on my machine and if you are
using OS X, you get a nifty blue icon
2

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.350
with a blue fox on it. So a little bit
different. You can see the original
3

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.789
Firefox there right next to it. So I have
got the little application up and
4

5
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.480
running and to see what we want to look
at, we have this whole web developer
5

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.800
toolbar here, menu option I mean, and
let's go ahead and take a look at the
6

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320
web council and we can see it brings up
a council and this is like a JavaScript
7

8
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.219
output council. So we can see what's
going on there and let's take a look at
8

9
00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.340
the network and I'm going to go ahead
and refresh the page so we can get some
9

10
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020
traffic there. So this is really nicely
designed. I like how they started up
10

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.350
here. Reminds me a little bit of Chrome
but over here, remember we're looking at
11

12
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.420
the Access Monitor. So we're seeing the output in the exact
12

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.770
request that we made and everything that
was responded back. So it's a really nice
13

14
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.850
implementation to see what's going
across a wire for a particular request.
14

15
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
So that's something that's going to
be very very handy to have. And then we
15

16
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.140
also have the inspector so we can come
in and see the HTML and you can see as
16

17
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.090
I'm mousing over things, the different
blocks are being highlighted so after
17

18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.600
the HTML. So this is a very very nice
example here. We don't have any styles to
18

19
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.150
edit, nothing for performance and memory
is an interesting one. So we don't have
19

20
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.680
any. So we don't have too much here but
we can see what's taking up
20

21
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.490
memory. So we have a very very light page. So probably nothing too interesting here.
21

22
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.509
But the biggest takeaways that you are
probably going to use on daily basis is
22

23
00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.490
going to be this inspector. Pretty
similar to the other tools and I really
23

24
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.069
do like the network tab here of how it's
showing us the actual requests and the
24

25
00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.790
response. No cookies, no parameters. So we can
25

26
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.349
actually see the response body and this will
be very handy for troubleshooting things
26

27
00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.730
like restful calls from your webpage. That will be a very handy tool for us to
27

28
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.909
have.
