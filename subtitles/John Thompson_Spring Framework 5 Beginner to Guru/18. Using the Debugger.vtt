00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.860
Alright I am in the process of coding
the next section of the course for the
1

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.460
uploading a file for the image. And I ran
into a small problem and I thought I'll
2

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.100
take quick opportunity to show you how
to use the debugger. So here we are
3

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.630
seeing quite a bit of this already. I
have a controller method, PostMapping to
4

5
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.650
take in a post at the URL of recipe id image and he's going to take in the ID
5

6
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
value and a MultipartFile. Now to give you
a little preview of course I'm doing
6

7
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.489
test-driven development here and so I
set up my MockMultipart
7

8
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.420
File and I have that URL there. So
when I run this right now, we're getting a null
8

9
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.190
pointer error. Okay so I get a nested exception. Right,
9

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
there's a null pointer exception and
it's set at the in the ImageController. So
10

11
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.890
it's right here on this line and it could
be a couple of things that's causing that NPE.
11

12
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.850
So if I had a null id value coming in,
it could cause that to pop. A null file,
12

13
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
that shouldn't care. I don't think it
would care there or if the imageService
13

14
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.770
is null as well but looking at my test
coming in at my imageService there,
14

15
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.500
I am initializing the mocks and I am
injecting the imageService there. So
15

16
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.329
the way I built the ImageController is I do have a private final
16

17
00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.100
property and I do require the imageService being ejected. So I'm expecting
17

18
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.470
that to happen by dependency injection. So that should not be null but I am
18

19
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.899
still getting that NPE. So what we can do
there is we want to inspect this a
19

20
00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.950
little closer. So I'm clicking in the
gutter there to get that little dot
20

21
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.770
there and that's going to be a break
point for the debugger. Now if I come
21

22
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.020
down here and do a right-click and say
run as debug, I'm going to get it
22

23
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.409
up in the IntelliJ bugger here and
it's going to hit that break point and
23

24
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.950
stop. And now I can see okay my id value
is in fact getting set to 1 which is
24

25
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.540
good. I do have a mock file there but my
imageService is null.
25

26
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.250
Because I come back over here in my
test and I look and I am injecting
26

27
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:28.030
that and I am doing initMocks but what
I missed was adding mock here. So that
27

28
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.220
property wasn't annotated with a
Mockito Mock or as a Mockito mock.So now if
28

29
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.739
I come in and run this again I'm just
going to restart in the debugger, we can
29

30
00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.220
now see that I actually have an
imageService there, its no longer null.
30

31
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.500
So you can see some of the Mockito stuff,
a little wrapper around there as we get
31

32
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.129
into the Mockito
but that's exactly what we want. Now if I
32

33
00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.290
just hit the little play button here,
it's going to continue on and we can see
33

34
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.669
that I still have a problem on my code. Where I'm expecting a redirect. What am I
34

35
00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:12.159
expecting here? So what  I'm expecting is found
but I'm getting a 200 there. So I got a
35

36
00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.450
little bit more coding to do here as far
as making sure everything's right but
36

37
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.319
now I'm passed that null point error. So I
want to take a section and share that with
37

38
00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.129
you because I get a lot of people that
get tripped up who don't know fully how to
38

39
00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.930
utilize the debugger. So the debugger has
a lot of tools and as I progressed
39

40
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.510
through the course, I'll take more
opportunities to show you a little tips
40

41
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.979
and tricks like this how you can debug
your code inside the debugger. I am using
41

42
00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.930
IntelliJ. That is my preference but
Eclipse and NetBeans both have
42

43
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.010
excellent to debuggers as well. So you can
do nearly the same thing. Almost the same
43

44
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.019
functionality there, clicking in the
gutter, set a deep debug breakpoint and
44

45
00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.799
then right-clicking and saying running
in the debugger. So functionality in
45

46
00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.690
other IDEs is going to be very very
similar.
