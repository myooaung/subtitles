1
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.420
So this concludes the section of the course on Spring rest stocks.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.330
As you can see it's a very very capable tool.

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.940
There's a lot a lot of features to it.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.130
Obviously I wasn't able to explore every one.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.350
Highly recommend you go and check out the documentation.

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.360
There's a lot to it.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.340
And with the ASCII doctor stuff you can really customize look and feel of your documentation.

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.380
So it's a great tool.

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.540
It's also very spring specific so does a great job for documenting API is.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.030
Now there are other tools for documenting API is actually we'll have opinions on that.

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.420
If you are not happy with what Russ docs some people really don't like it.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.410
So another great tool to check out is open API.

13
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.530
It's formerly known as swagger but is now our version three is open API and this is a very very robust

14
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.140
tool.

15
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.010
Actually I'm thinking about doing a course specifically on open API because it's a very very very cool

16
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.550
topic to get into so hopefully at some point in the future I will do that.

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.800
But for right now there's a self study assignment to get into open API here.

18
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.020
I just want to focus on spraying and spraying rust docs it's a great tool to use especially if you are

19
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.080
in a spring programming shop.

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.150
I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have accurate API documentation because you are not

21
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.250
the only person that's going to be using that API.

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.950
So chances are you're going to be in a large development organization at a company you might be working

23
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.520
with dozens if not hundreds of other people that are going to be working with your API.

24
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.570
So having good API documentation is absolutely critical.

25
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.360
Spring rust Axe is a great tool because it integrates with your unit test and allows you to generate

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.020
test and API documentation at the same time so highly recommended to use or at least something else

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.370
like open API.

28
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.710
That's another great tool to check out.
