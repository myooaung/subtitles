Alright, in this video I have an
assignment for you and that is to go in
1

2
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.830
and display the remaining recipe
properties. And specifically what we want
2

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.910
to do is, in the previous video I showed
you how we can add in a hint,
3

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.519
so IntelliJ will pick up the proper type
of recipe. So go ahead and add that to
4

5
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.320
the show page and then we want to add in
an iterator for the categories to
5

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.219
display each category, and then also want
to do the same thing for ingredients. So
6

7
00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.540
we'll have to add to iterators for
categories and ingredients. And then we
7

8
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.860
have roughly a half-dozen properties to
implement. So we want to get all that
8

9
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.070
dynamic content that's been stubbed out
on the page working in. I think you guys
9

10
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.129
should be able to work through this. We've shown most of it already in the
10

11
00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.000
course. We've gone through it before. But
in the next video, in case you run into
11

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.430
any problems, I'm going to walk through
it step by step so you can see this get
12

13
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.550
implemented and have a working copy to
go forward with.
