00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:07.015
Now in this video we are gonna take a look
1

2
00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:10.264
at using ControllerAdvice to handle errors.
2

3
00:00:10.264 --> 00:00:12.162
Our little recipe application is still fragile
3

4
00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.657
in a few spots.
4

5
00:00:13.657 --> 00:00:15.834
Let me show you a failure here.
5

6
00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.034
So I got it up and running
6

7
00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.946
and what we wanna do is come over here
7

8
00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:23.029
and lets get rid of this.
8

9
00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:27.443
And let's go in and we're gonna update it.
9

10
00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:28.748
And our cook time,
10

11
00:00:28.748 --> 00:00:30.561
let's set that to alpha numeric,
11

12
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.484
so a string value that's not a number,
12

13
00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.222
and when we Submit it we just go to a blank page.
13

14
00:00:37.222 --> 00:00:40.079
So this really isn't user friendly, is it?
14

15
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.519
So what we wanna do is do something
15

16
00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.433
a little bit more there
16

17
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.417
so let's take a look at under the covers what's happening.
17

18
00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:48.115
We're getting validation failed.
18

19
00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.542
So right here, this last message here, saying that.
19

20
00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.293
Actually, I can completely clear the log messages.
20

21
00:00:55.293 --> 00:00:58.460
If I come back and just resubmit that.
21

22
00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:02.010
That's the only thing that I'm getting there.
22

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.530
Now, this is coming out
23

24
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.971
of the ResponseStatusExceptionHandler.
24

25
00:01:06.971 --> 00:01:08.846
I just hit command-O to bring that up.
25

26
00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.916
So let's jump over and take a look at that.
26

27
00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.586
What we wanna do is let's inspect this in the debugger.
27

28
00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:16.466
So I'm gonna stop this, come over here
28

29
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.178
and stop the Spring Boot application.
29

30
00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:22.504
And I'm gonna restart it and the debugger.
30

31
00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:23.466
We wanna take a look
31

32
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.737
and see what's going on here a little bit closer.
32

33
00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:30.779
Now, we are back up and running.
33

34
00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:32.898
Let's come back over here.
34

35
00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:35.065
We're gonna refresh that.
35

36
00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:40.304
And now lets come in and do that same update again.
36

37
00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:43.203
Set that to the String value and hit Submit.
37

38
00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:46.719
Now we hit the break point and we can see that we have this,
38

39
00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.596
it's throwing an exception of a WebExchangeBindException.
39

40
00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:54.939
And, ultimately, under the covers it's saying
40

41
00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.208
that we weren't able to do a BeanPropertyBindingResult
41

42
00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.649
because we were throwing a type mismatch.
42

43
00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.962
And if you look, even here in the RecipeController,
43

44
00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:07.545
if I set a break point here ...
44

45
00:02:08.785 --> 00:02:13.115
And let's go ahead and let this play again.
45

46
00:02:13.115 --> 00:02:17.089
And you might initially think, "Well, wait a second,
46

47
00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.842
I should be getting into the controller,
47

48
00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.167
because I'm not even getting to my BindingResult
48

49
00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.970
But what's happening is this is failing within the framework
49

50
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.236
so it's trying to do the binding
50

51
00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:27.625
of that RecipeCommand object even before it gets
51

52
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:30.146
to your save or update method inside the controller.
52

53
00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:31.724
So that's an important concept to understand
53

54
00:02:31.724 --> 00:02:34.481
that this is happening within the framework.
54

55
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:38.480
And what we can do is we had something similar before,
55

56
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.809
and it's @ControllerAdvice and we were returning back
56

57
00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.504
this ResponseStatus.
57

58
00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:46.902
So let's bring this back to life and do that.
58

59
00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.054
We'll import that class.
59

60
00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:52.491
Can also do a BAD_REQUEST for the status.
60

61
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:54.873
An @ExceptionHandler, but this time rather
61

62
00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:59.040
than a NumberFormatException, we want this WebExchange,
62

63
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.534
a WebExchangeBindException.
63

64
00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:05.947
And now we're gonna return back a String
64

65
00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:07.292
rather than modelAndView.
65

66
00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:11.623
Remember the modelAndView is specific the Servlet API.
66

67
00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:13.873
And I'm gonna say Handling
67

68
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.131
Binding.
68

69
00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:18.843
We'll make that binding.
69

70
00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:20.674
So we're handling a binding exception
70

71
00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:22.369
and we're gonna output that.
71

72
00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.522
Don't need the ModelAndView
72

73
00:03:24.522 --> 00:03:26.851
because that is Servlet specific.
73

74
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:28.563
And this here is actually the view name
74

75
00:03:28.563 --> 00:03:29.635
that we wanna return.
75

76
00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:33.802
So we can set up this handler to return back that.
76

77
00:03:35.674 --> 00:03:37.869
And now what we're gonna do is
77

78
00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.036
we've got the exception we can also pass in the model.
78

79
00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:44.940
Go ahead and port that.
79

80
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:49.388
Don't need that line anymore.
80

81
00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:57.102
Now we're gonna bind the exception to the model.
81

82
00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.477
So this will be a little bit cleaner.
82

83
00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:01.458
And I'm gonna put a break point.
83

84
00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:04.633
Okay I already got a break point here.
84

85
00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:07.104
So let's go ahead and restart this.
85

86
00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:09.960
Now we're gonna use that error handling that we had before,
86

87
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.419
and remember that we set up that 400 error page,
87

88
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.440
and we're gonna add a little bit nicer exception handling
88

89
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.738
rather than just showing a blank page.
89

90
00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:20.722
So let's come back over here.
90

91
00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:21.976
And back up.
91

92
00:04:21.976 --> 00:04:22.976
And refresh.
92

93
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:26.031
Come in here, update.
93

94
00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:28.763
Random string there.
94

95
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.015
Now we can see that we fall into our ControllerAdvice.
95

96
00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:35.297
And we're gonna handle that.
96

97
00:04:35.297 --> 00:04:37.580
So I'm going to go ahead and hit play.
97

98
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.359
And notice that we did not hit this break point here.
98

99
00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:41.654
We went right by that.
99

100
00:04:41.654 --> 00:04:43.801
So now our custom ExceptionHandler,
100

101
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:48.770
our custom ControllerAdvice is handling that error.
101

102
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.191
And now we can see this is a little bit nicer.
102

103
00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:54.379
So it actually gives you something to go on
103

104
00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.614
rather than just a blank screen.
104

105
00:04:56.614 --> 00:04:58.486
So this is a much nicer,
105

106
00:04:58.486 --> 00:05:01.020
obviously you could enhance it from here
106

107
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.016
to do something more elaborate than this.
107

108
00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:06.093
But here we're getting a hook on to the bad request
108

109
00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:07.927
and we are able to return back
109

110
00:05:07.927 --> 00:05:09.958
some information to the end user.
110

111
00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.885
Obviously, we could dress this up quite a bit
111

112
00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:15.660
because we do have the messages here
112

113
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.732
that we could, just like we did before
113

114
00:05:17.732 --> 00:05:20.609
in the form validation, we could put it here
114

115
00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:22.359
or add additional logic.
115

116
00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.006
So there's a number of things that we could do here.
116

117
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:27.246
But this is going to be a global handler.
117

118
00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:30.045
I'm just showing you how to set up a global handler here
118

119
00:05:30.045 --> 00:05:31.670
for bind exceptions.
119

120
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.374
And again, this is being caused
120

121
00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:37.467
because I put in a String value for a numeric value.
121

122
00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.425
And the Spring framework stopped it.
122

123
00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.816
Originally we were going to the default error handler,
123

124
00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:45.786
which really has no logic at all as far as
124

125
00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:49.443
what it displays for an error message to the end user.
125

126
00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:52.156
Now we've revived our ControllerAdvice.
126

127
00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:54.790
You remember before we had this we were
127

128
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.601
using the ModelAndView, so we could not use that anymore
128

129
00:05:57.601 --> 00:05:59.882
because that is part of the Servlet API.
129

130
00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:01.403
Now this probably should,
130

131
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:05.589
I expect this also would work in a Servlet environment
131

132
00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.485
should we ever take the application back
132

133
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:10.688
to a non-reactive application and decide to use the Servlet.
133

134
00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:13.128
But this is a good example of taking and transitioning
134

135
00:06:13.128 --> 00:06:15.608
something that we had before to utilize now
135

136
00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:19.775
in a reactive environment without the Servlet API.
