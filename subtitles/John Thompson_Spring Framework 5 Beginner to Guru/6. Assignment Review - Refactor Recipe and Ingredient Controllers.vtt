00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.413
(upbeat music)
1

2
00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:06.163
Alright, what we wanna do
2

3
00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:08.595
in this video is go in and complete
3

4
00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:10.085
the programming assignment.
4

5
00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:13.013
So the first objective was to take the show method
5

6
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.838
for recipes and make that a reactive type
6

7
00:00:15.838 --> 00:00:17.207
that it's returning.
7

8
00:00:17.207 --> 00:00:20.688
So here on line 34, scroll up a little bit here,
8

9
00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:23.324
and I'm gonna get rid of this debug break point there.
9

10
00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:25.077
On line 33, so we're returning back
10

11
00:00:25.077 --> 00:00:26.852
an attribute called recipe,
11

12
00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:28.774
and right now we're doing a block.
12

13
00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.528
And that block is going
13

14
00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:33.290
to return back Recipe object.
14

15
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.608
And now if we get rid of that
15

16
00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:37.586
we will be returning back a Mono
16

17
00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:38.850
with a recipe inside of it.
17

18
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.344
And the ThymeleafTemplateEngine
18

19
00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.388
is gonna handle that publisher.
19

20
00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:44.340
Remember, the Mono is a publisher.
20

21
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.297
So that takes care of that one.
21

22
00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:48.902
And then we have the IngredientController.
22

23
00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:51.096
So let's go to the IngredientController.
23

24
00:00:51.096 --> 00:00:52.463
And let's see here.
24

25
00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:55.130
We wanna do the GetMapping here.
25

26
00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:59.622
We are actually already returning the Mono there,
26

27
00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:00.957
which is good.
27

28
00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:02.173
That was a mistake on my part.
28

29
00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:03.172
Sorry about that.
29

30
00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:07.178
And then we also wanna do the ingredient and show.
30

31
00:01:07.178 --> 00:01:09.473
So we'll get rid of that block there.
31

32
00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:12.073
And now we'll be returning back the Mono,
32

33
00:01:12.073 --> 00:01:14.354
and just as a pro tip for Intellij,
33

34
00:01:14.354 --> 00:01:17.951
if you mouse over and hold down the command key,
34

35
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.194
that's when that little window pops up there.
35

36
00:01:21.194 --> 00:01:25.361
And then we also wanna do the unitOfMeasureService.
36

37
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.564
So see down here on line 65,
37

38
00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:30.508
we can get rid of that break point too.
38

39
00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:33.258
And we will get rid of the block.
39

40
00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:37.309
And then we are also doing it here.
40

41
00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.765
Actually we don't need that collectList either.
41

42
00:01:42.765 --> 00:01:45.804
And then get rid of that up there too.
42

43
00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:48.406
And now we're just returning back the...
43

44
00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:50.804
That should be a Flux coming back,
44

45
00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.101
remember a Flux is many.
45

46
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:56.200
It's basically a list of objects and a publisher.
46

47
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.955
And that looks like that completes it.
47

48
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.802
So we had the one method in the RecipeController
48

49
00:02:01.802 --> 00:02:03.727
to here in the IngredientController
49

50
00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.387
and then the UnitOfMeasureService.
50

51
00:02:05.387 --> 00:02:06.719
So we wanna do that.
51

52
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.498
And let's make sure I'm not running already.
52

53
00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:12.455
It looks like I am, so we'll stop that.
53

54
00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.955
And I'm gonna come up here and restart it.
54

55
00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:18.334
And we'll toggle over to Chrome
55

56
00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:21.102
and make sure everything's working happily still.
56

57
00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:23.435
So jump over here to Chrome.
57

58
00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:28.027
And we can see that that is working,
58

59
00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:29.461
so let's do a view there.
59

60
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.491
That is working.
60

61
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:33.016
Let's do a view of our ingredients.
61

62
00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:35.281
And the Update view should also be getting,
62

63
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:37.026
so that's where the UOM is coming from,
63

64
00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:38.653
so now we're getting the reactive types there
64

65
00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.584
being used throughout it.
65

66
00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:42.736
Now one thing I do wanna point out here
66

67
00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:46.653
is I did go in and look at the controller test.
67

68
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.070
And I did try several different things
68

69
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.939
to get a controller test working,
69

70
00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.389
and it's just not there yet.
70

71
00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.862
So for right now, I'm gonna be leaving
71

72
00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:58.957
the controller test ignored.
72

73
00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:00.205
And at some point in the future,
73

74
00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:02.079
we will go back and refactor this
74

75
00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.822
to use the testing because right now
75

76
00:03:03.822 --> 00:03:07.004
I couldn't get a test working with the Thymeleaf
76

77
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:09.411
and reactive framework together.
77

78
00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:11.270
So I think that there's some bugs
78

79
00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.118
still to be worked out,
79

80
00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:13.871
it's still very very early.
80

81
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.331
So at some point in the future,
81

82
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.847
I am gonna go back and refactor this
82

83
00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:20.206
so we can pick up integration tests
83

84
00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.358
or some type of testing for our controllers.
84

85
00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:24.138
So for right now, I just wanted to alert you
85

86
00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:25.800
that I am gonna be leaving these tests
86

87
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.883
ignored for a little bit.
