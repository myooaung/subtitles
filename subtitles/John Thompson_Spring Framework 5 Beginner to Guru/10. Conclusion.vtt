00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.420
Okay, this concludes our section of the
course on Spring Externalized properties.
1

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.870
So there's a number of different ways we
can be setting properties within the
2

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.410
Spring Context and this is a very
important chapter. I know it may have get
3

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.800
a little dry seeing me set different
properties, different ways but you do
4

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
have quite a tool set here to work with
inside the Spring framework and this is
5

6
00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.410
a very very important chapter because as
you develop Spring applications, setting
6

7
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.399
these properties, as you migrate your
Spring applications through the
7

8
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.760
enterprise and through different
environments, these properties are going
8

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.450
to be used for a lot of different things. You'll be using them to connect to
9

10
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.809
different databases, to enable different
databases, different data sources,
10

11
00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.550
message cues, whether or not to turn on
something. So a lot of stuff can be
11

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.110
controlled with these properties and
it's a very important thing. I've been on
12

13
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.550
some very very complex Spring projects
where you had a lot of different
13

14
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390
propertie, a lot of moving parts on
these larger Spring applications. So
14

15
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.199
that's why I spent a lot of detailed
time on this. So we are going to have a
15

16
00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.080
lot more fun in the course going forward
and we're going to get off properties
16

17
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.689
into creating a real application and as
we progress further down in the course,
17

18
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.500
we will be coming back and utilizing and
reinforcing these properties and I'll
18

19
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.860
show you examples of where we can start
using these tool sets as we get more
19

20
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.630
realistic Spring applications to work
with.
