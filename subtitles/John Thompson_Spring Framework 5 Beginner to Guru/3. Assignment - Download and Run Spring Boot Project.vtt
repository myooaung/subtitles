Okay! I got a pretty simple coding
assignment for you, in this module. So
1

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.490
right now, where you should be at, you
should have Mongo database up and
2

3
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.150
running on your local machine. Now, in the
resources of this module, there's gonna
3

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.230
be a link to GitHub, for you to
download a Mongo database application,
4

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.039
I've written in Spring Boot. Now, I'm
gonna assume this course is for
5

6
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.730
experienced Java developers with Spring
experience. You should be able to run and
6

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.180
build a Maven project. So go out and
download that project from GitHub, run it,
7

8
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
and this is a Spring Boot project, that's
gonna come up against the default
8

9
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.710
parameters for the Mongo database. One nice
thing about Spring Boot is that it's
9

10
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
gonna start off and look at the
default stuff for Mongo, and connect out
10

11
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.510
the database, that we have running inside
of Docker container. Now, if you go over
11

12
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.949
to port 8080, you'll be able to see the web console. You'll be like
12

13
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.059
persist some data right to the
Mongo database, and be able to see how
13

14
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.770
that works with Spring Boot. And now, in
the next section, I'll step you through
14

15
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
all the step by step.
I'm downloading Spring Boot from GitHub
15

16
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.090
and connecting it to a running Mongo
database container.
