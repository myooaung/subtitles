00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.980
Alright, I wanted to give you a solid
overview of some of the web development
1

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.580
tools we have to utilize when we're
developing web applications using the
2

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
Spring framework and Spring MVC. Now a
lot of the tools there, we looked at the
3

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.650
client-side tools, we looked at HTTP
request. That is the environment that
4

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.240
we're going to be in as we develop web
applications using Spring MVC. We have a
5

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.109
variety of tools from the client side
using the browser's to see what's going
6

7
00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.940
on what we think is going over to it
into these Spring application. We have
7

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.170
the Axis TCP monitor to see what's
really going through across the wire.
8

9
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.680
This is a very very handy tool
especially as you start getting to
9

10
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.270
restful interfaces. And then finally we
have the Spring Boot developer tools and
10

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.739
these are a great tool set that we can
utilize it and it really really does
11

12
00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.030
speed up your development because you
get that rapid reload. And like you saw
12

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.649
in a couple of videos there, these tools
are not perfect. The compile, the reload
13

14
00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.870
on the Java side is usually rock-solid
but sometimes it does have a hiccup and
14

15
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.390
if you do get a hiccup, just shut down
restart and you're usually good to go.
15

16
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
And sometimes, it's actually a bug in
your code that's causing a problem. And I
16

17
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320
notice from experience if you fat-finger
the Java code and do the reload and then
17

18
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
you correct the Java code and do the
reload, sometimes that does most things
18

19
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.380
up. But for the most part, it is pretty
good but just be aware you may may hit
19

20
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
issues. So in the next section of this
course we are going to get into setting
20

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.549
up the database and take a closer look
at Hibernate and JPA mappings.
