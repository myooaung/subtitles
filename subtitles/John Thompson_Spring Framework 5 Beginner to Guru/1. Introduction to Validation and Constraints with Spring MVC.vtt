00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.980
Alright in this part of the course we
are going to take a look at working with
1

2
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
exception handling and when things go
wrong inside our application. So there's
2

3
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.340
a couple scenarios that we need to
accommodate for. One is where we run into
3

4
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
an unexpected error. So that's going to
throw an unexpected exception in which
4

5
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.960
we need to handle and deal with. Right
now we haven't configured anything
5

6
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.390
inside a Spring Boot and Spring MVC to
handle this. So we kind of go to a generic
6

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.809
error page. We want to be a little more
friendly on that. Another scenario is
7

8
00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
where we can run into things that we
could expect like if somebody puts in a
8

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.710
wrong ID, wrong a recipe ID value and it's
simply not found in the database. Right
9

10
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.280
now we go to a generic error page. Not
something that we want to do. We want to
10

11
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.300
be detecting those errors and do
something that's friendly for the user
11

12
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.690
and we're also going to get into
externalizing some of the properties. The
12

13
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.970
String values and we're going to look at
something called Internationalization.
13

14
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.970
Internationalization allows us to
take the String values that we display
14

15
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210
on the screen and put those into
language files and make our application
15

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.509
internationalize. And you'll often see
this abbreviated as I18N and that is
16

17
00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.159
an abbreviation of Internationalization. If you look at the characters in
17

18
00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.210
Internationalization, it comes up to 18
so that's why they do a shorthand I18N.
18

19
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.530
So Internationalization is a very
important feature when you're working on
19

20
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.890
multi-language apps. There's great
support inside of Spring and we're going
20

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.950
to take a look at that as we get through
this section of the course.
