OK I have a coding assignment for you and what we want to do is display a list of authors so that it's

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.440
almost cookie cutter from what I did for showing you the list of books.

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.920
But we're going to do it for authors so to do this we're going to need to do is create an author controller

4
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.340
and we'll need to order wire in by constructor the author repository and then we'll to create a a method

5
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.590
to bind a list of the authors to the model that's being returned to.

6
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.710
Timely.

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.950
We'll map a path slash authors to that controller method and then create a timely template to display

8
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.910
the authors.

9
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.940
So that's pretty much cookie cutter everything that I just did.

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580
I want to get your hands on it.

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.250
And in the next video I will step you through step by step.

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.900
Everything I did.
