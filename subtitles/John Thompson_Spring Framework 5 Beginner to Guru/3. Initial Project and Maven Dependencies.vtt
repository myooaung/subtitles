1
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.589
In this video, what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go through and we're gonna create
1

2
00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.509
a brand new project that we will be
using to explore sending and receiving
2

3
00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.220
JMS messages. We are establishing a new
project in this video. You can see I have
3

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
a brand new repository that I just
created. And, I'm gonna come over here and
4

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.039
copy that link over to my clipboard.
Let me jump over to the command line and
5

6
00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.090
what I'm gonna do here is do a git clone like
so that will establish the repository in
6

7
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.550
my local working directory. And now, I
wanna come over to IntelliJ. And, we'll
7

8
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.480
actually go and start setting up this
project. So, I'm gonna come into
8

9
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.300
IntelliJ and I'm gonna come up to
File New New Project. So, I'm gonna create
9

10
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.640
a brand new project. I'm gonna go
ahead and use the Spring Initializr and
10

11
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.059
we will go out to the default of start.spring.io like so.
11

12
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.650
I'm gonna be using on groupId
guru.springframework. And here, I'm gonna
12

13
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.970
use sgf-jms. Again, this is my
personal naming convention. So, this
13

14
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
artifactId, let me jump back over to
Chrome real quick. I'm gonna make that
14

15
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.530
match the repository name. So, like 150
repositories or more now. So, it does a
15

16
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.320
definitely help you track things. I'm
gonna go ahead and come back over to
16

17
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.479
IntelliJ. So, we're gonna do Java Jar. We
are gonna be working with Java 11.
17

18
00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:45.590
That is the current long-term release.
Yeah. Example JMS project like so.
18

19
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.280
That's okay there. I'm saying Next. So, here are
the this is the Spring Initializr stuff.
19

20
00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.850
So, we are actually up to Spring Boot 2.1.6.
And, go ahead and try the.. I am going to
20

21
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619
be jumping - 2 soon - 2.2.0 soon
But for right now, I'll stay on 1.6. I'll
21

22
00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.810
be upgrading the course. 2.2.0 is supposed
to be released in August of 2019.
22

23
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.180
That's about 2 or 3 weeks away from when
I'm recording this. So, they'll be updated
23

24
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.048
soon. But here, let's go ahead.
24

25
00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:20.519
We'll
take in the DevTools, we'll take in
25

26
00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.950
Project Lombok.
Go ahead and bring in the Web Starter as
26

27
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.690
well.
And now under Messaging, what we want is
27

28
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.680
we have the ActiveMQ 5 or the ActiveMQ
Artemis. And, I might be totally
28

29
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.490
butchering how you say this. I'm not
honestly not sure how to say that but
29

30
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.360
we're gonna take in this newer one. 
This is actually a newer generation that
30

31
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.390
this flavor of Apache MQ was donated by
Red Hat. It used to be Hornet JMS, if I
31

32
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.350
remember correctly. That Red Hat
recently within the last year or so
32

33
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.270
provided for us. And so, that gives us
some nicer options there. So, I'm gonna go
33

34
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:09.010
ahead and bring these in. And now, I'm
just double-checking things and I think
34

35
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.820
that it's all good. I don't think I need
anything else. I'm just going through
35

36
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.280
double-checking. And here I'm gonna go
ahead and change this directory.
36

37
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.790
So, I do have a course as directory. So, go to micro
and that's where I checked out. That's
37

38
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.799
the working directory that I checked out
into. So, I'm gonna tell IntelliJ to go
38

39
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.620
ahead and place it in that directory. I'm
just gonna double-check everything here.
39

40
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.049
That all looks good. So, I'm gonna go
ahead and say Finish.
40

41
00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.030
IntelliJ is recommending some plugins
and I am not going to be working with
41

42
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.799
the JMS messenger plugin at this
particular point in time. So, we will not
42

43
00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:05.420
enable that. Let's come in here and
what we wanna do is I am going to go
43

44
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.579
ahead and do it Git Add on this.
44

45
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.480
And, I come back over here to the brewery
project and I'm going to go ahead and
45

46
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.300
copy this
.gitignore file. I have a more complete
46

47
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.850
one and then what Spring provides us. So,
go ahead and copy that. I come back over
47

48
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.380
to the JMS project. I'm going to go
ahead and paste that.
48

49
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.090
So, I just have a number more things
in there. So, I'm gonna overwrite what
49

50
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.750
the Spring Initializr gave us for that.
So, we will provide that.
50

51
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.990
Now, let's take a quick look at the Maven
POM. So, we can see that it did set up
51

52
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.210
the Java version, Java 11 for us which is
exactly what we want. We do have the
52

53
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.669
spring-boot-starter-artemis. Let me close
this and let's open up the Maven tab
53

54
00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.710
and if you don't see anything here, click
on this little circle here to go ahead
54

55
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.400
and import that. So now I wanna come in
here and I want to take a look at the
55

56
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.699
dependencies. And, this starter for
artemis is only gonna bring down the
56

57
00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.539
client. So, you can see here, it's bringing
the spring-boot-starter bringing in the
57

58
00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:28.259
JMS and then it's only bringing in the
core and the client. So, this is only
58

59
00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.870
gonna give you the ability to talk to
a server. And, what I wanna do here is
59

60
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.529
we are gonna be running an embedded
server. So, I have a couple dependencies
60

61
00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.620
that I need to add there. So, I'll go
ahead and do these right now.
61

62
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.980
I wanna do the artemis-server like
so.
62

63
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.789
Then also,
jms-server. So, bringing these two
63

64
00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:04.149
dependencies will allow us to set up an
embedded server. And, initially that
64

65
00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:08.319
way I'm gonna go through this section
is we're gonna run an embedded server
65

66
00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.549
inside of Spring, so when we bring up the
Spring Boot application, we will have our
66

67
00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:17.349
own server. Now, obviously not a typical
use case. Sometimes there are cases where
67

68
00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.519
you wanna use that. But typically, this
can be for something for doing Hello
68

69
00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:24.519
World examples which is exactly where
we're at. Perfectly fine for where we're
69

70
00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:28.569
at right now. So, that's why I'm gonna do
it this way and show you how to bring up
70

71
00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.860
an embedded server and then we'll use
that embedded server to go ahead and
71

72
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.449
send and receive JMS messages. So, we'll
go ahead and work with that. But for
72

73
00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:45.159
right now, I'm just gonna get this set
up. You can see here that I've through
73

74
00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.389
Spring Boot Initializr. I brought in the
spring-boot-starter. And then, I added in
74

75
00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:56.079
artemis-server and the artemis-jms-server. These two dependencies for Apache
75

76
00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:01.649
ActiveMQ. So, that gives us the capability
to set that up and everything else was
76

77
00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:07.389
generated by Spring Boot or Spring
Boot Initializr so that is all set up
77

78
00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:13.419
and I will go ahead and commit this into
the master branch inside of the Github,
78

79
00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.069
the new Github repository. So, you're
gonna have just the initial project and
79

80
00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.029
initial Maven dependencies on the master
branch. I will be branching this as
80

81
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:25.719
we go forward in the section of the
class to show you the changes for each
81

82
00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:28.589
step along the way.
