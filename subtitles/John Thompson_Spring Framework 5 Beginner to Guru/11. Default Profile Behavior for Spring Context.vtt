00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.880
Now we don't specify an active profile
inside of the Spring framework at
1

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.500
runtime there's actually one that's kind
of active it's a special profile called
2

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.859
Default so you can specify beans with
Default to be added into the Spring
3

4
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.930
context when there are no other beans
of that type available so this is a very
4

5
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.689
special case and the use case that we
want to do here is I want to specify
5

6
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.140
have the English greeting come out in
our controller when there is no other
6

7
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.760
active profile that's going to meet that
criteria.So this is a very special case
7

8
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.989
so I want to say if I don't have any
active profiles use this one by Default
8

9
00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.460
so it's an easy thing to remember that
the Default is the Default bean and what
9

10
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.160
we're going to do is set it up. I'm actually introducing
10

11
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.820
another language. We're going to use
German you'll see how bad my German is
11

12
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.129
coming up and so we'll have a German
saying coming out to the screen when we
12

13
00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.150
have de active, English and Spanish will
still work with those but what breaks is
13

14
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.330
then Spring doesn't know what to do
because all these beans, what's
14

15
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.780
happening in the background, all these
beans will have a profile associated
15

16
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430
with them if we're not running an active
profile those beans are not eligible
16

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.049
anymore so we're going to mark one of
them as Sefault so we'll be eligible to
17

18
00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.960
being brought into the Spring context. Now I've gone in and added another primary
18

19
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.200
service but this time we can see that
I've marked it with "de" for German and
19

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.119
I'm pretty sure Google Translate did not
get that one correct but roll with that
20

21
00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.189
is in German because my German is even
less than my Spanish but we're going
21

22
00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.850
to get a German greeting out of this and
I want to use that when the Profile "de"
22

23
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.909
is active and this works out great
because if I come over here to application.properties,
23

24
00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.950
if I change this to de,
we're going to see that I get the output
24

25
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.349
and that works fine. I got my little 
German saying there and that's exactly
25

26
00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:18.579
what I want if I go back to en,
I will also get it. Alright I will get
26

27
00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.480
the proper proper greeting so I get the
English version then of course that es
27

28
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.480
for Spanish now I have three of those
and this all works out great but
28

29
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.190
what if I don't have one I come in here
and run it like this, now I get an error
29

30
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.019
and it's saying that it sees the
other ones and what's happening here
30

31
00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.040
this is important to understand because
I don't have one that's Primary. I'm not
31

32
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.409
using a Qualifier that sees all other
threes and it's Spring is falling back
32

33
00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.209
to trying to autowire by type. So it's
like oh you didn't tell me what you
33

34
00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.829
wanted so but I see that you want an
implementation of this but I have three
34

35
00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.440
implementations of it. I don't know which
one to use and what we can do is when
35

36
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.319
there is no Profile active, there's
actually a hidden one called Default and
36

37
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.639
what we can do is go into our Greeting service, the PrimaryGreetingService
37

38
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:31.449
and this will actually take an array and
we can go in and add in default and now
38

39
00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:36.879
this will be active when there's no
active profile or "en" as our active
39

40
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.299
profile. So what we're saying is that we
want in the English version to be the
40

41
00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.129
default bean that gets selected and
that is a default profile now it's
41

42
00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:56.829
important to understand if we could
change back, we go back to German you'll
42

43
00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.650
see that it gets ignored again just like
it should and default is only active
43

44
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.400
when there are no other Profiles active
so that's an important nuance to
44

45
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.379
understand because I've gotten bit by
that in the past myself so important
45

46
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.310
little nuance to understand that the
default Profile is only active when
46

47
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.460
other Profiles
are not active.
47

48
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.850
Okay I hope by now you can start seeing
how how powerful and how many options we do
48

49
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.240
have available for us in wiring up bean
so we have four or five implementations
49

50
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.669
of our beans, our Greeting service now
and we are using a number of different
50

51
00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.500
options so we have quite a bit of a
toolbox here as to how we compose our
51

52
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.030
Spring applications. Now there's a
lot of different ways here that we can
52

53
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.770
use and you can see what a versatile
tool set this is and as you get more and
53

54
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.030
more comfortable with working within
Spring you'll see how easy it is to
54

55
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.020
compose your application. We started off
talking about dependency injection
55

56
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.110
having these externalized and having the
Spring container manage things now
56

57
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.419
you're starting to see that what a great
tool set we have as to how we can really
57

58
00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.669
dynamically compose our application at
runtime using Springs IoC container.
