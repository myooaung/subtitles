00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.700
Okay, here we want to take a look at the
Chrome developer tools. I'm going to
1

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.099
start up the Spring application and see
it get started pretty quick because we
2

3
00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.480
really don't have much there and I am
going to come over here to Chrome and I'm
3

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.400
already on localhost and hit refresh. We can
see that's refreshing. Okay not much
4

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
going on there and what I want to do is take a look at the developer tools. So
5

6
00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.770
inside of Chrome, under the View menu, you
have a tab for developers and
6

7
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.660
let's take a quick look at the source. So
this is the HTML that was rendered. So
7

8
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.879
this is a handy thing to do when you are
working on Spring MVC projects. They are
8

9
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
always going to be looking at the actual
HTML that was generated. So you are
9

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.739
working with Thymeleaf templates but you are
going to be passing in data. So you
10

11
00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.219
want to see what's actually getting
rendered to the browser and this is an
11

12
00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.570
important tool to use. The next thing we
want to take a look at is come up to
12

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.869
view in Developer and Developer Tools. Now you can see that's not a lot is going
13

14
00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.760
on. The default, I hit refresh there so
you can see some activity. It defaults
14

15
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.990
and we are just going to localhost and
we are doing a get method and we are
15

16
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.229
getting back a status of 200. So it's an
HTTP status code. It's a document and
16

17
00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.860
over here we start seeing some of the
timings of how fast it was coming back.
17

18
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
Now this example is really kind of
boring it does not show us everything
18

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.920
that's going on. What I am going to do is
come up here and we are going to go into
19

20
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.909
an incognito window and go out to my
website. Now this website is actually
20

21
00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.880
running on WordPress. I mean of course I
could write it in Spring MVC but really
21

22
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.860
why reinvent the wheel. And what we
want to do is come in here. Let's
22

23
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.070
take a look at the developer tools on
this. This is going to be much much more
23

24
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.869
interesting and let's do a refresh there. Now what you can see is my website
24

25
00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
actually has a lot of different stuff
going on. It's got different WordPress
25

26
00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.060
plugins, so different style sheets are
coming down, so it needs a different CSS
26

27
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.460
files, different JavaScript files. So a lot more interesting stuff is
27

28
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.630
happening here and we can see all these
different requests being made and
28

29
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.490
actually, this is actually kind of bad
because we should be combining them but
29

30
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.010
if this was a commercial site for a
major company, I'd definitely be doing
30

31
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.930
just that. But I'm just going
through here for example of what's
31

32
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.830
coming through. So the main thing I'll
be looking is I'm looking at different
32

33
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.230
statuses and we are actually getting like
a post a page speed beacon for some
33

34
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.290
reason. Not sure what's wrong in that to be
honest. Like here, I'm running sumome.
34

35
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.739
That was a little pop-up and I was from
sumome. So it's doing a post and getting
35

36
00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.520
back at 200. So we can see different
things happening, we made an
36

37
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.239
options request. So that's kind of
interesting, so that's a different HTTP
37

38
00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.250
method. So lots going on off my home
page there and we can see over here,
38

39
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.860
here's like the timing of all the
requests and what's happening and let's
39

40
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.019
see if we got any chatter and we got a
little chat around the council. The
40

41
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.600
council is going to be something that
you're going to be utilizing with
41

42
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.370
JavaScript development and what not but
the main thing that we are going to be
42

43
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.330
concerned with is the network and seeing
the downloads and the different
43

44
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.390
components. And when you are doing web
development you are also going to be
44

45
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.330
looking at different components. So we
can come up here and see the
45

46
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.470
different components and this is all about
the HTML and you can see how we are going through
46

47
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.980
the different components that we are
working with, the different div tags and
47

48
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.470
menu items and things like that. And
another really nice feature inside of
48

49
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.079
Chrome developer tools, is we can change
to different views. So right now that's
49

50
00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:04.130
being rendered on an iPad pro. Let's take a look at my site on iphone 5.
50

51
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.690
A much smaller screen format but you can
see that it's a reactive format. We are
51

52
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.060
getting different content here. So kind
of nice having it, being able to drill
52

53
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.650
down to us. So pretty nice tool set. Chrome is probably my favorite to do
53

54
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.270
web development in and I just want to
give you a good overview of the tool
54

55
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.600
sets that are available when we are doing
web development with Spring MVC.
