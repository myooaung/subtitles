Okay I got an assignment for you in this
chapter, what we want to do is add in a
1

2
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.740
Publisher entity. Right now the Book
entity has publisher as a string so
2

3
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.230
we're going to valve our data model
here to have a publisher and on that
3

4
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.609
entity I want you to add a publisher
name and address attributes like address
4

5
00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.399
line one, city, state and then we're
going to remove the string from the Book
5

6
00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.649
entity and we'll add in the Publisher as
a regular property and we'll add in
6

7
00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.160
getters and setters and then we'll use
the JPA one-to-one relationship and
7

8
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.379
then we also need to add in a publisher
repository for Spring Data JPA and next
8

9
00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.730
I want you to modify the dev Bootstrap
class to populate the Publisher and Book
9

10
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.770
entity so what you'll want to do is
create the Publisher first save it and
10

11
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.150
then assign it to a Book and then save
that and then I want you to go in start
11

12
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.090
up Spring and go into the h2 database
and inspect your results. Now in 
12

13
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.320
the next video that we'll go in and I
will step through this step by step so
13

14
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
if you're a little worried about using a
new annotation for JPA and you get lost
14

15
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
a little bit don't worry in the next
video I will go through step by step of
15

16
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.229
creating this Publisher entity and show
you my results in the h2 database
16

17
00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.680
console.
