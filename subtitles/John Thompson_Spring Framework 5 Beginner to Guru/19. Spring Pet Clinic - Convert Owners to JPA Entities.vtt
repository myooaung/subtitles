00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.090
In this video, we are going to get into
starting to map out the JPA entity so
1

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.120
we're going to take the POJOs that we've
been working with and start mapping them
2

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.619
to JPA mappings and go through that
process. I think we have a pretty solid
3

4
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
object model right now that's going to 
lend itself nicely to the JPA
4

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.269
mapping. We're going to follow a lot
what's been going on with the official
5

6
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.730
implementation of Spring Pet Clinic. I
am going to be working on issue number
6

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.840
36 in this video. We're going to focus on
mapping the owners to JPA entities and
7

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
the owners. It gives us a little more
complex object model to work with so
8

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.059
we're going to have to update several
entities with it. One of the things
9

10
00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.649
here is that we are using inheritance so
I'm looking at the source code to Spring
10

11
00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
Pet Clinic. You can see here on line
27, we have a MappedSuperclass. That
11

12
00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.309
indicates that this object is not to
be created in the database that we
12

13
00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.300
are expecting other classes to inherit
from it. So we can see that it inherits
13

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.700
from base entity, creates person, and we're
saying that hey, it's a MappedSuperclass. Other
14

15
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.479
things are going to  inherit from it.So the
owner does inherit from this class.
15

16
00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.110
That's why we set things up. Now we do
have another JPA mapping there on line 30.
16

17
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.460
That is the column annotation.
This sets up the the naming
17

18
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
convention for the database column, so
this says, this is what we're going to
18

19
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.689
expect the database columns to be.
Then line 31, not empty. This is a
19

20
00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
validation constraint. I'm not going to
implement the validation constraints at
20

21
00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.549
this time. So important note there, if
you're following along with these Spring
21

22
00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.850
stuff, there's a whole section on the
course on validation. I think if my
22

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.180
memory serves me right, it's right after
this section. We're going to get into
23

24
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.229
implementing it there so I'm going to skip
over any validation constraints at this
24

25
00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.360
point in time. In this section, we were
focusing specifically on JPA mappings. So
25

26
00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.300
I'm going to jump over to IntelliJ.
We can see that we have Owner up. An
26

27
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.340
owner extends out person so I'm going to
just do command click and draw in the
27

28
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.430
person and we can see that person
implements base entity. This is a Mapped
28

29
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.160
Superclass, and just like that, we also
want to put that annotation on our
29

30
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.440
Person class because the way we are
setting things up, we'll never actually
30

31
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.410
work with a Person POJO per se. We're
going to be extending out from that. Now
31

32
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.170
there's a couple other things that we
want to do here is, we can use the JPA
32

33
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.310
annotation for column.
33

34
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.730
Let's give this a name.
34

35
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.500
It's important here. I don't think I've
used Column annotation
35

36
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
yet in the class. You might be a... you
did use this before with the other
36

37
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.070
JPA mappings that we did. Now by default
Hibernate, there's different naming
37

38
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.790
strategies that we can use. I was
allowing Hibernate to do the database
38

39
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.209
mappings before and figure it out. So by
default, Hibernate is going to snake case.
39

40
00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.780
This first capital N for name, that's
called camel case, and then using an
40

41
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.980
underscore between keywords, so first
underscore name, that is called snake
41

42
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.600
case. Hibernate, by default, is going to
be doing that anyway so being a little
42

43
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.430
bit redundant but we're being explicit
and I wanted to introduce that here to
43

44
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.300
show you guys in another annotation. So
let's come back over to Owner. Now Owner,
44

45
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.940
we're going to declare that as an entity.
You can see there, I've brought
45

46
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.040
in the javax.persistence entity. It's
on the JPA specification. Now I can also
46

47
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.370
do a table. That's also out of 
javax.persistence.And now this table here, I
47

48
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.290
can do name and I want to say owners
like so, so that sets up in the owner
48

49
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.970
table as owners inside the database. Now
let's go ahead and declare column names
49

50
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.180
for our properties here so I'll do at...
50

51
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.280
You can see, I'm just going through
naming these columns.
51

52
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.379
This is setting up what will be
the database name.
52

53
00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.020
Now we get into pets. Pets is a little
more. We have to set up some mapping
53

54
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.419
there as well and this is where we set
up a relationship mapping. So here, what
54

55
00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.740
we want to do is say a one-to-many.
55

56
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.120
So that's setting up that we're going to
have many pets here. I'm going to
56

57
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.170
setup a cascade.
57

58
00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.479
Though the setting up some of the
mapping properties. So CascadeType, when
58

59
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.539
I delete something here, if I delete an
owner, then that is going to cascade down.
59

60
00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.650
So if I have pets and I delete the owner
of the pet, the pets will also get
60

61
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.800
deleted, so that's what we want to be
setting up here. This completes the
61

62
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.060
mapping for the Owner entity. But now,
we need to need to go through and
62

63
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.360
address the other entities as well, so if
we come in and let's take a look at Pet.
63

64
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.619
Now the Pet also becomes
an entity. Let's give him a
64

65
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.169
table
and we'll call that pets.
65

66
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.819
Now let's do a ColumnName here.
Name equals name.
66

67
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.110
And now, you can see here how we have an
Owner owner here on line 21. This relates
67

68
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.099
back to this mapping. So we're saying
this set here, it's going to be mapped by
68

69
00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.810
owner so it's being mapped by this owner
property. In this case, it's going to
69

70
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.409
be a many-to-one.
70

71
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.490
And now, we're setting up a joint
column. That tells Hibernate basically
71

72
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.600
our JPA how to do the mapping and how
these two entities are going to be
72

73
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.770
related at the database level so we're
expecting at the database level that we
73

74
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.900
will have an owner ID property on the
pet record. Now we also have the
74

75
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.790
birthdate here. Let's go ahead and
complete that.
75

76
00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.560
Then lastly, we also have PetType,
that's going to be another entity that
76

77
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.740
we need to map here. That's going to be a
many to one.
77

78
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.370
We also need to specify JoinColumn for this.
78

79
00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.210
So now, we're going to set that up as a
type_id.
79

80
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.840
We also had to set up PetType so
let's come over here to PetType.
80

81
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.520
This is going to get annotated with
Entity.
81

82
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.730
We'll give it a table name as well.
82

83
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.770
I'm going to be consistent with
what the Spring Pet Clinic has done and
83

84
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.150
they just called this types.
84

85
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:38.430
Let's go through and review what 
we did here. So Person. Person, which is
85

86
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.070
the mapped superclass, we added in the MappedSuperclass annotation. Provided column
86

87
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.350
names for that and then we came back
over here to Owner, which inherits from
87

88
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:54.390
Person. We made Owner an Entity,
saying that it's going to be a JPA
88

89
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.100
entity mapped to the table of owners. We
set up column mappings. You can see there
89

90
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.340
for address, city, and telephone, we set up
column mappings, and then on line 23, we
90

91
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.740
set up a one-to-many relationship, saying
that this owner every owner can have
91

92
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:17.509
multiple pets, and then we went into pets.
Pets is now going to be a JPA entity
92

93
00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:22.520
as well. Table name of pets, we set up the
column names there. You can see there at
93

94
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.479
line 13, we set up for the property name.
It goes to the column name of name, and
94

95
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:33.860
then, we set up also relationships to PetType. This is going to have a PetType,
95

96
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.260
a singular petType and mapped by the
join column of type ID, type underscore
96

97
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.020
ID, and then also similar relationship to
owners, so every pet is going to have an
97

98
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.420
owner and we're going to map by owner ID.
Then finally, on line 24 there, you
98

99
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.470
can see that we set up a name for the
column name of birthdate for the
99

100
00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:01.250
property birthdate. And then finally, our
last entity here for pet type, we set the
100

101
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.990
PetType up as an Entity and then
created the table types. We're saying
101

102
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.130
that types there. Then on line 14, we
can see that we're giving a column name
102

103
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:15.320
of name to the property name. Overall, we
have three entities that we defined even
103

104
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.070
though we modified four classes. You can
see there, we've modified four classes in
104

105
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.839
this video, but three of them are going
to be entities. We will have owners table,
105

106
00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:29.360
a pets table, and a types table created
in our database when we move forward
106

107
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.750
with this. At this time, I'm going to
consider this issue done because we
107

108
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.990
completed the mappings for the Owner
entity, which is the objective here. So
108

109
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.100
this is issue number 36. Right now, I'm
not going to bring this up and test it.
109

110
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.120
I'm going to convert over the other
entities as well. It's a chance error
110

111
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.690
if I ran it right now, something would it
be unhappy. I would not be surprised
111

112
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.770
if something blew up but we are in the
process of doing the JPA mapping. Once
112

113
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.670
we get it all done, we will go and check
for errors.
113

114
00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:04.040
I'm going to come in here
commit the directory and that was issue
114

115
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.640
36.
115

116
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.420
This will close out number six. I'm
going to come
116

117
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.089
push it up to GitHub, which will close
out that issue.
