00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.480
Alright in this course all the source
code examples are tracked inside of
1

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.080
GitHub. Now I get a lot of different
skill levels who are taking this course
2

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.520
my students are from a variety of
different backgrounds some of you are
3

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
just starting your programming careers
well others of you are experienced
4

5
00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.310
developers and developing or expanding out
on your skills. Now if you are
5

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
experienced with git and GitHub and
you're comfortable using these tools go
6

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.870
ahead and skip this video. This is going
to be redundant for you if you already
7

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.239
know this however if you are not
comfortable using GitHub go ahead and
8

9
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
please continue with this video there's
a lot of great information in it. So GitHub is
9

10
00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.760
a website built around the source
control software git. Git is a software
10

11
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
which allows for the
incremental tracking of changes made to
11

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.629
source code. Git is formally defined as a
distributed version control system. Now
12

13
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.879
as you work through this course I feel it
is important for you to have accurate
13

14
00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.840
and complete source code examples to
work from and this is exactly why I'm
14

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.580
using GitHub. In this course you will
have complete access to working source
15

16
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.340
code examples but GitHub is more than
just source control, GitHub has a lot of
16

17
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.689
social aspects, these aspects allow developers to easily collaborate
17

18
00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.509
together. The same aspects makes Github
highly popular for use on open source
18

19
00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.520
development teams, for example all Spring
Framework projects are tracked inside a
19

20
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.930
GitHub. You can head over to GitHub for
the spring framework source code and see
20

21
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.430
exactly how the team is using it to
manage a large-scale project with
21

22
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.689
hundreds of developers from all over the
world so it's important for you to be
22

23
00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.530
proficient in using GitHub now I want
to point out that GitHub is completely
23

24
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.759
free to use the git client is completely
free so there's no cost involved for you
24

25
00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.630
to help you get up to speed on using
GitHub I'm going to share several
25

26
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.790
resources with you. You can find these
links in the course resources these
26

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.789
links are videos created by
the company behind GitHub. The first is a
27

28
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.860
short video called what is GitHub. This
video explains to you
28

29
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.650
the concepts behind GitHub and how it's
used for social coding these are the
29

30
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.030
aspects that make it so popular with
large development teams, these features
30

31
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.750
are important because I will be using
GitHub in the course to share source
31

32
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.510
examples with you and we can leverage
these social features to help support
32

33
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.740
you in this course. For example let's say
you have a problem you can't resolve I
33

34
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.930
may ask you to share your project with
me on GitHub then I will go in and fork
34

35
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.270
your project to my repository on GitHub,
this allows me to download the code from
35

36
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.160
my repository to my machine, now I get
your entire project just not some code
36

37
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.000
So I can see exactly what
you're seeing then I can run the code
37

38
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.630
I'll find the problem fix it I can bring
it up in the debugger or whatever then
38

39
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.340
I'll check in my changes of the fork
that I created from your project and
39

40
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.810
then using GitHub I will send you a pull
request with an explanation of what I
40

41
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.270
fixed. You can then emerge in that pull
request of your git repository and see
41

42
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.200
exactly what I change now this is really
important because you get full
42

43
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.910
visibility of changes that I made to
your code to fix it. The next thing I'm
43

44
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.580
going to share with you and the course
resources is a playlist on YouTube this
44

45
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.180
playlist is a series of videos also
produced by the people at GitHub and
45

46
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.130
it's going to walk you through different
features inside of git and GitHub of how
46

47
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.450
to check in, check out the code and
check it back in, there's a lot of great
47

48
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.430
information in these videos so even if
you're not familiar with using git or if
48

49
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.870
you're just somewhat new to git and
don't fully know it I highly suggest you
49

50
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.690
take the time to watch these videos
because there's a lot of really great
50

51
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.260
information in these videos and it's
going to help you expand your knowledge
51

52
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.459
of this very important tool that's used
by developers all over world called git
52

53
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.090
and GitHub.
