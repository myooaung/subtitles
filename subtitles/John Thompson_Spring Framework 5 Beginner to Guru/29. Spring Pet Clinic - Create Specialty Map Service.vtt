00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.670
In this video, we are going to go ahead
and implement the specialty map service.
1

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.799
Specialty is a attribute of Vets.
We'll go ahead and implement that.
2

3
00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.330
This is number 31. I'm going to toggle
over to IntelliJ and start working on
3

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.030
that now.
The first thing that we want to do,
4

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.450
it's going to be a lot like the vet
service. We're going to implement our
5

6
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.189
basic CRUD service. The first thing we
want to do is come in and create a new
6

7
00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.180
service for
7

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.940
Specialties.
8

9
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.010
It's going to stand out our CRUD service
and that's going to be
9

10
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.519
Specialty.
10

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.399
The primary key of Long or the ID value.
11

12
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.960
We need to make an interface, of
course. That provides that. Now we want
12

13
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.040
to come in and let's see here. Let's take
a look at the VetServiceMap. I'm going
13

14
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.759
to split this. It's a handy trick to
do when you have something that's fairly
14

15
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.149
cookie cutter. You can split it out.
I'm going to go through and just kind
15

16
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.479
of use the other one to cheat from, so
I'm going to say new Java class.
16

17
00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.979
Now I can say that it's going to
extend the
17

18
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.060
AbstractMapService. This is getting
to be a Specialty
18

19
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.930
Long and it will
19

20
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.930
implement our SpecialtiesService,
like so. Now you can see
20

21
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.660
that I'm getting a red squiggly there.
I'm going to hit command N on the Mac.
21

22
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.429
I'm just going to say implement methods. 
That tells me all the methods is
22

23
00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.140
going to implement. You can see
IntelliJ guesses a little bit wrong as
23

24
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
far as the types even though we're using
generics up here. It's not going to get them
24

25
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.990
quite right for us, but I have my handy
cheat sheet right below me here. So what
25

26
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.660
I want to do is this is going to be a
Set Specialty that's going to return
26

27
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.634
back super,
27

28
00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.070
findAll(),
28

29
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.086
like so. So that would be happy.
29

30
00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:38.250
Now this is
also going to return back a Specialty
30

31
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.640
here.
31

32
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.610
The ID value is going to be a Long.
32

33
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.490
In this case, I want to
super,
33

34
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.940
findById()
34

35
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.010
like so. You can see how
I'm implementing each one of these. So
35

36
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.520
now, I'm going to take in a Specialty. Return
back a Specialty. In this case, I'm going to do
36

37
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.070
super.save in that object.
37

38
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.920
We have the delete by the object.
It's going to take in that and then we
38

39
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.030
will say super
39

40
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.610
object.
It's also going to take in a 
Long
40

41
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.030
this time, so we have two delete methods.
This one's going to take in a Long.
41

42
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.750
You can see up here on line 30, I got
a little mess up in the formatting, so I
42

43
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.040
do command option L. Let's see that that
is the command to reformat things so
43

44
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.040
that has done that. This is really
easy to forget. I did not mark this as a
44

45
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.560
service yet. So now that it's marked as a
service, this is going to be
45

46
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.989
available to the Spring Context.
Just to recap, I'm going to close that.
46

47
00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.329
We implemented that SpecialtiesService.
This extends out. It looks like I
47

48
00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.790
have a typo there, so let me refactor
that. See I have a typo there, so I'm
48

49
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.610
going to come in and do a refactor
rename
49

50
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.909
SpecialtiesService. Hopefully I spelled it
right this time. There we go. My
50

51
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.249
squiggly went away. That is happy,
so now i refactored that and so that's
51

52
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.329
the interface. That interface extends out
our CrudService so that gives us our
52

53
00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:56.449
standard CRUD operations. CRUD again
is Create Read Update and Delete.
53

54
00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.689
That's exactly what we're doing here
with this interface. We are setting up a
54

55
00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.499
standard set of methods, and then we
provided an implementation of that using
55

56
00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:11.449
our map service. Remember, we extend
out our AbstractMapService. Kind of a
56

57
00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.770
common object and we're using our hash
map here
57

58
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.629
to provide this implementation.
We're using Java generics or
58

59
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.660
Specialty Long and then we implement
our interface for the SpecialtiesService.
59

60
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.590
So that completes that. Let's come
over here. That was number 31, so I'm
60

61
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:38.139
going to go ahead and close out number
31. I'd say Git.
61

62
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.270
I cannot spell Specialties
today.
62

63
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:03.110
Try that one more time. That was
number 31.
63

64
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.760
Number 31, like so. Now go ahead and
commit this and push that up to GitHub.
64

65
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.500
You see that is pushing. We'll toggle
over to Chrome and this will switch over
65

66
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.400
to close once it goes up there, so
that completes that task.
