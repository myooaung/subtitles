00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.639
Alright! In this video, we are gonna look
at adding in the data model, that we're
1

2
00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.620
gonna be working with the Spring
WebFlux. I've missed one dependency there,
2

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.830
projectlombok. I do know I have to be
writing like getters and setters and
3

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.439
stuff. So, I'm line 34, I've gone in and
added it in to the Gradle build script.
4

5
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.750
And also, one other thing that I did, when
I committed this project, I set up the
5

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.530
CircleCI build, and now, we can see over
here, now we are building the project on
6

7
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.719
CircleCI. It'll pick up the branches
as I add them and got the initial
7

8
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.570
commit into GitHub. You can see that, I
set up a README and that's the CircleCI
8

9
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.670
build badge. And I'm trying out this in
badge for downloads. I'm curious if that
9

10
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.050
will change or not. But right now, it has
not changed. But we'll see if that
10

11
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.780
changes. It's a badge. I just tried it
out with GitHub. So, let's jump over to
11

12
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.040
IntelliJ and let's go in. So, we can see
we just have this one. Let's go in and
12

13
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.360
create a Package.
13

14
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.410
I'm just gonna call it domain, and
let's be consistent with what we were
14

15
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.200
working with. And I am gonna create a
new Java class. Just call it Category.
15

16
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460
Say Yes.
16

17
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.829
Just a reminder, for MongoDB, the entities
JPA Entities are referred to as documents.
17

18
00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.750
Let's come over here.
18

19
00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.500
We're not gonna need anything too
complex here.
19

20
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.450
And we'll annotate that with the Id
property, and you can see that, this sets
20

21
00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.140
up a project called  MongoDB
entity called, Category. And we've marked
21

22
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.320
it with the @Data annotation for Project
Lombok, which will give us all the
22

23
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.460
getters and setters and equals and
hashcode and a toString method, if I
23

24
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.560
remember correctly. And then, the next
thing we wanna do is set up repository.
24

25
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.400
Let's go and create a New Package
for that as well.
25

26
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.430
So, creating a new package called
repository and will create a 
26

27
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.390
CategoryRepository.
27

28
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.240
In here, what we wanna do is extend
out the ReactiveMongoRepository. Now,
28

29
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.810
it's gonna give us the reactive types
to work with. Wanna make sure that we
29

30
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.749
get the Category.
The id as a String.
30

31
00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.690
And I made one mistake. This should be
an interface
31

32
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.220
that's why that was not happy. So, let's
take a look at the ReactiveMongoRepository.
32

33
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.890
And you can see that this
looks a lot like the regular Mongo
33

34
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.110
Repositories. But now, it extends out the
ReactiveSortingRepository, 
34

35
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.000
ReactiveQueryByExampleExecutor so it gives us
some additional properties. But, you can
35

36
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.030
see that it's going to give us back
reactive types. So let's take a look at
36

37
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.710
what's implemented here, as well. So we do
a findAll there. Extends out to over
37

38
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.690
ReactiveCrud up. So we get all these here,
and these different properties, that are
38

39
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.160
gonna be implemented. And this is a
usual Spring Data stuff, that we've seen
39

40
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.870
throughout the course. But now, it gives
us extensions for the reactive types and
40

41
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.760
we're gonna be using those with the
the Spring WebFlux as we develop our
41

42
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.420
RESTful API.
