00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.620
In this video I'm gonna to show you how to document a query parameter which is different than a path

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.950
parameter.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.220
So this is a path parameter with it's a go and add example of a query parameter.

4
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:21.230
So these are going to be your URL encoded parameters that gets set up at the end of your your l string.

5
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.570
So I am going to set up a example here in our control.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.430
It really isn't taking any parameters and but fortunately we have some flexibility there so I can say

7
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.920
pram.

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:44.380
I must say it is called so we're going to be asking for a cold beer from the API.

9
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.010
So this is just hypothetical.

10
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.990
The API itself does not take it on the parameter but if we pass along query parameters that even aren't

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.200
defined for the controller.

12
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.700
Controller is just going to ignore them.

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.000
But so I'm going through this as an exercise and documentation just to show you this functionality.

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.750
So the syntax can get a little confusing when we start expanding this out.

15
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
So I'm going to do a little change here.

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.430
So now what we want to do is

17
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.930
we can say request parameters and this is going to be the same parameter with name and we get it and

18
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.880
say is cold like so that description

19
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.550
so I'm adding a little description there.

20
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.310
So when you start adding in multiple things like this the syntax can get a little tricky so keep an

21
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.910
eye on that.

22
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.460
So now I'm just gonna go ahead and run this testing and make sure that we do run properly.

23
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.400
So we do get a green test back.

24
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.710
So everything ran good.

25
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.030
And this documentation would be generated and in the testing.

26
00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.770
So this is just an example is called does not exist on this controller but this is an example because

27
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.250
I know you'll have use cases where you do want to be documenting not only path parameters but your request

28
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.380
parameters so your query parameters that get passed in at the end of the year are also very very important

29
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.830
piece of documentation to add and then you can see that I've added and little trying to get the syntax

30
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.560
indented properly so it's a little more readable.
