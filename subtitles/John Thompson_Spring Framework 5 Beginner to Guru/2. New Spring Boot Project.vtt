00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.280
In this section of the course, where
we're getting into Spring WebFlux and
1

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.780
creating RESTful web services using WebFlux, I'm gonna create a brand new
2

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.160
project. And I'm gonna go through and use
start.spring.io and if you have been
3

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.900
watching Josh Long at all, you know that
is his favorite the URL in the world.
4

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.380
I am going to do it right through
IntelliJ. I'm sure you've seen me do it
5

6
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.210
before, but let's come in here, create a
New Project. I'm gonna use Spring
6

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.060
Initializr.
7

8
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.150
guru.springframework
8

9
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.630
And just for fun, let's do
a Gradle project.
9

10
00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:01.440
Java 8, Packaging Jar is fine.
spring5-webflux-rest that is all good.
10

11
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.290
So now here, we wanna come over here
and change it to, right now, we are on
11

12
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.190
Spring Boot milestone 7. Things are
rapidly progressing, and of course, I will
12

13
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.350
update this as we go.
Okay, so let's go over to web and we want
13

14
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.560
Reactive Web. So, keep things interesting.
And to go full select reactive, I am
14

15
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.079
going to do the Reactive MongoDB. 
We'll bring in the Embedded MongoDB, as
15

16
00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.240
well. And I think that will give us
everything that we need. So, I'm gonna
16

17
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.340
say Next. In the project location, we
actually
17

18
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.689
right here.
18

19
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.729
Just double-checking my Module name,
spring5-webflux, spring5-webflux,
19

20
00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.679
So, you can see my directory here,
courses/spring5/spring5-webflux.
20

21
00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.009
Just double-checking all that, before I
click Finish and get in trouble.
21

22
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.970
That just asked me to import from Gradle
22

23
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.180
and Enable Auto-Import there, so it
doesn't keep bothering us every time we
23

24
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.320
make a change. You can see that IntelliJ
is going through and indexing the
24

25
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.920
project. Let's go ahead and take a look.
You can see that, this is highlighted as
25

26
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.540
red because that directory, that I did
set it up in, I did already initialize
26

27
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.069
git in there. So, IntelliJ picked that up
right away.
27

28
00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.700
You can see that that's just a stub of a
project. Still red because IntelliJ is
28

29
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
still indexing the project that we have
a Spring Boot Application. So, that's just
29

30
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.560
a simple stub of the project. We have an
empty application.properties and a
30

31
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.620
single test.
So, nothing too exciting there, and let's
31

32
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.260
take a look at the build.gradle file.
You can see that we are on M7 because of
32

33
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
that we are bringing in the snapshot and
milestone directories for the Spring
33

34
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.650
components because they are not
generally available yet. So, this is set
34

35
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.740
up to sourceCompatibility. Again, I'm
recording this in December of 2017. So
35

36
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.510
for right now, just definitely stay on
Java 1.8. A lot of the Spring is
36

37
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.610
pretty good, but a lot of stuff around
Spring is still catching up to Java 1.9.
37

38
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.490
I'm excited to use Java 1.9 but the
community needs to catch up. And we can see
38

39
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.620
that we have the mongodb-reactive,
starter-webflux, a starter-test, the
39

40
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.430
embedded-mongo, which can be used
for testing, and projectreactor.
40

41
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.459
The important one here is we're bringing
in the Spring starter-data-mongodb. So,
41

42
00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.359
that's gonna give a Spring Data
MongoDB, as well as the Mongo
42

43
00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.189
Reactive Database driver, so it gives us
all that goodness. So, I'm going to get
43

44
00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:55.260
this all checked in and committed into
GitHub, and we will start building the
44

45
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.519
project in the next video.
