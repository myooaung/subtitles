00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.580
This video, I'm going to go ahead and show you how to create a custom banner, so let's show you what

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.080
we are talking about when we say create a custom banner, something that you'd like to do, especially

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.610
if you're working on a company or something when we start the application up.

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.280
I'm just clicking on the Green Arrow there to to start up the spring board application and let's expand

5
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.460
this up a little bit on the banner that we're talking about.

6
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.350
Is this right here?

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.910
So we can see it just a spring and and some fancy ASCII art on it.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.900
Now, this is something that we can easily customize for our use.

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.300
Look, like I worked at a company called Velho Payments, so we'd replace that with development.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.430
So see that on startup.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.310
So just a nice little customization that we can do for our spring applications to see that in the log.

12
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.340
Now what we can do is go ahead and customize that.

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.970
I'm going to toggle over to Chrome right now and I just picked a random ASCII art generator.

14
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.110
And this one here, I'm going to say Petr Jaquet Dotcom, you can see that you are all there.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.280
And I just kind of randomly found this through a Google search.

16
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.970
But you can see there's a bunch of different fonts that we can apply.

17
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.370
And I don't like that one.

18
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.750
We'll go and see how it looks and we'll go back to the first one I had there, you can really get lost

19
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.790
down a rabbit hole with this.

20
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.040
So this is the ASCII art that I want to go ahead and create for my banner.

21
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.740
And what I can do is I can just come in here.

22
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.910
Looks like there's select and copy.

23
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.310
So hopefully that copied it to the clipboard seeing this button down at the bottom screen.

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.760
So now what I can do is jump back over to intelligent and very simply to change the banner or to create

25
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.030
a custom banner under resources.

26
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.270
I just want to come in here.

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.450
I'm going to create a new file and we'll call that.

28
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.210
Banner, dot text.

29
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.080
OK, so.

30
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.290
And we'll add this into GitHub now, I'm just going to go ahead and paste in this text so you can see

31
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.420
here this has been pasted in and I'm going to come in here and click this little restart.

32
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.720
And by default, Spring Boot is looking for a file called Bernadotte Text doesn't find it.

33
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.910
Then it goes back to the default.

34
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.640
So you see here now I'm getting spring framework Guro to be displayed as my custom banner.

35
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.890
So a lot of flexibility here as to how we do that.

36
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.670
And as far as the implementation, just one of those little nice things that we can do with spring spring

37
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.640
boot for that start up text.

38
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:55.190
Again, what I did just a recap, came over here to a text site and there are like hundreds of different

39
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.370
fonts and things that you can select to work with.

40
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.350
Grab a text from this site and jump back over to ontology and other resources.

41
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.520
I created a file called Banner Dot Text.

42
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.170
That is the default file that spring board is going to look for for a custom banner.

43
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.120
And now you can see that I am.

44
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.860
In fact, when we start the application, I get that custom banner scrolling by.

45
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.000
We come back over to Chrome and I did create a ticket for this in our repository.

46
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.350
So create custom banner.

47
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.490
That's issue number six.

48
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.190
And I'll commit this the change that we did in this video against issue number six as well as it will

49
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.500
be on its own branch, for your reference.
