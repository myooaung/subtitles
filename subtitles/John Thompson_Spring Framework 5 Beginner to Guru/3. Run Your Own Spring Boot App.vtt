<v ->Now of course when we're building our image</v>
1

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:07.808
we're going to need to inject a JAR file
2

3
00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:09.548
that's been created by Spring Boot.
3

4
00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:10.473
The nice thing about Spring Boot
4

5
00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:13.769
it does give us an executable JAR to execute.
5

6
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.992
And I have a very simple web application
6

7
00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:19.264
that has a simple H2 in-memory database
7

8
00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:20.690
so nothing sexy here.
8

9
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.850
I wanted to give you a quick code review of this
9

10
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.123
and we'll run the application
10

11
00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:28.523
just to see it running inside the IDE.
11

12
00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:30.368
And get the build process.
12

13
00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:31.490
And I'll show you the build artifact
13

14
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.011
that we want to deploy
14

15
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:35.325
into our Docker container.
15

16
00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.048
So this is a very common process
16

17
00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:40.506
but I'd want to give you a quick overview
17

18
00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.817
of what we're gonna be running
18

19
00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:43.777
inside the Docker container first.

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:46.694
