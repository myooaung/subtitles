Hey folks! My name is John Thompson. I am
a Java developer primarily specializing
1

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280
in the Spring Framework. I've been doing it
for over a decade. I've been in IT for
2

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.330
coming up on 25 years now which is kind
of a scary thought that I've been doing
3

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.900
the stuff for that long. I actually
started in the industry as an intern
4

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.529
doing training documentation for a
software company that did warehouse
5

6
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.000
management systems. And that was
quite some time ago. My work with that
6

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
company went into project management. I did a
lot of system architecture and design
7

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.000
work. And along my career, I became more
and more technical and started focusing
8

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.500
on being a strictly a Java developer. It's over a decade ago. Today, my primary
9

10
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.940
income is from doing consulting and
working with clients. I am a freelance
10

11
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
Java developer. I've been doing that for a
while now and it goes quite well for me.
11

12
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.280
I enjoy the lifestyle and the
flexibility it also gives me a chance to
12

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.840
see a lot of new and challenging stuff. The clients that I work with are
13

14
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
doing a lot of high-volume stuff. A lot
of very interesting stuff, really just
14

15
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.490
the sweet spot for the Spring
Framework when you start getting into
15

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.020
large transactional processing and
things that really have scale. So that's
16

17
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.509
kind of the niche that I've been working
in lately. My personal life, I'm a
17

18
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.409
triathlete. So I do a lot of training. Let's
see here, I'm recording this in actually
18

19
00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.170
April 1st 2017 and just getting ready
for triathlon season. So I got my first
19

20
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.240
triathlon coming up here in another
couple weeks. Saint Anthony's triathlon.
20

21
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.290
I'm actually thinking about doing another
half ironman this year, see if I can pull
21

22
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.840
that off. Maybe that's a little too much. So when I'm not doing coding and course
22

23
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.399
content creation, I'm running or cycling
or swimming or something like that or
23

24
00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.159
just heading out downtown St.
Pete with my friends. So a lot of great
24

25
00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.540
content in this course ahead. I really try
to work in a lot of my experience into
25

26
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.069
it, not to show you just the mechanics but
also my experience from using actually
26

27
00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.330
using these technologies out of the
field. So you
27

28
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.430
you can get a feel for that and leverage
my experience from what I've done out in
28

29
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.400
the field. So I really hope you enjoy the
content ahead of you.
