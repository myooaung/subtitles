00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.330
In this video I have an assignment for you and that is to add rest to a project.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.200
So when I'm going to do is I'm going to give you a air quotes micro services project.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.650
Actually if you'd been taking my micro services course you've seen this project before but this is a

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.550
separate repository altogether just snapped on the branches.

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.840
This is gonna be perfect for our needs and that's so it's a very simple project with some controllers

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.070
that really no back end on it.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.630
So it's just controllers.

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.990
We got controller tests done.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.850
So the mark MVC stuff is already there and we have a couple of controllers to work with.

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.000
We have POA Joes and the poachers do have constraints on them.

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.990
So we have just about everything that we need and want to to go through the opportunity to actually

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.400
go through all the steps that we learned in this section of the course go out there configure maven

13
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.750
for the rest of it's bringing the dependencies bring in the necessary build plugins.

14
00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.100
Add in that template that is going to be used by ASCII Doctor configure the test so the tests including

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.760
constraints.

16
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.470
Remember we had a whole video on documenting how to do a constraint so add that.

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.390
Also remember we used the Maven resources plug in to add new docs in the static documentation to Spring

18
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.690
Boot.

19
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.230
So go ahead and do that.

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.470
Now this is kind of a large assignment.

21
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.140
So rather than do everything live code I'm going to go through a code review and this repository I'm

22
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.290
going to check my code in on a separate branch so the master branch of this project that you'll find

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.640
in the course resources that is going to be the project without any the rest Doc stuff in it and then

24
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.580
I'm going to complete the assignment and do that on a branch.

25
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.470
So you'll be able to go and do a different branches and see everything but we'll also go through a code

26
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.300
review in the next video of what was changed so it'll be a little bit quick and we'll rehash things

27
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.060
too much.

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.260
Really a cookie cutter from what we did.

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.480
But I'll give you a chance to apply what you've learned and also see any changes in deltas of what I

30
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.080
do.

31
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.870
So probably a good idea to go ahead and form this repository your own repo then work on it from there

32
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.450
and then you will have the capabilities to duffs to my repository to see what was different so if you

33
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.460
run into any problems if you forget a step or something and start working you'll be able to do a different

34
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.420
see what is different.

35
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.590
So again in the next video we will have a complete code review of what this assignment is all about.
