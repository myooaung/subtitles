(instrument strumming)
1

2
00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.004
Alright, let's talk about Multipart Uploads.
2

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.597
So, multipart uploads are what we use to load up the images.
3

4
00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:15.340
And right now I spent about 4 hours playing
4

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.170
with the reactive stuff and was not able to get it going.
5

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.654
And I think this is because it's not fully baked.
6

7
00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.635
And it may be just a knowledge gap on my part,
7

8
00:00:23.635 --> 00:00:25.773
but I was not able to get it going
8

9
00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:27.705
with this version of Spring 5.
9

10
00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.039
I expected somethings that's gonna mature
10

11
00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.344
and I'm gonna keep this on the short list.
11

12
00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:34.026
I will complete this video,
12

13
00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.791
but I'm gonna wait for this area of Spring 5
13

14
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.533
to mature a little bit more.
14

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.104
But at this point we do have most of the functionality
15

16
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:44.984
of a web application, reimplemented in the WebFlux model,
16

17
00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:48.239
so pretty stoked about that for the most part.
17

18
00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.836
I did run into a couple of nuances there
18

19
00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:51.764
but for the most part our web application
19

20
00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:54.853
is now fully running on the WebFlux,
20

21
00:00:54.853 --> 00:00:57.372
so we converted over from the Servlet model
21

22
00:00:57.372 --> 00:01:00.778
over to the WebFlux model and overall it's pretty painless
22

23
00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:03.404
but the multipart upload for images,
23

24
00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:05.072
I was not able to get working like I said,
24

25
00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:06.889
I spent about four or five hours on it.
25

26
00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:08.869
No luck and I expect that this is something
26

27
00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.839
that's gonna mature and I will get this video replaced
27

28
00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:16.006
as soon as possible, so definitely something coming soon.
