00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.870
Alright, in this section of course we
are going to take a look at setting up
1

2
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.130
project Lombok. Now if you've already
used this project Lombok in your
2

3
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.210
previous projects, go ahead and skip
ahead to the next section of the course.
3

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.800
But in this section, we are going to be
taking a closer look at project Lombok.
4

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.050
What this is, one of the large criticism, a long time standing criticism of Java
5

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.450
as a programming languages, you have to
go through a lot of serial mono encoding.
6

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.010
Just look at the properties like getters
and setters for example. If you look at a
7

8
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.270
language like Groovy, you automatically
get getters and setters provided for you
8

9
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.579
by default under the covers. And if you
specify one it overrides it. Not so with
9

10
00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.129
Java. You do have to actually write out
those get getters and setters and if you
10

11
00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.190
look at modern IDEs, you have quick
shortcuts and if you're using IntelliJ
11

12
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
or even Eclipse, you probably have those
shortcuts memorized to automatically add
12

13
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
in things like getters and setters and
constructors and things like that. What
13

14
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.570
project Lombok brings to the table is
very simplified annotations to add in
14

15
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.509
common things like getters and setters,
builders, loggers and a lot more. So it
15

16
00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.570
really does simplify your
development. It cuts down a lot of the
16

17
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.549
boilerplate code that you have to write
and it makes your life easier and makes
17

18
00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.079
you more productive. So in this section
we are going to step through talk about
18

19
00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
the features of project Lombok, how it
works, how you set it up and how we can
19

20
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.380
utilize it in our recipe project.
