00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.880
Okay, I want to talk to you about the
importance of forking an application
1

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.290
inside of GitHub. Now there's a couple of things that we can do here and the main
2

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.850
reason I want you to consider forking
the source code as you work through my
3

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.400
courses, is because it will get a copy of
the source code over to your repository
4

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.710
and then that builds up some history in
your repository and it's something that
5

6
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
you can share with a potential employer. So it gives you a chance to show a
6

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.440
source code that you did in the project. So as you work through I highly
7

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
recommend going through and forking the
repository and checking in your
8

9
00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.360
assignments and whatnot as you work
through the course. So that this will
9

10
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
build up a history of your software
development activity inside of GitHub
10

11
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.780
and then later when you're going for a
position with the Spring framework, this
11

12
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
is something that you can use to show a
prospective employer that you have been
12

13
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.579
working with the Spring framework and
show off some of the projects that
13

14
00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.810
you've built along the way in my courses. So I'm going to step through and show you
14

15
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.070
exactly how to do it. So I have up in in
Chrome here the recipe application, the
15

16
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.170
spring5 recipe app and what you want
to do is take this URL copy it over and
16

17
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
this URL is going to be in the course
notes as well and I'm going to come over
17

18
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.729
here and this is a different GitHub
account. So I've got two GitHub accounts.
18

19
00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.540
One is my Spring Framework guru account
and then I have an old personal GitHub
19

20
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.540
account. So what I want to do is come
into here and now come up here and fork
20

21
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.060
my own copy and we can see it's going to
take just a couple minutes for GitHub to
21

22
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.700
go out and create that copy. Now this is
a complete copy of that project that
22

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.149
I've been working on and you've been
working on. So we created that a little
23

24
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.920
bit ago in the course and you can see
that it is a full copy. So right now we
24

25
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000
only have one additional branch in there
and we will be building that out through
25

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.840
the application as we go through the
course. So when you do this, this
26

27
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.560
repository is going to have a lot more
in it, a lot more branches that we can
27

28
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.800
work with. But when you fork it,
you're going to get a copy
28

29
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.240
every branch in that and so you'll be
able to switch through and see the
29

30
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.830
changes from one branch to another. You
also will be able to work with that as well
30

31
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.570
and you'll be able to do divs and
things like that inside of GitHub and
31

32
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.680
see any changes in it and any deletes between
the branches as you progress through the
32

33
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.940
course. Now one other thing that you may
want to do and this is an optional step
33

34
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.890
and I will include these links. So this
is directions up on GitHub right at the
34

35
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.930
top here depending on your operating
systems. Mac, Windows or Linux. I am on the
35

36
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.630
Mac tab, it defaulted to that for me and
it's got directions about working out
36

37
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.730
the repository and I just showed you
exactly how to do that but if you want
37

38
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.920
to sync that to get any changes that I
make, now I will be going in and updating
38

39
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.170
the Spring versions on the branches as
things get releases. As major releases to
39

40
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.790
get that make sure that things are
working with later versions of Spring. So
40

41
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.350
I may go in and update that and make
minor changes that aren't going to
41

42
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.490
impact the flow of the course. If you
want to bring those changes down and
42

43
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.440
this is kind of important stuff
here is. It does show you how to create a
43

44
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.980
local clone but down here on step 3, it
starts talking about how to set up that
44

45
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.700
sync. And what you want to do here, you
can see if we do a git remote -v and I
45

46
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.280
believe that stands for view, it's going
to show you the origin and what we want
46

47
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.910
to do is add in another remote. So and
this is going to call it upstream . So if
47

48
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.750
you do get remote add upstream and then
this area here would be the URL for my
48

49
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:08.010
original git repository. Now you can see
yours is going to be the origin and my
49

50
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.840
original repository will be an upstream
repository. So that creates the
50

51
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.359
links to them and then the second link
that we need to look to is just syncing
51

52
00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.490
a fork and I have that already opened up
in another tab. And what we want to do is
52

53
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.500
do a git fetch upstream. And then number five we're going to
53

54
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.270
merge upstream master or whatever
happened, whatever branch we want to be
54

55
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.700
on to any of your local branches. So this
is a way for you to bring down and merge
55

56
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.290
in any changes that I have made since
you started the course. Ever since you
56

57
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.650
created the fork. Tips here, the second
step as far as syncing up with my
57

58
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.750
original branches is completely optional
and once the course is up and running
58

59
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.310
there's not going to be a lot of changes
so you may or may not to do this. So it's
59

60
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.230
completely optional stuff but I'm going
to leave these links in here so you know
60

61
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.610
about it and you know how to do it if
you want to grab any changes that I make
61

62
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.180
to the branches after I publish the course.
