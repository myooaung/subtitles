00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.413
- In this part of the course I have an assignment for you.
1

2
00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:07.612
One of the things I want to teach you
2

3
00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:09.999
is not only the happy path of things
3

4
00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.276
that are pristine and work all the time,
4

5
00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.922
but I want to give you some challenges
5

6
00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:15.829
of things that are broken.
6

7
00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.136
In this part of the course I have an assignment for you.
7

8
00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:21.216
In the resources you will find a link to a Dockerfile
8

9
00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:24.812
and a JAR file and this Dockerfile is broken,
9

10
00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:28.395
so it will not build the image from that Dockerfile.
10

11
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:31.229
So your assignment is to go in and fix that,
11

12
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.197
discover what the error is
12

13
00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:35.476
and fix that and get this Dockerfile to build an image.
13

14
00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.376
Like I said, I don't want to show you
14

15
00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:39.743
happy path all the time, so this is intentionally broken
15

16
00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:42.991
for you to go in and learn and detect the error
16

17
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.629
and figure out what's wrong with it
17

18
00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.410
and move forward from there.
18

19
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.573
In the next section of the course I'll go through,
19

20
00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:51.524
do a quick code review and show you
20

21
00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:54.223
exactly what was wrong with that Dockerfile.
21

22
00:00:54.223 --> 00:00:56.640
(dance beat)
