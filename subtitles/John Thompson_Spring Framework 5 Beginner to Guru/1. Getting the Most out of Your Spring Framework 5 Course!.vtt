00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.510
All right in this video, I want to talk
about how to get the most out of the
1

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
Spring Framework 5 Beginner to Guru
course. There's a lot of resources here
2

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.379
and not everybody utilizes
everything properly. So there's a lot of
3

4
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
tools in this course to help you become
a true expert on the Spring Framework.
4

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.797
I want to explain those to you in
this video.
5

6
00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.150
I am using GitHub for all the
6

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.070
source code examples, so GitHub is a very
popular source repository. I have over
7

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
twenty three separate github
repositories and I'm going to be adding
8

9
00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.170
more to the course so that number is
actually going to grow so there's a lot
9

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.550
of repositories that you can use and
utilize for resources in this course. Now
10

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.210
I'm finding that some people aren't that
familiar with GitHub. I'm gonna help you
11

12
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.070
get started also. I've added an Appendix
A with information. If you're brand new
12

13
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660
to GitHub, don't worry. Go to Appendix A
and we can get you started with GitHub
13

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.960
and you can start accessing these source
code examples.
14

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.860
Now one thing that I am
15

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.909
using in the course are branches. Most of
the sections of the course are gonna
16

17
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.330
have a starting branch. This is gonna
be the state of the code at the
17

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.700
beginning of the lesson. I'm also gonna
have an ending branch. So I'm gonna code
18

19
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.159
everything and then save the state of
the code at the end of the lesson. Now, if
19

20
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.570
you are familiar with git or other
source code control systems, you might be
20

21
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.080
thinking this is an odd use of branches.
21

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.080
"Are you like a crazy person?"
22

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.070
BUT not
23

24
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.200
totally crazy there is a method to the
craziness here. I did branches because it
24

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.670
allows you to go through the course and
as you look at the branches, you can
25

26
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.130
compare your current source code
to the branch and a lot of times, if you
26

27
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.920
get an error, you might be missing an
annotation somewhere on the course.
27

28
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.229
You might not fully understand what that
error is. You can do a comparison to the
28

29
00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.549
branch inside of GitHub and see any
differences between your code and my
29

30
00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.759
code because my code is going to be
working or was it at least working when
30

31
00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.410
I checked it in. This is a way that
you can see Delta's (differences) see if you forgot
31

32
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.530
something to see if you missed a class
or something like that
32

33
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.890
it's a great way for you to proceed in
the course and really get you over any
33

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.519
little speed bumps. Because I know as you
start learning new things, it's really
34

35
00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.989
easy to forget an annotation here and
there. I do it all the time
35

36
00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.950
but I've seen these errors a thousand
times so it's kind of natural it doesn't
36

37
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.329
stumble me up. But you as a beginner, it's
going to trip you up. So you have this
37

38
00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.739
tool and resource go and use that. 
Through using branches, I can go in and
38

39
00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.190
update the source code. So as new
releases of the Spring Framework come
39

40
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.560
out, I do go in and update the
releases. Typically, it's pretty good. It
40

41
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.500
doesn't break anything but sometimes
there's minor breaking changes and I do
41

42
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.010
need to make updates to that and that
will call that out in a breaking changes
42

43
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.359
but it does keep us running on the
current version of Spring Framework. If I
43

44
00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.200
were to use tags or commit IDs, I would
not be able to go in and update these.
44

45
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.000
Those are very static points in time.
However, branches are long-lived and I
45

46
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260
can go in and see that and you also can
look at that branch and seeing any
46

47
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.400
commit activity I've had on that branch
since I created.
47

48
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.060
"Are you like a crazy person?"
48

49
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.480
So I consider being a little
crazy not to be using branches.
49

50
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.040
Another recommendation, you guys see me make
inside the course is to go and do a fork.
50

51
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.699
Now, a fork is like taking the repository
to your own GitHub account and If you
51

52
00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.940
don't have a good GitHub account, don't
worry. It's absolutely free. I
52

53
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.379
recommend you to fork those to your own
GitHub account. As you follow along
53

54
00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.040
the course, you're gonna build up a whole
repository or a bunch of repositories
54

55
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.629
that you can show to future employers. So,
when you go to get a job as a Spring
55

56
00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.220
Framework developer, you can say look at
all the stuff I did in these courses on
56

57
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.700
Udemy and to show off my work.
57

58
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.360
Now
also exclusive to this course
58

59
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.900
is a Slack community. Inside the
community, you can interact with me. I've
59

60
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.560
got some teachers assistants that help
me answer student questions. They
60

61
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.280
monitor the slack community, and then
there's also two thousand other students
61

62
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.659
from around the world. You can get
help in the course or if you're working
62

63
00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.530
something cool with Spring, you can also
ask questions about that. We do have a
63

64
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.000
lot of great content or a lot of great
conversations in that community about
64

65
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.150
stuff, so I'm going to focus on answering
questions in the course
65

66
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.320
but there's a lot of great community
contributions there. Right now, we're
66

67
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.300
at 2,000 people in there. It's rapidly
growing. I think this is really really
67

68
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.990
cool community. I'm really excited about
the way it's turning out. Here's an
68

69
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.270
example of the Slack channel. So you can
see the people in there talking about it.
69

70
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.139
You can see we're not quite to 2000. I
expected by the end of the week, we will
70

71
00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.139
be there because we do have new people
signing up all the time into the Slack
71

72
00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.160
community, but you can see how people are
talking and they're asking questions and
72

73
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.280
interacting. So as you're learning the
Spring Framework, this is a great
73

74
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.580
resource for you to learn more about
Spring and the Spring community as a
74

75
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.700
whole.
75

76
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.520
If that didn't convince you to
join the Slack Channel, I also do free
76

77
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.300
shirt Fridays. Every Friday I give away a
free Spring Framework Guru t-shirt. It's
77

78
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.410
the same t-shirt that you see me wearing
in the videos. I give away just one. I
78

79
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.550
can't afford to give away all kinds of
t-shirts but I do give one away every
79

80
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.360
Friday. I've literally shipped
t-shirts all over the world. I've sent
80

81
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.699
them apparently to the US, India, Ukraine,
Poland. Actually sent a lot to Poland
81

82
00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.510
that's kind of surprising. Now if you
want to get that Slack community in
82

83
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.419
section one, where this video is later on
a couple sections down you will see so
83

84
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.000
instructions exactly how to join the
slack community.
84

85
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.580
Next is a free 90-day
85

86
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.530
trial for IntelliJ. Now IntelliJ I use
that because it is the most popular IDE
86

87
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.840
for Java development. It is widely used.
It has overtaken Eclipse for popularity.
87

88
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.449
It is NOT a requirement for this course.
Now all my source code examples are IDE
88

89
00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.949
agnostic. They will build with Maven or
Gradle depending on which repository
89

90
00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.060
you're in. So you can use those and
Eclipse does support both Maven and
90

91
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.479
Gradle but I do not personally use
Eclipse anymore.
91

92
00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.902
I've been using IntelliJ for well over a
decade. That is my preferred IDE.
92

93
00:06:16.902 --> 00:06:21.240
As you get into corporate
environments, that is probably what
93

94
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.320
you can see the most of. I know a lot of
shops are still on Eclipse, but from what
94

95
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.340
I'm seeing in the industry and the
clients I'm working with, it's almost all
95

96
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.620
IntelliJ now. I am able to offer a 90 day
trial code for IntelliJ through my
96

97
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.219
partnership with JetBrains.
See section one a couple of lectures from
97

98
00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.980
this one, and you'll see instructions on how to
98

99
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.230
do that you'll register for our code. You
can go download IntelliJ Ultimate right
99

100
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.600
now. You will get a free 30-day trial
after a few days after a few days of
100

101
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.470
registration there's still kind of a
batch process on my side. I will get you
101

102
00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.180
a 90 day code. I recommend you try to
take that 30 days in that first one and
102

103
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.930
then apply the 90 day code which
effectively will give you 120 days of
103

104
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.100
IntelliJ Ultimate completely for free.
104

105
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.440
And then a really nice resource in this
105

106
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.210
course, I call it a Spring Boot cookbook.
There's I think about a dozen
106

107
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.510
repositories in there looking at
different examples like using a Rabbit
107

108
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.910
or ActiveMQ in Spring Boot. These are
just little source code examples to step
108

109
00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.640
you through using these different
technologies to get you started quickly
109

110
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.190
with these different technologies. So
kind of a repository there. Very 
110

111
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.000
commonly used technologies with Spring
to help jump-start you on that. So I do
111

112
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.300
cover a lot in the course, but this
doesn't cover some stuff that I do not
112

113
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.180
specifically cover in the course.
113

114
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.600
And anybody joining the slack community
114

115
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.530
or taking advantage and or taking
advantage of the 90 day free trial to
115

116
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.640
IntelliJ Ultimate automatically gets
enrolled in my Spring Framework Guru
116

117
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.840
newsletter. This is a series of emails
that you'll receive a few times a week
117

118
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.490
general stuff about Spring, the history
of Spring, people like who Rod Johnson is
118

119
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:07.770
and Josh Long and some of the Spring
projects. I do have a very active blog
119

120
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.670
with a lot of content on it. I'll
reference blog posts there and give you
120

121
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:17.100
some tales from the trenches from my
experience as being a developer out in
121

122
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.570
the industry and some amusing tales like
that. So a lot of good content there in
122

123
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.880
the emails. You don't have to join
the Slack community or the 90-day trial
123

124
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.960
for IntelliJ Ultimate. If you want the
newsletter content, head over to my
124

125
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.280
website. You can enroll right there
but there's a lot of really good content
125

126
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.590
in that newsletter to get to your email
box with general stuff about Spring and
126

127
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.560
some amusing stuff in there as well.
127

128
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.020
Now, just a quick summary here, I've given you
128

129
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.230
a lot of good hints here. The number
one thing is if you want to become master
129

130
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:56.100
at Spring is to complete this course.
I highly recommend that you follow along
130

131
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.930
with the source code examples. I did talk
about using GitHub Branches comparison
131

132
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.590
Forks. I think it's a great idea for you
to fork that repository to your own
132

133
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.590
personal GitHub account so you have
something to share with potential
133

134
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:13.830
employers. The Slack community is a great
resource and got over 2,000 or well we
134

135
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.490
will soon have over 2,000 people in
there, where you can collaborate with
135

136
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.660
other Spring Framework Gurus from
around the world. I also have that 90
136

137
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.940
day free trial to IntelliJ Ultimate,
should you need it. So a lot of great
137

138
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.720
resources here. There's a lot of great
content in this course ahead of you. So I
138

139
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.010
really hope you enjoy this course and
please rate the course that does help me
139

140
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:40.350
out. It does help others find the course.
And if I did not earn that highest 5 star
140

141
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:46.050
rating, please tell me why and what I can
improve. I do get people that leave lower
141

142
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.310
than 5 star ratings and with no feedback.
So, if there's no feedback I don't know
142

143
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.980
what I can improve, and what you didn't
like about the course, and how I can make
143

144
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.060
this course better. So I hope you found
these tips valuable because at the end
144

145
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.470
of the day, I do want to see you find
success in this course. I get contacted
145

146
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.710
from students all the time telling me
how this course helped them find a new
146

147
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.540
job and it's a terrific feeling. So, I
want to see you find success so I
147

148
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.820
can be doing a little happy dance like
this!
