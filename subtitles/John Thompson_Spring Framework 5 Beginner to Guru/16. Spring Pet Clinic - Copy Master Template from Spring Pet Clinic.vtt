00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.700
Alright! In this video, what we are
going to be doing stealing more of the
1

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
front end from the official
implementation of Spring Pet Clinic.
2

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.390
In number 18 here, Copy Master Template from
Spring Pet Clinic. That seems a little
3

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.560
cryptic. I imagine, you're not very
familiar with what's going on underneath
4

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.189
the covers. Let me show you what's
going on and what we're going to do so.
5

6
00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.800
We come in here and they have a welcome
HTML file. I named mine index.
6

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
It's just how they set up the mapping.
But you can see this is a pretty lean
7

8
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.800
HTML file for an index page. Not a lot
going on there. The secret sauce is up
8

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.200
here on line 3, where they are
bringing in this Thymeleaf replace these
9

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.160
fragments, so it's looking for something
in fragments layout. It's going to
10

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.170
apply these templates to this. It's
going to basically do a merge operation so
11

12
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
it's going to take this layout. Like
merging, the header from that layout and
12

13
00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.860
then also take this body code and take
this body code and merge it into that
13

14
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
template. Let's take a quick look at
that template.And I might be moving a
14

15
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.490
little bit fast here. This is with Thymeleaf
and HTML. If you're not very familiar
15

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.340
with HTML, this is probably going to be a
little bit much right here, but I'm not
16

17
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.270
specifically teaching HTML on this class
so I can't get too deep into HTML
17

18
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.549
specifics at this point. I just clicked
over to templates fragments and layout
18

19
00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.439
HTML. So again, this is a Thymeleaf
template. And here, you can see now we
19

20
00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.909
have more of the typical stuff that
we're going to see inside of HTML. We have a
20

21
00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.200
head block. We have meta tags. We have
some links in there, as far as you can
21

22
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.700
see here, resources, images, favorite icon,
that count looks like some most static
22

23
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.930
resources that we brought over in the
previous video. And it looks like we
23

24
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.369
missed a resources CSS pet clinic. You
have to make sure that we do get that as
24

25
00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.620
well. Let's see here. Now, we also have a
nav class.
25

26
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.979
It's a lot going on here, but now you
can see here, this here does a th
26

27
00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.300
include template. This is basically
saying I want all this stuff here, and
27

28
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.260
then the other page I showed you, that
was kind of lean. We're going to take the
28

29
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910
body element and inject it right there.
So it's going to do to  a merge so this
29

30
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.810
like sets up a template for everything
that we're doing and then takes that
30

31
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.650
generic template and sticks it in here
so effectively we don't have to rewrite
31

32
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.330
all the the navigation header stuff, all
the header stuff. This all gets handled
32

33
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.380
by the Thymeleaf templates. In this
video, what we want to do is bring that
33

34
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.510
stuff over to our project. Remember
that this lives under resources
34

35
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.820
templates fragments. I am just going
to grab that whole fragments directory.
35

36
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.010
I'm going to minimize this resources
static and now let's go to templates.
36

37
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.250
We can see fragments. I'm just going to grab this whole fragments directory. Copy
37

38
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.580
that.
38

39
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.120
Come back over to IntelliJ now.
39

40
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.599
That goes under templates. Now
I'm just going to do a paste there.
40

41
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.740
So now, you can see that
I have under templates fragments.
41

42
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.590
Let's take a quick look there. So now
you can see that I also have fragments.
42

43
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
We'll implement things iteratively as
we go forward. You can see that there's
43

44
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.420
other templates in here for forms and
whatnot. We will do those in an upcoming
44

45
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.870
video.
45

46
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.319
I'm just taking a peek here. That's
all a reference to the CSS but I am not
46

47
00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.340
seeing that right now. We have static
templates.
47

48
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.069
The CSS that must be getting generated
and the less resources so that is
48

49
00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.410
something that we will also be seeing. These
less resources that we need to set up a
49

50
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.250
processing step for that. That is
going to be coming up at a future video.
50

51
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.370
But for now, we just want to grab these
fragments and put those in place. So that
51

52
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.070
accomplishes our task here. Just as a
reminder, we are going by issues. So here
52

53
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.870
issue number 18. Inside of GitHub was
to copy over that master template and I
53

54
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.500
wanted to take a moment to explain to
you what was going on there, so now we
54

55
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.020
have that. And in an upcoming video, we
will go in and start implementing these.
55

56
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:43.250
I'm going to just go ahead and say
Git commit.
56

57
00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.920
That was pushing up to GitHub right
now.
57

58
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.090
That should close that. You can see I switched to
close, so that issue is now closed.
58

59
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.460
Again, the purpose of this video was just to
bring over those template fragments,
59

60
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.890
which we will be implementing in
upcoming videos.
