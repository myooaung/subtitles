00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.770
Alright so let's go ahead and step
through the assignment to handle that
1

2
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.690
NumberFormatException. And what I'm
going to do first is create a new branch
2

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.019
here.
3

4
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.730
I'm going to call it number format
exception. Now the first thing we want to
4

5
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.989
do is write our tests. I'm going to come
into the RecipeControllerTest and
5

6
00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.410
that's here. So we have the recipe not
found. That's going to be pretty similar
6

7
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:56.440
to what we want so I am going to
shamelessly cut and paste that. And let's
7

8
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:08.619
do a number format. And this time, we're
not going to do that. So we actually
8

9
00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.130
we're not even going to hit that to be
honest. So we don't even need the mock
9

10
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.710
here. So I'm going to comment that out
and let's go ahead and do asdf and we
10

11
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:38.170
want isBadRequest. And we want to
turn back a 400-page. So those are our
11

12
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.330
tests so we should get the 400 view back
which we have not created and that. So
12

13
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.869
let's go ahead and run that and we
should see that it actually does in fact
13

14
00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:56.619
fail. So as expected, that is failing. So
we did get a NumberFormatException so
14

15
00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.250
that is what we are expecting to
see right now because we haven't changed
15

16
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.340
the Controller yet. So let's go ahead and
fix the Controller.
16

17
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.970
We are going to do almost the exact same
thing here. Instead we should not be cut
17

18
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.310
and pasting so don't do that at home. So
I'm going to say bad request and here we
18

19
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:39.041
want to do NumberFormatException.
19

20
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.519
I'll be a little bit nicer and this time we
20

21
00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:07.810
want to turn back 400 error and we'll take
in the exception and we'll rename that.
21

22
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.100
So that is now happy also clean that up
a little bit too. So let's see if our test
22

23
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.329
will run now even though we don't have
the view there. So that is now passing. We
23

24
00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:34.600
are getting that there so we need to
create the view. So let's come over here.
24

25
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.580
And we're doing almost the
exact same thing. Let's go ahead and do
25

26
00:03:50.580 --> 00:04:10.610
this. Shamelessly copy that into the new
page.
26

27
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.890
And we're going to get the exception getMessage. That should be good enough so let's
27

28
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:45.420
go ahead and run this now. We are back up
and running. Let's go ahead and take a
28

29
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.470
look at the page. So this is still the
old page so do a refresh there. So now we
29

30
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.540
get a 400 bad request for input
String asdf. So that gives us a nice
30

31
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.470
message for the user and we could dress
that up if needed. So that is our
31

32
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.680
handling. So just to recap there what we
did as we started off writing our unit
32

33
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.230
test, and let's go ahead make sure all
our tests are passing before we commit
33

34
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.440
this. So we're going to run all the tests
so the test there, we actually don't even
34

35
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.470
need that line in there. So I'm going to
get rid of that because we never get to
35

36
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.290
that. So the exception is going to pop
before then. So we're going to perform
36

37
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.370
a get with the String value in there
that's going to cause the NumberFormat
37

38
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.200
Exception and now we're going to get bad
request and direct to the view of 400
38

39
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.000
error. Take a look at the Controller. So
this is going to handle any of these so
39

40
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.830
wherever we have an ID value, if that is
a String that gets in there that error
40

41
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.960
handler is going to kick in. So and it's
going to return back a bad request for
41

42
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.640
the NumberFormatException and will
log out the output. Create a new ModelAnd
42

43
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.390
View and we will tell it to go to the
400 error which is the new HTML page that
43

44
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.870
we added and will output the error data
to it. So I am going to go ahead and
44

45
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.720
commit this up to GitHub since all the
tests are passing.
45

46
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.420
So NumberFormatException and I'm going
to go ahead and commit that and push and
46

47
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:36.800
I will add a link to that in the course
resources so you can pull that right out
47

48
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.280
of GitHub.
