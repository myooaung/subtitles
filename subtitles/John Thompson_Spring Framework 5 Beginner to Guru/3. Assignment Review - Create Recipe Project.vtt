00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.030
Alright, let's go ahead and review the
requirements for a little coding
1

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.120
assignment here. So we're creating our
new Recipe Project. We're going to use
2

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.830
Spring Boot Initializr to create the
new Spring Boot project. We want to be
3

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
using Spring Boot v2. Probably the
latest really should be fine and then
4

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
"DevTools" which will be under core
that's going to bring in the Spring Boot
5

6
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.890
development tools. Then we want to add in
"Web" and that's going to bring in tomcat
6

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.239
and Spring MVC and give us all that
goodness there. Then we want to be using
7

8
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.780
Thymeleaf templating engine. That's going to
be under Template Engines and then we
8

9
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.820
want to add in JPA and H2 and that's
going to be under the SQL tab. So let's
9

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.480
go through and step through this and you
can see over here, I do have a GitHub
10

11
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.980
repository. So when you go out to me in
GitHub, spring5-recipe-app, that's
11

12
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.800
where you're going to be able to find
this. You can see it's a brand new GitHub
12

13
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.580
repository. I haven't checked anything in
yet but by the time I'm done with this
13

14
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.369
I'm going to commit it there and
definitely leave you a link to the
14

15
00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.240
project so you'll be able to get the
full working working project as I
15

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.440
downloaded it from start.spring.io
16

17
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.659
I'm going to toggle over to IntelliJ. I'm going
17

18
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.880
to use IntelliJ to do this but you can
use the Spring website again
18

19
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.180
start.spring.io and I'm going to come into
IntelliJ, say a New Project. See I've
19

20
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.170
already got the Spring Initializr and there's start.spring.io and I'm going to
20

21
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.270
name it my website and I want to be
consistent here. So I'm going to come
21

22
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.799
over here, grab that, paste that in. We'll
continue using Maven,
22

23
00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:03.570
Jar, Java 1.8 and the SNAPSHOT version is
fine. So I'm going to give it a 
23

24
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.379
Recipe Application for the description and
click on Next and then in Core, we want
24

25
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.420
DevTools
and in our Web, I'm going to take Web.
25

26
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.090
Template Engines, we are going to be
using Thymeleaf and then under SQL we
26

27
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.049
want to be using JPA and that's what's
going to be giving a Spring data JPA,
27

28
00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.760
the ORM, Spring ORM and hibernate
and then H2 and that's going to give our
28

29
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.920
embedded in-memory database that we'll
be using to leverage
29

30
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.439
hibernate and Spring data. And say
Next, see the Project Name there. Project
30

31
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.980
location and we are all happy and now
I'm going to say, and this project
31

32
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.730
location you want to be setting that to your
working directory. So this is my
32

33
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.879
working directory but set that to whatever working directory you're using for your IDE. And I'm
33

34
00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.469
clicking Finish and we'll see that
IntelliJ that's going out, brought
34

35
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:14.980
down that zip file and now it's opening
it up and indexing the project. See down
35

36
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.949
the bottom right hand corner we've got a
couple processes running. Let's go ahead
36

37
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:27.040
and inspect what we brought down. So we can
see we got the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
37

38
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.239
there on line 30. That's going to give
us the Spring data. Then on line 34, we
38

39
00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.780
can see that we had the spring-boot-starter for Thymeleaf, spring-boot-starter
39

40
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.849
for web and then also we have
the spring-boot-devtools and that's
40

41
00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.970
going to give us the DevTools. That's an
important component for later in the
41

42
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.729
course because we are going to be, I'm
going to show you how to use the
42

43
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.509
development tools to speed up your
development. So that's a very important
43

44
00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.930
thing. H2 we are not connecting to a permanent,
44

45
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.859
database. So H2 is just fine for us
right now. Beginning a lot of use out of
45

46
00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.650
that and then the spring-boot-starter-test
that brings in things like junit for
46

47
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.840
testing and we'll be getting into junit
later as well.
