00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.440
Alright, this part of the course, we are
going to look at JPA data modelling
1

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
with Spring and Hibernate. We're
going to cover a lot of material in this
2

3
00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
section. The main thing we're going to be
looking at is setting up JPA Entity
3

4
00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.320
relationships where you have one object
related to another and what we need to
4

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.130
do is we're going to create a data model
for a recipe application which is going
5

6
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.969
to be pretty cool. We're going to get
into a more complex model where we're
6

7
00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.480
going to have one-to-one JPA
relationships, one-to-many where we'll
7

8
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
have a list associated with a different
entity and then many-to-many where we'll
8

9
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
have something like a product and
categories where we'll have a
9

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.809
many-to-many relationship. And towards
the end of the module, we're going to set
10

11
00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.250
up Spring data JPA repositories. We
already saw that. This allows us to do
11

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.550
CRUD operations pretty easy against the
database. Then we're going to talk about
12

13
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
database initialization. This is a pretty
pretty beefy concept that we need to
13

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.970
talk about. Just getting the database
initialized and this is talking about
14

15
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.510
setting up the database tables and also
initializing the database with the
15

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.610
initial data. And finally the last
portion of this module I should say, we
16

17
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
are going to look at displaying a list
of recipes on the index page. We just
17

18
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.189
want to get the recipes loaded up there
with a referential data. We'll have all
18

19
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.220
this set up and then we are going to use
Spring MVC and Thymeleaf to show a list of
19

20
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.479
recipes on an index page.
