been defining Spring Beans and there's
1

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.090
actually a number of different ways to
define beans and we're going to take a
2

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
closer look at how we do Spring
configuration. There's a number of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
configuration options for us
to use and we've only touched on the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.179
surface of them and so far in the course. So this section of the course, we are

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.380
going to get into a lot more stuff on
how we configure Spring and the options
