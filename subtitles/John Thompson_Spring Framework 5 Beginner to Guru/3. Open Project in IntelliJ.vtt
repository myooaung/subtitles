00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.510
So let's go ahead and take a look at the project inside of IntelliJ that we brought down from Spring
1

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.280
Initializr.
2

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.160
So I'm going to come in here to IntelliJ and let's come up here we're going to file and I am to say a project
3

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.570
from existing sources. What I've done is I took that zip file. I moved it into a temp folder.
4

5
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.200
You can put that in a workspace that you're comfortable with.
5

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:36.090
Here I'm just demonstrating this so we're going to go through and open up the spring5webapp and I'm going
6

7
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.060
to click on the pom file. And here I am going to say open.
7

8
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.340
What's happening is IntelliJ is now importing the project. This takes a second. It's going to
8

9
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.500
go through and scanned the project bring down a dependencies and down on the bottom you'll see some flashing
9

10
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.190
going by. Let me resize this a little bit.
10

11
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.220
So now we could see here we had spring5webapp. And let's open up this pom file. So there's a lot
11

12
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.410
of important things that are happening here.
12

13
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.920
So the way Maven dependencies are going to work is it's going to inherit from the Spring Boot parent.
13

14
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.970
Now if I come in and hold down the command key under OSX, I think control for Windows, I could be wrong
14

15
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.820
on that since I don't normally use Windows, and then click.
15

16
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.200
This will take us into the Spring Boot Starter parent and you can see here this is setting up a
16

17
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.350
number of resources for us and different plug ins which we really don't need.
17

18
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.810
But the more important one is that it's going to come here to Spring Boot Dependencies.
18

19
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.500
So this is gonna be bringing in a lot of common properties. You can see there's literally hundreds of
19

20
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.110
versions being maintained for us. So this is what's called curated dependencies.
20

21
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.090
This all being maintained by the Spring team.
21

22
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.160
And now you can see this dependency management.
22

23
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.980
So this is a real quick tip as we're working with Spring Boot when you're bring in dependencies.
23

24
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.470
These are all curated dependencies. So when we have this in dependency management, if I wanted to
24

25
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.120
grab this artifact in, I'd just bring in the artifact into my upper level BOM senses in the dependency
25

26
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.730
management.
26

27
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.420
And I just include that and then I can omit the release and allow this to manage release. So that's actually
27

28
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.870
a best practice.
28

29
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.480
And this is something I talk about more in-depth in my Maven course.
29

30
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.540
So we really go into this a lot in-depth but just be aware of how we are inheriting dependency information
30

31
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.230
from the Spring Boot parent pom and the dependencies pom.
31

32
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.650
So I closed this and take a closer look at what it gave us.
32

33
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.440
Remember we said we gave it a group I.D. so you can see guru.springframework there.
33

34
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.540
The artifacts spring5webapp starts off with the version of  0.0.1 snapshot. Name. Remember
34

35
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.030
I gave it simple application. It looks like a must of misspelled that in the previous video. Oops.
35

36
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.560
That does happen occasionally.
36

37
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.640
And you can see properties Java 11.
37

38
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.260
And now here's our dependency.
38

39
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.150
So we have a the Spring Boot Starter JPA, Spring Boot Starter Web and then the H2 Database and then
39

40
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.790
also it brings in the Spring Boot Starter Test.
40

41
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.720
And this is emitting the Vintage engines.
41

42
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.950
And so that is something that we're going to need if we want to bring in JUnit 4 test. And here you
42

43
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.230
can see that Maven changed the pom.
43

44
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.600
And Maven is asking if I want to import the changes. Those whitespace changed but I'm going to click
44

45
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.250
on enable auto import just to keep that happy. That you used to be problematic on larger projects.
45

46
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.030
But it's actually pretty decent to just go ahead and allow it automatically import.
46

47
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.860
So let's come over here.
47

48
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.870
I'm going to expand out this Maven tab. And now we can see here's our Spring Boot app and I want look
48

49
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.970
at these dependencies.
49

50
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.290
So let's take a look at the Spring Boot Starter Web.
50

51
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.270
And here you can see it's bringing us the Spring Boot Starter that has dependencies so you can see here.
51

52
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.020
So you have Spring Boot that's bringing Spring Core.
52

53
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.440
So all this stuff, you use to go out and figure out what dependencies you need to include in your project
53

54
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.870
to get a functional Spring application.
54

55
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.340
So these are all common sense stuff that we can bring in. If we wanted to omit one, we can say excludes.
55

56
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.720
but so far we're going to not be doing that specifically.
56

57
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.640
And so that was the Spring Boot Starter Web.
57

58
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:44.140
Here's the Spring Boot Startup Data. This brings in AOP, JDBC., Jakarta Persistence, Hibernate.
58

59
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:51.450
So bringing that version of Hibernate. Spring Data JPA. So you can see that's the Spring and a variety of stuff.
59

60
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.990
And sometimes they do duplicate the dependencies because you don't always use these together.
60

61
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.150
So the Spring Boot Starter has dependencies saying hey I need this.
61

62
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.570
And when you see omitted for duplicate that means that another dependency is asked for the same one.
62

63
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.930
So let's collapse that. And then the other thing we want take a look at is the Spring Boot Test. So
63

64
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.710
you can see here this is bringing in a number of things for testing.
64

65
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.760
So I have entire course on testing Spring Boot.
65

66
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.540
We look at this a lot closer but these are a lot of testing tools and we get these included in our project
66

67
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.100
for free.
67

68
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.330
So we get like Mockito and Hamcrest Matchers, AssertJ.
68

69
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.900
That's some really cool stuff.
69

70
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.270
And of course JUnit as well.
70

71
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.660
So clear. The way
71

72
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.360
Spring Boot and Spring Initializr are set up these initials dependencies is very important because we're
72

73
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.690
going to be relying on these libraries for our project.
73

74
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.220
So let's go ahead and collapse the Maven tab now and let's take a look at what we got for source
74

75
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.970
code.
75

76
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:06.800
So under source main Java. Let me change this property here. That just compacts middle packages so don't have to
76

77
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.620
click through everything.
77

78
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.410
So here's the main class.
78

79
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.210
This is the main Spring Boot application. So remember every Java application has a main class so this
79

80
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.320
is our entry point.
80

81
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.230
And this is just going to start up a Spring Boot Web Application.
81

82
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.990
So we will get into this in a lot more detail.
82

83
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.210
But standard Java main class.
83

84
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.800
And then finally here if I go into test we also get a Spring Boot Test.
84

85
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.950
So this is a very simple JUnit 5 test.
85

86
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.340
And what this is going to do is bring up the Spring Context.
86

87
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.460
Again, that's a new term. We will be looking at that in upcoming lessons in the course.
87

88
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.100
But the primary thing is it provides us a application, a main class and then a test.
88

89
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.270
And that's going to make sure that context actually does load the Spring Context.
89

90
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.200
So very very simple but a very simple starting point for us to start developing from.
90

91
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.160
And then finally here this Help. Help.md
91

92
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.300
This is markdown document. You can see here.
92

93
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.640
This is going to have additional content and that's something that Spring just recently started doing so
93

94
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.680
when you go through and generate a project with Spring Initializr, it generates the links to help
94

95
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.490
documentation for the projects and
95

96
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.110
the spring boot starters that you selected inside your view course. A pretty cool little feature. Handy. If you need
96

97
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.370
to go in and look up something quickly for the documentation.
97

98
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.800
And then finally one other thing that does include is gitignore.
98

99
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.370
I personally have my own favorite gitignore files and you'll see me using those on upcoming projects.
99

100
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.420
So I think this is a nice little starter but you can definitely expand upon the gitignore so you don't
100

101
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.580
get things that you don't want included into your GitHub repositories.
101

102
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.230
Always helpful to have that within your code base.
102

103
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.440
And then finally these two files here.
103

104
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.320
And that's part of the Maven wrapper.
104

105
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.160
And here's the magic source behind the Maven wrapper.
105

106
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:07.540
As you can see this is really I can't under emphasize enough how much of a time saver this is because
106

107
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:14.440
I remember setting up Spring projects, you'd start off writing this this pom, start researching which
107

108
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.200
dependencies you'd have to bring in.
108

109
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.800
You didn't have this one handy dependency that would bring everything in that you need for a web application.
109

110
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.010
You'd have to go out and find out oh I need Spring MVC, Oh I need Spring AOP. I'm doing data. I need
110

111
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.580
JPA. I need the transaction jars. So a lot of different libraries that this really takes a lot of work
111

112
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:39.760
from you that you don't have to worry about. And then also I remember going to have to
112

113
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.610
type out, creare a directory source, create a directly main, create directory Java.
113

114
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.590
So this is all time saving stuff that we get for free by using the Spring Initializr.
