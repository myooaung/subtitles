Alright! In this video, we are going to look
at getting MySQL installed on CentOS.
1

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.009
I picked CentOS, as an example because
that is, some people would say Cent OS
2

3
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.210
because it is a fedora based Linux
distribution. So, it's going to cover a lot
3

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.439
of different ground, a lot of variants
come from that. Ubuntu is also at
4

5
00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.470
Debian. So, two of the primary Linux
families of distributions. So, hopefully
5

6
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
give you two good examples here. But the
Fedora uses a different package manager
6

7
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.989
commonly called 'yum'. The first thing
that we want to do is come in here and
7

8
00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.450
do a yum update. If you're not signed
in as root, you will need to run sudo
8

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.410
prior to that. So, while that's going, this is
just going to go out and get the system
9

10
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.559
updated. What's important is I'm
logged in as root here. That does have
10

11
00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.079
some risk with it, but you also need to
be either as root or as a user account
11

12
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.969
that has sudo access. So, a lot of times,
I'll log in as that and then I'll do a
12

13
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.610
sudo su to go ahead and switch over to
root. Then, I can just run all my
13

14
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.010
commands without having to prefix them
with the prefix of sudo. So, I'm going to
14

15
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.060
pause the video. That's taking a couple
seconds longer than I thought it would.
15

16
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.180
I am going to come back once these
updates have completed. Okay, I fast
16

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.479
forwarded while that was downloading and
skipped ahead a little bit, so I didn't
17

18
00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.189
touch anything else there. So now, the
system is updated. I'm going to run a
18

19
00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.700
command called 'clear' to clear the screen.
So, I get back up towards the top. Make it
19

20
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.259
a little easier. I knew. I hope. Now, the
next thing that we want to do is install
20

21
00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.509
a utility called 'wget'. This allows us to
download things from the command line.
21

22
00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.549
That's asking to do we want install it.
Now, if you've had your CentOS system for
22

23
00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.329
a while, chances are you already
installed this. I don't know why they
23

24
00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.170
don't actually install that just by
default because everybody it's like one
24

25
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.490
of the first things that they do. So, we
can see that this got installed okay. I'm
25

26
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.960
going to clear again.
Now, I'm going to do a wget,
26

27
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.160
and this is a URL that I've copied off a
link for the MySQL repositories. Be sure
27

28
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.080
that you get the right URL for your
release. That is important. If you
28

29
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.580
don't, you will have problems. So, we can
see that went through and is happy.
29

30
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.910
Now, I need to run a command  rpm- ivh. So,
it's basically going to port this into our
30

31
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.540
local repositories so the installer knows
about it, and that's all we need to do. So,
31

32
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.459
that is installed. Now, I've seen some
recommendations where it's a good idea
32

33
00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.400
to do a yum update again. Just see if
anything is out there. So, it actually did
33

34
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.900
find a couple things, so let's go ahead
and clear that. And then finally, we need
34

35
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:11.130
to do a yum install mysql server. You
can see it went out and looked at all
35

36
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.400
this dependencies. It's going to install.
Just say yes. So now, it's going to go out to the
36

37
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.269
internet, download all the stuff
over to a bunch of perls start scrolling
37

38
00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.470
by. I'm going to pause this while this is
downloading and i will resume the script
38

39
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.170
in a second. Okay. You can see that I'm
getting a prompt here about a gpg file.
39

40
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.140
I'm going to say yes. So, saying that it's
good and it's going to continue downloading
40

41
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.480
things. I'm going to pause the video one
more time. Okay, now you can see that I
41

42
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.890
have a complete down at the bottom there
and everything has installed normally. No
42

43
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.640
error messages. Make sure that you don't
have a errors. If you do run into a
43

44
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.410
problem here, I'm going to guess, you
probably grabbed the wrong URL for the
44

45
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.989
yum install, so double-check that. So, I'm
going to go ahead and do clear. Okay. Now, we
45

46
00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:09.239
can go ahead and start up MySQL. You know,
system control start mysqld.
46

47
00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.540
That's where the daemon process.
That's going to take a second. Start.
47

48
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.280
Now, we can also come in and do a
status.
48

49
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.410
Now, you can see that MySQL is up and
running normally, so that is what is
49

50
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.090
required to get MySQL installed. In
an upcoming video, we're going to look at
50

51
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:37.419
connecting to it clear. So, I just did a
ps- ef  | grep mysqld. So, we can see
51

52
00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.770
that MySQL daemon is in fact running
out of the system. So, everything is good.
52

53
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.610
Like I said in an upcoming video, we are
going to go ahead and learn how to
53

54
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.430
connect to MySQL and start working with
it.
