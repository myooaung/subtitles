00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.990
Okay! In this section of the course, what
we wanna do is start introducing you
1

2
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.210
into the Docker Framework, and see what
Docker is, how we can work with it.

3
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.060
In the first section, we're gonna take a
look at exactly what is Docker, why it
3

4
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.130
came to be, and then we'll get into some
very simple exercises using Docker. We're
4

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.269
not gonna look at anything too
much with Java. In this section of the
5

6
00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.540
course is really just to get you
familiar with Docker. Get you some
6

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.530
history of Docker.  Get your environment
set up, so that Doctor is now functional

8
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.200
on your system, and you can start using
Docker Containers on your own
8

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.129
development system. So let's jump into
the next module of the course and we'll
9

10
00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.760
take a deep dive on what exactly is this
thing called Docker.
