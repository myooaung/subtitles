Alright, this is going to wrap up our
section on Spring Configuration. Now I
1

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.160
showed you a lot of the basics here and
different configuration types and didn't
2

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
get too deep into the XML because that's
really being phased out of the Spring
3

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990
Framework as of right now. There's a
couple of outlying projects that are
4

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.060
still using XML configuration but for the
majority of the Spring family of
5

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.590
projects are all moving towards Java
Based Configurations and Java DSLs for
6

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.880
us to do configuration. So that's the
area I'm going to be focusing on the
7

8
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.540
course going forward and as we get into,
we're going to be building more
8

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
applications in the course. So I'll have
more opportunity to show you realistic
9

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.660
examples because me personally I learn
best by having concrete examples to work
10

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
with. So reading, I could do slide decks
and show you all the features of
11

12
00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.480
configuration but I think it's better to
get hands-on and do that. So this is to get
12

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.010
you primed on Spring Configuration. So I
want you to see and understand how these
13

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
different options work so you can do
Java configuration, you can do Base
14

15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.880
Configuration and XML Configuration and
if you're really brave, you can even toss in Groovy
15

16
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.140
Configuration and all this is going to
get pulled up into the Spring Context. In
16

17
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.680
the Spring Context that inversion of
control container is what's going to
17

18
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.820
wire up your application. So it really
doesn't matter where you define Spring
18

19
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
Beans at and the different options. You
have a plethora of options to choose
19

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.150
from but they all get brought up into
the context and right now the industry
20

21
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.110
is definitely moving towards the Java
based configuration and Annotations based
21

22
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.850
configuration. Just makes things a lot
easier. So a lot more great content
22

23
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.899
coming ahead in the course.
