00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.530
All right, I got a very exciting section
here of the course. What we are gonna
1

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.010
get into is Spring Data for MongoDB. 
MongoDB is a no SQL database. It's
2

3
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.240
quite a different model, than what we're
used to with traditional SQL databases.
3

4
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.590
Now, I'm introducing this into the course
because one of the new features inside
4

5
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
of Spring Framework 5 is reactive
programming. And guess what? Relational
5

6
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.010
Database is the JDBC spec, at the time of
production of this course, does not
6

7
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.149
support Reactive API's. So but the Mongo,
Mongo is a does have a reactive driver.
7

8
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.469
I want to get into the MongoDB.
We're gonna take the recipe
8

9
00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.730
application that we've been using, and
we're gonna revert it over to Mongo.
9

10
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.399
So we're gonna learn a little bit more
about the Mongo database. We're gonna
10

11
00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.609
learn about Mongo, a Spring Data for
MongoDB, and how to use that. We're
11

12
00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.760
gonna transition that recipe
application over to using MongoDB. So
12

13
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.580
there's a couple things that we're gonna
have to do. Obviously, setting up the
13

14
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.530
project, and then removing all the JPA stuff, all the JPA baggage, and then
14

15
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
introducing Mongo. There's a couple
little nuances that we need to work with
15

16
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
or work through, which aren't you about
to work through with. You're gonna
16

17
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
see how easy it was to create this
application. This really sets us up
17

18
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.100
for doing some really neat stuff, later
in the course, because now, you'll have
18

19
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.290
experience working with MongoDB, and
will be able to go and build an end-to-end
19

20
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.049
reactive application using Spring
Framework 5.
