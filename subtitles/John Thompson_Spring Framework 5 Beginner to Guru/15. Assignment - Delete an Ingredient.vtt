Alright, I got a coding assignment for
you in this video. What we want to do is
1

2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
implement the functionality to delete a
specific ingredient of a recipe. So
2

3
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.080
we'll go through it just like we did
before for recipes. We'll set up at a URL,
3

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.789
a link that we can click so we're going
to use the get action. Even though we're
4

5
00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.380
using get and this is what we're
kind of limited to within the HTML
5

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:34.200
standard of forms and links. So you can't
do an HTTP delete from a web form without
6

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.700
using JavaScript. So we're just sticking
to the straight forms. Later in the
7

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.090
course we're definitely going to get to
CRUD operations where we will be using
8

9
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.210
the delete verb from the HTTP standard. But here we're setting up a form so what
9

10
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.870
i want you to do is implement the delete
action just like we did before for the
10

11
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
recipe, but now i want to be able to delete
an ingredient. So go ahead work on that
11

12
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.449
for yourself, try to work through it and
in the next video I will step you
12

13
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
through step by step on my
implementation and don't forget to write
13

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.760
a test case for it so follow follow
test-driven development so write your
14

15
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.110
test case first and then do the
controller action, then do the service.
