00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:08.035
<v ->Alright, in this video, we are going to take a look</v>
2

3
00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:10.675
at setting up Spring MVC Internationalization
3

4
00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:13.489
and we're going to be using Spring Boot to help us out.
4

5
00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.986
And what I want to do is go through
5

6
00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:17.370
and show you exactly how that accept header is working
6

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.075
with inside of HTTP.
7

8
00:00:19.075 --> 00:00:22.025
So, I got a pretty cool example here for you.
8

9
00:00:22.025 --> 00:00:26.400
I have Chrome running with the English US region,
9

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.793
that's to follow my operating system so Chrome's taking that
10

11
00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:31.699
and then I also have Firefox running
11

12
00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.373
with English Great Britain.
12

13
00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:35.306
And I'm going to show you how these cascading messages
13

14
00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.011
dot properties files will work
14

15
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:39.186
and how we can set that up for different defaults.
15

16
00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:40.690
But first what we're going to do is
16

17
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.517
we'll get Spring Boot up and running
17

18
00:00:42.517 --> 00:00:44.889
and we're going to go in and take a look at the developer tools
18

19
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.638
so we can see that request header.
19

20
00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:48.234
So this is a header, if you remember
20

21
00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:51.184
we looked at the HTTP request earlier in the course,
21

22
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.984
so there's a number of headers that get set
22

23
00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:55.844
and the browsers do set a number of those automatically.
23

24
00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:57.608
And I want to point out that this
24

25
00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:00.338
is a behavior of all modern browsers
25

26
00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:01.875
to be setting these headers.
26

27
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:06.130
Later in the course, when we get into doing RESTful APIs,
27

28
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.998
we're still going to be using HTTP as a protocol,
28

29
00:01:09.998 --> 00:01:11.477
but it's going to be up to us to set
29

30
00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:13.238
a lot of these request headers.
30

31
00:01:13.238 --> 00:01:14.687
So when you're doing web development
31

32
00:01:14.687 --> 00:01:16.442
and these request headers, it's important
32

33
00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.867
to understand all the stuff that the browser's
33

34
00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:23.190
telling our web server that it can and cannot accept.
34

35
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.767
So in this case we're looking at internationalization
35

36
00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:26.999
and our browser's telling it
36

37
00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.254
I want this language and this region.
37

38
00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:30.087
And we're going to take a look at
38

39
00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:31.675
that inside the developer tools.
39

40
00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.675
And then we're going to take a look at setting up
40

41
00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:38.844
Spring and Spring MVC, all the stuff that we get out of that
41

42
00:01:38.844 --> 00:01:40.938
and how we can work with the messages properties.
42

43
00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.787
And then at the end of this videos, we're going to
43

44
00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:45.204
take a look into the coverage of the Spring Boot
44

45
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.168
autoconfiguration and exactly how that
45

46
00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.772
is working for internationalization.
46

47
00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:51.671
Okay, I want to go through a couple things here
47

48
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:53.759
within Spring Boot itself.
48

49
00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.249
And I got a little demo set up here for you.
49

50
00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.320
And what I've done is I've come in here
50

51
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.953
to our recipe form class and right here
51

52
00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:05.890
on line 40, pull that down a little bit
52

53
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.323
so we can see a little bit better here
53

54
00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:11.340
on line 40 you can see the th colon text
54

55
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.809
I've added in recipe description
55

56
00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.106
so that hashtag recipe.description
56

57
00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:18.047
is going to say to pull that out of the properties file
57

58
00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:20.130
and in messages.properties I've set up
58

59
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.255
recipe.description and here you can see
59

60
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.897
that I've added in the default and I've added in
60

61
00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:28.281
English for Great Britain and English for US
61

62
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.622
but both those are currently commented out,
62

63
00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:32.584
I don't want to be using those yet.
63

64
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:35.514
But what I want to do is show you a little demonstration
64

65
00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:37.676
of what's happening for when we're talking
65

66
00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:39.100
about the accept headers.
66

67
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.774
So I'm going to come over here into Chrome
67

68
00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:44.649
and show you what's happening here.
68

69
00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:46.115
So if I come up here and do
69

70
00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:48.865
View, Developer, Developer Tools.
70

71
00:02:50.802 --> 00:02:52.466
Now I have the network tab up
71

72
00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:54.716
and when I click on update,
72

73
00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.452
I'm going to see the traffic that was created here
73

74
00:02:58.452 --> 00:03:00.261
so let's take a look at that.
74

75
00:03:00.261 --> 00:03:03.344
Get request on recipe 2, so that URL
75

76
00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:07.247
and what we want to look at is here.
76

77
00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:09.275
So this is what's going to across the wires
77

78
00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:11.955
from the browser so it's important to keep this in mind
78

79
00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:14.009
about how we're going to be resolving the locale.
79

80
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.826
So right now, inside of Chrome,
80

81
00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.610
you can see my Accept-Language
81

82
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.777
as en-US and then en.
82

83
00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:24.017
So these are the two preferences
83

84
00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:25.459
and to be honest I'm not quite sure
84

85
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.663
what the q equals 0.8 is, I'm not going to lie to you,
85

86
00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:30.996
I'm not quite sure what that is.
86

87
00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.093
If you do please leave a comment on this video.
87

88
00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:35.470
I'm kinda curious what that is now, that I'm looking at it.
88

89
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.489
But the main thing I want to
89

90
00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.268
be looking at is the Accept-Language.
90

91
00:03:39.268 --> 00:03:42.888
So en-US or en, so these are two different levels
91

92
00:03:42.888 --> 00:03:45.142
that the browser is asking for.
92

93
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:47.085
And right now it's coming into default.
93

94
00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:49.318
So you can see the default there,
94

95
00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:51.322
and this is from right here.
95

96
00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.731
So that is how that message is getting set,
96

97
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:55.190
out of the message.properties.
97

98
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.838
So it's going to the default because I haven't
98

99
00:03:57.838 --> 00:03:59.800
technically set that in either one
99

100
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.807
of these descriptions here.
100

101
00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.802
Now if I come over here to Firefox,
101

102
00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:07.005
the developer edition of Firefox.
102

103
00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:11.293
And come in Tools, Web Developer, Toggle Tools.
103

104
00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:15.288
And now if I come in here to say, update,
104

105
00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.663
now if I inspect this call, again we're asking
105

106
00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:20.958
for the document there.
106

107
00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:22.903
And now down here in the bottom,
107

108
00:04:22.903 --> 00:04:25.414
you can see very similar, but what I've done
108

109
00:04:25.414 --> 00:04:28.962
is I've gone in and reconfigured my Firefox instance
109

110
00:04:28.962 --> 00:04:30.761
to as for Great Britain.
110

111
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.657
So it's asking for the en-GB version of English.
111

112
00:04:34.657 --> 00:04:36.997
And then it'll fall back to just English.
112

113
00:04:36.997 --> 00:04:39.580
So now if I come in to IntelliJ
113

114
00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:44.374
and let's change this, actually
114

115
00:04:44.374 --> 00:04:47.374
let me do something here on the fly.
115

116
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.066
Going to go ahead and add en.
116

117
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:58.748
So now I have just messages.en.
117

118
00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:00.581
Let me copy that over.
118

119
00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:05.454
And we'll add this in like so.
119

120
00:05:09.405 --> 00:05:12.572
So if I do just en, make it lowercase.
120

121
00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.781
Making that lowercase just to be consistent.
121

122
00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.674
And now let's go ahead and restart Spring Boot,
122

123
00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:23.507
so we make sure that takes effect.
123

124
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:28.021
And now if I come over here
124

125
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.685
and refresh this page.
125

126
00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:36.459
You can see it's just en, so it's defaulting to that.
126

127
00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:41.102
And if I come to Chrome and do the same thing.
127

128
00:05:41.102 --> 00:05:43.004
We can see we get just en.
128

129
00:05:43.004 --> 00:05:45.034
Now if I come back here to IntelliJ
129

130
00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:49.418
and let's go into the US and we'll uncomment the US.
130

131
00:05:49.418 --> 00:05:51.918
And go ahead and restart that.
131

132
00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:57.055
And what's going to happen now is the US
132

133
00:05:57.055 --> 00:06:00.956
will show the US values, so I'm doing description US.
133

134
00:06:00.956 --> 00:06:04.214
So I come in here and do a refresh
134

135
00:06:04.214 --> 00:06:07.277
and we can see that this is US here.
135

136
00:06:07.277 --> 00:06:09.640
And if I come back over here to Firefox
136

137
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.775
which is set to Great Britain and do a refresh.
137

138
00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:15.927
We still see just en.
138

139
00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:18.988
So now if I come back here to IntelliJ
139

140
00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:23.155
and let's go ahead and uncomment this guy for Great Britain.
140

141
00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:29.159
Now we can see that Great Britain's going to change
141

142
00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.220
as soon as we get this running.
142

143
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.387
So now we come up here and we can see that we have
143

144
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:39.513
the Great Britain locale selected.
144

145
00:06:39.513 --> 00:06:41.795
Come back over here.
145

146
00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:43.709
And I'll even refresh this one more time.
146

147
00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:46.835
See how this is saying US, I can see how
147

148
00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:48.563
these work in conjunction with each other.
148

149
00:06:48.563 --> 00:06:52.526
So if I don't have the locale for a specific language code,
149

150
00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:54.168
it's going to fall back to that.
150

151
00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:56.116
Now if I were to configure one of my browsers
151

152
00:06:56.116 --> 00:06:59.821
for Russian or Polish, or something like that,
152

153
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:04.624
it would fall back to just the messages.properties,
153

154
00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:06.184
so it would go back to the default.
154

155
00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:08.575
So if I don't have a given language code
155

156
00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:11.908
or a language code locale, it's going to go back
156

157
00:07:11.908 --> 00:07:13.013
to the default setting.
157

158
00:07:13.013 --> 00:07:15.650
It's a really really versatile set of tools
158

159
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.741
that we have here, as far as handling multiple languages
159

160
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:20.417
and being able to find the strings for those
160

161
00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:23.046
in our messages.properties.
161

162
00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.692
Okay, there's a lot of disinformation about setting up
162

163
00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:27.102
internationalization, especially
163

164
00:07:27.102 --> 00:07:29.026
when it comes with Spring Boot.
164

165
00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:30.715
Because Spring Boot is doing some
165

166
00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:31.913
auto configuration for us
166

167
00:07:31.913 --> 00:07:34.406
and I want to take a quick look at that too.
167

168
00:07:34.406 --> 00:07:38.323
I'll come up here to WebMvc auto configuration
168

169
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:42.899
is the auto configuration class.
169

170
00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.250
So I'm going to take a look at that.
170

171
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.081
And I'm going to go ahead and tell it to download sources here.
171

172
00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:53.527
So we can see the annotated class, or comments I should say.
172

173
00:07:53.527 --> 00:07:57.527
Now if I come in here and do a search on locale.
173

174
00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:03.649
So here on line 239, what we have is a Conditional
174

175
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.416
OnMissingBean so if we're missing the bean,
175

176
00:08:06.416 --> 00:08:08.875
a localeResolver and you'll see
176

177
00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:11.535
a lot of examples out there, even when you search
177

178
00:08:11.535 --> 00:08:14.151
on Spring Boot and internationalization
178

179
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:16.205
about setting up the localeResolver.
179

180
00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.587
Now you do have some properties that you can set up
180

181
00:08:18.587 --> 00:08:21.334
in the application.properties but the default
181

182
00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:24.001
behavior here, you can see here,
182

183
00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:28.374
if you set up a property for fixed.
183

184
00:08:28.374 --> 00:08:30.298
So you have this option of doing a fix
184

185
00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:32.567
and this is, again the fixed is going to be pulling
185

186
00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:36.566
from the JVM. So if the JVM is set to a language code
186

187
00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:39.227
so that's what the fixed property's going to do.
187

188
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.110
And this here's just an if statement,
188

189
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.727
so if you've overridden that, but if you do nothing at all,
189

190
00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:48.562
automatically the AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver
190

191
00:08:48.562 --> 00:08:51.949
is going to be configured and wired into your project
191

192
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:53.157
by Spring MVC.
192

193
00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.081
So I wanted to clarify that because if you start
193

194
00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:58.550
searching around on that, you're going to see a lot of examples
194

195
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.117
where they tell you, even with Spring Boot
195

196
00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:02.530
that you have to define this bean.
196

197
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.123
But that is incorrect, you do get internationalization
197

198
00:09:05.123 --> 00:09:08.725
out of the box with Spring Boot configured on your projects.
198

199
00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:11.225
So, this has been in there for some time
199

200
00:09:11.225 --> 00:09:13.590
and it's a lot of misnomers overheld
200

201
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.393
from back in the day when we didn't have the Spring Boot
201

202
00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:19.181
and you did have to set this up manually,
202

203
00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:20.533
when you're working with Spring MVC
203

204
00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:22.312
but this does come out of the box
204

205
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:24.062
with Spring Boot in.
205

206
00:09:24.062 --> 00:09:27.779
Again, this is what's going to be looking at that accept header
206

207
00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:31.582
and specifically just to reiterate there.
207

208
00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:34.077
If I come in here and look at the update request.
208

209
00:09:34.077 --> 00:09:37.356
That interceptor is going to be looking at
209

210
00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.103
the Accept-Language header, so that's
210

211
00:09:39.103 --> 00:09:42.170
what's going to be swapping the message.properties for us.
211

212
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.849
So that's how that's configured,
212

213
00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.014
so if you ever need to change that,
213

214
00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:48.269
and again, looking at this configuration.
214

215
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:50.625
So, if you define one of the LocaleResolvers
215

216
00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:53.349
we talked about in the previous video.
216

217
00:09:53.349 --> 00:09:57.254
This is only going to be created if Spring Boot
217

218
00:09:57.254 --> 00:09:59.453
does not already see a LocaleResolver.
218

219
00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.954
So if you define one in your configuration,
219

220
00:10:01.954 --> 00:10:06.121
this code does not kick in and does not create one for you.
