00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.620
We are just about done with creating our castle.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.560
There's just one last thing we have to do before it's finished and that's give it some cast shadows

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.110
and this will just help differentiate between the different pieces to our castle.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.000
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to merge our two little house type structures.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.380
So go ahead and merge those then we're going to select their shape and add a new layer then using the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.990
brush tool with a hard edge and this dark blue.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:49.530
We're going to create a line that looks something like this and we'll add another line across here and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.880
we'll do the same on the other side

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.670
.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.840
Now what we'll do is we're going to bring the opacity down on that layer

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.000
just like so.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:19.440
We also want to select our layer and we're going to come up to filter and blur than box blur and that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.950
will allow us to blur our shadows.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
But like I said make sure that you have your shape for your house is selected.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.060
Otherwise it's going to blur outside of your house selection.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.120
Now let's do this one more time.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.780
But for these two towers.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:49.440
So we're going to find those two towers are going to merge their layers are going to select their shapes

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.860
.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.240
Add a new layer

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.580
paint on our casts shadows that look something like that

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.260
then we'll put on a box blur filter

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:22.230
at 10 then we'll turn down their opacity.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.050
Awesome.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.620
Looks good.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.320
Now let's go ahead and place this castle in our background so what we'll want to do is we're going to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
want to merge all of these layers now before we do that.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.710
Let's go ahead and save our piece

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.970
and this is just so that we have all our layers in a file somewhere.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.900
I'm calling this the 0 6 4 version 0 6 because this is my sixth version of the castle.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.710
Then we're going to go ahead and merge all of our layers all the way down to the skyline.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.300
Make sure you don't merge them with our drawing or our reused ones.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.610
Now we're going to copy them make sure we're on the rectangular select tool.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.670
We're going to copy them and paste it into our background.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.730
Now we want to drag the sky all the way down beneath our tree layers.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.960
Then we want to turn our drawing back on so we can see where Castle is supposed to be placed.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.150
And now we'll just place them after resize them

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:07.270
.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.440
That looks just about right.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.280
We might nudge them down just a little bit.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.670
Awesome.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.360
Let's turn off our drawing and you'll see we have some empty space under here so we're just going to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:29.130
go ahead and hurry up and fill that in that will select that color and we're just going to simply brush

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.520
it in

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.980
.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.490
Same on the side ropes.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.720
Selected this color.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.320
And let's quickly read position our trees because they're not really in the best place.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.790
So we'll come to our tree layers

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.700
and we're just going to move them.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.320
Well actually leave that guy because there's not really a good place to move into but we will move our

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.730
other tree moved him to about there.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.010
Awesome.
