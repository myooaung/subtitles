00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.160
All right guys so here we are in Photoshop.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.720
Now for those of you that have never used Photoshop before and have no idea what you're looking at don't

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.360
worry I'm going to take you on a little crash course on the few tools that we'll be using at the beginning

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.390
of this course for the rest of you that have used Photoshop before and are very comfortable with it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.440
.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.330
You can go ahead and skip ahead but if not let's proceed.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.930
So when you first get into Photoshop it can be pretty daunting.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.380
I know the first time I got into Photoshop I was pretty overwhelmed but it's really not that hard of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.550
a program to learn.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.270
So our first tool that we're going to review is the grab and move toy which is up here in the left upper

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.840
hand side I'm Sorry the upper left hand side.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.270
So if we grab that or click on it you can see we can grab our layer or object and we can move it around

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.600
.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.260
It's not letting us move it around because our layer is locked.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.650
And by that all that means is that if you come down here to her layers which is in our bottom right

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.520
hand side you'll see that we have a layer right here which is labeled background and on that layer we

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.900
have a lock icon on it.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.370
That means the layer is locked.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.430
So if we just click on that unlock it and I'll go over layers in the next in the next part of the course

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.970
so don't worry about that.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.580
So if we come back to our workspace we can click on our layer and now we can move it around.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.990
Let's edit undo that.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.480
Now our next tool is the marquee tool which is the tool right underneath the move tool.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.680
So if we click on it you can see we can select an area by clicking on the page and dragging our stylus

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.710
and it will select the area.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.620
So now that this area is selected we can grab our grab move tool and cut it out and move it around the

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.240
page.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.680
This is very useful for a lot of different things.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.690
So let's undo that and I'll show you.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.370
There are different marquee tools and the ones we will be using are the elliptical marquee tool which

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.620
is the one we just did and the second one is the rectangular marquee tool.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.470
So if we select that one you'll see it does the same exact thing except it selects the area in the shape

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.840
of a rectangle.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.440
Now if you want to create a perfect square you would hold down and drag and then click shift or press

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.410
shift and that will create a perfect square and different.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.060
And you can drag to create different sizes.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.150
The next tool that we'll be using is the Lasso tool which is the one right underneath the marquee tool

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.380
.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.500
So with this tool you can do a lot of things with.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.210
Also it works very much like the marquee tool except you can create your own organic shapes so with

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.810
the Lasso tool we can draw our shape.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.490
So let's create a nice squiggly line and connect them closer shape.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.290
And now we've created a shape that we can now grab and move.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.910
So let's undo that.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:23.610
So now if we use the other Lasso tool which is the Polygonum Lasso tool we can create shapes also but

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.970
they will be Pawley gone.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:34.770
So we just click around the page we can create a shape that is now nice and rigid and is a polygon and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.790
we can grab the shape and move it around the page.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.070
So let's undo that.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.400
So go ahead and experiment with these tools that I showed you.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.580
And once you've done that you can go ahead and move on to the next part of the course.
