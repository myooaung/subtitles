00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:01.590
All right guys.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.470
Now let's go ahead and create the next piece of our castle.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:14.010
So I've created a new folder called the ark 4 and I'm going to create a new layer and there are going

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.960
to turn this tower off so we can see our sketch behind him.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.770
And the first thing we'll do is we're going to draw out the shape of this little note you would call

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.470
it kind of looks like a house or a cottage or just going to trace that guy out

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.590
.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.120
and then we are going to fill them with a gradient of that blue and that purple

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.850
now will add a new layer above that and we're going to trace out this roof

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:20.380
and we're going to fill that in with a gradient between this red and this orange.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.880
We want it to go from orange to red like that.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.400
So we do that right? looks good.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:40.920
Now we're going to add a new layer and using this light orange using a brush tool with a hard edge.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.570
We're going to click hold down shift and click and we'll do that once more click hold down shift and

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.100
click.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.380
Now we're going to using our race we're told we're going to race the unwanted areas

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.670
like so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.400
and we are going to grab that layer and nudge it up just a bit.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:24.510
Now we're going to add a layer beneath that and we're going to create a shape like that and we're going

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.910
to fill that in with this red

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.690
.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.190
Now we're going to create a doorway so I add a new layer and we'll create a shape with our Lasso tool

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.500
that is shaped like a door.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.050
Then we're going to fill that in with this dark blue

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:05.490
and we're going to select our first shape and then press control shift I to invert the selection and

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.060
then we're going to press delete to delete that little area down there.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.770
Next we are going to select our doorway shape then using our brush and selecting this color.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.180
We're going to create a straight line there.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.160
I mean make that a bit thicker there and there.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.030
Now lastly we're going to add to our tapestry to the top or the peak of our roof.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.810
So add a new layer and we want it to be behind all of our roof layers using our elliptical tool.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.050
We're going to create an oval and we're going to fill that in with our other green tapestry color so

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.000
we'll turn this guy back on and we're going to select these two colors.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.160
We'll turn it back off and then we'll go ahead and fill we want to start with the darker color.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.380
Add a new layer fill with the wider.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.580
Add a new layer and fill it the darker and we're going to shrink them down

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.180
shrink to the next layer down.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.370
Make sure your unselected out of him and select the next layer and we'll shrink him down.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.320
Then merge those layers

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.150
then we're going to rotate them and resize them like so

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:16.920
then we're going to select the shape of that layer add a new layer drag it underneath and it will fill

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.050
that shapen with a dark blue.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:39.460
Then we're going to nudge him over like so then we'll turn down the opacity about there is good that

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:48.390
will merge those two layers then we'll erase out this unwanted area.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.410
And you've just created your fourth part to your castle
