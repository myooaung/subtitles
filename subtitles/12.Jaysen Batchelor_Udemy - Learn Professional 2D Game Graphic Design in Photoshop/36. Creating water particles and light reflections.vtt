00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.600
We are so close now to finishing to our background the one of the last things you want to do is we want

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.220
to add some particles to our water.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
So what we're going to do is we're going to add a new layer.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.250
And on this layer we're just going to make some white random dots on our water

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.530
and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.870
then we're going to shrink our brush down and create some smaller dots

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:07.240
then we are going to come up to filters blurred and Box Blur and we're going to keep it at four.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.690
Then we want to bring down the opacity

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.450
to about 40 percent then using our race tool on an opacity of a 4.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.390
We are going to erase away some of our particles

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.800
.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.540
We want to leave the lightest part of the particles and our light rays over here.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.400
All right.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.990
Now the next thing we want to do is we want to add a light reflection from the water that will be reflecting

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.930
up onto our islands.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.260
So the way we'll do that is we'll add a new layer will come down to our island will select its shape

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:06.120
then we can close that back up then we're going to select this blue here and then using our brush tool

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.300
with a soft edge.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.280
We are going to create a line on our new layer straight across our water line

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.310
go a little bit higher like so then we're going to select our water shape and we're going to delete

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.700
out the area that's underneath the water.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.180
Now we're going to put our layer on lighten so and it will bring down the opacity.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.610
Now we'll do the same thing for this island and we're just going to keep it on the same layer.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.350
So it will come down to our floating island

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.510
and well-selected selected shape

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.460
then we're going to paint the bottom edges of our island.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.910
So you might want to race away a little bit up here because it wouldn't be catching as much as of the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.000
light.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.040
Let's actually bring down the opacity a little bit more to about 30 percent
