00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.630
Let's talk about layers now layers are a very important part of Photoshop.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.020
And what make it so great.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.770
So if we come over here to the bottom right hand corner you'll see our layers area.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.740
Right now we only have one layer it's labeled layer 0 to add another layer.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.410
We come down to this icon that looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.100
It's right between the trash can and the folder.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.600
So go ahead and click that and it will add another layer.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.090
Now what we can do is we can come over and select a color and use our brush tool to create a squiggle

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.160
.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.150
Now this brushstroke is on Layer 1 and layer 0 is a completely separate layer.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.920
So if we turn off layer one by clicking on the eye icon it turns it off.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.180
But our layer 0 is unaffected.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.110
We can turn that back on and I'll further illustrate this by adding a third layer.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.900
So let's come over here and select a new color let's choose green.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.810
And now we can paint on top of that layer and this green squiggle is on its own separate layer now.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.960
So if we turn that layer off you'll see it doesn't affect the red layer.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.270
Another cool thing you can do with layers is you can switch places so if we click and if we grab layer

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.200
2 we can drag it down underneath layer 1 and they switch places which is really helpful to do for doing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.600
a lot of things in Photoshop.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.580
Now some people get a little confused about layers so I'm going to illustrate this for you guys who

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.380
are having a hard time with it.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.630
So if you come over here to our layer's area let's imagine that each layer is like a sheet of glass

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.240
and it's stack of glass or a stack of sheets of glass.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.690
The bottom layer is on the bottom of the stack and the top layer is on the top of the stack on each

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.560
sheet of glass.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.150
We can paint and create images on them.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.270
So if we were to come up to our free paint on Layer 2 that is the sheet of glass in the middle of these

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.710
two sheets of glass so we can paint on that.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.260
And when we turn that layer off all we're doing is we're removing that sheet of glass and bringing it

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.280
back when we turn it back on.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.210
I find that's a very simple and easy way to think about layers.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.700
Go ahead and mess around with the lares see what you can do with it.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.340
And once you've had a little bit of practice with that you can go ahead and move onto the next part

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.620
of the course.
