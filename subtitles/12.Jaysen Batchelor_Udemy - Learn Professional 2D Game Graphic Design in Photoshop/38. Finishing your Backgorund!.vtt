00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.030
We're basically done with our background.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.770
There's just one last adjustment I want to make before we finish up.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.000
And that is to bring down the opacity on our floating islands.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.800
And the reason for this is because the further away something is the lighter it's going to be like our

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.860
mountains in the background for example.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.350
So what we're going to do is we're just going to select their folder and bring down the opacity and

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.140
that will bring down the opacity of all the layers in that folder.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.760
We're going to bring down the opacity on our smaller floating island to about 50 percent then we're

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.200
going to select our larger floating island and we'll bring that opacity down to about 90 percent.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
Remember there is not one sure way to create digital artwork.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700
There's all kinds of different ways.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.050
And I've just taught you the techniques that I use to create my digital artwork and I hope they help

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.260
you in creating art for your games or backgrounds or jobs creating games and backgrounds.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.490
If you have any questions go ahead and ask.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.350
I will be answering every single question that I get from this course.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.160
I also appreciate constructive feedback and a rating from you.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.980
I hope you've enjoyed this course and that it's been helpful for you.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.570
And you can go ahead and move onto the bonus part of this chorus which is where and how to find jobs

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.330
doing this.
