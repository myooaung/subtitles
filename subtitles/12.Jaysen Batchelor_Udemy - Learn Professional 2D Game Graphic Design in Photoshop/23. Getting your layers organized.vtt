00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.400
We've now created our first architectural piece for our castle and what we want to do now is we want

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.520
to get a little bit organized.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.120
So we'll come over to our layers and we're going to select all of our layers except for our drawing

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:25.310
and our reuse layers and we're going to stick them in a folder and we'll call that folder there

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.400
are 1

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.620
open it back up and now we need to do some merging and some are relabelling.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.720
So we're going to merge each piece of our castle or at least each piece of our architectural piece into

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.790
one layer so we can keep track of them better.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.040
For example our railing we are going to merge that into one layer and we'll label it railing

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.270
and we'll just continue to do that call that Windows

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.080
doorway

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.840
.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.800
By

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.240
spire

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.280
large cylinder we're actually going to merge our doorway and our large cylinders.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.770
So we're going to bring our doorway down next to our large cylinder and then we're going to merge them

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.650
Then

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.570
we have another Spyer

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.740
another Spier

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.690
call this large.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.190
So our sorry small cylinder.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.860
Then let's merge these two layers together.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.240
So now that's one layer and we'll call it let

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.150
all merge our finial pieces together and we'll call it finial

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.020
we'll call this roof
