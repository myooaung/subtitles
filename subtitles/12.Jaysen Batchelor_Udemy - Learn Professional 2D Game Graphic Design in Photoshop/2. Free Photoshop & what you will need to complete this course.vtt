00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.910
Let's go over what you'll be needing to complete this course.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.660
So the first thing that you're going to need to complete this course is photoshop.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.130
Now if you don't have photoshop you can download a 30 day free trial from the Adobes download page which

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.240
I will leave a link to.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.650
I'll leave a link to every page that I refer to in this course for you guys.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.220
Now the way to download the 30 day trial is by either clicking on the icon or the text link for Photoshop

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.820
.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.510
From there they're going to ask you for some information.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.090
And after that it's pretty self-explanatory.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.690
Now if you're planning on making money from creating digital art for animations or games which I assume

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.900
most of you are because you're taking this course you're going to need to buy Photoshop.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.800
Now the way Adobe works is you pay for a monthly subscription fee and for Photoshop which is this package

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.180
right here it's 1999 a month which I think is a pretty damn good deal for all the things you can produce

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.960
with Photoshop.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.260
Now you're also going to need a drawing tablet of some sorts one that you can plug into a computer and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.540
draw with.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.920
Now it's said that way comm makes the best tap drawing tablets.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.370
And I would agree.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.730
I use a tablet but I've also never used any other drawing tablets made by other companies so I cannot

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.260
say whether or not there are better tablets out there but for me my tablet has worked great and mine

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.620
is a way tablet.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920
Now let me show you what tablet exactly.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.980
I am using the tablet I'm using is the way comm bamboo tablet which has worked really well for me.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
I haven't had any problems with it and it produces great artwork.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.460
Now you can spend a little bit more money and get something better.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.570
You spend less and get worse.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.420
I bought mine use which made it even cheaper.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.680
I paid less than $100 for it.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.040
So if you'd rather not pay retail price for it you can go ahead and buy a used one.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.460
Now the last thing you're going to need for this course is some basic drawing skills.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.450
And by that I just mean you need to be able to look at an object perceive it and draw the basic shapes

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.780
of it.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.900
You also are going to need to be able to draw just some basic straight lines.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.410
Other than that it's that's that's basically all you're going to need for this course.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.090
So I'm excited.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.340
Let's jump right in and get started.
