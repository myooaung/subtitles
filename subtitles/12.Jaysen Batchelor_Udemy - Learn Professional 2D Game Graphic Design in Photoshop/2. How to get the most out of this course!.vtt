00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.350
I really appreciate you guys taking this course and deciding to learn from me.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.720
It means a lot to me.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.820
Now remember if you have any questions at all about this course about game design anything that has

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.650
to do with digital artwork you can go ahead and ask it here in the Q and A section of the course so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.440
you just click on the Q&A and it'll bring you to this page.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.290
And on this page you can search a question or you can ask a new question.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.170
So please please if you have any questions or you're confused about anything please ask them.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.620
I would love to answer them.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.580
My goal here is to help you succeed.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
I want you to become the graphic designer that you want to be.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.700
Also I ask that you add a little comment in here.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.370
So if you go to ask a new question I want everybody to ask a new question but you're not going to be

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.430
asking a question you're just going to be sent telling a little bit about yourself so you'll put a title

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.290
in and then you'll come down here and I just want you to give like two maybe even three sentences about

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.470
who you are what you're doing.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.150
And other students will get involved with you.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.550
I really want this to become a community where we can help each other become the artists that we want

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.440
to be to become the people we want to be and to do the things we want to do.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.140
Thanks for listening to this lecture.
