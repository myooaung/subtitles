00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.710
So what we'll do is we will merge all these layers

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:18.870
then we will select our bubble window and copy it and we'll come back into our background document and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.260
we'll paste it.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.640
And we want to make sure that we're piecing it underneath our shadow layer for our cavern not that layer

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.540
sorry this layer right there.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.490
So you want to make sure you're underneath that layer because you want the shadow to also be cast on

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.110
our bubble Windows since they're inside the cabin.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.370
So go ahead and paste and it will resize

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.880
and we'll just start sticking these guys around in archiver

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:42.460
.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:58.690
Awesome

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:18.810
.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.020
Now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.280
that we've placed all of our bubble windows we need to create some shadows for them and the way we'll

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.130
do that is by first merging all of our bubble windows together into one layer.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.540
So find our first bubble was right there.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:50.490
Hold down shift and select all of those layers merge them and now we will select all of our shapes on

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:59.110
that layer then create a new layer and bring it underneath our window layer.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.780
Now using a dark blue color.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.990
Let's go a little bit darker almost black.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.930
We'll fill those shapes in.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.480
And then using the Graben moved tool will nudge those down

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.090
like so.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.820
And then we want to turn down the opacity

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.380
right about there is good.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.050
You just created your bubble windows for your cavern.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.960
Your background should really be looking cool at this point.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.830
Hope you're excited.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.960
Now let's go ahead and move on to the next part of the course
