00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.150
Now we're going to create our railing that goes around to our castle.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.600
So the first thing we'll do is we'll create an oval on top of our first cylinder so come all the way

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:24.030
up to our top layer and we're going to come to our elliptical tool will Create a cylinder or sorry not

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.800
a cylinder an elliptical and we'll fill that in with this dark red.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.220
Go ahead and fill that in.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720
Let's create a new layer for it.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030
Then we'll fill it in.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.930
Then let's shrink it down just a bit

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.350
.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.370
Now create a new layer.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.000
We'll fill that in with black then will shrink it down and we want to shrink it down so it fits

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870
into our cylinder.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.350
The width of it at least

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.540
then will come back down to our red elliptical and we'll delete that selection.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.190
So I'll see we've deleted that area.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.240
Then we can delete our black layer.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.350
Now add a new layer and using this light red color

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.730
there is its color.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.080
Now on our new layer we're going to create a horizontal line like so then we'll do a second line underneath

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:15.150
it and then create a new layer above that and we'll create a vertical line like so

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:31.020
then we'll select it and copy paste it and position it next to the first vertical line and we'll paste

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.590
it once more

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.790
and you'll see they automatically line up with the same distance between them.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.010
So we'll just continue doing that and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.390
then will merge all of this together

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:30.840
.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.290
So now that's one layer and then we're going to delete this edge away

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:53.100
and then we'll copy this paste it and align it next to it to continue our railing

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.680
against it.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.520
One last time

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.050
and there was our relic.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:17.220
Let's merge those three layers together and then we're going to cut off the edges of our top and bottom

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.970
railing

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:30.660
.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.920
Now we'll select railing will move him down

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.000
and using command t will resize them

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.320
then using the warp tool.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.540
We're going to warp him around our cylinder shaped

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.830
like so.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.440
And there is our railing.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.630
Now we're going to create a loop for this little cylinder up here.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:04.800
So what we'll do is we'll come to that cylinders later then we will copy the top of the cylinder and

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:14.760
paste them and resize them so is a bit larger than the original cylinder.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.430
And then we'll delete the bottom of him

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.370
about there is good.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.880
At least

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:39.340
we'll bring him below our cylinder and then we'll add a new layer.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.440
And we will create an elliptical on this layer

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.720
and we will fill it in with this color

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.750
then we'll nudge him up

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.250
then we're going to grab our small cylinder and we are going to nudge him down

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.500
like so

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:38.590
next we are going to select our elliptical shape and we are going to paint in a shadow.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.130
So using this blue color

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:52.750
and make sure you have a brush with a soft edge and we'll keep our opacity at four.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:02.350
Come down to our elliptical layer and we're going to paint in the center area like so
