Next we're going to add a hue and saturation on top of our bottom three layers.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.620
So will go to human saturation and that then we're going to bring the darkness down about halfway maybe

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.720
a little bit less than half about negative 37 then we're going to nudge our color a little bit more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.730
towards the green side.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:40.680
Next we're going to come into our island folder and we're going to select our island shape then we can

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.370
close out of that.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.890
Then our water background folder we are going to add a new layer and we're going to fill it in with

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650
a dark dark blue

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:04.920
and we're going to grab it and then we're going to grab it and move it and we will shrink it down

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.420
and move it into place.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.390
About there looks good.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.770
Then we're going to bring down the opacity
