00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.930
Now let's create our highlight for our castle so well select our cylinder shape and using our brush

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.220
tool with a soft edge.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.660
We're going to use this color and make sure that your opacity is down to five.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.700
We're going to click hold down Shift come down to here and click and that'll give us a nice line.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.700
We'll do the same on this side.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.770
Click.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.420
Hold down shift and then click.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.410
Now let's do that.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.770
Now let's add actually a second layer to that highlight because all of these buildings here would be

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.980
causing less of a highlight on this edge because the light from behind it couldn't pass it.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.090
So up here there's going to be a little bit more of a highlight So we'll add a little bit more there

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.170
.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.280
whoops it's too far in.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.440
So just like that then we'll add then we'll select our smaller cylinder and go into that layer and we'll

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.570
do the same thing this time.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.170
Make sure that your opacity is up to zero.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.380
That actually might be a bit too much.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.130
So let's do

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.570
it.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.700
Let's move on to our cone.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.790
So we'll select them then let's add a new layer.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.990
And using this orange color let's actually make it a little bit brighter.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.680
Right.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.620
So that's the color we'll be using.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.920
Now we'll take our brush and paint along the edge

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.770
then using our arrays tool we'll put the opacity on five.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.840
We're going to race out this little area.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.790
Now we'll switch back to our brush tool and we'll use this yellow color

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.810
we'll bring our brush size down and we'll paint in that edge of our cone

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.920
.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.270
Now we want to copy these and save them for later.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.260
So go ahead and copy our first cylinder.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.930
Come down here to our folder and we'll paste and we'll actually get rid of this first guy that we created

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.580
because we're actually not going to need him because I forgot about our highlights that we were going

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.240
to mean to delete him.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.010
Keep the one with the highlights.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.650
Then we will copy our smaller cylinder

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.450
and paste them then we'll rename our folder.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.680
