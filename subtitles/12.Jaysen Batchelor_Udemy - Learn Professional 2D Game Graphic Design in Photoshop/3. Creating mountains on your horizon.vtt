00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.490
Let's put some mountains out on our horizon line.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.100
So first before we do that let's merge our two cloud layers the way you do that is that you'll click

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:21.000
on both layers using control and then you'll right click on them and you'll come to merge layers and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.360
select that and that will merge two layers together so now they're one layer.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.490
Let's add a new layer and call it mountains.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.080
Now let's bring our values layer to the very top.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:52.880
And let's put it on multiply so we can see our color and are drawn at the same time.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.260
So what we're going to do is we're going to trace our mountain line.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.640
So grab our Lasso tool make sure on the polygon a Lasso tool and we're going to trace the same basic

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.690
shape that we have here

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:18.700
.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.830
Now on our mountains layer let's fill that in.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.970
We're going to use this blue right here but we're going to Dargan it just a titch bit.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.460
It's come down a little bit.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.950
And then we'll go ahead and fill that in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.510
select out of that.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.460
Now let's bring our value layer back down and there's our mountains.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.530
Now these mountains are really far away so they'll probably be a little bit out of focus so we're going

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.760
to add a bore effect to them.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:27.690
So let's select our mountain layer and then we'll come up to filter's lawyer and then box blur.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.230
Now we can select how blurry we want our mountains to look.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760
So right now we have it at two.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.960
Let's try five.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.170
It's a little bit too blurry.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.770
Let's try four.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.030
All right.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.140
Let's go with three.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.780
That looks good and creating our mountains is as simple as that.
