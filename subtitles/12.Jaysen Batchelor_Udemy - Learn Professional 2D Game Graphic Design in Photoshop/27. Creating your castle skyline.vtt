00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.820
Now let's quickly organize our folders so they're in the right order.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.290
So we turn that guy on and then we want our Center tower to be in the front.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.270
So we're going to grab his folder and bring him to the top.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.510
Then we want our house to be next.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.170
So we'll grab his folder and we'll bring him to the top.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.120
Then we want our next tower to be this tower.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.030
And he's already there and this guy is in the right position too.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.750
So now we can go ahead and create a new folder and we want it to be underneath the ark for actually

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720
we can just create it in the same, no.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.470
Let's create a new folder and we'll call it art 5.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:01.260
Then we're going to open arc four and we're going to merge all of the layers then we're going to copy

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.500
it

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.030
then we'll come back into our five and paste

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.640
then we want to flip the sky.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.890
The flip horizontal tool.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.670
And we're also going to resize them just a bit.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.960
Now we're going to create our skyline and the way we'll do that is we'll select our layer then we're

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.730
going to create a new folder and we want him to be on the very bottom of our folders stack and we're

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.140
going to call a skyline

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.160
and then we're going to create a new layer in that folder.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.170
Then we're going to fill him with this color and we're going to bring it down just a little bit.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.200
So it's a bit darker and we'll fill him in.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:15.480
Then we'll drag him out from behind there and then we are going to come into our arc one folder and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.510
find our finial layer.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.850
There it is and we'll select it then we're going to copy our finial.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.510
Actually we just want to select the shape so we'll select it by clicking the layer and we can close

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.810
that back up and we'll come back into our skyline folder and add a or yes add a new layer and fill that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.040
in with our Color Purple and we can grab that guy and drag them down.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.590
We'll rotate them and resize them.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.350
Awesome and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.690
reposition them.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.680
Then we're going to merge those two layers.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:26.520
So now that's one layer then we're going to copy that and whoops one to copy that and paste it then

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.720
we're going to flip up

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.590
and we're going to warp this or distort the sky a little bit using the distort tool and that just allows

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.150
us to grab points and warp or not work but distort our image

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.810
.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.680
So looking a little bit too distorted

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:11.490
that's Good then we're going to paste one more time and we're going to flip them

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.870
and this guy we're going to shrink down just a little bit

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.430
like so and we'll even rotate them

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.710
and we're going to use our brush tool to fill in this empty space.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.840
And there you are.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.120
We're just about done with our castle
