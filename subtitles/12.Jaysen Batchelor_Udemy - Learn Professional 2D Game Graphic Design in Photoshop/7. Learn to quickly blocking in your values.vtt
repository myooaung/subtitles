00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.370
We can now move on to locking in our our values are saying I'm going to do is I'm going to add a second

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.960
layer and I'm going to change it to multiply.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:25.320
Well this allows us to do is it allows us to paint on top of our image but we can still see our image

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.420
through it.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.620
Someone going to go ahead and start blogging in my callers are value sorry

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.840
I use my fill tool make sure it's on the paint bucket.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.590
Fill that in

00:00:46.620 --> 00:01:05.440
.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.960
Now we want to do here is we just want to give a general value to each part of our background so for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.980
our island.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.660
We want to give it a dark value for Castle.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.570
We're going to have probably a white value and we want to give a value to our sky and we also need to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.310
give a value to our floating islands.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.360
And this is just to help guide us throughout the rest of the creation of this background.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.870
So we're not guessing on how light or dark things should be.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.430
We know that the island is dark floating islands are dark and the castles are white and the sky is a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.210
light gray

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.570
the way you make things stand out in an image and give it a focal point is by adding contrast.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.440
So our castle is going to be our focal point.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.190
Sarcasm is going to be very white and our sky is going to have a dark gradient behind it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.700
.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:34.170
Now just to keep my paint from going into the water I'm only selecting this top area that's outside

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.320
of the water.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.280
So that way when I paint it can't see over to my water side

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:52.080
.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.670
So we're just going to leave that castle white

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.560
and we'll give these floating islands the same value as our island in the water

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.190
.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.220
Let's give a darker value to our grass on our floating islands

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.220
.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.080
Now we're ready to add a value to our sky the way we're going to do this is we're going to add a third

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.970
layer and make sure that it's behind a layer one and we're going to use our fill tool but we're going

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.170
to use the gradient tool and we're going to select a light gray.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.710
We want to make sure it's lighter than this great so that the sand out so user eyedropper tool which

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.130
is this tool over here on the left hand side and click on that color that value and it all selected

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.430
for you down here in your color picker.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.900
We want it a little bit lighter than that so let's come up.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.900
And now we can use our fill tool and create a gradient across there.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.760
Whoops I forgot to put it on multiplies so let's put our layer on multiply.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.160
Now let's try it.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.940
Good.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.820
Now I want our gradient going in a different direction so I'm going to redo that.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.450
Got graded are gray is a little too light so I'm going to bring it down just a bit

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.150
.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.450
I think that's about good.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.220
So our castle is no longer white because our grading is going right through.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.250
So what we're going to do is we're going to erase the gradient wherever the castle is.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.330
We also don't really want a gradient going through our water so let's select our water area and delete

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.400
the gradients out of it.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.250
Just make sure that you have your gradient layer selected when you do that

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:22.810
.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.140
So right now we are just erasing the gradient.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.500
We're not painting it white.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.550
We're just erasing

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:44.560
.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.100
Now one last thing I want to do to us things I want to do actually is first I want to add more of a

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.830
canyon look under the water.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.360
So I'm going to come back to our water layer.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:12.540
I'm going to select this color and I'm just going to kind of add a little bit of a rocky look over here

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.580
kind of finish off our canyon

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.450
.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.110
Now I want our water to have a little bit of a glow so we're going to select this gray the water gray

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:40.730
and then I'm going to come up a bow a third higher and then I'm going to enlarge my brush.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:51.030
It's come up to our brushes and let's select one with a softer edge and let's bring the size up to save

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.340
500 pixels.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.220
Let's go a little bit bigger.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.280
Let's go with 800 pixels.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.880
That's good.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.290
So now what we want to do is we want to paint in a glow

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:32.540
.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.240
I think we want to add some mountains on our horizon.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:44.100
So when I add a new layer above our sky layer and I want to select everything outside of the water

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:56.650
and let's choose a gray that is a little bit darker than this gray.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.740
that was my paint brush I can

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.570
paint in some mountains

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.920
and

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:27.650
let's erase

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.230
All right.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.390
This is looking good.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.450
We can go ahead and move on
