00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's go ahead and move on to the brush tool.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.140
Now the brush tool is a very important tool in Photoshop especially in what we're going to be doing

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.410
.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.800
So let's go ahead and select it.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.390
It's this little brush icon that you'll see on the left hand side of your screen.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.070
So go ahead and select it.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.540
The hot key for it is the letter B.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.420
So you can press be on your keyboard and that will also select it.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.540
Now that we have a selected let's create a brush stroke.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.740
So you do that by clicking on the screen and dragonet.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.730
It's as simple as that.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.150
You can draw squiggles with it you can draw smiley faces.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.080
It's just like a normal paintbrush.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.050
Now you can change the color of your paint brush by coming over here to the left hand left hand side

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.580
of the screen and selecting the color.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.170
Now you can move your cursor around the color picker window and choose whatever color you'd like.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.220
So let's choose a green.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.130
Now we can create a green brushstroke.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
There's different types of brushes that you can use in Photoshop and I'll show you where they're up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.520
here and the right hand side of the screen.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.580
It's this little icon that looks like a can with paint brushes in it.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.750
So go ahead and select that and you'll see we have a wide array of brushes we can choose from so if

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.140
we go ahead and choose one that has a different texture to it let's increase the size so we can see

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.600
it.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.570
You'll see that we get a different kind of effect.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.340
The go ahead and play with those and see what kind of effects you can get out of them.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.160
Now you can also change things with your brushes you have different options down here.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640
Let's select a brush that we can change all the options on.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.270
So if you select this guy we can change the size oven.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.510
We can also change the hardness of them which increases and decreases the heart and softness of the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.100
edge of your brush.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.520
We can also change the spacing between our brushes and the reason why you might want to do that is because

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.540
let's say you wanted to create a bunch of grass so you selected this grass brush.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.420
Now you can increase the spacing and it's increased the size also.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.790
And now you can create something that looks something like grass rather than having your brush really

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.410
close together.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.040
And that does not look like grass.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.530
Now there's also a way that you can change the size of your brush with hot keys which is what you're

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.400
going to want to do.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.590
Because if every time you want to change the size of your brush and you have to come up here and manually

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.010
drag this back and forth it's going to take forever.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.580
So the hot to change the sides of your brush is different in Mac and Windows.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.730
So I'll tell you what they are for both of them.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.150
So for Windows it's going to be old and then right click and drag your cursor back and forth left and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.990
right and that will increase and decrease the size of your brush and Mac.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.320
It's going to be Option Command and you'll do the same exact things option.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.720
Man and then you'll just drag it back and forth and that will increase and decrease the size of your

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.020
brush.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.490
Now while you're doing this you'll see you can also change the opacity by dragging your brush your cursor

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.030
up or down and what opacity is that's just how see through your brush is going to appear.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.490
So right now we have about 100 percent.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.420
So if we decrease it let's say we decrease it to say 30 percent.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.140
Now when we paint with it you'll see that our brush stroke is transparent which is very useful for certain

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.960
things.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.310
So that's about it for the brush.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.530
So go ahead and play around with that.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.110
Test it try some different things and you can go ahead and move on to the next part of the course.
