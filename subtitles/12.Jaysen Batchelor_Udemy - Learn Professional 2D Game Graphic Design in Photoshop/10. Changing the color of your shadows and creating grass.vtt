00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.950
Before we go any further let's label our layers

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.130
so we can now go ahead and merge our two shadow layers

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.890
.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.190
And let's name the layer chateaus and we'll do that for all of our players

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:51.390
.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.440
Now we want to change the color of our shadows so right now it's just a plain black shadow but we want

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.260
our shadows to feel a little bit cool so we are going to change the levels on it to bring them to more

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.700
of a blue color and the way we do that is we'll select them

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.930
then we'll come to our levels which is this little guy right here.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.550
Then we'll come to our blue

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.850
and we will slide this across to change the levels of blue and we want more blue.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.120
So we're going to slide out a little bit towards the blue side and we want to take some of that red

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.680
out because we don't want it to look very purple So we're going to take a little bit of red out

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.410
like that.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.380
And now we just want to do that on the rest of our layers.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.930
Now that we've changed the colors on all of our shadows we're going to create some grass for our floating

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.860
islands.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.030
So let's start with our larger floating island first.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.210
So what we'll do is we'll add a new layer then we'll grab our brush

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.000
and using this bluish green color we are going to paint in a solid shape for grass.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.960
So act as the base color and sort of as the shadow for the grass.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.250
You'll see what I mean here in a second

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:57.370
.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.220
Right now we are going to grab this a lighter green color

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.870
and we're going to shrink our brush size them.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.210
Now let's go ahead and zoom in so you can really see what we're doing.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.430
what we're going to do is we're just going to start painting strokes that look like grass just like

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.540
that.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.540
We'll just continue to do this on both layers of grass

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.420
.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.530
You want to make sure they look a little random a little organic.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.130
So some of them will crisscross

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:08.920
.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.960
Now I'll move onto our top layer.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.270
Our top level I mean

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.450
.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.920
That's good.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.560
Maybe a little bit more down here.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.530
Really what is grass.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.920
I seem to be hanging over a lot.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.690
Very overgrown and sagging.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.920
All right.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:52.550
Now let's grab a lighter color and let's Najah a bit more towards the yellow side

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.780
and we'll use that for the highlight for our grass

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.660
to start painting like so

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.250
move to the second layer level

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:23.890
.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:30.330
And now we've created a really cool grass look and go ahead and do that on your second island and then

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.300
we can move on to the next part of our course.
