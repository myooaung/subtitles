00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.400
Let's go ahead and relabel these two layers are cast shadow and our castle so-called Castle castle

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.040
and will color cast shadows cast shadows

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.710
.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.760
So I just wanted to talk a little bit about real quick how to make the process of creating your artwork

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.960
faster.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.170
So when we created our castle and our island you notice that we reused a lot of the same parts like

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.400
our cylinders were all the same cylinders and our finials were all the same.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.920
Finials We reused both these two house type structures.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.670
Same with our windows and our tectonic plates.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.500
So that's a big way that you can create backgrounds a lot faster by reusing pieces and parts of other

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.110
parts of your background or even using different parts from other backgrounds in your game or animation

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.880
and reusing them in another background.
