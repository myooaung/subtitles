00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.460
Now that we've chosen our thumbnail Let's go ahead and further design and detail it.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.590
So what we'll do is we'll grab our marquee tool and select the thumbnail that we've chosen.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.570
Now we're going to cut it out of the page by going control X on your keyboard on a Mac.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.440
It is command X..

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
Now let's create a new page or a new document.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:39.670
Let's make it 1000 by 1000.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:50.820
Let's go ahead and copy and paste that guy in by pressing control V on a Windows and command the Mac

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.190
.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.910
Now that we have that in there we're going to create a rectangle by using our shape tool over here on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.710
the left hand side.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:09.300
It's going to click and drag and that'll create a nice perfect rectangle.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.470
Now let's add a new layer above that.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.530
So that way it doesn't affect any of our other layers.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:23.550
And most select the brush tool we can now start drawing redrawing our thumbnail that we created previously

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.140
.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.490
And but this time around we are going to add some more detail and we might change it up a little bit

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.280
and just figure out what's going to make this background really work.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.110
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.820
So I want to create a straight line first off.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.420
And the way you do that in Photoshop is with a paint brush is by holding down shift as you paint.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.450
So you'll see I'm holding down shift right now that allows me to make the very straight line.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.240
I'm going to grab that line.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.160
I'm going to move it down just a bit about the brush.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.140
Now you can get drawn so I think for my island I want one island that looks very.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.550
I want to be able to see the tectonic plates very well as like as if they're coming out of the ocean

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.820
out of the ground you know pushing now.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.360
Just gives a really cool visual look to the piece.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.350
And we have some sort of a castle up here.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.450
Not exactly sure what it's going to look like yet but we'll get to that later.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.330
For now you just kind of want to fill in the spaces and kind of get the basic detail and the basic gist

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.980
of what it is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:03:07.760
.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.180
I'm also going to be cool if there were some sort of underwater part of this castle like it came down

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.410
into the mountain and then there were there were some kind of underwater world underneath here like

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.450
Windows and be like bubble windows.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.030
I'm just going to start sketching in some little shapes and things that I think take it somewhere

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:50.240
.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.600
I also think I'm going to get rid of this treehouse type building because I feel like it's just really

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.280
in the way and it's not I don't know I just don't really want it.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.260
So I'm going to take him out and I think I'm going to shift these floating islands over to the right

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.650
side of our image because I'm thinking this is going to be a menu for game so right about here in the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.340
center of our image I think we're going to have a menu on display.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.810
So I'm going to take this guy out and shift these guys over

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.500
and that's what designing and doing thumbnails is all about it's about creating and recreating and until

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.690
you get it the way you want it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:47.240
.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.130
Now I'm going to pick this island up because I don't really want them there.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.290
And I just put a circle around them so I'm going to show you two tricks right now.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.220
So the first one is how to undo something the way you undo something in Photoshop is by pressing control

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.620
Z.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.450
And on a Mac I believe it has a command Z.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.190
The other thing I want to show you is I want to grab the sky and move them somewhere else.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.840
And I also want to resize them.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.120
So I'm going to grab them with my marquee tool.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.920
Now I'm going to go to my grab a move tool and I can move them wherever I want now.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.800
And he's a separate thing even though he's still on the same layer but he's the only part of this letter

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.790
that I have selected.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.750
It's only moving in.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.440
Now I want to resize them so to do that.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.160
I'm going to press control T and on Mac it's command T.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.020
And now I can change the size of the size of them to whatever I want to keep them proportional.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.620
I'm going to hold down shift and now I can shrink them and help keep his proportions and just press

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.350
enter.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.150
And we have resized our floating island to unselected just click out of him

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.700
.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:18.020
I think there's going to be some sort of far off sort of underwater canyon out there

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.400
and some clouds.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.730
All right.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.120
I think that's I think that's done.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:43.860
So now we can move on to the next part of the course which is creating or not creating But designing

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:50.100
finished designing all of the aspects and pieces of our background so we will we're going to design

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.800
this castle out and we're going to design these islands and we're going design what this mountain looks

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.460
like in this underwater world.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.390
And we're really going to get into it and design it and create.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:07.470
We need to really create those visuals and those shapes instead of rather just having these squiggly

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.950
scribbly images.
