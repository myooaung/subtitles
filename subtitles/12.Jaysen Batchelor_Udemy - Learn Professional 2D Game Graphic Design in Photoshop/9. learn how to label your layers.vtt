I forgot to mention you can also relabel your layers and the way you do that is you will come over here

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.260
to your layer that you want to read label and you'll double click on it's the label that allow you to

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.970
retype the text in there.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.870
So let's call this one background and then press enter.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.840
And now that label is or that layer is relabelled.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.590
This is really useful because if you have a lot of layers in your image on your piece of artwork it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
can get really confusing trying to remember which ones on which layer.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.420
So by labeling them you can just look at the labels and know exactly what's on that layer.
