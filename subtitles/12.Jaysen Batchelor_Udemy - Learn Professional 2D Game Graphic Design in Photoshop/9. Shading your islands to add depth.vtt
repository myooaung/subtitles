00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:10.110
Before we go any further let's go ahead and label our layers because right now they have no labels so

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.370
we'll call base base.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.920
It's called the pink hair pink code.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.090
And let's call the spotted layer texture

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.520
.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.010
Let's do that for all of them.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
Now we have labels on all of our layers.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.130
We're going to start shading our islands.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.850
So let's start with our ground island first and it will select its shape and then let's add a new layer

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.700
above our texture and then using black and our brush.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.570
It doesn't really matter the shape.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.360
We're going to fill in our first tectonic plate.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.320
Now we want to make sure that our opacity is to 50 as you can see right here.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.570
Now we're going to go over that one again.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.490
We're also going to go over the one next to it like so

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.410
now we're going to do that one more time.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.360
But we're going to go to the third tectonic plate

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.640
.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.220
Now that star on the other end

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:04.980
.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.920
Now let's lower the opacity

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.320
about 40 percent.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.260
Should be good.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.630
Now we'll do the same for our floating island

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:07.690
turned

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.950
down that opacity.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.860
And we're going to add some shading on the underside of the grass that will be on top of our floating

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.640
islands the sway it gives it a nice whoops puts bring down the size.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.760
This will give a nice shadow underneath our grass.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.110
Do the same for the top

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.360
.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.330
Now let's do the same for our last island

00:03:48.330 --> 00:04:09.780
.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.320
Now we'll bring down that opacity.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.280
Lastly we're going to add some shadow underneath the bottom of our floating islands because the light

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.200
source is coming from above.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.490
So naturally there wouldn't be very much light underneath our floating islands.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.200
So we'll go ahead and create a new layer

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.800
select our shape and using our brush tool again.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.600
We're just going to add some shadow underneath each tectonic plate

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.750
.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.150
So and that will bring that opacity down.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.710
And let's do the same for the rest of them.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.810
And you layer

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.000
the reason why we're putting this layer on a.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.140
We're sorry.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.840
The reason why we're creating a new layer for the shadows is because we want to be able to control them

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.030
separately from the other shadows

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.320
bring his opacity down.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.140
Great.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.190
That looks good all over shading is done for our islands.
