00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.800
Now let's create our second tower and the way we're going to do that is we're just going to create a

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:14.690
new folder and we'll call it whoops new folder and we'll call it Arc 3

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.730
Then we're going to come back into our ark to folder and we're going to merge all of our layers except

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.050
for our railing.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.140
So now those are all merged and we're going to copy them

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.100
and then we're going to come into our three folder and paste it.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.350
Now going command T and then right clicking.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.490
We're going to flip horizontal

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.140
and we're going to resize them

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.800
like so.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.960
Now we're going to add some sort of a hanging tapestry here on the side of our tower.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.300
So we'll create a new layer using our Lasso tool.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.240
We are going to create our shape

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.860
and we're going to fill that in with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.230
this color the same color we're used for our grass and there's it's color

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.670
then we're going to come back into there into our original document.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:00.210
And we're going to select this lighter green color then we're going to create a new layer and fill that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.240
in and we're going to shrink that damn

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.880
like so so that it fits within our larger darker green tapestry

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:25.940
.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:35.760
Now using our Eraste tool we're just going to let some merge them first and then using our race tool

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.790
.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.950
We're going to erase out the unwanted part of our tapestry.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.280
Now we're going to select our tapestry and then we're going to create a whole new layer underneath it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.580
.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.930
And we are going to fill it with a dark blue

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.450
then we're going to use Comanche and we're going to stretch that out and we're going to rotate them

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.210
just a bit.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.330
Then we want to reposition them.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.360
So then we'll bring down the opacity about there is good.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.160
And we've just created our second tower
