00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.750
Great now you've created the base for your island.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.700
What we want to do next is we have all of these layers with each individual tectonic plate on it and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.260
we don't want that.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.280
So all these layers should be inside of your island folder.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.750
what we're going to do is we are going to select all of them by starting with the top layer coming all

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.670
the way down to the bottom layer.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.930
Hold down shift and select it.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.810
And that will select all of your layers.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.030
Now we're going to Right-Click them and go merge layers.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.020
Now all of those layers have become one layer as you can see.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.580
if we turn it off turns all of them off.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.810
Now we want to go ahead and do the same thing for our floating islands.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.600
So go ahead and paste.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.150
And these guys will have to be shrunken down quite a bit but we'll just do the same exact thing.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.000
We'll just reshape them in size them and put them into place.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.590
Don't worry if they are I mean off this edge.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.800
We'll go ahead and delete those by using our Lasso tool and you can just go ahead and delete.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440
So go ahead and do that.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:37.050
Make sure that you create all of your tectonic plates in a new folder and name it floating island one

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:49.060
for this island and then call create a new folder and call it floating island 2.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.250
So go ahead and continue doing that.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.430
Make sure that you create two new folders for each floating island
