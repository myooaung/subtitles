00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's create our islands now.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.980
So first of all we want to do is we want to create a new layer then let's grab our values layer and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.060
bring it to the top so we can see our drawn.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.800
Now let's use our Lasso tool and we'll trace out one of these tectonic plates

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:43.920
.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.330
All right.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.760
That should be good.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.990
Now let's grab this purple color there is its color right there and we're going to fill our selection

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.410
and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.830
make sure we're on our new layer.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.110
And let's bring our layer in front of our background so you can see it.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.420
Now let's I'm going to use this pink color with my brush.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.390
I'm going to paint the edges of my tectonic plate.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.720
It's kind of hard to see because our drawing is turned on.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:31.260
So let's turn him off and then we just want to get the very edges of our plate doesn't have to be perfect

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.070
because it's a rock it's part of the earth so it can be pretty organic

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.560
.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.260
All right let's unselect out of that.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:56.080
Now let's create a folder and we're going to call this folder island.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.170
Let's drag our new creation into our folder.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.840
And now we're going to do as we're going to copy our atomic play.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.920
Now let's paste them in.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880
So now we have two tectonic plates.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.490
Well let's turn our drawing back on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.020
and let's bring it.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.350
Beneath our tectonic plate.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.970
So what we're going to do now is using Control-C we are going to rotate and change the size of these

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.780
tectonic plates.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.360
And we're just going to continue copying and pasting and putting them into place.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.750
So I'll show you what I mean.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.730
So this guy right here we need him to kind of fit more into our drawing of this the next tectonic plate

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.960
next to this tectonic plate.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.080
So we'll go Comanche.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.780
And by doing that we can rotate it and we can also change the size of it.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.510
That's probably about good to paste another one.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:30.000
Now some of these are wider stuffier and some of them are a lot skinnier.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.300
So continue pasting these tectonic plates and re shaping and sizing them to fit into their spots.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.950
And once you've completed that we can go ahead and move on to creating our floating islands
