00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.040
All right let's cut a hole in our island now before we do that.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.180
Let's relabel our players for the trees so you can see I've already done mine.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.970
I just labeled them tree and you just want to do that for every layer that has a tree on it.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.420
Now the first thing we're going to do to cut out our hole is we need to get into our island folder and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.140
then we are going to come to our bass player then using our Lasso tool.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.140
What we'll do.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.620
Well first let's bring our drawing up above our pink coat and let's turn them on so we can see it.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.360
And now following our drawing We're going to cut out the whole the I guess it's more of a cavern in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280
our island.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
So let's begin and we're cutting out on the base layer

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.740
sweep

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.200
.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.340
Now let's cut him out by pressing delete.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.820
We also want to cut out the shape on our coat.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.780
Now the next step is to first turn off our drawing.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.830
And now what we want to do is select our islands shape and now we're going to add shadows and highlights

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.750
to our whole.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.070
So first we'll start with the highlights.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.040
So let's add a new layer above our pink coat.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.980
And then using the eye dropper we will select our pink color and we'll switch back to our brush and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.500
we're just going to paint the highlight on our whole.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.810
This is what will give it a three dimensional look

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.010
and go ahead and add some I guess texture to it because this is Rock and so it can be very organic looking

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.390
.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.270
All right.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.640
Now let's switch over to a dark purple.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.020
So we'll selected this purple right here.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.290
And we'll just do the same for the top

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:56.660
.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.200
And we're also going to want to get this under side right here because that would also produce a shadow

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.090
.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.570
Next let's bring down the opacity on the Slayer

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.640
85 should do it.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.470
Now we're going to add a new layer underneath our base layer and on this layer we're going to create

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.220
a shape that is a little bit bigger than our whole.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.720
Now we're going to select this dark purple out here or sorry we're going to slide this light purple

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.680
and fill it in.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:20.190
Now we'll create a new layer and we'll grab a dark blue color almost black and then using our brush

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.810
we are going to paint in a shadow for our whole

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.920
right

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.630
.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.290
Good.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.850
Now let's bring down the opacity

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.280
about there should be good.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.440
Now all we have our shape selected.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.680
Let's add a hue and saturation

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.220
and with this we're going to bring down the darkness.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.530
That's good.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.130
And there you have it there is our cavern.
