00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.900
I've now saved my values my value blocking out as a JPEG.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.080
So it's all flattened now and I've reopened it now what we're going to do is we are going to create

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.480
the sky.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.750
So let's first off rename the first layer and let's call it values.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
Let's add a new layer we'll call this one sky

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.860
and we're going to fill our sky layer in with a balloon.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.240
So let's grab our paint can and then we need to select our layer first and then let's come over here

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.530
and I have a blue selected.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.260
Now if you want the exact color that I'm using you can go ahead and copy this number right here and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.100
fill it into your color picker and it will bring up the same exact blue.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.430
So any time I'm picking colors just go ahead and posit the video and type that number in and you'll

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.250
get the same color.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.510
Now I have another blue.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.180
It's a little bit lighter and a little bit more green.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.120
I'm going to select about one there is its color right there its color number.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.640
And now we are going to grab our brush

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.080
and then let's

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.570
let's make the size 1500.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.620
It's.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.550
OK.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.240
Actually let's bring it down a bit.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.060
Let's bring it to 800.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.370
That's better.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.520
Now we want to bring down the opacity on our layers so that we can see your drawing underneath it.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
So this is going to be kind of like where the sun is coming from from behind the mountains kind of like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.010
a sunrise.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.430
So I think it's going to be right almost centered with the castle but a little bit off.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.340
So go ahead and click once.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.040
Now we have a highlight to our sky.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.060
This click one more time just out a little bit more highlight in the sky

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.420
bring our capacity back up.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.300
And there is our sky
