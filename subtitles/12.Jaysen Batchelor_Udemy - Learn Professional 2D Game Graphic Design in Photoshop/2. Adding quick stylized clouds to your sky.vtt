00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.920
And let's put some clouds in our sky first thing we want to do is we want to add a new layer and Let's

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.330
rename it clouds.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.560
Now we're going to do is we are just going to dot the page with a circle brush with a soft edge and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.180
we're going to use the same color we use for the highlight in the sky.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.300
So we'll just begin doing that.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.630
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to achieve some shapes that look sort of like clouds but

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.000
they don't have to be perfect they're going to be very stylized.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.460
So don't worry if they don't look exactly like real clouds it's kind of the idea

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.200
.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.540
All right.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.580
Now that might look kind of funny looking but what we're going to do is we're going to bring down the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:02.690
opacity to about 25 percent so they're really the light can hardly even see them.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.500
I'm thinking we're going to add one more layer of clouds just to give it some depth.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.330
So I'll do the same thing again this time.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.970
This cloud needs to look a little bit different than the first cloud that we created

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.810
.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.980
It's good.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.810
Last spring his opacity down to about 25 percent.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.820
Also there you go.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.240
Those are clouds.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.660
Don't forget to add another layer for your second layer of clouds.
