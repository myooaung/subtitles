00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.310
Next we're going to create a new folder and we're going to drag it down above our background folder

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.090
and we will call it water background

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.860
and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:28.800
then we'll grab our solid blue layer and we will drag them into our water background folder and now

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.070
we're going to come back to our original folder.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.200
And let's name it while we're here and we'll call it water body.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.640
And let's name this Slayer water line.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.320
And now we're going to add a new layer and we want to bring that below the waterline and then using

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:12.700
our gradient tool we're going to create a gradient between white and blue.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.440
So go ahead and create that gradient loops which first want to select our area.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.180
So we'll come down here to our solid blue layer and we'll select that area then we'll create our gradient

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.050
like so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.400
then we're going to put our gradient on multiply like so.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.250
Now we're going to create a new layer and using this blue

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:04.910
we are going to fill our area like so then we're going to put our layer on overlay like so then we'll

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.820
create a new layer and we're going to fill it with this color

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.690
.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.170
Go ahead and fill that then we're going to bring our opacity down to about 15 percent.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.290
Like so
