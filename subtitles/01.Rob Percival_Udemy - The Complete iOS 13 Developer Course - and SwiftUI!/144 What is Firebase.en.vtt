00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.290
Hi within this lecture we're going to discuss what is for your base and how we can leverage.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.440
It's in our apps so you have seen the intro with your right.

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:21.550
You have seen the database you have seen the authentication module and we gonna do that all with firebase.

4
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.860
I'm going to explain how to unify your base what kind of features firebase provide us and we're going

5
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.550
to actually learn how to integrate firebase to our X code projects during this couple of lectures.

6
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:43.340
In order to do that of course we're going to start by creating an X code project and then we're going

7
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.600
to go to Firebase and open a new project for us and then connect the two projects together.

8
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.640
So let's say create a new project and we're good to go with single view app this time again.

9
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.920
And for product name I'm going to choose instead clone Firebase and in fact we're not even going to

10
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.750
use a single new app we're going to use a tabbed controller in here and actually we could have chosen

11
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770
that tapped controller in the first place but I'm not going to do that.

12
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.340
I'm going to show you have to manually at this.

13
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.720
So let's go for was complete.

14
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.300
And here we go.

15
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.440
This is our project.

16
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.010
So let me make this into full screen.

17
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.260
OK.

18
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.290
And before we go on and write any code or before we go on and do our user interface let's open fire

19
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.610
bays dot google dot com.

20
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.200
So as you may have already understood this is a service by Google.

21
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.060
So Google provides this five year base.

22
00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.910
So this is kind of for all in one solution in which we can get a cloud server and also we get the back

23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.030
end services with this cloud server as well.

24
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.770
I'm going to explain all of this in detail but first let us create our firebase project in order to

25
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.910
do that you have to come here and sign in with your gmail account.

26
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.730
After that you will see a go to console button here of which you can click on and go to your firebase

27
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.760
dashboard.

28
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.010
And if you don't have a Gmail account please click here to create one.

29
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.190
It's completely free.

30
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.880
So you can get a gmail account and you can use Google services along the way.

31
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.820
So if you click on that go to console you will see a screen like this.

32
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.660
So I have some existing projects in here but I believe yours is going to be much more clearer.

33
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.080
All you have to do is just play here on this plus sign.

34
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.010
So in order to create a new project and we're going to choose the settings of our project as well.

35
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.980
So I believe we should do that together of two.

36
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.850
You hit on the plus button you will just enter a project name first.

37
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.990
So I'm going to go for insta clone firebase.

38
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.910
OK.

39
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.500
And then we're going to say continue.

40
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.640
It will ask us if we want Google Analytics for our five year base project as well.

41
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.160
So this is a great tool actually.

42
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:34.190
It lets us just analyze the statistics of our app like we can do some HIV testings we can do some user

43
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:42.640
segmentation is if we put our app on AppStore it will be beneficial for us to track all of these numbers.

44
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.980
That's how many users clicked on our app how many users using our app.

45
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.630
So we can choose to go with this but I'm not going to do that right now because if we do that it will

46
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.890
ask us to create a Google Analytics account as well.

47
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.800
And in order not to make things further complicated I'm just going to go with not right now and don't

48
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.430
worry we can actually change this later on we can add this feature later on.

49
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.710
So if you publish your app on the App Store and a future in a need of some analytics for your app then

50
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.410
you can come back here to add it.

51
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.220
So I'm going to create this project and it will take some time because it will create the whole project

52
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.510
for me.

53
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.270
And we're going to see what five year bases once it gets done.

54
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.620
So here you go.

55
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.470
We can just click on continue and it shall take us to the project dashboard and actually didn't.

56
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:49.520
As you can see if you come up in a situation like this you can refresh the page and you will see the

57
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:57.650
project appearing here and then you can actually choose the project to go to your project dashboard

58
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.130
so here you go.

59
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.340
We now see the insta clone for your base.

60
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.620
Let me just click on this and this is our project dashboard.

61
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.520
So first thing to do is to add our fire base to the X code but we're not going to do that right now

62
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.070
but rather we gonna discuss what is for your base and why we're using it.

63
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.610
Again this is a service by Google.

64
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.990
Okay but it does.

65
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.380
It just doesn't provide a cloud database.

66
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.120
It also comes up with SDK software development kits so that we can easily connect our X code project

67
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.470
to this firebase cloud server so that we can communicate between the server we can add these data to

68
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.090
database we can add some images to the storage.

69
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.930
We can do create some users with the authentication module and everything.

70
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.520
As you can see we have different modules on the left hand side.

71
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.350
We can create users with authentication we can use databases we can use storage and we're going to learn

72
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.510
them all and in here why do we even need a cloud server.

73
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:17.440
For example let me suppose that I'm going to share a post I'm going to add I'm going to choose a new

74
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.990
picture from the photo gallery.

75
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.870
I'm going to add a comment and I'm going to share it with other people.

76
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.230
So if I use core data for example it won't make sense because it will be stored on my phone.

77
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.850
Right.

78
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.410
So in order to let other people see my things I have to put this on the Internet.

79
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:43.270
So in that cloud server so that I can go to the other device and download this upload the pictures and

80
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:50.680
comments and everything so that I can see those all of these information in other devices as well so

81
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:58.780
that all of the devices will be connecting to these same clothes and network same clothes database.

82
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.880
So five actually provides us with that.

83
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:10.210
So in here you see these storage for example we store some media like images videos whatever were you

84
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.630
can come into your mind.

85
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:20.770
So in here for example you see functions if you want to run a code in your server rather than in your

86
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.910
app you can do that with firebase as well.

87
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:31.900
Of course it's not in the scope of these cars because it requires some backyards developments like Javascript

88
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.960
but we're not going to go into that of course we're going to focus on building our app with X code.

89
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.470
But it's possible.

90
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.620
So firebase has a lot of opportunities.

91
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:50.590
We're going to be focusing on authentication databases and storage in here and we going to learn the

92
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:58.300
most important methods and functions regarding those modules but actually firebase provides us more

93
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:58.810
than that.

94
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.520
For example as you can see we can integrate this to Android apps.

95
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.340
We can integrate firebase to the IRS apps and web apps as well.

96
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:16.180
So if you're going to make an app in which you will put store in the Google Play so you're going to

97
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.310
develop it for android and AOS and for that you can use for your base.

98
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:30.190
So that three of these platforms will all have one database one storage one authentication module so

99
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:39.160
users can actually sign in India and write on India U.S. and India app so you can build your own system

100
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.470
with Fi your base in a way you want.

101
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.900
Another great feature of Firebase is that this is so fast.

102
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:54.700
So we're going to be working with a database called fires store and lead fi use so you can easily upload

103
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.180
data and download data within less than a second.

104
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:07.060
So it's ideal to create some real time databases real time apps like chatting app like if you want to

105
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:12.680
get a service in a less than a second then five ways is the way to go.

106
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:20.410
Later on the next step would be to actually integrate our X code project with this five year based project

107
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.230
because we have created this.

108
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:29.260
Now I have to integrate this SDK software development kids to my project in order to communicate with

109
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.800
the server and in order to do that we are going to have to learn something called Coco Pops.

110
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.120
Let's do that in the next lecture.
