00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.950
Hi we within this lecture regrouping to create the functions that we are going to use when we try to

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.200
recognize the image.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.960
So in order to do that I'm going to download the model that we going to use.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.730
So we have different options in here.

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.740
As you can see this is 32 bit the 16 bits.

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.830
And this all belongs to mobile Net V2 model.

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.480
So as we increase the bits deep precision increases as well.

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.660
So if we want a full precision if we want clearer results we have to go with this 32 bit which is 24

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.920
megabytes.

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.860
So if we want something smaller of course we can try to go with other models as well.

11
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.200
But I'm going to go for the big one because I want full precision.

12
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.910
OK.

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.120
So I want better assumptions on the images that I'm going to try and recognize.

14
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.600
And if you click on this view code it will display a documentation in which you will find the details

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.760
of how to use this image classification models.

16
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.890
And don't worry I'm going to explain all of those and in fact we're not even going to follow this documentation.

17
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980
I'm going to simplify it.

18
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.370
I'm going to rewrite all the codes from scratch in our app but know that this documentation exists here

19
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.310
so that you can try to take a look.

20
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:44.550
Then you either know try to work with another model or another class model if you're working with machine

21
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.500
learning examples.

22
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.010
OK.

23
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.820
But e we're going to complete two steps first we going to complete the request and we're going to create

24
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.900
and handler.

25
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.380
We're going to see what are those later on.

26
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.140
Don't worry.

27
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.840
But we're going to see a lot of new code and a lot of new techniques in this section.

28
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.920
So in order to memorize what's going on.

29
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.080
Just know that we have two main steps you're creating to request and creating a handler to handle these

30
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.240
requests to fire up these requests.

31
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.180
OK.

32
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.370
And we're going to work with a class called Yang core and male model.

33
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.010
OK.

34
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.180
And again if you want to you can just try to read the details of this documentation but I'm going to

35
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.590
explain all of those in our code as well.

36
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.910
So let me open my downloads folder and bring in this model into my project and make sure this copy items

37
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.620
if needed and the targets are selected.

38
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.890
Once you confirm you can just head on finish and it will bring in the models so that we can use it in

39
00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:59.870
our code.

40
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.720
OK.

41
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:10.620
So first I have to import the core amount framework that we have talked about and also furthermore we

42
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410
need something more.

43
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.220
And it's called Vision.

44
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.860
So this is a model.

45
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.150
This is kind of a module that we use when we try to work with image recognition models.

46
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.790
OK.

47
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.310
So that's why I mean part think this I'm gonna need this classes in my app.

48
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:37.130
So after you import the core email and the vision in your app you're good to go actually.

49
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.790
And we're going to have to adjust this image because controller and we're going to have to create our

50
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.890
recognize function as well.

51
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.510
I'm going to call my recognize function recognize image.

52
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.380
So this is going to be basic and I'm going to call this function under did finish launching I did finish

53
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.570
Peking media with info.

54
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.660
OK.

55
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:13.320
And once user finishes speaking media it will get called it will get executed and in order to do that

56
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.410
this methods I had this function actually will ask me some image type called See I image.

57
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.990
OK so I'm going to have to adjust my code according to that.

58
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:37.230
So if you come over your documentation you you can't see the CIC because it's better to do this now

59
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.750
because it will ask us for later on and I don't want to waste any more time.

60
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.970
I just want to get in to my recognized image functions so that I can tell you all about this core and

61
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.770
now functions core and the classes and objects.

62
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:05.220
And in order to complete this I'm going to convert my UI image to be SGI image and as you can see this

63
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.440
is a representation of an image to be processed by core image filters.

64
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.190
So that's why we're bringing this into the game.

65
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.780
And in order to do that I'm going to create another variable called if CIA image and I'm going to use

66
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.540
it flat.

67
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.000
Because my UI image is casted optionally in here.

68
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.560
And if you say CGI image it will ask you for some data.

69
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.940
And the best way to do that is through a UI image because we already have a UI image.

70
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.970
At this point.

71
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.290
Right.

72
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:51.900
We can try to convert this UI image into SGI image so I can get as easily from Image view dot image.

73
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.050
OK.

74
00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:04.820
And it's in here under if left you can try to come up with a variable so that we can use it under our

75
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.960
function.

76
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.700
So let me save our chosen image and this is going to be SGI image.

77
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.920
OK.

78
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:21.060
And in order to comply with the scope I'm going to say chosen image is a SII image so that I can come

79
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.170
over here and use my chosen image later on.

80
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.470
So make sure you selected the right one and under the recognized image.

81
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.050
Now we can actually use this chosen image.

82
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.260
In fact I don't even have to do that I can just take this as an input in my function right.

83
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.820
I can't come over here and say this function will ask for an image and this is going to be a CIA image

84
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.250
and in the recognized image I can just use this as a parameter.

85
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:50.660
Right.

86
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.670
I can come over here and say yep this is chosen.

87
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.440
Image.

88
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.400
Yep.

89
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.570
So far so good.

90
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:06.680
Now I have my fun ready in order to leverage all this core email objects and classes.

91
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.130
So again we're going to create the request.

92
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:19.320
We're going to create on handler to handle this request and try to get the assumption try to get declassification

93
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.990
from our image model.

94
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:25.940
So let me try to find the CIA image.

95
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.340
Yep.

96
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.480
As you can see in the handler it asks us for a CIA image.

97
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.800
And again this is the reason why we have created our CIA image again.

98
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.870
So here we go.

99
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.110
I believe we can stop here because in the next picture we going to create our requests.
