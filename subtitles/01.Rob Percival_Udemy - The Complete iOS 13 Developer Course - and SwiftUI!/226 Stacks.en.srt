00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,590
Hi.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,520
We didn't this lecture we going to see what s tech is and we're going to play with this views so that

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,410
we can get a hold of swift UI.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:19,060
So we have this text and text is some kind of a label E side of our swift UI framework.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:24,290
We use it to show strings we use it to show text to the user.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,260
For example if you say dot after the text you can just choose any attribute any method you want.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,740
For example if you choose bold it will make your text bold.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,500
Right.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,090
So let's see another one.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:47,190
If you just say dot you can come over here to change the font for example and it asks you for a font

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:55,980
and if you hit dot over here you will see some options like a color like a caption or look like a large

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,290
title.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,020
Just choose the large title and you will see that it will increase your form size.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:11,370
Let's try something else like footnote for example and still make it a lot smaller compared to the large

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,840
title.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,280
So that's how it goes.

17
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,790
That's how you can add some new features like this.

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,130
You can just hit that once again and try to make it bold after you change the font.

19
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:31,080
Of course you can continue experimenting does by adding some new features like adding dots and trying

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,070
to find some options that is relative to texts but there is another way to do that if you don't know

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,650
anything about who you are.

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,980
You can come over here by hitting comment on your keyboard.

23
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,980
If you click on text you will see a menu like this.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,060
You have to go does inspect menu and it will give you something like an attributes page.

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,910
Okay so remember in the main story birds we had that through Spain and we could have changed any attribute

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,680
that we want.

27
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,640
This is something like that.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:11,220
It EC exactly lets lists the common attributes come on options that you can change over here like found.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,870
And if you want you can just change it from there as well.

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:21,210
For example let me go for a headline and will do headline code over here.

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,050
So it adds the code automatically if you choose it from this menu.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,140
So you can see how to add this how to add those codes by choosing from this menu for example a color

33
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,720
just I want to make this blue.

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,970
So it added the foreground color color that blue automatically.

35
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:50,040
So I know right now how to change the color so I come over here I can change the alignments but it won't

36
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,160
make sense because we're stuck in this frame and we're going to see what the frame is later on.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,160
But I can change it by clicking over here.

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,600
Right.

39
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,950
So this is good.

40
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,360
This is very cool.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,580
We can't even change the tax from here as well.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:15,000
So this lists the common attributes that we can change from here Come on properties and don't hesitate

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,950
to use this inspection menu whenever you come across a new view to see what you can actually change.

44
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:31,200
So we have this frame over here and it refers to this blue line wrapping around our text and we going

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,530
to see what it is later on.

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,230
It actually defines the size of our view but I believe view.

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,610
Good to go with images when it comes to frame to understand it better.

48
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,910
So right now what if I want to add another view on top of this view.

49
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,670
Can I just do that like hello world.

50
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,960
OK.

51
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,320
Will it show up.

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,890
Nope it will give me an error because it may sound stupid right now but you can only return one view

53
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,800
inside of her body.

54
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,710
So you may think that you do I get to have one view in swift UI in every screen from now on of course

55
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,440
not.

56
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,960
There is some bypass to this problem as well.

57
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,070
And we're going to use it a lot in other projects.

58
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,660
It's called Stack.

59
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:33,060
OK so we're going to create this stack and we're going to wrap everything around as tags so that we

60
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,720
can return everything inside of that act like this.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,210
So if you say we stack and open and curly brace and then you can just stack whatever you want inside

62
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,400
of that V stack like this.

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,450
So take everything and put it inside your Fritzi stack and you will see that this new tax will show

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,040
up and you will see the hello world and hello to you as well.

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Now in this buddy I'm just returning the V stack and inside of that we stack I'm doing what I want.

66
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:15,550
So right now I can just add as many views as I want inside of this vertical stack and V stands for verticals.

67
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:24,010
Tech is stacked so we stack the views inside of the stack and we have other options as well.

68
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:32,860
For example if I want to sack views horizontally there is an eight stack to do that just change V to

69
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,240
H and you will see they will be side by side like this.

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
So this is horizontal stack.

71
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:48,190
And the again this is we stack and as you can see I can use this V stack and I can use that a stack

72
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,850
in order to have structural stacking of my views.

73
00:05:53,230 --> 00:06:00,620
For example right now I'm using this vertical sack but my views are actually very close to each other.

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,800
So I want to move them further away a little bit.

75
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:12,460
So I have to come over here to one of them and add the padding as you can see this blue frame wrapping

76
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,170
around our helo world just got expanded and it's called frame.

77
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:24,670
As I said before it actually determines what size will our view hold.

78
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,860
As you can see in the helo swift UI now I'm just wrapping around it.

79
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,760
So if I say padding over here as well it will just expense and it will move.

80
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,500
Hello World further away.

81
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:49,660
So that's how you add a padding to actually sets your views up so that they will have the size that

82
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:57,330
you want and they will have the margin of space that you want Reagan to work with frame with images

83
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,540
in order to understand it better later on in the next lecture.

84
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,430
Don't worry.

85
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,480
And aside from waist tag and 8 SAG we also have something called disease tech as well.

86
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,220
So if we change it to Z you will see that they will overlap and this is kind of z position that we have

87
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,310
seen in the sprite kids.

88
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,550
OK so this defines reach ever view is going to be shown first and it doesn't make sense in this case.

89
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,150
But if I had an image is rather than hell of world.

90
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,290
If I want to write something on that image okay.

91
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,290
That that would make sense to use this tech.

92
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,130
In this case of curse we don't have to use these tech.

93
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm going to go with the V stack in order to have a proper look.

94
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,560
So that's it for stacks.

95
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:58,270
That's why we use taxing swift UI so we're going to stop here and within the next picture we're going

96
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,430
to dig a little deeper and understand swift UI features better.
