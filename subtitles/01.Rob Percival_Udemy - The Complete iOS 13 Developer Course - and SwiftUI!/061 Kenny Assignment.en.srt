1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,620
High within the section you're going to get your second big assignment.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,390
So first one was calculator and the second one is going to be this game.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,650
So let me show you how it looks like.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,630
So we have Kenny running away from us.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,730
And if we can't catch him and if we can tap on him as you can see score increases.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:29,610
So we're running against time and if time reaches zero it displays an alert message for us.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,080
It says that time's up.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,330
Do you want to play again and in here we can say replay or okay.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,990
And on the bottom we have the high score.

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,110
So we start use value in a way that's if user closes this down and opens one more time.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,540
This won't go away so we star there's value in our database.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:59,370
So we started his value in a way that we only so started the highest score that has ever been achieved.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:08,160
And we can tap on the replay to play one more time and if we can catch the Kenny in a higher score this

14
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,580
time this will be reflected in the higher score a parent.

15
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,690
They are not very good at this game so I could only do one and high score is still five.

16
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,780
As you can see since this is less than one so far we have been learning a lot.

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,870
So this will be a great chance to put all of this information into practice.

18
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,890
And you how some skill missing in order to complete this app and let me give you a hint.

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,180
You have to come up with a way to find to create the random variables or random numbers in order to

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,760
make this work.

21
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:56,240
And you may have to come up with a way to make animations or make some views reasonable or not reasonable.

22
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,520
And we have not seen that yet but you can easily try to figure out how to do this.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,760
And you can easily find this information on Google and if you can not do that Don't worry.

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
This is a very hard practice by the way.

25
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,290
This is the hardest assignment that you will ever get during this course.

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:24,390
But after that you will see how you can actually turn your theory into practice and you can actually

27
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,570
see how you can use all of this information in real apps.

28
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,130
And again if you cannot do this.

29
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,200
Don't worry we're going to be building this app from scratch during this section.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,500
So I suggest you pulls do video and tried to come up with a way to make this happen.
