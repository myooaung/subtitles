00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,750
Hi we didn't this lecture we going to see how we can send a push notification from X code.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,560
Now we know how to send one from this dashboard.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,130
Right.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:20,070
Manually but we going to do it automatically so that we can learn how to send it to X code with code

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,430
so that we can send a push notification when somebody like some posts.

6
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,960
So let me come over here to documentation and show you how it's done.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,730
So it's sending push messages but it shows me how we can send that to the dashboard.

8
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,050
Right.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:48,360
So we have already done this so we don't need this documentation at this point what we need is ice native

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,300
documentation so that we can see all the SDK related codes.

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:01,590
So let me come over here and as you can see there is a section called How do I send a notification to

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,480
a single user.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,020
So that's what we need.

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,760
We're going to send a notification to only one user.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:17,520
So whenever Kirk likes the post of James or James likes the care posts of Kirk then the other one will

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,720
get a push notification.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,450
Okay.

18
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,040
So that's what we need.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,710
And don't worry if you cannot find this documentation I'm going to show you how to do it anyway.

20
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,530
But it's a nice thing to read the documentation and see the other modules as well.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,610
So what we're going to do we're going to take this play your idea and we're going to send only one notification

22
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,580
to that specific play your I.D..

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,370
OK.

24
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,070
As you can see it says that the eye you have to use this method called include play your I.D. and you

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,180
have to include that specific player I.D. that you want.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,890
So if you come over here to user user messages or transactional messages guides you can find what you're

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,650
looking for.

28
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,430
So I'm going to go over to user user messages.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,480
So there are two steps actually first we have together the player I.D. then we have to send the message

30
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:25,470
to that player I.D. And we know how to get display your I.D. right now from dashboard but that's not

31
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,280
what we want.

32
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,720
We have to get that from the access code itself so that we wouldn't go over here every time someone

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,330
is trying to send a push notification.

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,940
OK.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:44,790
So I'm going to open this mobile SDK reference and I'm going into the IRS native SDK so that we can

36
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:51,150
learn how together it is play your I.D. and how to send a push notification using that player I.D..

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,090
So this is a U.S. native as the Kay documentation.

38
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:04,770
OK so what I'm looking for is to send a push notification and I believe it's under here somewhere.

39
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,420
So let me search for it.

40
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,010
So let me come over here.

41
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:08,530
Yep.

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,290
This is sending notifications.

43
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:17,550
So if I click on that it will take me to this post notification method and that is exactly what we are

44
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,150
looking for post notification.

45
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,610
OK.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,020
So it's really easy method.

47
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,630
So you can easily send a push notification as you can see it says that you have to call 1 signal that

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,590
post notification and then you create the content and then you include the player I.D. that you want.

49
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,510
So I'm going to cope with this one I'm going to come over here.

50
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:52,080
OK so let me come over here to my iPhone X R because I'm sending this not to my iPhone sir but I'm just

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,980
sending this to my iPhone but I can use a simulator to send it to my iPhone.

52
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,660
OK.

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:07,250
Even though simulators do not actually support push notifications we can still send one right.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,460
We are not receiving push notifications in the simulators but we can send some push notifications using

55
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,410
simulators anyway.

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,160
So what I'm about to do I'm just going to put that code that we have copied into my X code I'm going

57
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,170
to run this using my simulator so I'm going to delete the existing is the clone firebase from here so

58
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,820
that it would ask me if I want to receive notifications and I will allow it even though I won't be able

59
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,740
to receive one.

60
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,370
I will be able to send one.

61
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,950
So let me come over here to my feed.

62
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:50,560
We have controller because that's the controller that we will see when it first loads.

63
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,020
So under we did load.

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,580
I'm going to try this code.

65
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,110
OK.

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
So I'm going to say post notification or push notification.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,300
OK.

68
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,130
As comment.

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,370
So let me say push notification and I'm going to paste it in.

70
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,540
So in order to do that I'm going to import the one signal over here as well.

71
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:18,210
So once it's done let me come over here and see how it's done.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
Now let me paste this code in.

73
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,260
So in this code I have to specify the content and test messages.

74
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:35,100
OK for me right now but I'm going to change this so that I can try to send my push notification to my

75
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,690
iPhone.

76
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:45,510
OK so let me paste as in so that will send a push notification called text message to my iPhone when

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,320
my iPhone X are loads.

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,030
So let me run this.

79
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:58,020
And also on it that at the same time I have to open my real iPhone as well so that I can see if I get

80
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,450
the message or not.

81
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:08,010
And once we open the simulator it will ask us to give permission for push notifications.

82
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:13,370
I'm going to love it but we won't be able to receive any notifications.

83
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,920
And I believe you're logged in with Kirk but I'm going to make sure that you're logged in with Kirk

84
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,490
anyway.

85
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:27,990
So I'm going to say Kirk adds Metallica dot com and give some passwords that we have created before

86
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,800
I believe it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 and sign in.

87
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:38,910
Here we go now we're logged in with Kirk now wi fi come over here on refresh this page I will see my

88
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,390
simulator over here subscribe.

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,230
But as you can see it says that even though it has a player I.D. It says that I Os simulator unsupported

90
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:55,620
so we cannot receive any notification using this simulator but we can send one as I said before.

91
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,860
So what I'm going to do I'm going to open this.

92
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,280
OK.

93
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,350
So let me run this one more time to see if you're really logged in with Kirk and it will just run this

94
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,150
one signal code.

95
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,330
OK.

96
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,430
And once it's done I will receive a push notification in my real life form.

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,350
And here you go.

98
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:25,140
Now I received that push notification as you can see if I tap on it it will direct me to my app.

99
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,910
So here you go.

100
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,160
That's how we actually send push notifications eastside of X code.

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,570
So what we have to do right now is to find out how we can gather the player I.D. so that we can send

102
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,490
the push notification of whenever we want to whichever device we want.

103
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,860
So let's do that in the next lecture.
