00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.450
Hi within this lecture we're going to do the rest of the improvements that we have talked about like

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.070
hiding the save button from the selected details view controller.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.020
OK.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.850
And maybe disabling the save button until a user chooses an image inside of our ad screen.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.570
Okay.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.570
And also I'm just going to show you how to get some exemplary images in your app.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.500
So let me open the assistant editor because I'm just going to have to define the save button as an outlet.

8
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.760
Yes because we only have the same button as an action but we have to reach its attributes at this point.

9
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.910
So I'm just going to come over here and save save button and make sure that outlet is chosen rather

10
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.440
than action and click on ads and close this.

11
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.720
And now we're done.

12
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.990
So if you go to details we have controller we can reach say buy them for a main function and we can

13
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.580
make it hidden or we can make it disabled.

14
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.020
For example if chosen painting is not empty string so it means that we're just going to get some values

15
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.580
from the core data.

16
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.160
And in here we don't even need save button.

17
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.950
So if you say saved by them is enabled.

18
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.660
OK this one is enabled.

19
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.150
If you make this false it means that the bottom will be shown but it won't be clickable.

20
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.030
So let me show you what I mean.

21
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.530
Let me run this.

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.150
OK.

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.050
And in the details we you controller when we click on one off the table view items as you can see it

24
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.660
doesn't show right now.

25
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.290
We chose actually but we cannot click on it.

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.010
So this should be good.

27
00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.260
But maybe we can do is hit them false as well so it won't even show it is hidden true I mean it won't

28
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.100
even show disable by it will just make it invisible.

29
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.750
So if you go over here you will say see that this is now invisible and in the plus puddling the ads

30
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.250
button clicked.

31
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.010
We can use the is enabled false thing in here unless a user choses an image right.

32
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.990
So let's go down.

33
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.440
So if chosen painting is not an empty string we're doing this.

34
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.230
And if it's actually an empty string in the else block we can come over here and just say Say button

35
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.930
that is hidden is going to be false because I want it to be visible but I want it to be disabled.

36
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.990
So I'm going to say is enabled false and violence.

37
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.640
A user chooses an image in the deed finish picking media with info function.

38
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.600
I'm going to do say button that is enabled true.

39
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.700
So let's say that say button that is enabled is true.

40
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.610
So that this will be only clickable once a user chooses an image.

41
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.970
OK so this vote will be much more efficient than what we have been doing.

42
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.780
As you can see we cannot click on this.

43
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.150
So let's come over here and choose a painting from this.

44
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.330
And as you can see now I can't I can't click on the same button and we're done with the app.

45
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.710
So let me show you how you can find some images from online that you can use as a test purpose in your

46
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.490
app.

47
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.490
So try to just take this up a little bit as in a real iPhone as you can see you can close the app any

48
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.020
time you want and you can use this as a real phone.

49
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.860
So let me go to safari.

50
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.490
OK.

51
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.650
Let me go to Google dot com.

52
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.130
Are we going to just google some arts.

53
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.910
So I believe we can start that Mona Lisa for example and see the most basic one.

54
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.550
So our user is going to be visiting loved museum.

55
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.540
And suppose that he or she sees this Mona Lisa.

56
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.010
If you hold onto that you can add two photos.

57
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.530
So you have to log press on the Mona Lisa or any image.

58
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.900
OK.

59
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:32.990
In order to save it to photos suppose that our user has just taken the picture of Mona Lisa and then

60
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.010
later on she will just add it to our app.

61
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.100
So let's go for Scream by Edward Munch.

62
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.470
Okay so let's click on this and say add photos and let's go for one or two more paintings.

63
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.210
Maybe we can go for starry nights.

64
00:04:51.210 --> 00:05:00.320
OK so this is why one go so find one and click on that and it doesn't work.

65
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.280
I believe this is too big so it's not even an image I believe we we're inside of a website.

66
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.960
So let me go to images.

67
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.370
OK yeah.

68
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:19.550
This one images and find their regular image from here and click on that long press and say at photos

69
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.360
maybe we can get some more like last supper.

70
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.230
OK.

71
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.200
So let's go for a last supper.

72
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.520
By DaVinci I believe.

73
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.920
Yeah.

74
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.650
So last supper.

75
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.100
And just find the one that is good looking good looking for Yeah.

76
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.610
And added to your photos.

77
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.820
Once you do that you go good to go.

78
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.350
You can just close is down.

79
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.640
OK.

80
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.670
You can just closes down as well.

81
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:55.760
And you can find your own app from this menu and just open it and you can just select the images in

82
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.090
your photo album like this.

83
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.050
And here you go.

84
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.080
You can edit the image but since we have chosen the original image in the did finish speaking media

85
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.230
it won't even going to matter.

86
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:17.930
So Mona Lisa the artist let's say that when she and let's say 1850 and I don't know the years of these

87
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.610
paintings I'm just making this up so maybe you're better art lower than me so you can find the details

88
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.080
and add for real.

89
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.730
So there's a scream.

90
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:37.030
OK Edward Munch and the year will be something like nineteen hundred eighteen hundred.

91
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.260
OK and here you go.

92
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.820
Let me do one more example.

93
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.640
Let's go for our last supper this time.

94
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.780
OK.

95
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.560
And this will be last supper.

96
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.580
And the artist will be Da Vinci and the year will be eighteen hundred.

97
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.460
And here you go.

98
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.160
Now delete all of this.

99
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.920
And here we have our art book.

100
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.500
So let's stop it and play it from the beginning.

101
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:10.320
As you can see we have the related data in our record data and everything seems to be working fine.

102
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.890
So I believe we have learned a lot in this section.

103
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:20.210
So you have learned how to work with local databases how to do some improvements on your own app have

104
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:29.240
to use notification center how to use gesture recognized or to go and select pictures from the user's

105
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.810
library and everything.

106
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.440
So I hope you enjoyed this section.

107
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.330
So let's stop here and go into the next section where we're going to talk about maps.
