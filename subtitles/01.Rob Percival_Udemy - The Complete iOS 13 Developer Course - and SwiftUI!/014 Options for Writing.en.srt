00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,240
Hi.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:09,450
Following this lecture we're going to start learning about the swift basics and in order to do that

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,110
I actually need something very simple.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,130
I don't need 80 main dot storyboards.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:22,230
I don't need any simulators because I won't be building any user interfaces.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,410
I won't be just displaying those user interfaces in my simulator.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:37,380
I just need a very basic way to write SWIFT code and see these outputs without giving too much thought

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,860
into user interface or without having to run simulator every time and wait for it to compile and build

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,050
on it.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,490
Show me the user phase and stuff and then in order to do that I'm going to show you two options.

11
00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:00,200
And don't worry after this section after we complete the basics of Swift we are going to go back to

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,170
that as well.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:08,240
We're going to create user interfaces we're going to build apps we're going to test them in the simulators

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,880
all the cars will be based on this practice.

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,800
However in the section in the basic section we don't need that.

16
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:26,130
We just need a simple method simple technique to write our code and see these outputs.

17
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:35,660
First one is to create a playground and that is the common solution in order to learn about basic swift

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,080
operations.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,430
So as you can see we can explore new ideas quickly and easily in the playground.

20
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,290
So when you click on those it will ask you for a template again.

21
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:55,560
And of course we going to go for blank because we going to create everything from scratch and you can

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,830
call your playground whatever you want.

23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,510
OK.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,650
I'm going to call it the variables.

25
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:07,950
This will be our first topic and we're going to see what a variable is.

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,070
And we're going to create this and save it in whenever wherever I want.

27
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm going to go for a desktop or I'm going to go for AOS complete folder in fact and you can just choose

28
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,330
it over here as well.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm going to save every playground that we are creating in my AOS complete folder.

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,410
And later on I'm just going to share all of those things for you.

31
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,280
So let me create actually a new playgrounds folder and save this playgrounds in my playgrounds folder

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,840
so that I can zip them and share with them easily.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
So here we go.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,130
May you first create the playground.

35
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,080
It shows you something like this.

36
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:00,720
OK so you're importing something importing means you're importing your library into this project and

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,470
you're running something called SDR.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,930
So this is a variable actually and VAR is the keyword to define a variable.

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,110
We will see what it is later on.

40
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,880
If you click on this play button over here it will run this playground.

41
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,660
If you're doing this for the first time and I believe this is my first time on X called 11 for playgrounds

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,000
it's it's going to take some time.

43
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,470
So the most basic thing about the playgrounds they have to be fast and they have to be efficient because

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:44,790
we're just writing some code and we're expecting to see the outcome of discos codes fast if you get

45
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,520
stuck in playgrounds.

46
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:56,370
If this doesn't work for some reason I will show you another option because sometimes students experience

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,380
some difficulties with the playground.

48
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,200
It should be like this you have to see the output on the right hand side of this playground.

49
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,150
So if you don't see it you can try to close this playground and open it again and hitting the play button

50
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,520
one more time because it should display these variables very fast actually.

51
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,630
So let me create another one so you can just write it like me and I'm going to explain what these are

52
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:34,140
but these are print later on but just for right now know that I'm creating a variable and I'm trying

53
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,840
to print it.

54
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,820
So if I click the play button I will see the result on on the right hand side.

55
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:49,410
And since I am printing this I will see the results on the lower side of this playground as well.

56
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:58,130
So this is the print section and right hand side is where we get the output of our code actually.

57
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,360
So this is the logic of playground.

58
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,820
So you write some codes and you see the results on the right hand side.

59
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,690
For example I multiply temp buys 10 times five.

60
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,670
And I can see the 50 instantaneously on the right hand side.

61
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,790
So if this is working out for you.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,220
That's great.

63
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,050
So you don't have to go for the second option at all because playground is actually better and I'm going

64
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:33,450
to explain a routine in the playground says well but I have come across some situations students could

65
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,380
not start playgrounds or whatever day try.

66
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:37,710
OK.

67
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,760
So they try to close this they try to restart their computers they try to delete the playground and

68
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,070
create it again but it won't start.

69
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,360
So if you come across a situation like this I'm going to show you a second way.

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,110
And let me show you the second way.

71
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,750
Let me go over here to X. go down say new projects rather than playground.

72
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:12,390
I'm going to go for a project but rather than I guess now I'm going to create something for Mac OS I'm

73
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:20,550
nuts of course going to build an app for Mac OS in this at this moment but I'm going to create a very

74
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,720
simple project in which we can write code and show the output instantaneously again without having to

75
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,990
deal with the main storyboard or deal with the simulator at 0.

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,030
So if you choose the Mac OS you can come here choose commands line two.

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,770
OK.

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,510
That's what we're going to create here.

79
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,330
And we have to give you the product name one more time.

80
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,800
So I'm going to say command line variables over here but I'm not going to write any coding here.

81
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm not going to explain all the section in command variables.

82
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,540
But I'm just going to show you whether this.

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
So here you can choose Swift.

84
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,490
And as you can see we can write C or C++ called in here as well but we're not going to do that but the

85
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:16,370
rather we're just going to go for a swift time create our projects and as you can see this creates a

86
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,330
project just like as we did before but rather than having a wheel controller that swift or apt delegate

87
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,160
or scene delegate we only have something called Main that Swift.

88
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:36,500
So this is a basic swift file in which we can write code and then we played this when we run this here

89
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,320
using my Mac.

90
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:46,060
It will just run the code and display the results for me for some reason I'm getting an error message

91
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,340
let me see.

92
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,180
Yeah.

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:55,970
As you can see I'm not connected to my Apple I.D. even though I suggested you to go and do this in your

94
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,510
signing capability section.

95
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,970
Apparently I didn't do that.

96
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,800
So let me go to signing capabilities.

97
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,130
And here you go.

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,710
It doesn't see my account here so it doesn't see Molly.

99
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,180
See my Apple I.D..

100
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,340
So this is very easy to fix if it's not shown.

101
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:25,730
If it's not chosen for you just choose it and say sign in and then later on you can just give your Apple

102
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,690
I.D. password over here so that it can't connect you to your ex growth project.

103
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:38,810
And I believe this is not an issue for you because you have done this in the previous section for right

104
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:47,150
now it's an issue for me so I'm signing in with my Apple I.D. and it's going to a sign my Apple I.D.

105
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,420
2 x code project and this will be okay then.

106
00:08:51,530 --> 00:09:00,470
So right now I'm here signed in let me go to my main that's 5th and try to run this one more time and

107
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,250
the errors will go away.

108
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,690
And as you can see now I will get the log.

109
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:15,530
I will see the output of this print as you can see I see the output over here on the right hand side

110
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,850
bottom.

111
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:24,680
So if I do something like this now I have to print this rather than seeing on the right hand side because

112
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,800
right now we don't have that kind of capability in the here.

113
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:36,050
So I'm going to wrap this around to print and if I do that it will just print the results for me in

114
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,090
here like this.

115
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:46,100
So you can use this technique or you can use the playgrounds and I suggest if it is working for you

116
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,670
you use the playground because it's simpler.

117
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:55,870
You don't have to write print every time in order to see the results.

118
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,260
Okay.

119
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:03,920
So you can create new tables like this in here as well you can see something like as he can say for

120
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,210
my number is four times four and print my number.

121
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,430
And if you just run this you will see the same result.

122
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,150
So we are seeing 20 in here and we will see the same thing in here as well.

123
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,900
If we run this.

124
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,380
Okay.

125
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,630
As you can see we see 16 because yeah I said four times four.

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,120
But it's working.

127
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,070
So choose one of them choose either of them.

128
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,050
Okay.

129
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,000
And if it's working go with the playgrounds.

130
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,810
If it's not.

131
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,150
Go with this.

132
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,180
There but.

133
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,440
Okay.

134
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:47,080
So we will stop here and following the next lecture we're actually going to start learning about what

135
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,200
a variable is.

136
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,800
And we're going to start with the basics of swift.
