Hi.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:08,490
We didn't this lecture we going to discuss the final details of the firebase for example in our database.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,800
Remember we started with the test mode and it actually allows us to read and write without any condition

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,520
and it's not very safe to do that.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:27,600
So let's try to view the documentation and let's try to make our fire base safer than it already is.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:35,130
So this is the fire store security rules documentation and you can find tons of information in here.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,990
You can see how to write.

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:44,810
Conditions have to love the read How to love the rights based on a different condition.

9
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:51,990
If you're going to publish an app on the App Store I really suggest you guys to come over here and take

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:01:00,630
a look at the security rules so that you may find a real good example of what you're wanting to do in

11
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,380
your app.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,510
But for right now let me show you a quick way how to make your application safer.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,500
So we're allowing everything in here read and write without any condition.

14
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,240
OK to add a new condition in here after you say a low read then right you will hit a space.

15
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:30,180
OK you will bring a space in here like this and you will have to put that column up to write an essay

16
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,690
if request that off.

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,560
So is not now.

18
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:44,250
It means that if the request has authenticated using our app like signing in or signing up then a low

19
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,050
read their rights if you hit publish it will just save the security rules.

20
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,500
And as you can see you can see the versions over here so that if it breaks your code or if it doesn't

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,430
work you can go back anytime you want after you change the security rules.

22
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:07,330
You should of course come over here and test to see if you can write something new to your app.

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,050
So let's try to upload another picture we're here say Mona and say upload and as you can see it got

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:25,050
uploaded and it got downloaded so we can read and write to our in our app so that it's working let's

25
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,950
try with another user let's sign in with James.

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,670
OK.

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,950
James that Metallica dot com.

28
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,500
So let's sign in.

29
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:41,970
And as you can see we can see the pulse with James says well we can write the e in the database so when

30
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,940
we hit it like it brings up the like count.

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,040
And in here you can see the version of the security rules so that if anything happens you can revert

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,770
back anytime you want.

33
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:03,510
So let me open my safari because I want to go to Firebase Google dot com to show you another thing I'm

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,240
going to go for pricings.

35
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:13,410
And as you know this is completely free when you test your app but after your app meets a certain volume

36
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:21,660
you may have to pay up to the firebase because it has some kind of limitations for example you can have

37
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,900
one gigabyte of data in the file your store.

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,560
You can have some kind of 10000 authentication in one month.

39
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,090
OK.

40
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,260
Authentication requests in one month.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,880
And if you want to upgrade there's a flame plan.

42
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,440
It's twenty five dollars per month at this current moment.

43
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,370
And if you exceed this plan as well.

44
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,020
There is a place plan you pay as you go.

45
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:57,180
So if you have an app in mind and if you wonder how much should I pay if I reach like 100000 people

46
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,080
in my app you can come over here and trying to try to calculate what would be the sufficient amount

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,950
to invest in that app.

48
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,650
So if you come up with a startup idea or if you're looking for investors you will know how much money

49
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,150
you will have to invest with that kind of volume in your app.

50
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,890
OK.

51
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,350
And fi your base is kind of cheap.

52
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,080
I believe for just service they pay for a right cause they're providing a very good service they're

53
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:36,810
providing us with a very powerful back and they're providing with very powerful database we can do real

54
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,590
time updates we can do storage.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,620
We can do the authentication.

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,470
It's hard to find that kind of service in these days.

57
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,670
We're going to see an alternative later on called pass.

58
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,820
But I believe fire your base is better right now.

59
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,880
So I hope you enjoyed this one.

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,800
So let's meet in the next section to continue learning about I ask developments.
