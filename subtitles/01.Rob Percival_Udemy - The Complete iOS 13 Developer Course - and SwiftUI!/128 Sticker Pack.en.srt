Hi within this lecture re to see how to create seeker packs and by fire.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,900
This is going to be our easiest lecture ever because we're not even going to write any code.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,010
We're just going to see how to create sticker packs so we can actually send them two messages or other

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:28,260
checking applications in our iPhone and this feature is specifically designed for designers about it's

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,920
actually beneficial for us to learn about does because it's so easy and convenient.

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,130
Just choose sticker pack with you from here.

7
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,190
But you create a new app rather than single you app and I'm going to name this Pokémon sticker app.

8
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,740
OK so we're going to download some Pokémon stickers and we're just going to work with the software you

9
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,240
create this project as you can see this is very simple.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,640
So there is not think it's really all we have the stickers Assad's folders so this is basically we drag

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,650
and drop the stickers that we have created and we work with them.

12
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,690
So if you're a designer you can just create your own stickers and you can actually see how those on

13
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,230
the App Store are like.

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,310
I message X or a sticker pack.

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,230
Okay so people use a message in their daily lives so they are looking for just different kinds of stickers

16
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,850
and stuff every time and make sure I'm going to go for Pokemon stickers said and I'm going to work with

17
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,590
those.

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,950
So I'm just doing is a random example.

19
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,870
Make sure that you don't steal some copyrighted image from the Internet.

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,910
You have to find one without the royalty shoes or you have to create your own Citigroup packs.

21
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,840
If you wanna put those on AppStore or if you want to put those for sale.

22
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,850
OK so let's find some pokemon stickers here as you can see from the Google.

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,060
I just choose a random Web site.

24
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,110
And I'm downloading some Charizard I can here.

25
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,820
So let's go for another one.

26
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,770
So what is this one called Blast choice.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,270
Okay let's go for blasters.

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,160
So let me download this a little bit and let me just do one more.

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,180
So as you can see we have different sizes here available but I'm doing this just for an example so I'm

30
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:41,150
going to go for another one and I'm going to go for biggest one of this.

31
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,090
So this is some kind of P.G. ghetto so let me know it's called her I my.

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,870
So anyway let me open this folder and I'm going to go for Cherry's art.

33
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,230
OK.

34
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,200
And so this one is blasters I believe.

35
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,740
And this is the Harry Yama.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,720
So after Dad I will choose all of this.

37
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,080
I'm going to bring in this sticker packs and as you can see now we are ready to use those stickers and

38
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,870
that school.

39
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,090
And here you go.

40
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,770
This extension is chosen one more time to run on my simulator.

41
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:29,990
So when I opened this on my simulator you will see that VK used his own messages app.

42
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,440
So this works perfectly with the messages.

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,850
OK.

44
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,950
So if you open one of the messages from here you can click on this message.

45
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,670
And here we see our own secret back.

46
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,560
Like I can come over here choose Cherry's art and send it as a message to Kate.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
So this is cool right.

48
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,410
This is all we have to do is to just to create that sticker pack.

49
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,240
And as you can see this is relatively easy.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,540
You can create icons and you can work with the sticker bags if you're a designer.

51
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,430
And remember people really dig this stuff if you come over here you will see some other options as well.

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,180
And as you can see they have all icons.

53
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:24,740
Of course we don't have any one yet because we haven't put any icons in our app but we can see the Pokémon

54
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:34,100
sticker name actually here and we can just choose and we can add some more so there is this whole list

55
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,360
here.

56
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,960
So we can scroll down if we want.

57
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,200
Right now we only have three so we can only see three.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,450
So this is one of the cool features of ISIS as well.

59
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,890
And it's good to take a break from coding for a while but that's it for right now.

60
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,870
So we're going to stop here and we're going to continue with face recognition in the next lecture.
