Hi.

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.220
We didn't expect lecture re going to continue our jogging of icons and regrouping to draw as search

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.530
I can end up play by them play icon.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.570
OK so I'm going to name this search icon OK and I'm going to come over here to our newly created art

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.950
board and I'm just going to delete everything inside of this artwork because I'm going to bring in a

6
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.660
circle or an ellipse this time and I'm going to hit shift in order to make disproportional.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:43.270
OK and then later on I'm going to draw a line over here as a holder over magnifying glass.

8
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.510
OK like that and maybe we can do some editing over here.

9
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.960
So let me just zoom in a little bit and I'm just going to go for this so it will make it around like

10
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.410
that and now I believe this looks good.

11
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
But maybe we can do this a little bit bigger in order to have a better look.

12
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.590
So choose this.

13
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.200
And hit upper arrow over here to make this a little bit bigger like that.

14
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.660
So I believe that's good for research.

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.500
I can.

16
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.580
All right.

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:24.500
So of course you can have some symbols or here or some like a bigger circle to make this a little bit

18
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.580
better like that.

19
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
So maybe it's kind of longer holder.

20
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.790
And yeah I believe that's good.

21
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.610
So we can go for this.

22
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.520
And of course there is always room for improvement over here and but I'm not going to waste time on

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.340
that you can just try to make it better on your own time rather I'm just going to copy and paste this

24
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.960
one more time because we're going to create the play I can.

25
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.250
OK.

26
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.470
So kind of a play button.

27
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.960
So let me zoom in and we're going to delete everything over here as well.

28
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:07.910
So that's let me close down the series and I will bring in a triangle over here like that and we're

29
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.330
going to use this as our play button.

30
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.890
So let me just make it central and then I'm going to rotate it like that so that we can have this shape.

31
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.000
So as you can see now it looks like a play button but we're going to make it better.

32
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.390
So first of all I'm just going to give it a fill in the color of this border and then I'm just going

33
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.880
to make this look something like smoother over here.

34
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.370
Yeah.

35
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.170
This works well now I believe it's good right.

36
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.610
So it looks like a play icon so you can just use it to play videos or you can use this in your feed

37
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.590
tab bar as well.

38
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.630
So let's stop here and continue with the additional examples in the next lecture.
