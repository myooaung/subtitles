00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.520
Hi within this lecture we're going to start trying disease that we can bring in our art bird or pasteboard

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.540
in general.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.040
OK so first of all we have the selector.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.900
So this is the most basic bone because we use this to select some views.

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.550
So when we select this one we use to select till we can come over here to any object in our pasteboard

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.080
we can select them we can make them smaller we can make them bigger we can rotate them if it's applicable

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.310
of course to the case as you can see we can move them.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.990
We can do whatever we want with them.

9
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.850
OK but if we come over here for example to the rectangle and now if you come over here and hold onto

10
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.530
your mouse you can just drag and create a rectangle over here.

11
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.430
So right now if I come over here and click one more time it will create another rectangle.

12
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.410
So in order to go out of this loop I have to select the select tool or I can just hit V on my keyboard.

13
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.430
OK.

14
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.750
So as you can see now I have created two rectangles.

15
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.150
Now if I choose one I get to see its properties on the property inspector.

16
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.340
Right now as you can see I have some options like filth.

17
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.750
Now I can feel any color that I want using this color inspector here and I can't even select a color

18
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.110
I can just pick a color using this option and it will just select the picked color for me.

19
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.840
So I can't change the color over here I can change the opacity of this color as well so it will be more

20
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.860
transparent.

21
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.750
But when I go down and it will it won't be any transparent I go up.

22
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.340
So this is a good color Inspector you can just create any color that you want.

23
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.600
And over here you see a border.

24
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.310
So let me zoom in so you can see the current border over here.

25
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.780
All right.

26
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:17.680
So if I want to I can just increase the size of the border by coming over here on say six for example.

27
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.530
As you can see now we can even see the border from my broader perspective.

28
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.810
I can just uncheck this to give some border but not Phil or vice versa.

29
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.800
So if you come over here to shadow we can give some shadow.

30
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.640
For example we can choose the axis to give the shadow as well.

31
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.520
So this is the x axis and the vertical one is the y axis.

32
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.520
As you know.

33
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.770
So let me give some more shadow or hearing the y axis.

34
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.810
And as you can see we see the shadow over here.

35
00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.030
The basic idea is that you can just select a view where you can get to change you get to change its

36
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.410
properties over here like the opacity of the whole shape as well.

37
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.770
So under this you will see some blur.

38
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.940
And in this case I believe it won't do much for our case.

39
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.890
So we can do just that Justice contrasts and brightness over here but I believe it's made our view in

40
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.680
a very bad shape.

41
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.680
So I'm going to undo this.

42
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550
I'm going to check this.

43
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.200
And here we see something called Mark for export.

44
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.130
So when we try when we're finished with our design we can export the things that we're going to bring

45
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.900
in the X code as well so we can use this mark for export option.

46
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.290
Every going to see how to use them later on.

47
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.760
Don't worry we're just learning about rectangles right now.

48
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:59.040
So I get to select as I get to move this around as you can see I have a repeat grid button over here

49
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.200
which is a very cool feature of a there'll be d If you click on this you can create some repeated grids

50
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.730
are repeated views like this.

51
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.810
So you can create as many as you want and it will just copy the same view.

52
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.700
So this is good right now.

53
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.430
If you just select as you can move them around and you can even angrier up this grid to have individual

54
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.110
views later on and you can just delete them you can just change them you can do whatever you want with

55
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.830
them.

56
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:45.560
So it's a very good way to copy an views into some grids and I believe that's it for our rectangle.

57
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.720
And as you can see I can move this into the pasteboard as well I don't have to put some use into the

58
00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.160
outboard necessarily but it makes sense to use art bath as I said before because it's an object.

59
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.370
It's set to to you as a frame.

60
00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:11.480
So if I'm going to design something for iPhone then it makes sense to do it for our frame within a frame.

61
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.200
As you can see I can see in the layers a if you cannot see those layers you can just go to me view and

62
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:26.210
layers and you can see the individual elements in our pasteboard on in our art bird like this when you

63
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.050
choose one.

64
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.100
OK.

65
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.310
Now I see the art port content.

66
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.930
If I just click one of them I get to change its name or I get to delete them and I can see all the structure

67
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.140
on the left hand pane on the extra menu that I got here.

68
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.520
So that's it for a rectangle.

69
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.240
So let me choose that area every each of them and delete it because it won't make sense and you can

70
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.780
do the same things with a different way as well.

71
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:03.410
So let me show you if you hold onto shift while you're creating your rectangle.

72
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.710
It will create a square for you.

73
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.020
So whenever you hold on to shifts it will do this thing in a straight way.

74
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:19.850
So if we're creating Garrick tangle it will create a square for you if you're creating in circle for

75
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.510
instance or an ellipse it will create a perfect circle for you.

76
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.170
And aside from that we have the alt or option button as well.

77
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:37.370
So if you hold on to option it will take the first point as a center and it will just I expand this

78
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.640
view around the center.

79
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.750
For example let me hold onto nothing and as you can see I can create that view like this.

80
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:52.280
But if I hold onto alter or option it will take the first point that I touch as a center and expand

81
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.750
this view around that center.

82
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:05.310
So it's kind of cool to use shift an option in order to create some centered and straight views.

83
00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.440
So we're going to stop we're ever going to continue with inspecting other views in the next lecture.
