00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.070
Hi.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.930
We didn't this lecture we going to see how to perform say grace within sight of cold.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.240
We're not going to a sign and stating Segway right now we're just going to do the Segway inside of our

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.710
view controller that Swift.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810
And in order to do that we are going to create the Segway from here.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.780
OK.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.810
Choose this yellow that it means the view controller and just drag and drop the second view controller

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.050
and choose show Segway and this will create a Segway between these apps.

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.300
And the second one comes from the button but the first one comes from the controller itself.

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.620
So it's not a sign to any view right now.

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.710
So I'm going to give this an identifier.

12
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.750
OK I'm going to say two seconds V.C. because we will need this identifier because we're going to call

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.260
the Segway inside of our code for example if you come over here and say power firm segway to your next

14
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.940
clicked OK.

15
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.440
And this should be performed Segway.

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.560
OK like this.

17
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.930
So double click on that.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.530
Or he'd tap it will ask you for an identifier.

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.640
And I'm not looking for this shoot per for more campaign for I'm looking for power firm Segway.

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.120
So in here I'm going to give the identifier that I have written so it has to be exactly the same.

21
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.460
So two second V.C. two seconds V.C. and sender it means that this is a helper object that can transmit

22
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.270
messages.

23
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.820
We're going to do that manually.

24
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.710
So I'm just going to say nil.

25
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.820
So this will per firm the Segway that I have created with this identifier.

26
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.740
So I have written this inside of my next clicked.

27
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100
So I can't write this anywhere I want.

28
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.900
He doesn't have to be bothered.

29
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.830
It's can be anything I want.

30
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
OK I can write this inside of a function.

31
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.380
I can write this inside of a button as you can see now when I click Next it takes me to second view

32
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.960
controller.

33
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.740
So right now all I have to do when I type a name here like I still had next I wanted to show it here

34
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.330
but in order to do that we need to learn about some new stuff as well.

35
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.650
Because in the second view controller I have some variables but I cannot reach them in the first view

36
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.500
controller right.

37
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.950
In fact let me create a new variable here and they assign it to be my name labeled text because we're

38
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.420
going to need that eventually.

39
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.930
Right.

40
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.010
So we have to do it under class but outside of my we did lots function.

41
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.520
So I'm not defining this into a function.

42
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.110
OK I'm defining this outside of my functions inside of my class so that we can reach it from everywhere.

43
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.180
So I can assign it to be my name right.

44
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.470
So this is OK.

45
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.020
Now only thing to do is just to connect is my name which we have controller.

46
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.960
So we have this variable over here but I cannot just come here and call this right.

47
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.620
I cannot just say my name from here because it won't be in the first week controller it will be in the

48
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.960
second controller.

49
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.790
By the way do product build or command B when you create a second view controller.

50
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.120
So every file on your app should be synchronized.

51
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.990
OK so after you do that we're going to learn about a new function called prepare for Segway.

52
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.430
So within this function we tell what to do right before we do our Segway.

53
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.290
OK.

54
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.410
So if you write prepare you will see prepare for Segway.

55
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.330
And this is an override function.

56
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:11.280
It means that this is generated for us before and we are overwriting we're editing dysfunction and we

57
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.740
can't just say if the Segway is coming from this view to that view do this.

58
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.070
Of course we can have multiple say grace in an app and we have identifiers to differentiate them so

59
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.540
we can use these identifiers in here.

60
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.670
So before we do that let me create the user name variable and I'm going to say name tags that text.

61
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.640
OK.

62
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.950
And it's actually OK to force I wrap this because I'm sure that this text exists and it's going to take

63
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.240
some empty strings at least.

64
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.570
OK.

65
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.590
So what I basically want is to make this user name equal to the my name in the second view controller.

66
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.040
Right.

67
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.640
So we can use prepare for a Segway function in order to do that because this gives us a Segway.

68
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.840
This gives us a UI storyboard Segway that we can use this in order to understand why we are going and

69
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.060
where we're going from.

70
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.650
So how do you do as you control.

71
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:25.040
You start by controlling Segway identifier and the Segway first the given Segway in this function.

72
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.880
OK.

73
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.890
You can check to see if the Segway has really the second V.C. identifier.

74
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:32.450
OK.

75
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.180
If that's the case we're going to do what we have to do.

76
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.370
So what we want to do is actually define the second view controller.

77
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.340
OK.

78
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.550
So let me show you in the main storyboards.

79
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.860
You can understand better.

80
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:57.390
So we have some have controllers and we have some Sig ways in the storyboard and the Segway vill have

81
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.470
a desk nation.

82
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.430
So it's coming from this view controller to second view controller and second view controller is the

83
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.500
destination right now.

84
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:14.720
So if I say say great that destination it will give me the wheel controller that I'm going to.

85
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.170
OK so we can use this.

86
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.690
So let me say Segway.

87
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:27.770
That destination and as you can see it gives me a UI view controller and I can cast this view controller

88
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.760
to be my second view controller and I can use this as a variable.

89
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.280
So let me create this variable does let.

90
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.990
Destination we see.

91
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.980
OK.

92
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.170
And of course I'm going to use Segway.

93
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.720
That destination.

94
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.660
And this will give me the view controller about this is going to be a UI wave controller and I'm going

95
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.770
to cast this as my second view controller.

96
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.790
OK.

97
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.720
Because I know I'm going to the second view controller because I've checked the Segway identifier.

98
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:07.740
OK so I'm going to use as well as before and I'm going to first casters.

99
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.440
I'm pretty certain this is going to be my second view controller if any dropped.

100
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.980
If you have any doubt over here you have to differentiate your sick ways.

101
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:24.520
You have to make sure that this is definitely going to be second view controller or else this will fail.

102
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.480
This will crash.

103
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.360
So now if I say destination we see as you can see V how second view controller as a variable.

104
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.870
And we can reach what they were we want to we can reach my name string from here.

105
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:48.020
So right now I connected my second view controller as a variable and I have managed to reach the attributes

106
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.870
the variables of that view controller so I can just make it equal to user name.

107
00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:02.060
And of course in order to do that I have to come over here and do this insides of my class.

108
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:10.130
But outside of my function so I'm going to initialize this as an empty string and rather than saying

109
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:18.800
var here I'm just going to say user name as user name tags start text why I'm doing this inside of next

110
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:27.470
clicked rather than we've did load because I want to assign this name text that text then actually user

111
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.680
clicks on next clicked not when the app is loaded.

112
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:39.200
So we're getting guess an error here so let me try and do comment B.

113
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.740
Yeah.

114
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.590
This error was nothing so if I do command B it will go away.

115
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.200
So here we go we have what we need right.

116
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.960
So let me run this.

117
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.680
Let me try to give a name to my text field and hit next.

118
00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.970
So let me say a tail OK and a text and let me go to second first.

119
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.720
If I hit this as you can see I don't see anything.

120
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.070
And if I hit next.

121
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.100
Now I see a tail here.

122
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:18.800
So as you can see this works in a way that we won't we're controlling the say when identifier if that

123
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.570
is correct.

124
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:28.070
We're casting our second view controller as a variable so that we can reach it any time we want.

125
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.220
OK.

126
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.400
And we do that inside of next clicked so that I clicked the next clicked.

127
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:41.560
It worked but when I clicked the second button in which I don't have any code.

128
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:49.370
It didn't take my name and just show it on the second view controller because it only works if the Segway

129
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.780
identifier is actually two seconds V.C..

130
00:09:52.880 --> 00:10:00.410
So that's how you work we'd segue ways that's how you work with second screens you can write so much

131
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:06.950
more in this weave controller and in fact we're going to build a lot of apps during this course and

132
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.250
we're going to use Segway as most of them.

133
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:16.070
So we're going to be practicing this a lot in the upcoming lectures.

134
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.350
So we can't stop now.

135
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:24.320
And within the next lecture we're going to continue using this app but rather than say Waze I'm going

136
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.510
to show you some other concept called we have controller lifecycle.
