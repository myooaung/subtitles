1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,770
High within this lecture regrowing to ads navigation by using the detailed disclosure button in our

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,610
notation and we know how to do that from the travel book app.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,860
Remember what we have to do we have to call for V for a notation to customize our annotations.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,120
But as you can see we cannot call you for a notation right now because we haven't made our details we've

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,360
controller a delegate of our map view right.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,580
So let's do that.

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,870
Let's come over here and let's say that M.K. map view.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,780
Yep this one map view delegate I remember we used to say see our location manager delegate as well but

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,920
I believe in our case we're not going to use this because we're not getting the user location at this

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,840
point.

11
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:02,190
So afterwards if we need this we may have to edit later on but right now I just need those details map

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:12,330
view that delegate itself once I do that I can come down and I can call for V for a notation so let's

13
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,300
call for we for a notation.

14
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,610
Here you go we are looking for this function and in here we're going to check to see we're going to

15
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,750
actually customize it the annotations that we have but I don't want to deal with location on notations

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,750
of the current user.

17
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:38,340
So remember how we do that we we actually begin to check to see if annotation this one.

18
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,790
OK.

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,290
This notation is M.K. user location on notation.

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,670
So I'm going to return nil if that's the case.

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,880
And later on I'm going to create an annotation.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,420
I remember how we do that.

23
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,210
This is giving us an error because it expects us to return that notation which we will later on I'm

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,310
going to create this annotation and I'm going to call this pin view and this will be map view that D

25
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,870
Q reusable levitation wheel and this will ask us to give you an identifier and actually we're going

26
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,870
to use this identifier more than one time.

27
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:27,300
So I'm going to create a reuse idea here call it pin and give this reuse idea as an identifier and then

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,950
I'm going to check to see if this pin view is nil or not if it's still done we're going to give it some

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,260
odd notation to it.

30
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,860
We're going to create our own notation here for real.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,130
So this will be an M K pinpoint our notation real.

32
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,580
This will ask us to give it a notation and an identifier.

33
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,580
The notation is this one okay and the identifier is the identifier that we have created.

34
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,510
So give it some reuse I.D. and then later on we have to say pin me dot can show call outs.

35
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,310
So this means that we can actually show the button that we're about to show on the right hand side.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,430
So if we don't do that even though we added it won't display it so let me create that that's button

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,620
that we have been talking about.

38
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,150
So the type of this button will be disclosure detailed disclosure.

39
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,470
OK.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,440
So it will display something with I like in an information button OK.

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,600
And we're going to add this to be air right.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,020
Call out accessory view to our pin view.

43
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,640
OK.

44
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,020
So that it will display the button in the right color accessory.

45
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:50,610
Else if pin is actually not nailed down pin where you are location is d notation that is given to me.

46
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,050
So that's it.

47
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm referring to design notation by the way.

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,820
I'm going to return this pin view so that I have my customized notation.

49
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,850
So if you haven't watch the map section I believe you should go and watch for a refresher because I'm

50
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,560
explaining everything in the details in that section.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,060
And again I'm going to call for call outs accessory control tapped.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,500
And this specifies what will happen once we click on that button over here we have created that button

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,370
remember.

54
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,490
So this defies what will happen when a user taps on that bottom.

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,360
So what we want to happen is to open the navigation actually and in order to open that navigation remember

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,790
we need something called Place marks.

57
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:50,310
And in order to get that place marks object we need to have a reverse geolocation operation and in order

58
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,900
all of these things to happen we have to create a location to begin with.

59
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:04,390
So under this call out accessory control tapped function we're going to control we're going to actually

60
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,290
create a location first.

61
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,740
So we have our chosen latitude and longitude here right.

62
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,270
So I'm going to check to see if SDR chosen longitude is not zero that's the euro.

63
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,630
So we have some values and if South are chosen latitude again is not zero that's the euro.

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,150
So I can come over here and I can create a location.

65
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,030
And at this point it doesn't make sense to have these values zero that zero.

66
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:45,570
But again to be on the safe side I believe we can just do it after we check this I'm going to create

67
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,340
this request location.

68
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,040
OK so this request location will be a at location.

69
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,890
So this is not a single location according to the.

70
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,670
And you will see why in a minute.

71
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,830
And again this will ask us to give some latitude and longitude.

72
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,090
So this will be chosen latitude.

73
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,320
And this will be chosen longitude.

74
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,730
Okay.

75
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:17,190
And after we give this after we create this request location then we are going to use this yellow geo

76
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,050
coder that I was talking about.

77
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:26,040
So this actually converts place names to coordinates or vice versa.

78
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:34,410
So I'm going to do a reverse geo called location this one and this should in fact ask me for a request

79
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,800
location as here location and I cannot see it right now because yeah I misspelled it.

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I have to add this parentheses over here and say reverse geo location.

81
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:54,270
Yep this one as you can see it asks us to create a second location and it gives us a completion handler.

82
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,830
So that's the one I want.

83
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,700
Let's let me give a request location and hit enter.

84
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,620
Here you go we have our place Mark Rey.

85
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,700
So let's call this place marks an error.

86
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:15,090
So I'm going to cast my place marks array as a place Mark variables so that I will make it not optional.

87
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,600
By doing that.

88
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:23,940
So after that I'm going to check to see if placed mark that count is actually greater than zero meaning

89
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,120
that I have something inside my array so that I can create my M.K. place Mark object.

90
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,820
So this will be M.K. place Mark.

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,640
OK.

92
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,560
So this is a description of the chosen location.

93
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,520
It will ask me for a place Mark.

94
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,410
So this one and I'm going to get this from place Mark zero.

95
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:55,140
So first element of my place Mark object and then I need a map item because that's what we need to open

96
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:03,100
in navigation is and it will drive from it will be coming from this M.K. place Mark and this one yep

97
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,200
that I'm k.

98
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:12,870
Place mark that I have created later on I'm just going to use this map item and we can give it a name

99
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:20,370
if we want to display in the navigation as well and we can get this name from our details name label

100
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:20,750
right.

101
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,780
So details.

102
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:31,260
Name label dot text so that we can see the name in the navigation as well and actually now I can just

103
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:38,760
come over here as a map item that's open in maps but it will ask us to give some specific launch options.

104
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,250
Let's take care of that as well.

105
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,380
Let's create launch options.

106
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:51,810
So first we have to give some key and the key is M.K. launch options directions mode key and the value

107
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,270
that I'm looking for is more driving.

108
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,760
So I'm okay.

109
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,440
Launch options directions more driving.

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,390
So this will by default.

111
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,040
Show me how to get there by car.

112
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,440
So let me give this launch options and let me try this.

113
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:18,480
So let us Iran does in our simulator OK and let us try to go to James a restaurant and if I click on

114
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,510
here you will see the disclosure button.

115
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,940
This is the detailed disclosure button as you can see.

116
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:34,110
Now if I tapped on this if I tap on this actually this will get cold colored accessory control tapped

117
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:43,500
and will bring me into a navigation in which I will get my current location to the destination location

118
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,370
navigation.

119
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,910
So this is showing drive by default.

120
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,990
And here you go.

121
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,270
That's all we wanted again we are using map item to open in maps.

122
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,700
So and we are checking to see if the location is not empty and we are creating our request location

123
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:15,490
because this will ask us to give us some MTA map item and in the MTA map item we need some place marks.

124
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:24,140
And in order to get this place marks yep we have to create this place marks array and in order to create

125
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:31,670
this place marks a we have to have this reverse geo called location and in order to have this request

126
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,020
location we have to make sure there is latitude and longitude is not empty.

127
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,380
That's why we are doing all of this.

128
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,760
Now I believe we are okay right now.

129
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,630
We can go ahead and test to see if our app is really working by adding new places.
