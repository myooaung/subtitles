00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.470
Hi within this lecture we're going to continue building our Kenya app.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.080
So far we have designed our game right now.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.650
First things first.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.660
I'm going to make sure that when a user taps on Kenny it's actually refreshes the scar it increases

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.920
the score and shows it on our score label.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.270
And in order to do that what can we use.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.200
If you say gesture recognizing you're absolutely right.

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.040
Because that's where I'm going to go.

9
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.070
So I'm going to create a gesture recognize her and I'm going to assign them one by one to our Kenny's.

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.010
Of course first I need a score variable to keep track of this score right.

11
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.620
I'm going to initialize this as zero and then later on I'm going to do what I have to doing in we've

12
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.440
did load because that's very it's going to take place.

13
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.680
So I want them to happen when the first user launches this app.

14
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.310
Like what.

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.740
Like creating a gesture recognized.

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.090
So I believe you know how to do that right.

17
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.420
First let me make sure that score labeled text displays the score.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.610
So I'm going to go for a score.

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.690
And with a reverse slash over here I'm going to use my scoring teacher.

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.010
And then later on I'm going to go ahead and create my gesture recognize there and then assign it to

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.400
be my gesture could nicer in my image of use.

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.110
So I cannot do that with one gesture recognize it.

23
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.590
Unfortunately in fact it makes sense to use one gesture recognizing.

24
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.530
But unfortunately that's not how it works in Swift.

25
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.910
That's not supported.

26
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.890
So we have to create each recognize one by one.

27
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.680
So I'm going to call this recognizing one and this will ask for a target.

28
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.250
And of course the target will be south.

29
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.480
And you know why this is right because we're going to choose the selector function in our view controller

30
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.840
and I'm going to create this function just for once.

31
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.020
Hopefully this is supported and swift so I can just call it to increase score and all this function

32
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.530
is going to just increase the score by 1 and display it on the text score labeled that text.

33
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.260
Okay.

34
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.840
So we have to make sure we put flunking here and in the action I'm going to go for a selector and increase

35
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.430
score.

36
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.890
So that's good.

37
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.130
I'm going to create this recognize there for nine times so I'm going to copy and paste it for nine times.

38
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:59.180
So one two three four five six seven eight nine so you can change it in a fast way.

39
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.930
Okay.

40
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.990
One two three four five six seven eight nine.

41
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860
And you can choose the same function.

42
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.260
Okay.

43
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.110
So increase score will do the thing for all of this recognizes.

44
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.800
And now I have to make sure that these are recognizable as are assigned to related Image view so I'm

45
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.090
going to go ahead and say can you one dots even recognize or gesture recognize her right.

46
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.540
So how do we do that add gesture her and we're going to add recognizing one in here.

47
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.570
So I'm going to copy and paste is nine times as well and I'm only going to change the numbers.

48
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.210
So this is four five six seven eight nine and I'm going to assign the relate to the recognizes as also

49
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.130
one two three four five six seven eight nine.

50
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.230
OK that's cool.

51
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.660
And in fact we have to make sure that these images can be clicked.

52
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.950
These images can be tapped.

53
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.240
So before we do that we have to say can you one ease user interaction enabled to.

54
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.920
So I'm going to do that for nine times as well.

55
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.970
So after we do this boring stuff will be over I promise.

56
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.120
So you have to do this though.

57
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.000
So can you one these user interaction enabled.

58
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.990
So I'm going to copy and paste is nine times as well.

59
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.750
So one two three four five six seven eight nine.

60
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.320
So let me see two for three.

61
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.080
Five six seven eight.

62
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.570
And we need the one more so nine.

63
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.300
And this all will be true.

64
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.620
So we are good to go.

65
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.610
We have created our kidney's me.

66
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.210
We made sure that we created the recognizes and we assigned them to be.

67
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.960
Gesture recognizes all the lighted imagery use.

68
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.380
So far so good.

69
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.120
Now we're making progress.

70
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.560
So let me increase the scoring here.

71
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.790
All I want to do is just say score plus equals 1.

72
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.660
So it will add 1 to the current score.

73
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.240
OK.

74
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:28.320
And of course I had to say score labeled that tax is going to be score reverse slash and score because

75
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.930
that will refresh the current label.

76
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.610
OK.

77
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.690
So I believe we can test is right now right.

78
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.510
I did that in the we did load as well.

79
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.500
So these may cause a little bit confusion for you but if I don't do this here it will just refresh this

80
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.350
core variable but it won't refresh the score label because this code will only get called once once

81
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.920
D we did load gets cold.

82
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.510
And after that it won't get cold.

83
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.450
So we have to make sure we add this line here.

84
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.100
So as you can see when I tap on this it increases the score.

85
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.270
So let me try a retaining here.

86
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.970
So it seems that it works on all of the cases.

87
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.460
So we are good here.

88
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.980
So we managed to increase the score right so we can move forward.

89
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:31.620
We have to make ways to animate these kidneys and we have to make ways to count down from some certain

90
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.500
number and we have to make a way to store our high score.

91
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.460
And we are going to do all of this in the following lectures.
