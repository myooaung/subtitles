00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,230
Hi.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,250
We didn't expect you re going to see how we can create this fear rather than a box so that we can create

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,470
our worlds create our planets so that we can build our solar system app.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,190
So it's easy I'm going to comment this out rather than creating an ICM box.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm going to go for a science fair.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,360
OK so I'm going to call this my sphere.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,490
OK.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,420
And this will be an ACNC fear.

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:36,720
And if you open parentheses it will ask you for one radius because the radius will be okay to create

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,960
a sphere.

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,570
And again I'm going to go for something small like 0.01.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:50,100
And of course we have to make sure we change this my box to be my sphere in order to add this to our

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,820
scene view.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,840
So this is my sphere.

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,510
Here you go.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,580
Now we can test this and we will see will that JP G wrapped around our sphere so that we will get a

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,900
wooden sphere.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,790
Okay.

19
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,000
So let's see.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
Here you go.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,460
Now I believe this is good right.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,670
We can do something with that.

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,940
As you can see we have this round image that looks like a planet but it's like a wooden planet.

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,640
And it's OK.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,820
And of course we're going to find some textures to wrap around our spheres later on like a virtual texture

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,750
or Venus texture.

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,340
But for right now we're good to go with that.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,600
So what I'm going to do I'm going to create a function in order to create some spheres later on because

29
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,680
we will add more than one and it will be not efficient to copy and paste everything over here.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,980
It's better to do that with code.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,290
Better to do that with functions.

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,870
So I'm going to take everything from here.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,370
I'm going to cut them with command X and I'm going to create a function called Create sphere.

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,460
Okay.

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,700
And under that function I'm going to paste in everything and I'm going to get some inputs over here.

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
First of all I need the radius.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,030
Right.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,790
And our radius will be as he felt type and rather than saying radius we're going to say radius over

40
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,730
here and we need a content name.

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,510
Right.

42
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,540
Like a Would that JP.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,600
So I I'm going to call this content and it will be a string.

44
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:41,240
And finally we we will need a vector and this will be an ACM vector tree.

45
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,720
So if we give these inputs we can easily create some spheres later on.

46
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,550
So rather than saying Would that JP I'm going to open a parentheses here with a reverse slash and say

47
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,750
content and let me see where the radius is.

48
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,150
Yep it's here.

49
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,920
So rather than single point one I'm going to go for radius.

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
OK.

51
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,300
And rather than giving the SC on vector I'm just going to give the vector over here so this function

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,690
will return some N.S.A. to me.

53
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,710
OK so I'm going to make it return on a C and note and I'm going to return the note over here that we

54
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,410
have created so that we can assign this note to be a variable over here.

55
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:33,220
For example let me say let my sphere is a create sphere function.

56
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:42,290
I need to return as a node and over here it will have 0.01 radius and a content of all dots PMG and

57
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:50,600
a vector of ACM vector tree and open parentheses and I will give the same numbers one more time like

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,970
a zero 0.01 or and minus 0 point 5.

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:02,240
And I believe we test this with 0 point 5 all the time so I'm going to change this to be minus 1 and

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,270
let me do this something like 0 point 2 so we can see how it looks like our other than saying note of

61
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:16,010
course we have to say my sphere to make this work and now I'm going to run this on my simulator on my

62
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,080
iPhone actually not simulator on my real device to see if we can see this fear with Waldock PSG.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,780
So let me open my phone and here you go.

64
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,580
We see walled up PSG wrapped around our sphere.

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
So it's looking good.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,050
It looks like kind of Star Wars planet over here.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,550
So I believe that's good.

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,050
Now we can find some other textures to work on but but before we do that I'm just going to show you

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,500
one more thing.

70
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:54,950
In order to verb vids shadows more efficiently you can come over here and say seeing view dots automatically

71
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,400
updates lighting.

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,430
And this will be true.

73
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,680
And then I run this.

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,180
It will be much better in terms of lighting and in terms of shadows.

75
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,020
So maybe you cannot see it as if it has at this point because it was already looking good.

76
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,220
But in other cases you will see the difference when you do this.

77
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,620
It will take care of lighting and shadows by it so so it will be much more realistic.

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,950
It will be much more lively.

79
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,880
Okay.

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,380
So I believe we can't stop here and in the next lecture we are going to find some planet textures and

81
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,460
we agree to finalize our solar system app.
