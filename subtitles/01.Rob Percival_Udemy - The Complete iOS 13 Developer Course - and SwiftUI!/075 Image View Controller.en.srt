00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,680
Hi within this lecture we're going to add our second we've comptroller and we will make it so that when

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,540
we tap on one of these elements it will take us to the other we have comptroller.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,840
So in order to do that let's go to our main story board and first thing we're going to do we're going

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,950
to add a new view controller.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,980
Right.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,090
So in order to do that open this library and search for a real controller we have done this before right.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,560
So you know how to do it.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Just drag and drop when we have controller to here so that we can have a Segway from here to this wheel

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,500
controller.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,610
And you know I have to do that as well.

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:51,300
Just click on this yellow dot and we'd control Drag this to the other controller and say show.

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,920
So this will create a Segway a connection between our UI view controller and the new View Controller.

13
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,570
So this is connected to we have controller that Swift.

14
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,350
And the second one is not connected to anything.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,210
So before we do that let me embed in the navigation controller.

16
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,640
And remember what it does.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,890
It creates a navigation bar inside of our UI we have controller and also a navigation bar in the have

18
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,290
controllers that are connected to this table view we they show Segway so that we can have it back by

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,970
then automatically in our navigation bar.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,140
So it will make us our life much more simpler when we go back and forth between this view controllers.

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,390
So we have to create an image view inside of this view controller right.

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,940
We we will have one image view and we will have one labeled that's it.

23
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:58,410
We are going to display the image of the selected landmark every going to display the name of the selected

24
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,380
landmark.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,230
So let's go for a label.

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,810
So this is where we're going to display the name.

27
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,970
So this is going to be name.

28
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:13,110
Let me make this a little bit bigger because we might have that long landmark naming here.

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,100
OK.

30
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,600
So that's good.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,420
Let me zoom out a little bit so we can see better.

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,080
So let's make this centrally aligned.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,210
That's all right.

34
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,610
So we have an image view and we have a name label.

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,500
And of course later on if you want you can add that description label you can add a country label whatever

36
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,790
you want.

37
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,850
Don't forget to reset to suggest the constraints.

38
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,790
So we will have a proper view here.

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,590
OK.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:49,630
And the next thing is to define those images into a controller which we don't have right now.

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,570
We have to create a Coco touch glass like we did before.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,830
Remember how we can do that.

43
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:04,620
We can just go to this landmark book folder right click here and say new file a rather dense file I'm

44
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,150
going to go for cocoa touch class and this will be indeed a view controller a UI weave controller but

45
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,270
I'm not going to named his view controller.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm just going to name this image view controller or you can just call these details we have controller.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,280
OK can choose a name and it's UI controller and Swift is perfect for me.

48
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:36,040
So I'm going to say next and create and this will create this new service file in my project folder.

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:45,330
So we're ready to go to mainstream birds and connect this view controller to my image view controller

50
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,760
within the identity Inspector.

51
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,210
So I'm doing this kind of fast because we have done this before.

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,940
So you know what to do.

53
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:02,370
We are just re practicing it so that we can do it better we can really understand it then we have to

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,020
write our own apps later on then we finish this course.

55
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,860
So let me open the assistant editor over here and let me bring in the image of you first.

56
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,630
OK.

57
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:22,920
Control drag this imagery to here called Image view and we only have one more reading here which is

58
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,280
a label.

59
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,200
So let me choose this label and drag and drop and let's say label.

60
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,860
OK landmark label and connect it.

61
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,880
So we're good to go.

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,890
Let me close this down.

63
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,220
We're done here so we can have an identifier to these Segway as well.

64
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,320
So make sure that the Segway is chosen and go to identifier.

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,350
You can say something like to image V.C. or image view controller.

66
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,310
OK we're going to use this identifier in our code.

67
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:07,270
So make sure you remember this so too imagery controller and everything seems to be right in the main

68
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
that's Tory Burch.

69
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:17,020
So we can go to our real controller dot swift and re going to call another function.

70
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:24,740
So since we are a delegate of disabled we we can call the related functions remember and this time I

71
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:34,340
want a function that understands if I tap on the table to use cell I will explain what to do 2 x code

72
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,480
in that function.

73
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,400
So if you search for did select row m looking for did select throw.

74
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay I'm not looking for did these select throw I'm looking for did select a row at.

75
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,870
So this is did select row and it gets cold.

76
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,440
Once a user taps on one of these rows.

77
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,050
So what will happen when the user taps on one of the rows.

78
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:11,180
Basically I want to do and say grey right so I can come over here and I can just say present or perform

79
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,710
Segway not present performed Segway and the identifier that I'm looking for to Image view controller

80
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,400
OK and center is nil.

81
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,490
And this will just take me to Image view controller.

82
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,770
So let's try this.

83
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:36,650
Let's run our app in simulator and then we tap on one of these landmark names it will just take me to

84
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,890
the imagery controller in which we won't see anything yet but later on we will see.

85
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,550
So let's choose Coliseum.

86
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,420
As you can see we see a label.

87
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,040
So this is working well.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Each time we click one of these landmarks we get to go to Image view controller.

89
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,290
Now it's time to stop here and within the next lecture.

90
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,710
We're going to make it so that we pass this information to Image view controller so that we can display

91
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,150
the image and the name of the chosen landmark.
