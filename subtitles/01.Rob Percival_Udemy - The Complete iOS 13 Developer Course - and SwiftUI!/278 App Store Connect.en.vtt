00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.210
Hi.

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.620
We didn't this lecture we agreeing to see the necessary steps to take in order to configure app in a

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.670
proper way so that we won't get rejected from the App Store.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.720
And also we will have a good app store optimization configuration for example.

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.630
Over here you will see something called subtitles.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.170
OK so this is kind of optional but don't let this kind of opportunity go because it's optional.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.490
You have to provide a good subtitle over here explaining your app and explaining your app in a good

8
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.550
short way so that when a user searches for your app like be the keyword or something your app can display

9
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.210
in upper positions.

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.970
OK.

11
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.650
So app store actually works kind of Google.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.070
Maybe you have heard the term and a search engine optimization before.

13
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.130
So this is kind of things that you do to get a good visibility on Google.

14
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.190
And in here we have App Store optimization.

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.530
And again these kinds of things that you do to get a good visibility on the App Store.

16
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:20.030
So here you can provide a good subtitle for your app and after that we have other sections as well.

17
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.720
So for example here we have this Privacy Policy your URL so you have to have a privacy policy.

18
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.150
According to Apple in every app so that you can let your user know what kind of data you're gathering

19
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.720
from them and what are you doing with that data.

20
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:50.490
So after releasing of GDP far and every other personal policies personal data protection policies this

21
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.520
became one of the most important topics in the Apple as well.

22
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.700
So I'm going to show you how to create one.

23
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.270
So if you come over to Google and search for privacy policy ie your less app generator.

24
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.270
OK so yep this makes you makes much more sense privacy policy generator for U.S. apps.

25
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.320
If you search for that you're going to get a lot of free the results a lot of free tools.

26
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.590
For example I'm going to go for this first one a privacy policy generator.

27
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.280
So we're going to create our privacy policy from this tool and you're going to have to put that up on

28
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.820
a website and give it's your round to the apple.

29
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.510
So if you don't have a website yet you will see how to create one in the next section as well.

30
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.250
So for app name I'm going to say app store test for example.

31
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.320
OK.

32
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.520
So this is app store test and for contact information I'm just going to give my name.

33
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.080
I'm just doing this for an example I haven't even used this tool before.

34
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.130
I'm just showing you that this is very easy to find and create.

35
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.360
So let me just say yep it asks for what kind of personally identifiable information that I'm collecting.

36
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.800
This is something like email address telephone number and personal address mailing address and everything.

37
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.440
So for example I'm just going to go with e-mail and telephone and for a platform I'm going to go for

38
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.650
AOS and are they using any term party services for example.

39
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.020
I'm not using google play services.

40
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.180
Maybe I'm just using firebase analytics.

41
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.730
So I have to include this in my privacy policy as well.

42
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.330
If I click on generate it will create this policy for me.

43
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.260
So if you're working for a big company of course your low years may generate that for you but if you're

44
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.070
just developing for your own as an individual you're more than welcome to find a free privacy policy.

45
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.570
And I really suggest you read that of course in order to detect if there is something funny over here.

46
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.570
But I believe there is not in this case for example over here you'd say that yeah we're collecting your

47
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.540
e-mail and telephone and we're using some term party services like firebase analytics.

48
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.410
So it's informing the user of what we're doing about their privacy.

49
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.700
OK.

50
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.760
So you can come over here you can check to see for security for example the app you're collecting some

51
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.680
personal information and we are doing our best to protect that information.

52
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.260
OK.

53
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.740
And on the bottom of this page you will see there is an advertising for this Web site.

54
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.430
So you're more than welcome to copy all of this and delete the last line from here and paste it in your

55
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.530
web site so that you can get.

56
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.920
It's your URL and provide it as a privacy policy to Apple.

57
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.150
So if you don't do that your app will get rejected.

58
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.150
So make sure you complete the step before you tried to up the upload your app.

59
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.570
After that if you're developing for Apple TV it will ask you for a privacy policy as well.

60
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.850
And we don't want to deal with that right now.

61
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.200
And over here we have to choose some categories.

62
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.330
For example let me choose entertainment from here.

63
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.330
And of course you can choose a second one if you want but this is optional.

64
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
For example let me go for lifestyle and over here.

65
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.240
Let's see.

66
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.950
Yeah.

67
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.380
We have this bond the it's already selected for us and I believe that's OK for this page.

68
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.930
Let me save this.

69
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.730
And on the left hand side you will see the pricing and availability.

70
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.620
So if you want to sell your app you can choose a price from here of course it has its own price his

71
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.780
own range.

72
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.210
And if you want free you can choose the first one to sell your app for zero dollars.

73
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:13.560
So after you've saved this and I believe there is some kind of other options over here like if you're

74
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:23.160
selling your app for a price you can just do a discount for educational institutions by selecting this

75
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.510
option over here.

76
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:34.320
Since we're releasing for free I'm not going to go over these options and then later on I think we are

77
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.520
done with the pricing.

78
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:42.000
So if you click over here to prepare for submission you will see some other options as well.

79
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.190
And these are important.

80
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.440
And here you can see the submit for review but then after you're done with everything you can submit

81
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.610
your app.

82
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.660
Here you see these screenshots of our app.

83
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.750
So you're going to have to take some screenshots and upload them over here and taking screenshots is

84
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:08.730
actually very easy using simulators or you can use your own phone for example you can just take a screenshot

85
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:16.190
with your app running and just upload it from your phone to over here.

86
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.460
Right now I'm just going to show you how to do that with simulator so that you can take some different

87
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.410
screen sizes and upload them to the App Store as well.

88
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:37.380
So let me run this OK and once my simulator runs I'm going to show you to take a screenshot from the

89
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:43.530
simulator menu not the regular rate that you take a screen shot in the back office.

90
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:50.700
So once it gets loaded click on your simulator and you're going to have to go to your simulator menu

91
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.800
from file.

92
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:57.780
You can just say new screenshot and it will take a screenshot of the current page and save it to your

93
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.810
desktop.

94
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:04.530
And as you can see we're just seeing a blank page and it doesn't make sense but that's how you get a

95
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.560
screenshot later on.

96
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.450
You can just take this and upload or here.

97
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:20.260
And I believe these sizes don't fit with this one let me try it 5.5 inch display.

98
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.020
No it doesn't work like that as well.

99
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.990
And I believe iPhone X R is not one of these sizes.

100
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.900
So we have to go for either six point five or 5.5 inches.

101
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.760
So let me try iPhone 7 or iPhone 8.

102
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.680
I believe it was something like iPhone 8.

103
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.170
Let's try with the iPhone 8 and if it doesn't work we're going to have to find it eventually anyway.

104
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.100
So let me just go back one Violet's loading.

105
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.350
I'm going to show you the other information as well.

106
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.100
So here we have this promotional text and description.

107
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.930
So these are very important for App Store optimization again.

108
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:06.370
So you're going to have to write its short summary a promotional text over here.

109
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.250
So this is sharp and description will be long.

110
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.720
So we have like 4000 characters over here.

111
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.950
So you're going to have to write anything that is related to your app.

112
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.850
So make sure you include the important keywords in this description as well.

113
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.780
For example if you're doing a movie social media application about the movies.

114
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:37.630
Make sure you include words like movie directors ratings and stuff.

115
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.850
And in the keywords it's same as well.

116
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:47.620
So you have to include the important keywords so that when people search for that keyword they can see

117
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.060
your app in the App Store search.

118
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.060
So that's it.

119
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.580
And Lee how does support your url.

120
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.210
So this is something like a contact information.

121
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:07.030
So if any user wants to connect with you about your app they may have to go to your Web site so that

122
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.980
they can click on the contact section so that they can send you an e-mail and stuff.

123
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:17.530
So make sure you provide your web address to the support yourself as well.

124
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:21.930
And below we have this marketing your URL and this is optional.

125
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:28.540
So if you want to market your app if you want to display some additionally information about your app

126
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:35.250
in your Web site make sure you provide it's in the marketing your URL but that's optional.

127
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.870
So our iPhone 8 is ready so let me take a screenshot and test this.

128
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.520
So let me come over here and try to bring this in.

129
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.810
So let's go for this.

130
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.000
And this doesn't work.

131
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.130
Let's see if this is 5.5.

132
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.600
Yep.

133
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.330
It doesn't work as well.

134
00:10:54.460 --> 00:11:01.870
And I believe we have to search for it right now because apparently I don't know the screen sizes for

135
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.420
iPhones very well.

136
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:11.230
So iPhone six point five inch is for iPhone X s and let's see what 5.5 was.

137
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.960
Yeah it was six plus eight x plus seven plus or eight plus.

138
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.260
So it's not iPhone 8 it's iPhone 8.

139
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.030
Plus I don't even have iPhone 8 plus.

140
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.980
So let me create that simulator over here.

141
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.310
So let me come and choose iPhone 8 plus.

142
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.250
Okay.

143
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:39.790
And let me give it a name so let me call his iPhone 8 plus and close this down and run this in my simulator.

144
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:48.220
But before that I'm going to quit out of that one and I'm going to run this in iPhone 8 plus I'm not

145
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.450
going to actually upload this to the App Store on submitted for review.

146
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.990
But anyway I just want to show you that this actually works.

147
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.390
So let me delete this and come back over here.

148
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:07.180
So let me go down so that we can see the other information over here.

149
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.050
So in this right hand section we have some person lead formation.

150
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.950
That's why I'm blurring over here.

151
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:15.390
OK.

152
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:22.020
So that you cannot see my address and you cannot see my telephone number and stuff.

153
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:28.940
And on the left hand side we have this app store icon and we have this version.

154
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:36.120
So make sure one point always selected if you're releasing if you're uploading it for the first time.

155
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:43.510
And over here you can just choose any app store I can that you want and you're going to know how to

156
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.960
do that in the design section later on.

157
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.510
OK.

158
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.850
So if you come over here you will see app review information here you're going to have to provide your

159
00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:02.110
username and the password and your contact information so that if any technical person from Apple team

160
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:08.050
wants to contact you they can contact you using this information.

161
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:08.630
OK.

162
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:14.530
So that they may ask you something about your app before they accept or reject.

163
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.530
So in the version release this is important.

164
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:24.100
So to medically release this version means that once Apple accepts this it will get released to the

165
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.770
App Store immediately.

166
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:33.110
And if you don't want that you can just go for manually release this version after Apple actually accepts

167
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.970
your app.

168
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.130
You then choose then to make it official.

169
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.070
Then to make it published in the App Store.

170
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:47.360
If you come over here to release this version at the specific date you can just choose a time.

171
00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:55.540
And before that time if Apple accepts your application now you can just upload it to the App Store anytime

172
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.260
you want.

173
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.430
So let me take another screenshots and let me try this one.

174
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.390
Hopefully this time it will work.

175
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.370
And here you go.

176
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.170
Now it works.

177
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:13.160
And of course just uploading one picture won't do the job you're going to have to upload like a several

178
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.640
of them in each sizes.

179
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:16.480
OK.

180
00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:22.630
So after you're done over here you can come to other tabs as well.

181
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.400
And I believe we are almost done because we have gone over every detail.

182
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.150
So let me save this information.

183
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.540
Now let me go to these features.

184
00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:40.560
So if you're using something like inner purchases or Game Center you can adjust your settings from here.

185
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.800
OK.

186
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.210
And we have this test flight.

187
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:51.380
This is a testing tool so if you want to have test users before you release your app you can use that

188
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:58.570
tool to test your app and create some test users and a rethink and indie activity tab.

189
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.330
You can actually track your app versions.

190
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:08.600
So if you change your app for Vita updates for example you can see the older builds from here.

191
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:16.060
This menu how we how to upload our actual app to here so that we can submit for review.

192
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.020
Let's do that in the next lecture.
