00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.580
Hi.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.520
We did this lecture regrouping to finish our authentication process by implementing remember user and

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.990
logout functions.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.860
Right now if I run this from scratch it will ask me one more time to sign in and that's not what we

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.870
want.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.910
So in order to take care of that we are going to use what we have been using so far.

7
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.250
Where are you going to come over here to our Tap Bar.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.130
And are we going to give you some storyboards I.D. to our Tap Bar.

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.500
OK so this will be tab bar and make sure that you don't have any class over here so this is just a UI

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.340
tab by controller.

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.750
OK and let's come to our scene delegate why we have the window Rainbow and under this function will

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.220
connect to session function.

13
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.570
I'm going to check to see if we have the user or not.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.030
So I'm going to import the file your base.

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.930
OK.

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.940
And over here we're going to see if the current user is nil.

17
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.810
So I'm going to create the current user from authentication module and I'm going to check to see if

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090
this user is not.

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.990
No.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.770
So if current user is not actually nil then it means that I have a user signed into already which I

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.910
can use that user right.

22
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.150
So let me create my main Storyboard So this will be a story Bert and this will ask me for a name and

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.480
a bumble and name will be main bundle will be name and then I'm going to create my tab bar as a variable

24
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.290
and then I'm going to say bought that instantiate wi controller.

25
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.730
OK so this will ask me for an identifier.

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.260
And this is the identifier that I have just given.

27
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.760
So this is tab bar.

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.130
So I'm going to first cast this as a you or I tab bar controller.

29
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.270
OK so UI tab bar controller this one.

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.170
And if this holds that I'm going to make my route with controller my tab bar.

31
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.610
So if we have a logged in user regarding to use our tab bar as a truth we have controllers so we're

32
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.060
going to take the users to the feed we have controller.

33
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.400
Now let's run this in our simulator and let's see if we can go to wheat feed we have controller directly

34
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960
because we have already signed in with James.

35
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.700
Right.

36
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.640
So there is no reason to see sign in we have controller right now and here you go.

37
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.900
We are in sight.

38
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.130
Now we had to take care of this logout functionality as well so that we can try our functions.

39
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.920
So let's come over here to log out.

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.160
Of course we are going to have to have a Segway from our logout settings controller to signing we have

41
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.270
controller.

42
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.350
So let me do at present mildly Segway.

43
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.200
And then later on I'm going to click on this and go to do is picture or we're here to make a full screen

44
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.260
Segway and I'm going to call this to sign in we see.

45
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.390
So let me copy this because we're going to need help later on.

46
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.300
And let me go over to my settings we have controller over here we are going to have to do it do try

47
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.860
catch because remember de logout function kind of throws an error.

48
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.150
So let's do that.

49
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
Let me import the fire base first.

50
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.190
OK.

51
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.180
And then I'm going to say do an open parentheses.

52
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.530
I'm going to try over here and then later on I'm going to catch if there's any error.

53
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.730
So what I'm about to do is to log out from the current user so I'm going to do that with AUTH Of course.

54
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.820
So all thought of that sign out as you can see this chose an error.

55
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.220
So that's why we are doing this.

56
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.880
Do try.

57
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.690
Catch.

58
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.460
After doing that of course I'm going to perform a Segway.

59
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:22.600
So let me say soft performs Segway and we're going to pass in the value that we have copied.

60
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.990
And here you go.

61
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.280
Now we are ready to test this.

62
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.140
So let's run our simulator and let's go to our settings we have a controller.

63
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.300
Okay so let's go to settings we have controller and log out and over here let me run this from beginning.

64
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.430
And we're going to see if we have any problem.

65
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.050
Here you go.

66
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.340
Now we are in designing we have controller.

67
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.370
Let me sign in with James and we're going to see.

68
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.780
Yep.

69
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.690
Here we are.

70
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.750
Various sites.

71
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.630
And if we run this from beginning if we go to feed we controller as we are now.

72
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.440
Now it means that it's completed.

73
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.360
We are dumb needs our authentication process.

74
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.770
Now we are ready to take care of this upload we have controller so that we can upload some snaps to

75
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.580
the firebase server.

76
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.510
That's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
