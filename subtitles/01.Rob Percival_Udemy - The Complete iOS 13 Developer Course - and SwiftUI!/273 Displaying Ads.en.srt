00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,980
Hi within this lecture we're going to load our ads and we're going to show them to the user when they

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,300
click on the next button.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,320
So we already have initialized our interstitial ad.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,320
So let me go back to documentation and see how it's done.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,950
So here we have lower than at and we have showed the ad sections so again loading the ad doesn't mean

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:32,880
showing them to the user first we have to create a request and we have to load that request so that

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,980
our ad will be ready to be presented.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,140
So I'm going to do that under we did load as well.

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,710
Once I initialize my interstitial ad I'm just going to create a request and load it and then later on

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,360
you can show it to the user when you want as you can see this has an is ready method.

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,830
So if this is ready we can present the interstitial ad using the S as a route we controller.

12
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,580
So I'm going to copy this if block of course you can copy the else block as well if you want.

13
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,080
If this is not ready you can do whatever you want.

14
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:18,540
So let me go back to my app and paste in or here so that I'm ready to present this to the user.

15
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,880
Now it's if it's ready I'm going to present it.

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,880
If it's not I'm not going to do anything else.

17
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,490
So let me run this and it will display a test ad not a real ad so that we can see if it's working or

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:32,850
not.

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,680
So once I click on Next here you can see the test ad over here so it's a full screen ad rather than

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,310
seeing a not good ad over here Regis going to see real really good ads.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,420
So let me close this down and as you can see now we have learned how to display ads.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,210
So remember to change this ad unit I.D. once you complete your app and once you're ready to deploy this

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,950
to the App Store from here and from the info that people list as well.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,530
And that's not all.

25
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,680
Actually you can't do much more things with the ads if you come over to the documentation you can see

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,530
that you can actually have a delegate in your interstitial ads and you can set the delegate to the V

27
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,070
controller itself.

28
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,050
By doing that and it will give you some power to call these functions.

29
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:36,210
So this is like a lifecycle of ad you can just choose to do something when interstitial ads did receive

30
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:43,380
some ads or if it fails to receive or it will present to the screen or it will dismiss from the screen.

31
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,820
So you can choose to do some actions when this happens.

32
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,820
OK.

33
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:57,330
So you can use these functions in order to have much more complicated algorithms regarding the displaying

34
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,480
of the advertisements in your app.

35
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,930
So here you can take a look at other options as well like banners or rewarded ads.

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,280
So that's it for bringing in Google ad mobs into your projects but you have to know some other features

37
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,140
of Google ad mobile dashboard as well so that you can control your ads in a real good way.

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,470
For example let me go to Google.

39
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:31,500
Add them up and here after you create your ads you after you do your setup up you can come over here

40
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,850
to blocking controls in which you can choose whatever ads that you want to display in your app.

41
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,520
For example here we have some categories and they are all allowed ad at the beginning.

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:53,340
For example if you want to block some certain kind of categories like if you don't want to show any

43
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,550
auto mobile ads or if you don't want to show any art ads you may choose to do it.

44
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,630
So for example you can see there are a lot of categories over here.

45
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:13,470
So for some reason I don't want to show an auto mobile ads so I can't come over here to auto and vehicles

46
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,390
and disable this ad block.

47
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,640
This ad category so they won't be shown in my app.

48
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,770
OK.

49
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,130
And there is no reason to block Auto mobile ads.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Most of the time but you can come over here to sensitive categories in which you will find something

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,190
like dating or drugs and supplements or I don't know politics.

52
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,080
OK.

53
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:46,470
So you can't choose to block these ads like a religion if you don't want to display any religion related

54
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,170
ads.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,600
You may choose to do it.

56
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,370
So from here.

57
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,060
So it's important to choose these categories OK depending on your app.

58
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:05,200
And we have other features to block or filter dads like you can come over here to add content rating

59
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:13,240
so you may want to filter do ads regarding their content rating or something else like if you don't

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:22,510
want to show ads that are directing major people or directing the minor people you may choose to do

61
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,750
it so and you can just choose some advertiser your URLs to block the ads.

62
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,360
So as you can see it gives you complete control over your ads and it's fantastic.

63
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,230
So you can use this Google ad mob to make money out of your apps.

64
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,760
So that's it.

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,540
We're going to stop here and continue within the next section.
