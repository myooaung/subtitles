00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.610
Hi within this lecture we going to see how to run our simulator in order to simulate and test our code.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.010
And so far we didn't write any code but actually we have just added a new label over here right.

3
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.480
So we see the helos swift over here and we're not going to live this as it is.

4
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.260
We're going to change this app a little bit.

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.730
We're going to build an app but for right now I'm going to show you how to create an simulator and how

6
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.370
to choose one and play one.

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.960
So if you don't see any options over here you can go to ad simulated tears if you click over here you

8
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.850
can choose the simulators from this tab and you can choose whatever you want.

9
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.750
Right now I only have iPhone 8 x on X R and I can delete or rename it's in the way I want.

10
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.530
It doesn't matter which name I'm using because I can click on this plus bottom and I can choose whatever

11
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:14.370
form whatever i pad version what I want and I can rename those simulators and I can create new devices

12
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.320
as you can see for rating system version I have now.

13
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:28.620
IOW 13 if I want I can download more simulator run times and I can have more operating system versions

14
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.300
from here.

15
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.680
And in fact I don't need any of this simulators right now.

16
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.400
I'm good to go with AOS 13 so for example you can just create an iPhone 7 like this and when you create

17
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.370
these kind of devices you can choose one of them and you can run your code.

18
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:58.290
You can run your app inside one of these devices as a simulator on your Mac us.

19
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.060
It's very easy to do that.

20
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.400
You can't go over here and choose just one ad in the top option you will see something called no device

21
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.630
is connected to my Mac.

22
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.460
And if you actually connect your iPhone using a USP you can choose your own iPhone and you can test

23
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.770
your apps on your own iPhone.

24
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.040
I'm not going to do that because Apple has some kind of limitations like you can just run 10 apps per

25
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.780
week on your own iPhone.

26
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.800
If you don't have a developer account registered.

27
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.470
So for now we don't need that.

28
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.380
So not to complicate things.

29
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.700
I suggest you to try these apps try your apps on your simulators rather than your phone and there will

30
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.990
be exceptions of that obviously for augmented reality apps or for push notification tests.

31
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.650
You will need your iPhone or you will need a device like i pad.

32
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.380
I'm really going to go into all of those matters later on.

33
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.780
But for right now just choose one of those predefined phones predefined simulators over here like iPhone

34
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.400
X are and if you click on these ROM but certainly if you click on this play button.

35
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.790
If it will just compile your code and it will display your app for you in the simulator.

36
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.020
Right now we don't have any code but we have a label.

37
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.590
We can't see how it how our label will look like in the real iPhone X are using this simulator right.

38
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.450
Once you do that if you're starting for this first time it can take some time like a couple of minutes

39
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.610
maybe and you will see a screen like this.

40
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.630
So this is going to open your app.

41
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.660
This is going to open your phone first and then he stole the app on your phone in your simulator and

42
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.850
then displayed for you.

43
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.190
And this may take a couple of minutes.

44
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.870
As I said this is being a little faster for me because I have around this before and as you can see

45
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:18.090
now I can see my helos Swift's label in my phone and I can see exactly what it will look like when somebody

46
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.790
downloads to download this app today your iPhone X our model.

47
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:31.860
Okay so we're going to test our apps using this simulator regrouping to run some code we're going to

48
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:39.960
play this on our simulators and we will see how it will react under real circumstances.

49
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.320
And this is actually a phone you can use this like you can go to the Internet.

50
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.440
It does you can just play around with the simulator but we're just using this simulator readjust using

51
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.750
this phone for tax purposes.

52
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.050
OK but this is functioning iPhone simulator like I can go to I know I can change what they were I want

53
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:13.740
from here as well so I can close and I can open I can go back and France as in a regular form.

54
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.650
So this is how we create this is how we work with the simulators.

55
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:24.070
Right now I'm going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to design our app.
