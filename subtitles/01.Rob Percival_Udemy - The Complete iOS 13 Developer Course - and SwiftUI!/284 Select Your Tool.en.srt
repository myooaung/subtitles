00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,400
Hi.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,260
So far we have been learning care about a U.S. development.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,550
And actually we have learned a lot so that you can create your own apps you can make money out of your

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,630
own apps.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,390
You can apply to be an professional AOS developer and so much more.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,170
But right now you don't know how to do a design a simple design like you don't know how to engage in

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,160
user interface and user experience situations.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,240
So I'm going to show you a way to enhance your design skills.

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:43,140
OK so re going to be working with design software is we going to see how we can create easy images to

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,280
use in our apps so that we can take care of little image you lead a live visual problems.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,290
And in order to do that we have to come up with a software that tool to work on.

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,180
So I'm going to show you a couple of alternatives so that you can choose one.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,820
So if you come over here to Google you can search for our first option which is sketch.

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,250
Actually it's not our first option where you're not going to use this because it's not free but it's

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,780
a very popular tool.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,190
And in fact I believe this is the first choice when it comes to you eye and you X design for mobile

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,040
apps.

18
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,640
And it goes like this sketch dot com.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,580
OK.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:37,590
So this is a digital two designed to as you can see it kind of looks like this where it lets you create

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,070
new good designs for your mobile apps.

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,350
And the other two that I'm talking about is the adobe extreme.

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,680
So if you search for it they'll be extinct.

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:56,940
Will being you in a Web site like this so deep as you can see this is the adobe Steve Web site.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,290
And if you search for the Big Steve I believe you can just easily find this.

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,540
And the most beautiful part of this this is for free Adobe.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,620
Steve is completely free.

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,830
Where as you're going to have to pay for this catch.

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,970
I believe they're pretty much the same.

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:26,070
And since we're not looking for to be a designer or a UI UX person I believe we're good to go with Adobe

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,960
Steve because they're almost the same thing.

32
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,570
And Adobe.

33
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,810
Steve for free and you have to pay I believe like a hundred dollars per year for a sketch.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:45,420
Right now I have sketch in my computer as you can see I pay for it and because I I got used in a long

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,070
time ago and Adobe still only came out like a couple of years ago.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,460
So I'm still using this sketch as you can see it's pretty easy to use this and you have seen me doing

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,820
some stuff some visuals on my computer before in the development section as well.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,310
But right now I'm just going to go with it.

39
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,070
They'll be Steve.

40
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,740
So as you can see if you come to the pricing of sketch you will see.

41
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,840
I will ask you for a hundred dollars to pay and it will only give you one year of updates.

42
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,940
So if you want to update your schedule later on then you're going to have to pay it one more time.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,560
So it's not cheap.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,590
It's kind of a hundred bucks like getting an apple developer account.

45
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,480
So it's kind of an expensive to be an IRS developer as you can see but you can make it for free as well.

46
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,830
So I really suggest you come here to.

47
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:48,780
That week Steve's Web site and just download this and if you have any existing tools on your computer

48
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,950
like photoshop or something then you're more than welcome to follow the section with Photoshop as well.

49
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,160
We're going to discuss why are we using Adobe d rather than Photoshop and other tools later.

50
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,780
All right.

51
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,950
Now if you click over here it will ask you to create an account.

52
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,740
So this is an Adobe account so it won't ask you for a credit card or something.

53
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,980
So if you just click over here to create account you're going to have to give your first name last name

54
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,400
email and everything and it will create the account for you.

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,960
So since I how an account let me come over here and sign in and I don't want to go to any phone number

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,630
or we're here right now.

57
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,000
After that you can just come over here and it will ask you for permission to download.

58
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:47,100
If you click on Download it will download not the adobe Steve but this Adobe Creative Cloud application

59
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,840
for you.

60
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,490
OK.

61
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,020
So maybe you're going to have to do some little installing but I believe you can do that.

62
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,660
If this asks and as you can see in my kids in my case it won't asking a thing it just opens this up.

63
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,850
And as you can see this is a tool to manage old adobe softwares.

64
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,860
Right now I only have extreme in my computer about Adobe has a lot of other tools as well like Photoshop

65
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,880
actually belongs to the adobe itself.

66
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:27,890
So after you install these tools as you can see you can update them using this Adobe too easily.

67
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,720
As you can see there are a lot of options over here but I'm just going to go with Adobe Steve and I

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,390
don't even know what those bios software is do.

69
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,300
Most of them actually.

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,070
And you.

71
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,670
You can use the photoshop if you have it on your computer.

72
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:54,810
As I said before but photoshop is actually for editing the photography doing some big images of focusing

73
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,690
on editing and creating new visuals.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,180
But in Adobe 60 and in sketch we focus on designing mobile apps.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,990
So if you see the install button right next to the adobe.

76
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,780
Just click on it it will start to download it for you.

77
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,300
OK.

78
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,390
So after you download you can come over here to your launch pad and find the adobe steam or you can

79
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,840
hit Commandant space in your computer to find the adobe 60 and open it as well.

80
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:35,370
Right now I believe my yeah my update is completed for me so if I click over here to open it will pop

81
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,430
open at page like this.

82
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:46,200
So when you see this maybe you can see some little differences as well because Adobe the actually gets

83
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,540
updated every month.

84
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:54,210
So that we is doing a very good job of keeping this up to date.

85
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,610
They're very current.

86
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,560
They're adding new features to the other weeks every month.

87
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,380
So it's kind of super cool.

88
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,530
OK.

89
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:11,010
And don't hesitate to try out this catch as well you will see it's doing the same thing either as Adobe

90
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,380
is.

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,400
So if you're thinking that I'm missing out something in sketch because I'm not paying for it that's

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,720
not really the case.

93
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,690
OK.

94
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,770
So after you select this then you're ready to go into the next lecture because that's where we're going

95
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,980
to create our first project.
