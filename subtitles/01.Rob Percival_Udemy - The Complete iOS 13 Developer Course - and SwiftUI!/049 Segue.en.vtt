00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.420
Hi we within this lecture we are going to see how we can connect this very personally controller with

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.440
the second view controller so that we can go back and forth any time we want.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.440
So before we do that what defines which we controller is shown first.

4
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.990
So you see the little arrow on the first few controller right.

5
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.500
So this defines the entry point of our app.

6
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.920
So if I run my app right now I will see the view controller.

7
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.290
OK.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.930
First we have controller because this arrow is here.

9
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.570
So this is first we have controller as we expected.

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:49.020
If I take this arrow and put it in the second view controller if I run this right now I'm going to see

11
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.610
the second view controller.

12
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.990
OK.

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.220
So that's how you change your entry point but I don't want to do this I want to use you really start

14
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.240
with the first view controller and then find a way to go to second wave controller anytime I want a

15
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.870
beer in mind that you can change anytime you want.

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.930
You can drag this entry point to any controller.

17
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.680
So there are a couple of ways to execute Segway is.

18
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.300
Remember Segway.

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.410
We have talked about this this basically the connection between the first wheel controller and second

20
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.020
controller.

21
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.720
So let me create a button over here and we going to make it that.

22
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.560
So when a user taps on this button it will go to second view controller and I'm going to make it in

23
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.760
a way that I'm just going to do it from here I'm not even going to use a code I'm just going to create

24
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.010
the Segway and the main storyboard and this will be some siting methods.

25
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.340
This will be not a living thing.

26
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.990
When a user taps on this it will just take them to the second view controller in order to do that he'd

27
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:12.300
control and direct the first button to second view controller like this and drop as you can see it creates

28
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.950
a Segway.

29
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.300
So we have to choose Segway type over here.

30
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.470
We generally go for a show and we have some others like present Maudsley and I in most of the cases

31
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.190
you don't want present bodily or you don't want the other.

32
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.940
So I can say grace over here.

33
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:40.800
The show is very useful when it comes to going back and forth and you're going to see how we can leverage

34
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.690
this.

35
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.150
So if you choose it it will create this arrow that you see and this is the Segway itself.

36
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.090
If you click on the Segway you can see it attributes as in the regular view.

37
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.970
OK.

38
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:01.310
And in the right hand side you see that it has an identifier you if you want to give it one it.

39
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.310
It doesn't have much really it only has an identifier.

40
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.120
And we're going to need an identifier Reinado to differentiate Segway because we're going to see more

41
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.750
than one.

42
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.240
So I have just connected this button to the second view controller and I didn't do anything else.

43
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.110
If I click on this as you can see takes me to the second view controller in a way that it's pop ups

44
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.110
like this and the user can just take it down any time they want.

45
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.600
So this is cool right.

46
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.130
This is very good.

47
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.180
Animated.

48
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.190
This is practical.

49
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.290
But most of the time you don't see this kind of Segway in apps.

50
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440
Most of the time you see a bag by them.

51
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.700
You know you two go back and forth between view controllers.

52
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.840
So choose your wheel controller and I'm going to show you how to do that.

53
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.830
Go to Ed and say embed in navigation controller.

54
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.390
So this will bring in a new controller for us and we're not going to see that controller in the real

55
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.920
app as you can see it seems like a new wheel controller but it's actually not it just gives us a navigation

56
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.510
controller and navigation bar inside of our apps.

57
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.910
Now as you can see we have created that navigation bar in the first week controller.

58
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.880
And whenever we Segway from First we have controller to another one the another one will get navigation

59
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.300
bar automatically with a back button.

60
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.790
So this is very very practical and this is what we see inside of apps generally.

61
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.310
So let me run this I show you how it works and you'll love this because it's so practical it's so easy.

62
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.520
If I click on this.

63
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.240
Here you go.

64
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.350
I'm in the second.

65
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.410
If I click back I mean the first.

66
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.190
So this is kind of cool right.

67
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:08.800
And yeah that's basically it but there will be some times that you don't want to.

68
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.880
Just a sign a Segway to a bottom.

69
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.720
Maybe you want to do something before you go and show information on second controller.

70
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.930
For example if I had to get a name from user and displayed in the second view controller I cannot do

71
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.900
that without writing code right.

72
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.660
So it's not a good way to assign a Segway from a button to a controller.

73
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.920
This is the easiest way but we generally don't pay for it.

74
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.530
We prefer it with code.

75
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.340
So let me create this kind of setup for you so you will understand what I'm saying in a better way.

76
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.760
So let me dragging a text field.

77
00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:01.350
OK so within this text field regrowing together name from user or just a text from user every will try

78
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.080
to display this text in the second view controller.

79
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:15.440
So I'm going to create another button over here and I'm not going to a sign and new Segway to this bottom.

80
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:24.790
So let me go to place holder has a name so user will be giving his or her name in here and in this button

81
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.100
I'm going to say next.

82
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.040
So let me make this a little bit bigger and make it central.

83
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.380
OK so here we go.

84
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.030
We have what we need.

85
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.620
And again I'm not going to go and just do the say great thing this time or rather I'm going to place

86
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.730
a label over here and this will display the name.

87
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.070
So this is going to be name.

88
00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.690
OK.

89
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.620
Name label and we're going to display what we get in this first week controller and this is kind of

90
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.310
hard right.

91
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.960
Because we cannot reach the variables inside of one have controller from another one if we don't know

92
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.340
what we're doing because they're completely different swift files.

93
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:17.180
So let me first try and is sign this into our codes as a variable.

94
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.510
OK so let me drag and drop and called his name label or name text.

95
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:32.240
So this is named text and I'm going to need this but I have not even a sign the other button as an action.

96
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.290
Remember we didn't write any code to show and run the Segway.

97
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.010
Right now we need one because I'm not going to do as I did before.

98
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:51.020
So let me two seconds view controller because I'm going to define this name label here as well and let

99
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.220
me say.

100
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.710
Name label OK so yeah.

101
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.180
That's basically it.

102
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.560
We have defined our objecting to coding section.

103
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.510
Now are we going to stop here and continue building this Segway app in the next lecture.
