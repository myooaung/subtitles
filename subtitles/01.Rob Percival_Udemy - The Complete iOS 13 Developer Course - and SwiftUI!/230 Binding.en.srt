00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,520
Hi.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:08,640
We didn't this lecture we going to see a new concept called bindings and in order to do that I'm going

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,610
to create another file as usual.

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:19,610
OK I'm going to come over here and say Neil swift UI file and I believe this will be our fifth view.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:29,190
OK so in this fifth we you I'm going to change our text one more time but rather than changing it constantly

6
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,330
I'm going to take the input from the user.

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:32,950
Okay.

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,010
So regrowing to use a text field along with our text as well.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,900
So let me wrap this around the V stack because I'm going to have a text field just under my text and

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,080
text field is the actual text field that we have used before in storyboards as well.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,630
Right.

12
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,290
So this is where we get input from the user.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,780
When you open the parentheses it will ask you for some parameters.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,300
Where are you going to go for the first one which asks for a title and a text.

15
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,370
So title is actually just a place holder and the text is the binding string and we going to see whether

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,290
this.

17
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:22,050
So in text fields in the texts side I'm just going to say place holder and it will display this message

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,950
if there is nothing on the text field.

19
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,900
OK but in the text I'm going to create a state variable as before and I'm again going to call this my

20
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,870
name and this time I'm going to go to James as my name initially.

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,070
OK.

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,570
And after that we're going to display James over here in the text section.

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,770
So this will display my name rather than hello world.

24
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,340
And I'm going to bind my name to the text fields.

25
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,160
So how do I do that.

26
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:07,130
And what does it even mean to bind something you will see if you write my name it will give you an error

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,310
it will say that yeah I'm asking for a binding string and you're just going to you're just trying to

28
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,060
give me a regular string rather than binding strings.

29
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,810
So how do we convert something to be binding.

30
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,990
You put dollar sign in front of the variable name.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,190
Now it's bind that.

32
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:36,510
So it means that when we changed this text field value the state variable will also get changed.

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,700
OK.

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,100
And we get to see the change in the text as well since this is a state variable.

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,380
It will be re rendered.

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,790
So here we go.

37
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,770
Now we see the James in the text and we see the James in the text field.

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:03:00,630
So let me just bring this up a little bit by adding yet padding and just increasing the font size a

39
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,060
little bit so that we can see it better as as you can see now we see the James.

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,840
Now I want to change this text field so that this binding variable will get changed as well.

41
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,720
So let me click over here.

42
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:16,630
OK.

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,960
And you cannot see the keyboard but you can just type with your own keyboard.

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,590
And as you can see once I delete and once I add some characters this changes.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,540
So this is very cool right.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:39,050
In order to have something like this in all the regular main story boards we had to go for delegates

47
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,010
and we had to bring in some new functions on everything.

48
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,950
Of course we can't reach this result in old way as well.

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:56,430
But this time we're doing this just with one line we're just binding this variable to our text field

50
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:04,230
so that when we change this value the same variable will get changed and everything I showing that state

51
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,990
variable will also get re rendered and we will see the new result.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,110
We will see the new value on that text as well.

53
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,420
So this is again one of the cool features of swift UI.

54
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:27,630
It may seem a little bit complicated when you compare it with previous methods like we didn't have this

55
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,060
binding game we didn't have this at state before.

56
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,170
But right now we have this.

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,650
And once you get to know this you will love it because you can actually create whatever you want with

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:46,470
swift UI in less time in less code and in a more structural way.

59
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,910
Now we have a lot more to learn regarding swift UI in order to do that.

60
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,490
I'm going to stop here.

61
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,150
I'm really going to start building an app.

62
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,090
It's called favorite book.

63
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,360
Every we'll just learn along the way when we built the app so we will get to practice what we have learned

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,220
so far and we will learn a lot more things along the way.
