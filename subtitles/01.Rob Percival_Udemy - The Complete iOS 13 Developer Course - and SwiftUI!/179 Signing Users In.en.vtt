Hi.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.390
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see how to log users in so far we have created our user right.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.150
So now we have the James user.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.500
Now let's go into the sign and click and try to log that user in.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.950
So of course we are going to use P.F. User class one more time here.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.580
So I'm going to check to see if user name tags that tax is not empty string and password.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.290
Tax that tax is not even an empty string.

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.240
One more time because if that's the case I don't want to send any requests to the server I just want

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.920
to go to an empty string message to the user.

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.650
Okay.

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.770
So I'm going to do what I have been doing so far.

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.400
I'm going to use make Eliot as a user name and password.

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:03.720
But if they're not empty strings then I will just begin to log the user in by using P.F. User class.

14
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.380
So again if you say P.F. user dot to you will see a lot of options like signing in signing out.

15
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.340
But we need something called the log in.

16
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.780
So there is the logout function.

17
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.000
We're going to use that later on.

18
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.920
But right now I need something with logging in of course we're going to log in in background we username

19
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.160
and password.

20
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:36.630
So as you can see we have this log in that chosen error and this is working sync erroneously.

21
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.960
We want something with backgrounds like this.

22
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.080
OK log in user name in background with its user name and password.

23
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.860
And this gives out a block.

24
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.810
So that's exactly what I want.

25
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.810
I want to log in with the user name and the password and see the results in a block.

26
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.700
So for user name I'm going to go for user name tax stop tax and I'm going to force unwrap this and for

27
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.220
a password of course I'm going to go for password text not text and for song wrap this as well and for

28
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.060
block if you hit enter it will give you either a user or an error.

29
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.900
OK.

30
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.560
So this time we don't get any boolean like we did before.

31
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.880
Right now we get a user.

32
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.650
So let me call this user and let me call this error.

33
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.740
So insight does closure.

34
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.030
Let me just close this.

35
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.490
So we can't see better.

36
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.420
OK.

37
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.890
Let me close this one as well.

38
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.980
I'm going to check to see if error is not nil.

39
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.980
And of course if area is not nil I'm going to say s stop make Eliot and for a title I'm going to go

40
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.930
for error and for message error dot localized description with a default value of error so if that's

41
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.760
the case I'm going to display this.

42
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.800
But if it's not if I don't have any error messages it means that my user has signed then.

43
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.660
So generally I want to do a Segway in here every going to do that.

44
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.750
Once we create our other we have controllers.

45
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.220
So I'm going to take an old saying Segway for right now.

46
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.970
I'm just going to show you what this user has.

47
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.800
If you say user dot you can just get the user email.

48
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.620
You can just get the user password user that the user name and if you want to do something with that

49
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.370
user variable you're more than welcome to do over here.

50
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.820
Right.

51
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.660
So right now all I want to do is just print out something like welcome OK.

52
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.660
Maybe we can do something like user dot user name.

53
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.300
And before that we can just print out the welcome message.

54
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.810
Of course we don't do that in real app.

55
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.990
I'm just doing that as an example to see if we manage to log the users in.

56
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.250
So let me run these on our simulator and let's go for James but for password let's leave this blank

57
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.660
as you can see we get we got the error so it's working fine.

58
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.490
Let me give our own password as you can see we get the invalid user name or password from the PA server.

59
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.140
So this is our error message.

60
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.240
And if I give the wrong our right credentials as you can see the logs me in.

61
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.270
So we have created signing in and signing up functions but we cannot actually use them since we don't

62
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.620
have any further view controllers at this moment.

63
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:50.600
And I believe this is the time that we stop here and create these places we have controller in which

64
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.730
we display the existing places in the server so that users can choose one of them and display the details.

65
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.760
But we are going to do that in the next lecture.
