00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.280
We didn't this lecture we going to see how we can have an image slider in our apps so that we can display

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.550
all the snaps inside of our snap B.S..

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.750
So that's how I did that.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:21.090
I went to Google and I googled for horizontal image slider not an android but in U.S. Swift.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.790
So as you can see we have a lot of options over here.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.410
So it's very easy to work with in the library in order to create an image slide show.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.770
So I went for that one.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.440
So this is called Image slide show.

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.410
And it's very easy to work with this image slide show of course I'm going to share this you're all in

11
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.930
the resources with you but you can just google it and find it yourself if you want.

12
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.730
It's very easy to bring this in and it's very easy to load the images as you can see it has a part.

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.260
So let me bring in this pod so that I can explain how to use it while it's being installed.

14
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.770
So let me close down and let me open the terminal one more time.

15
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.130
OK so let me make this a little bit bigger because it opens very small actually.

16
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.630
So I believe that's OK.

17
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.050
So let me go to downloads and I guess completes and Snapchat clone.

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:32.820
And over here I'm going to pull the install because we have already edited our pop file and over here

19
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.260
you will see some documentation related to this image slideshow.

20
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.080
And one of the greatest features of this is that they actually provide us ways to include images from

21
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.340
the Internet as well.

22
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.980
So this is not only for the images in your own project.

23
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.330
You can actually use Elmo's Fire.

24
00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.900
You can actually use sd web image or Kingfisher in order to download everything from the Internet and

25
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.330
display them in this image slide show.

26
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.750
So I I'm going to go with this Kingfisher source.

27
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.640
So we already have as the web image in our own project.

28
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860
But this is another part.

29
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.020
So we have to go with another pod over here.

30
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.500
And I have tested to see that SD web image source does not work properly in this case.

31
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.600
So copy this pub name as well and open your pod file.

32
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.450
OK.

33
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.180
So other than image slideshow I'm going to bring in this image slideshow Kingfisher as well.

34
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.310
And this will bring in the Kingfisher pod itself as well.

35
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.240
So now we have to image caching and image downloading as he cronies downloading image libraries in our

36
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.790
app but I believe that's OK.

37
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.730
So you can just eliminate the s the web image and go with the Kingfisher instead.

38
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.440
But I'm going to live this as it is so that you would know all the options regarding to this image downloading

39
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.660
sets and tools.

40
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.900
So when I run party install one more time as you can see Kingfisher has been downloaded.

41
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.400
Now we are ready to use it.

42
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.600
And there is a great documentation about this.

43
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.850
I'm not going to show you the documentation I'm just going to write it.

44
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.930
So you would know how this works but I suggest you go and search for the documentation to see the other

45
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.730
features of this image slider as well.

46
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.120
So I'm going to bring in this image slide show and we cannot use means storyboard to bring an image

47
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.780
slideshow to our view controller but rather we going to create this image slide show as we did in the

48
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.960
layout section.

49
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.770
OK.

50
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.510
So we are going to use the same technique to create the view and add this as a sub view inside of our

51
00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.640
weave controller.

52
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.100
OK so I'm going to use we've added load in order to do that.

53
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.640
And of course we can check to see if SNAP is here or not.

54
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.140
So I'm going to make this selected snap non optional as we did in the selected time.

55
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:25.340
And if that's the case then I can get the related information from snap like snap that image Larry area.

56
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.380
And if I go into a for loop using this snap image URL area I'm just going to have this individual image

57
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.610
your eyes inside of this image.

58
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.140
So let me call this image here.

59
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.430
Also it would be more explicit.

60
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:47.760
So now I have all the images URLs here one by one and I just want to display them in our image slider.

61
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.240
So let me create my image slide show so you will know how to do it first.

62
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.140
I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to give it a size.

63
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.500
Give it a position.

64
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.040
So I can have it on my view so that's how it goes.

65
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.280
Let me call the Zemin slide show and this will be a type of image slide show.

66
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.780
OK.

67
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.780
This one.

68
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.850
So once you do that you can open parentheses and it will ask you for a referee.

69
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.510
So remember this frame.

70
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.510
Then you say see direct it will ask you for an X and Y coordinate and also a width and size.

71
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.470
We then height sizes so let's do that.

72
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.500
Open C.G. rect and choose this.

73
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.920
So it asks you for an x y and width and height.

74
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.350
So we're going to actually stretch it all around.

75
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.040
I'll reveal controller.

76
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.330
So I'm just gonna say 10 10 over here because it will be stretch out to all the width and all the height.

77
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.380
So I'm going to call this self-taught.

78
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.390
We've got framed up lit and may be multiplied by something like 0 point ninety five.

79
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.060
OK.

80
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.420
So it would stretch out all the way to the edges.

81
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.490
OK.

82
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.150
And I'm gonna do that do the same thing for height as well.

83
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:11.930
I'm going to say s that view that frame that height and I'm going to multiply this by 90 percent.

84
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.350
So if you haven't watched the layout section where we define these views by code I suggest you go back

85
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.470
and watch it to see what I'm doing.

86
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.700
And over here I'm going to say image slideshow dot background color and I'm going to give a white color

87
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.120
to its background.

88
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.580
Okay.

89
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.000
Later on we can just give some indicator to this image slideshow as well.

90
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.850
I'm going to show you how it's done.

91
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.060
But now we have to work with the essentials to see if that's works or not.

92
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.090
So I'm going to say image the image slide show dots.

93
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.430
And here I'm going to specify the content scale mode.

94
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.210
This is like the content scale mode in image views.

95
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.910
Right.

96
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:06.850
So you can call UI eye view content mode and we have this aspect feel an aspect fit in this case.

97
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.730
So if you say you eye contact more dots kale you will see scale to fill skill tests packed fit.

98
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.230
And that's what we want.

99
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:22.160
Remember we have all always use this as packed fit in our UI image views and that's what we are doing

100
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.680
in here as well later on.

101
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.090
Let let me just coal use of that.

102
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:35.000
We've got Ed subdue and add this to our view so that we can see if this works or not if this works I'm

103
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.680
going to be to fly you to later on and here you can see that it has a set image input methods and it's

104
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.830
asking it's asking for some image sources inside of an array and that's what we're going to do in here.

105
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:56.280
We're going to use this Kingfisher source in order to provide this image inputs.

106
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:03.620
And we already have our Urals things over here so that we can just say image slideshow that set and

107
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.220
give some input area were here in order to do that.

108
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.070
I'm going to create my input array as a variable over here.

109
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.570
OK.

110
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.860
Over my we did load.

111
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:24.170
So let me say input array and this input area will have Kingfisher sources inside of an array so that

112
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:31.420
I can come under my forward loop and I can append everything inside of my input array.

113
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:37.900
So I'm going to say I have spent and I'm going to call the Kingfisher source and will ask me for a U

114
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.020
or else drink.

115
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.150
And of course this is image you're up.

116
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:50.380
So in this for loop I'm going to append everything to my Kingfisher sauce array and let's force our

117
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.220
practice.

118
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.720
OK.

119
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:59.520
And then later on I'm going to give this input array as an image input to my image slideshow.

120
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.530
So that's it.

121
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.910
That's how you create an image slide show.

122
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.640
So let me run this and let's see if this works or not if this works I'm going to go ahead and be to

123
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.330
fight this a little bit more.

124
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.200
So it's taking its side because we have brought in some new pots.

125
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.280
So let's see if we can see all the snaps from James Hetfield OK.

126
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.810
Let me click on those.

127
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:27.190
Yep.

128
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.080
It opens and let me try to slide.

129
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.830
Here you go.

130
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.580
Now we see all the images in a slide show.

131
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.610
We have some problems though we don't see the time label.

132
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:44.370
I believe it's it got in the background when we have covered all this.

133
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.370
We have controller reads our image slide show and we don't have any indicators showing up.

134
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.690
So we're going to take care of that.

135
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.150
First let me take care of this label issue.

136
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.960
If you want to bring some reel to the front.

137
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.650
You can just all self-taught view dog bring some sub you to the front.

138
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.930
And here I'm going to specify my time label.

139
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:17.300
OK so let's say time label and later on we're going to just give it an indicator.

140
00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.030
If you don't know what an indicator is you will see it in in a minute.

141
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.840
It displays where we are currently in terms of yes sliding images.

142
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:34.370
So you have to create this UI page control and this page indicator will have some colors.

143
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:39.880
So we have two colors one for displaying the current page indicator.

144
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:40.500
OK.

145
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.390
This will be UI color.

146
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.810
That's light gray.

147
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.320
And two we will have the other page indicators as well.

148
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.560
So this will be the current not current but page indicator tint color.

149
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.060
OK.

150
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.530
I'm going to give you eye color dark black over here.

151
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:10.150
And later on I'm going to sign this page indicator to be my image slide show page indicator.

152
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.020
OK.

153
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.700
So let me just do it.

154
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.280
And here you go.

155
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:19.270
Now let's run and you will see what the page indicator is.

156
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.390
And it will be to fly our snap we see a lot more you will see it.

157
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.710
So once you open your app click over here and here you go.

158
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:33.370
Now we have this indicator indicating where we are currently.

159
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:40.850
So as you can see very harsh is shown in light gray and the other ones are shown in black and our time

160
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.380
label is back.

161
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.890
So that's very cool.

162
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:50.680
We're going to stop here now and within the next like you re going to test our app and we're going to

163
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.980
improve our record if we come across with any bug.
