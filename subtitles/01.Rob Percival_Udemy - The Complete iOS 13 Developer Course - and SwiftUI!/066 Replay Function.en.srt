Hi.

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:09,140
We didn't this lecture re going to start writing Gover replay function so that a user taps on the replay.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,340
The score will be reset and the time will be reset.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,100
Kenny will start animating Bon soir.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,350
So let's go to our replay function.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,540
So remember we have to write this in our replay bottom where we control if counter is 0.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,670
So we invalidate as our timer.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,560
Right.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:39,480
So we need to start timers one more time and then we also have to make sure that our score label or

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,120
score variables are reset.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:51,220
So I'm going to say score zero and it gives me an error because we're inside of what is called a closure.

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
So we have to make sure that this is self.

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,540
That's core why we're doing this because the X code things that maybe we created another variable called

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,250
SCORE.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:11,990
Right now we know to reach this car we had to say s that score maybe I created another variable over

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:21,260
here called score and in order to make sure that I'm not referring this score rather I'm referring the

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:28,070
variable that I have created previously I'm saying s that score and don't ever do that.

18
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:35,240
If you have some variable called score don't ever come here inside of a closure and say that okay I'm

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,100
going to create another variable that has exactly the same name as before.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,000
So just create another name.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,430
So here you can just say s out score as well but you cannot create another scoring here so that won't

22
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,730
be any problem.

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,230
But in here D it's inside of a blog and inside of another blog.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:07,190
So you have to say s that in order to make sure that you're referring to the correct variable.

25
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:15,730
So I'm going to say South Scalia will doubt tax score and reverse slash s that score.

26
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:23,060
And after that of course we have to do that for the counter as well so I'm going to reset our counter

27
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,720
and timer label.

28
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,180
Okay time label.

29
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,600
So this will be solved our time label not taxed.

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,130
So string representation of self doubt counter.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:42,640
And after that we have to make sure to call this timer's one more time in order to do that.

32
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:50,930
Let's go over here and just copy and paste all of these values to the replay function below.

33
00:02:50,930 --> 00:03:00,440
So let's go here and paste and I believe we have to say SDR timer in order to make sure this works.

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,510
Yeah you have to say so SDR timer.

35
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:14,640
Okay let's fix it and you have to say s dots count down south dots height Katie and SDR timer s thought

36
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,620
Hi timer in order to make it explicit.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,570
So here we go.

38
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,040
We are ready right.

39
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,330
We have finished our replay function.

40
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,300
Let's see if this works.

41
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,590
So let's run our game and let's try to hit on Kenny as you can see I can.

42
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,050
Tab on Kenny and score increases so time is running out.

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:48,190
And once I reached the zero I can say replay if I say replay time will start one more time and scurry

44
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,730
0.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,010
Now wi fi tap on Kenny will increase.

46
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,980
So this works in a perfect way.

47
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,910
This is what we want.

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,820
If I say okay this will be zero and score will be seven but I cannot tap on Kenny anymore.

49
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:12,410
So we gonna The here actually and within the next lecture we are going to take care of high score because

50
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,620
in here we only reset all the variables right.

51
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:25,550
We reset score we reset counter we reset labels and we recall timer's but we don't take care of high

52
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,130
score.

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,200
So we're going to have to do that separately.

54
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,390
Let's do that in the next lecture.
