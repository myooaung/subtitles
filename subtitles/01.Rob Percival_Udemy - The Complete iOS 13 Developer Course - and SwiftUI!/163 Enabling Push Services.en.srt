1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,770
High within the section we're going to learn how to implement push notifications in other apps in order

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,660
to do that.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to use the Instagram clone that we have made in the previous section because it's so convenient.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,220
We have a like functionality over here and then we hit on like we want to display a push notification

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:32,040
to the Post owner so that Post owner will see a push notification in his or in her phone saying that

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,320
somebody liked your post.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,810
For example if you're using this with James then if Kirk likes James Post James will see a push notification

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:50,520
indicating that Kirk has liked your post so that when James hits on that push notification it will open

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:58,010
his app and we will have a complete push notification solution in our Instagram clone.

10
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,710
Of course you can try this with another app or you can create an app just to try this as well.

11
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,800
But this is so convenient so I'm going to go with this.

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,010
We don't even need Instagram or we don't even need firebase in order to make this work.

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:22,500
But anyway I'm going to use this as an example so if you haven't watched the Instagram clone section

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,320
I really suggest you go back and watch this to understand how this works.

15
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,340
And second thing in order to test push notifications you have to have an iPhone device and you have

16
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,680
to have a developer account.

17
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,240
So in order to upload your apps to the App Store and in order to test some features like push notifications

18
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,570
you have to have a developer account and it costs a hundred dollars annually.

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,410
So if you're not ready to put your app on the App Store or if you don't want to try and test push notifications

20
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,440
maybe you don't want that.

21
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,870
But if you're ready and if you really want to implement this in your app then I suggest you come over

22
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:13,930
here to developer dot apple dot com and under a counter you can create your own developer accounts.

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,920
OK.

24
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,970
Again it costs a hundred bucks.

25
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,710
So it's kind of expensive but if you're going to be an iPhone developer you will need one.

26
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,350
Of course if you're working for a company you can use your own company's Apple I.D. as well.

27
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:37,140
So this is how we go to developer dot apple dot com and just sign in our developer account.

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,080
Once you hit the account tab it will ask you for your Apple I.D. and password.

29
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:50,040
You can just give these credentials and open this dashboards where we will adjust our push notification

30
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,180
settings.

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,160
OK.

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,070
And again if you don't want to test this but if you want to learn how push notifications work you can

33
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:06,120
actually watch this section to understand how this push notifications is implemented.

34
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,570
But you cannot test it without an apple developer account.

35
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,910
So first of all I'm going to show you what we will use in order to implement push notifications.

36
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,470
And the tool that we're going to use is called One signal.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,150
OK.

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,390
So if you come to one signal dot com.

39
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,940
So this is a platform.

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,410
This is a tool that actually gives you a tool to use for free.

41
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:42,110
And you can just send as many as push notifications you want from your apps using this one signal.

42
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,750
So this is a great tool and big companies use this tool and it's completely free.

43
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,490
So why not we use it.

44
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,470
Right.

45
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:59,490
So we can use this with IRS apps we can use this with Android apps and we can even use this with that

46
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,630
push notifications as well.

47
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:09,060
So if you're building an app that works on some other platforms than does one signal will be the choice

48
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,300
for you.

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,090
And I'm going to show you how to work with this tool how to set this up and how to do all procedures

50
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,730
in order to get this work.

51
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,960
Don't worry.

52
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:29,610
So after you come to your one signal dot com you have to create an account which is fairly easy.

53
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,680
So come over here and find log in or sign up.

54
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,670
OK.

55
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,670
So I have an account so I'm going to log in.

56
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:46,050
But in your case you have to click on the sign up and provide some email address some password and your

57
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:54,840
name or your company's name and just hit create a count and after you sign up you can just come over

58
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,080
here to sign it.

59
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,970
And as you can see it says that no credit card required.

60
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,370
It's completely free.

61
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,640
So let me log in from here.

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,480
And as you can see I'm already logged in and I can see all my applications in those lists.

63
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:17,870
So I have some test applications over here and I can add a new one and I can delete the existing ones

64
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,870
or I can adjust the existing settings.

65
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,470
So let me add a new app and in our case our app will be called instead glorify your base.

66
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,200
OK.

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,440
Once I add this app it will ask me to do some configurations.

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,240
And we're going to start with choosing our platform.

69
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,990
So as you can see it works on a lot of platforms and of course we are interested in Apple I guess at

70
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:45,890
this point.

71
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:53,510
So I'm going to go for a polite U.S. but in any case if you're working with other platforms you're more

72
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,520
than welcome to do it later on.

73
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:03,650
So once I choose the Apple II OS it will ask me to configure this platform and it will ask me to create

74
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,430
a p twelve file.

75
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,730
So this is a production certificate for push notifications.

76
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,560
OK.

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,420
So we have to create this file first and in order to create this file we need a developer account.

78
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,270
OK.

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,710
So that's why we need a developer account.

80
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,690
So I'm going to show you how this works.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,970
So if you can come over here to read the documentation you can follow along the documentation and guides

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,950
as well in order to create yours.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,940
I'm going to open it anyway and I'm going to show you how to do it manually as well.

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:52,130
So you have to go to your developer account and open it first of all and come back here to read the

85
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,460
documentation as you can see they have an automatic provisioning to Lesotho.

86
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,450
So if you give your apple IDM password over here it can create all these things for you but I'm not

87
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,490
going to do that.

88
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm just going to do it manually in case it fails or in case if you don't want to give your credentials

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
to one signal.

90
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,330
So I'm going to show you how to do that manually because if you do it manually it will work in every

91
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,130
case.

92
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,240
OK.

93
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:31,220
So first of all we're going to need something called and Certificate Authority it's actually called

94
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,830
as he has are it certs kids signing request.

95
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,850
OK.

96
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:44,340
So in order to do that we have to access something called Keychain Access.

97
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,510
And we have to come over to this menu and say you request a certificate from a certificate authority

98
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,070
so maybe you have never worked with Keychain Access before.

99
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,420
It's kind of a tool that we store every password every search could in our Mac books in order to reach

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:02,930
that.

101
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,290
You have to hit command and space in your keyboard and write key chain access.

102
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,890
So that's the one that we are looking for.

103
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:19,410
So let me minimize this and let me just move this a little bit further.

104
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,880
So here we see all the logging related things in our mac book.

105
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,810
OK.

106
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,550
I remember we have to request a certificate from a certificate authority.

107
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:40,130
So if you come over here to certify get assistant you will see some different main your here so it's

108
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,300
not saying request a certificate from authority.

109
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,360
It says that request a search for good with your user name.

110
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,950
So if you see something like that you have to click something else rather than all items or log in.

111
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,870
OK.

112
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:01,660
So try to click on system or system routes for example as you can see it still doesn't work.

113
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:10,190
But if I click over here to system routes and let's try it one more time come over here to key chain

114
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,110
access and certify get the system.

115
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,580
Now you will see request a search goods from a certificate authority.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,360
OK.

117
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,850
That's what we want.

118
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,490
Now if I click on this it will ask me for my e-mail address and my name.

119
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:31,700
So over here you have to give your developer accounts e-mail address and your name or your organization

120
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
name and our here choose saved to disk.

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
OK.

122
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,700
So after doing that you will just continue and it will create this year are for you.

123
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,500
So search good a request.

124
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,700
That's what we need in order to create some short cuts later on.

125
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,760
So after you do that you can just close this down and go back to your developer account.

126
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,930
OK so in the documentation it explains how to do that actually.

127
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,110
And over here as you can see there are some other things to do in the developer account.

128
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,560
I need a actually explains all of them but I'm going to show you anyway first of all we need to come

129
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,220
to this sort of goods identifiers and profiles.

130
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,490
Over here we will see the identifiers so this is why we register our app.

131
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,230
It's kind of registering your bundle I.D. to your developer account.

132
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,330
And as you can see it says that do not enable push notifications in that face.

133
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,220
I'm going to show you how to enable push notifications later on.

134
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,260
Don't worry.

135
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,680
So come over here to identifiers as you can see our app is not listed over here and we need its bundle

136
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,800
I.D. in order to register it.

137
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:57,290
So come over here to general and try to copy this bundle identifier.

138
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,260
OK.

139
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,110
So let me go back and let me see if we have this over here.

140
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,460
Nope we don't have it.

141
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:15,540
So then we have to bring in manually OK all we have to do is just come over here to plus sign and hit

142
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,380
the plus side to create our new Bundle identifier.

143
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:28,390
So let me hit over here and as you can see it asks for some options and we need of an app I.D..

144
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,510
OK.

145
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:36,750
So we have other kind of IDs as well but we need to register our app so I'm choosing app I.D. And over

146
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,780
here we need to give this bundle I.D. that we have copied.

147
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:47,850
So let me copy it one more time just to be sure gave it command seat and let me bring this down and

148
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,330
paste it over here with comment V.

149
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,120
And here you have to write a description for your app.

150
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm just going to name this is clone five your base as it is.

151
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,810
OK.

152
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:06,060
And then later on we see this capabilities over here as shown in the documentation.

153
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm not going to enable this at this phase but later on I'm just going to enable those inside of X coat.

154
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,180
So once you give that you can just come over here to this menu and register your app it means that your

155
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,930
bundle I.D. is registered to your developer account.

156
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,160
So now you can see instead glorify your base in that list.

157
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,810
So far so good.

158
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,920
Now we have registered our app.

159
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,310
And if I hit on that I can't see it.

160
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,780
I can't remove it.

161
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:43,800
I can just see the bundle I.D. and other app I.D. profile numbers and everything.

162
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,790
OK.

163
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,810
So as shown in the documentation I'm going to come over here and say push notifications is enabled but

164
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,930
I'm not going to configure it because we're going to do that inside of X code as I've said before as

165
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,180
shown here.

166
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,850
You have to enable this but not configure it.

167
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
OK.

168
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,240
So next thing would be to create a new search.

169
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,650
OK.

170
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,220
That's what we're looking for actually.

171
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,350
And we're going to do that in the developer account as well.

172
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,040
So I'm going to show you where this but as you can see it's under services an apple push notification

173
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,750
service SSL.

174
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,390
So let me go back to my developer account after enabling this but not configuring it.

175
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,920
Let me confirm this.

176
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:37,110
Save this and just go out of this identify your section because let me check if it's enabled.

177
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,450
Yep.

178
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,530
It's enabled.

179
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,220
OK.

180
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,020
It saved.

181
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,470
So let me go back and create our certificate.

182
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,430
So in here we're going to go for certain tickets and our here is just going to add a new certificate.

183
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,870
OK.

184
00:13:51,870 --> 00:14:00,420
As you can see I you see my existing search goods but we're looking for a new Apple push notification

185
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,750
serve as an API and as SSL certificate.

186
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,240
OK.

187
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,770
So we're looking for that.

188
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:13,880
So come over here and hit the plus button and over here we will see something like services.

189
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,700
And under these services we have some options.

190
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,270
You will see a U.S. Apple push notification service and you will see Apple push notification service

191
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,410
SSL.

192
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,340
So we need Apple push notification service as described in the documentation.

193
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,800
OK because this is for production.

194
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,550
So let me come over here and you will see to select Apple push notification service SSL.

195
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,270
So after choosing that you can just continue and create your certificate.

196
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,150
It will ask you for an identifier.

197
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,600
And since we have registered our app we can easily choose that identifier.

198
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:02,570
So let me choose is the clone file your base OK so yep I believe that's it.

199
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,240
After choosing my app I can register I can create a certificate just for that app.

200
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:18,350
So it it asks me to provide a CSR in this step as you can see that's why we have created this CSR in

201
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,400
the first place.

202
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:27,470
So since now I have that I'm going to say choose file and I'm going to go over to my desktop where I

203
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,870
can find the CSR and just choose it.

204
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:41,920
So this will actually provide the proof that I'm really the developer that is trying to sign this up.

205
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:49,290
After that you can just download your search kit and as you can see now we have this dot c e r file.

206
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,740
So this is our search.

207
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,060
OK.

208
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:59,560
And let me go back to documentation because we have a lot more things to do after downloading this.

209
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:07,400
As you can see we have to bring this in to the key chain and then we have to create a provisioning file

210
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,210
which we will upload to the one signal.

211
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,070
So let me show you how this goes.

212
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:20,630
Let me open keychain access one more time and over here under my certificates I'm going to bring in

213
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,750
the certificate that I have created.

214
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,440
OK so let me bring this down a little bit.

215
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,350
Let me go to log in and my search.

216
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,710
So choose log in form key chains and in the category choose your certificates.

217
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:43,400
OK so that you can see all the certificates related to you and your apps.

218
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:52,670
After that we have to bring in the newly created search kit and say export apple production push services.

219
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,300
So let me try to do that.

220
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,810
We are going to need our newly brought in CRM.

221
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,750
So if you double click on that C.R. It will appear in here.

222
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,670
So if you cannot see it over there you can just double click or you can bring this in manually.

223
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,110
So let me try to do that.

224
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:20,180
So if I double click on this it will be displayed in the key chain or I can just bring this in like

225
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,980
dragging and dropping as you can see.

226
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,080
Now let's see which one I believe that's the one that we are looking for Yep instead glorify your base.

227
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:38,660
So not right now I can't come over here and right click and say export Apple push services and it will

228
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,260
create a p twelve file for me.

229
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,080
So I'm going to name this my inside column.

230
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,680
And as you can see this is P. twelve and that's the one we were looking for all the way along.

231
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,910
Right.

232
00:17:51,950 --> 00:18:00,110
So now I can just say this and I can just upload this to the one signal I'm going to save this on my

233
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,950
desktop so that we can each add three easily and it will ask me for a password and we're going to use

234
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,270
that password later on.

235
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:15,170
So make sure you remember what password you're giving right now because one signal will ask us to provide

236
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,140
that password.

237
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,820
OK once you do that you can just hit on.

238
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,510
OK.

239
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:29,970
To create this and let's say OK and then it will ask you for your key chain access expert key.

240
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,750
So this is the password for your own computer.

241
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,840
So let me write my passwords.

242
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,950
Okay so this is the password for my old MacBook.

243
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,270
If I say hello we will create these certificates for me.

244
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,410
So here you go.

245
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:55,900
Now I have created my p twelve file so now I can go over to my one signal configuration and I can just

246
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,710
upload this production certs get over here.

247
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,750
So let me choose that file okay.

248
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,230
And let me go to my desktop.

249
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,480
Yep that's the one that we are looking for.

250
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,440
So when we upload this it will ask us to provide the password that we have just given.

251
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,510
And if you don't remember your password you have to do all of those things from scratch.

252
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,800
So make sure you take note of your password.

253
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,570
Okay.

254
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:31,880
And after you provide this password you can just say Save and move along with your configuration.

255
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,090
So this has been a long lecture.

256
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,050
Let's stop here and do the rest of the things in the next lecture.
