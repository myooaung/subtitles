00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,310
Hi within this lecture we are going to finalize our app by passing information from this content view

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:16,020
to the details we use so that we can use this model's properties in order to display the image and other

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,060
information and best way to do that is to create a variable inside or of our details view so that we

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,190
can get the chosen model.

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,850
So I'm going to call this chosen favorite element and this will be a type of favorite elements.

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:44,170
OK so this will ask us to give a favorite elements instance when we try to initialize details view.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,180
So when we do that whenever we write details view it will ask us to choose a favorite element.

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,330
So now I did that and if I do a command B to build this up.

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,450
So I am getting some weird error.

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,180
So let me do a command B.

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,870
And as you can see I'm even getting that error under this preview struct.

12
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,680
So we haven't talked about this yet but this displays the preview.

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,100
OK.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,750
So this defines what will be displayed in the preview on the right hand side as you can see now we are

15
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,680
displaying the details view this struct over here.

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:33,510
And since we're initializing these details view it's asking for the the chosen favorite elements.

17
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,500
So if we give some exemplary chosen favorite elements over here it will display as an example on the

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,670
right hand side.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,480
For example let's give the Dark Knight as an example.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,630
Of course this won't affect the real app itself but it will only affect the preview.

21
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,700
We will see The Dark Knight as an example in our preview.

22
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,850
Once we do that.

23
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,500
OK.

24
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,430
So let me try to resume this and let's try to build this and we get on air.

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:13,160
And the reason for that error is because we're actually calling details view inside of our content view

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,720
as well.

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:25,260
And this time navigation link destination is asking us to provide the same parameter to here so that

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,440
we can pass the information.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,350
Right.

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,100
So it's easy to get the chosen favorite element right now because it's already given as an element here.

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,130
So if I write elements here then it will pass this information to the date details view and so that

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,780
I can come over here and get the chosen favorite element and do whatever I want to do with that element.

33
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,220
For example let me wrap this inside of a V stack because we are going to have more than one text for

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,570
right now I'm just what I'm just going to display the name of the chosen favorite elements.

35
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,750
And for example this will just display the Dark Knight name because I'm using the Dark Knight as an

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,540
example inside of my preview.

37
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,200
Right.

38
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,230
But in the real app I'm not going to see The Dark Knight all the time I'm just going to see whatever

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,460
I choose.

40
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,490
So let me resume this and let me try this from here.

41
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:33,600
OK once it's loaded you can click over here and you will see whatever you choose like this.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,540
So as you can see what I'm choosing is shown in the details view.

43
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,870
So that's good.

44
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,680
That's what I wanted.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,790
Now all we have to do is just to come over to details view and have the other views as well like an

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,500
image.

47
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,600
So when I write image it will ask me for a name.

48
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:03,190
And we already have that name stored in chosen favorite element dot image name right.

49
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,840
So I can get this and displayed on my screen and of course this is going to be too big.

50
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:19,560
So I'm going to resize it as usual and I'm going to give some aspect ratio to this image and I'm going

51
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,890
to say that fit and let's see.

52
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,330
Yep this is good.

53
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,590
But this is far too close to each other.

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,440
So maybe we have to make this a little bit bigger.

55
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,670
OK.

56
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,940
And let's see.

57
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,230
Yep.

58
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
This doesn't work.

59
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,090
Let me give this some padding.

60
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,580
Yep.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,710
This looks good.

62
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,940
Now we have to display the description as well.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,400
So let me call text chosen favorite elements.

64
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,730
Yep.

65
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,650
This one chosen favorite element dot description.

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,330
So let me give you some padding over here or some other font as well.

67
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,060
So I believe the current font is good and current padding is even good so we can use this same details

68
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,140
view in every element that we have.

69
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,370
Let me run this from the scratch.

70
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,450
And here you go.

71
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,490
We have the Metallica image.

72
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,500
We have the Megadeth image and this looks good to me.

73
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,900
So let's try the others as well.

74
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,480
So this is a little bit big but it looks good.

75
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,040
So here you go.

76
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,210
Now we are done with our app.

77
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,660
The good thing about is that I can come over here and change whatever I want since I have only one view

78
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,460
regarding this view.

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,200
It will affect everything.

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,860
So if I'm not satisfied with the image size for example I can just change it for once and I will use

81
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,910
it for every other view as well.

82
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,290
So this is cool.

83
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,380
Now you have learnt a lot about swift UI.

84
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,840
But again there is a lot more to more to learn about swift UI as well.

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:09,610
So if you're ready you can't go over here to developer dot apple dot com and into the documentation.

86
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,380
You can't go for a swift UI and try to figure out yourself if you're not ready to do that.

87
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:23,830
I suggest you go on and check out our other cars on Swift UI so that maybe you can feel a little bit

88
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:31,840
better run You tried to learn about all these things but this the Apple has a really good documentation

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,380
regarding swift UI and they have this landmark book app that's they're doing in swift UI.

90
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:46,120
It's kind of the landmark book that we are doing in this class but it's poorly written in swift UI and

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:54,430
they believe swift UI will take its place in most of the apple projects in a couple of years because

92
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,030
now there is a better way to create user interfaces and there is a better way to work with data and

93
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:09,160
all other things and people will choose it over Main storyboards and other things in the upcoming years.

94
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Now it's too early to switch all your projects to the swift UI because it will be only effective as

95
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
of us 13.

96
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,120
So it will take a couple of years at least.

97
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,690
But keep in mind that this swift UI has a great feature ahead.

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,850
So let's stop here and continue within the next section.
