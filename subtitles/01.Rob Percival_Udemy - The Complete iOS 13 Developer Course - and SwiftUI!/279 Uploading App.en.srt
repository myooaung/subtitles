Hi.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,860
We didn't his lecture where you're going to see how we can upload our app using x code so that we can

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,550
finally submit for review once we're done with all of this configurations.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,380
So let's go back to our project and let's make sure to open keychain and double click on this provisioning

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,520
and cert get tools so that they will they will be included in our key chain.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,940
And you can actually drag and drop the distribution certificate over here but make sure you double click

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,720
both of them.

8
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,130
OK.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,540
You cannot drag and drop the provisioning tools but you can drag and drop the search.

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:53,560
Forget so that they will be included in your key chain so that you would not experience any synchronization

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,310
problems regarding to those cert gates.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,450
And later on you can go back to your ex code project re going to do a different thing over here we haven't

13
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,640
done it yet.

14
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,770
So choose generic asked device from here and say product and archive.

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,000
So this will kind of compile everything in your project and it will archive your app so it will be ready

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,030
to be uploaded as a package.

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,190
So once it completes it will create something like this for you.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:34,830
If it doesn't open you can't come over here to window and find an option called organizer.

19
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:42,880
So in organizer we see other apps and if we haven't done these archiving thing it wouldn't appear in

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,690
here.

21
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:51,130
Now I can click on this distributes app and of course I want to distribute on App Store and I can just

22
00:01:51,220 --> 00:02:00,070
upload it from here and if I say next it will try to find my credentials and it will try to see if there

23
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:08,800
is something wrong with my app and I will say next and here it will ask me if I want to do this signing

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,360
thing automatically I'm going to say yes because my developer account is already defined in the X code

25
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,990
as you can see it cannot see the distribution certs forget that we have defined.

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,870
Even though I know we have created this now we cannot see it over here.

27
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,850
So let me say many certificates and over here if you hit this plus button and select April distribution

28
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:42,370
it will synchronize your latest distribution certificates with developer that Apple dot com.

29
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:50,440
Then you can click done and it will just get you a page like this where you can hit the upload and upload

30
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,900
your app to the App Store.

31
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,710
So once you do that it will start uploading process.

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,830
And don't worry it's not uploading directly to the App Store after you do that you're gonna have to

33
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,080
go back to your app store connect that Apple dot com and hit submit for review.

34
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:17,440
OK once it's it got accepted by Apple team then you can just release your app publish your app on the

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,360
app store every app is actually reviewed by the Apple team and every update is actually reviewed by

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,950
the Apple team so they are very strict on that policy.

37
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,150
So I believe in my case I'm not going to be able to finish this upload section but in real cases you

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:44,840
can just come over here once it's done and fill out every necessary tool and hit submit for review.

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:52,510
The reason that I'm not going to be able to finish this because I'm working in beta X called version

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,780
so I'm trying to make this video available before I use 13 comes out.

41
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,050
So now I'm inside of X Code eleven beta.

42
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,990
So in the real life example you won't be dealing with this kind of problem but I don't even have some

43
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:18,400
logos some icons in my app so I don't have anything in my app so I believe it won't let me upload this

44
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,420
to the app store anyway.

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,560
So after you complete your upload all you have to do is just come over here and hit submit for review

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,280
button.

47
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,050
So that's it for uploading our apps.

48
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,860
The app store if you're ready let's meet in the next section.
