00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,180
Hi within this lecture reading to see how to connect these views to our coding section.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:16,830
So right now I have my user interface over here but nothing happens when I click on the button or click

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,810
on the image or click on the label.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,780
I want something to happen when I click on the button.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,640
Right.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:31,260
I cannot reach my button or my image or my label in the coding section.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,860
I don't have anything in my view controller that swift right now and that is where I'm going to write

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,180
my code right.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,850
But in here I only have something called the did loads and we going to see whether this later on.

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,550
But I don't have my image I don't have my button in here.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,000
Are we going to see how to have doge in the way controller that's swift.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,660
We're just going to connect those views to our real controller.

13
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,810
That's swift in order to do that.

14
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:11,830
I'm going to click on this to open another editor and if you click over here you can choose where they

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,800
were you want to display in the second editor like this so you can choose where you controller does

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,170
Swift from here and you can display real controller on the right hand side and you can display the main

17
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,430
story storyboard on the left hand site.

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:36,330
Again if you couldn't open those you can come over here you can choose whatever you want from me or

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,800
whatever file you want from here.

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,850
OK and here I already have my mean that storyboard and for example if you click on this image.

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,320
If you hold your control key and your keyboard you can drag and drop this image to your class and as

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,400
you can see it shows me where I can drop this.

23
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,840
OK so I can drop this.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,450
I cannot drop this outside of my class and reading to see why the class is later on.

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,430
Don't worry about it.

26
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:16,290
But right now I'm just dropping it below my class but not in my overwrite function over here.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,540
I'm just dropping this under my class display and it asks me for a name.

28
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,590
So whether were I write over here it will be the name of my image in my coat.

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,760
So right now I'm choosing a name for my view.

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,310
I'm going to go for Image view.

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,340
OK.

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,810
And we're going to do this V S capitalized.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,600
So does a big V Image view.

34
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,670
So this is a general convention in programming.

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,990
I'm going to talk about that later on.

36
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,060
And you have to choose outlet over here if it's not already chosen and that's it.

37
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:08,790
If I say connect right now it will just take this image view and it will define this as an image view.

38
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,830
OK.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,850
And right now I can hit enter to create more space over here because I'm going to justify more objects

40
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,110
in here later on.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,500
And for example if you just have misspelled imagery and if you want to change the name of the image

42
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:35,460
you if you delete this and if you define this one more time using drag and drop it will break your code

43
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,520
and don't do that right now if you have written something else by mistake.

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,870
That's OK.

45
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,890
But I'm going to show you how to change this anyway because this is a common error that we have come

46
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,950
across with the needs starting students.

47
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,230
They misspelled things and they tried to change the name and they break their code.

48
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,430
Why do they break the code.

49
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,700
Because once you connect an image or runs you connect any view in your class in your app in your swift

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,890
file here.

51
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,590
It makes a connection and we can use this connection outlets in order to see these connections.

52
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,650
OK.

53
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:28,050
So if I delete this connection it will be okay for me to delete or change this but without doing that

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,850
I break my code.

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,620
So for any reason don't do this but I'm going to show you how to do that for any reason if you want

56
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,520
to change your name if you want to change this image of user name you have to break the connection first

57
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:52,170
and then delete this line and then just do the whole thing one more time like this I'm breaking this

58
00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:01,120
and now I see an empty circle over here which means that I can delete this and then I Kenya redefined

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,240
this again by doing the same thing dragging and dropping and sync Image view.

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:18,120
OK so this is how you create an image view and I believe you're done with the Image view.

61
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:25,930
Next thing to do is to decide whether we define this label in our code or not.

62
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,240
And I don't need this label right because I'm going to click on this changed by them and the image will

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,780
change.

64
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,880
So I'm going to definitely need the button and the Image view itself but I'm not going to use label

65
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,910
in any way in my code.

66
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,930
If I wanted to change the color or the text of the label I will definitely define this.

67
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,380
But right now I'm going to go for the button.

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:58,960
So if you drag and drop the button over here OK below the function or at both the function it will create

69
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:07,120
an action for you as you can see it gives the option of action when you define a bottom because that's

70
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,340
what buttons are created for you click on them and some something will happen.

71
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,940
So choose the action and name this button clicked.

72
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,750
OK.

73
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,760
So if you say connect this will create a function for you.

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,490
Now I'm actually done with connecting my view so let me close this down and let me go back to my view

75
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,400
controller dot Swift.

76
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
So here I have my Image view.

77
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,550
And here I have my function.

78
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,440
So we don't know what is a function right now but that's OK.

79
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,980
It's basically doing something when something happens and we're going to see whether this in the next

80
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,000
lecture.
