00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.400
Hi within this lecture re going to set up our app so that when we hit on this Add button it will display

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.450
this exact same page that we're seeing right now but when we click on the Eiffel Tower or any other

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.050
record it will pass this information to the other controller and then we're going to get that information

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.670
from the core data and display the details of the selected landmark or selected record in our travel

5
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.960
book app.

6
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:41.070
So we're going to come over to view controller a Regan how some selected name or select a title variable

7
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
in here in order to get the data from our list.

8
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.960
We controller.

9
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
So we're going to use the same technique that we have seen in the previous section.

10
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.720
OK we're going to use prepare for segue way where you're going to use did select row and we're going

11
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.200
to pass that information in here.

12
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:09.040
So I'm going to say select the title and this will be an empty string initially and selected title I.D..

13
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.970
So this will be a you you idea optional.

14
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.340
I'm going to pass those information from the list of controller to DV controller.

15
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.240
OK.

16
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.370
And in the vivid load I'm going to check to see if selected title is not equal to an empty string.

17
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.350
If it's not equal to I'm going to go to court data to get there relate to the information or else I'm

18
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.870
not going to do anything at all because I just want to show this view controller as this because our

19
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.080
user is trying to create a new view.

20
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
I believe new record I believe.

21
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.860
So I'm going to say add new data.

22
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.000
So in order to do that we know how to do this right.

23
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.210
We're going to write the app delegate again.

24
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.610
We're going to get the idea and just filter the results according to that idea using this predicates

25
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.310
but we're not going to deal with those right now.

26
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.040
But because first we have to go to list view controller and we have to pass this information and in

27
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.360
the Add button clicked we're just going to send the selected title as an empty string.

28
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.830
And in here in the deed select row we're not going to do that we're just going to get the related information

29
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.900
from the index path.

30
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.820
So let's call this electro and let's call prepare for Segway.

31
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.540
OK so we have these two functions here and let's create our chosen title and this will be an empty string

32
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.990
first.

33
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.430
And again chosen title idea.

34
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.780
This will be an optional you you idea and let's come down and if we click on this add button clicked

35
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.600
down it means that I'm going to say chosen title is an empty string and in the select row I'm just going

36
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.220
to make sure that I do a say take away right I'm going to perform a Segway because eventually I'm going

37
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.270
to the wheel controller again.

38
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.480
So let's say to we have controller and center is now but before we perform the Segway I have to make

39
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:33.090
sure that chosen title is actually title array and index parts that row I'm going to do the same thing

40
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.840
for the chosen title idea as well.

41
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.670
So this will be chosen title idea and this will be idea array index path.

42
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:51.450
That row and that's it for this select row I'm going to go for prepare for Segway and in here I'm going

43
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.820
to check to see if Segway identifier is actually the two we've controller.

44
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.500
OK.

45
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.070
If this is the case this is the Segway that I'm looking for then I'm going to create the weave controller

46
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.810
as everybody's here so I'm going to say destination we see Segway that destination as we controller.

47
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.150
So I'm going to cast this as my second view controller and then if I do command be it will get synchronized.

48
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.390
So when I say destination we see that I will see the related options.

49
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.090
So what I'm looking for is not latitude longitude but I'm looking for selected title.

50
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.450
OK.

51
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:43.980
Select a title is actually chosen title and destination we see that selected title idea is the chosen

52
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.210
title idea.

53
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.070
Yeah.

54
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.000
This one.

55
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.260
So that's how we pass this information into the secondary controller.

56
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.380
If we come over to we have controller let's right now just create the string you you idea and see if

57
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.680
this verb let's say that let's bring you you I.D..

58
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.700
I remember we have to come over here and say I like the title idea that you use this string.

59
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.070
Now I can print this out print string you you I.D..

60
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.060
And in fact let's make this not optional.

61
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.650
Okay.

62
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.860
Because we are certain that this will be here because it's not empty string.

63
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.130
And let me run this and see if everything's working out fine.

64
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.520
So if I hit on the Eiffel Tower I won't see the details but I will see these you you I.D. string as

65
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.750
you can see here.

66
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.800
So let's go back and click on the second one.

67
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.490
Here you go.

68
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.200
We have another you you I.D..

69
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.510
So I.D. actually works.

70
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:55.510
Now of course we have to get the related information from core data and display them in here as well.

71
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.200
If we click on this ad button it works as well.

72
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:07.460
It brings up the empty name empty tags empty map so that we can choose whatever we want.

73
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.910
So let's stop here and within the next picture we're going to get all of this data from core data and

74
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.490
display them in our view controller.
