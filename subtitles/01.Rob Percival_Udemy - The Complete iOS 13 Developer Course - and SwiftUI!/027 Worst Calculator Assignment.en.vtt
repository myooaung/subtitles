Hi within this lecture we are going to give you your first assignment.

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.850
So you are going to be building the Versed calculator ever.

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.240
I'm calling gets reversed because this is so simple we can only do four basic operations in this calculator.

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.050
Let me give you an example.

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.110
So I write 10 and 20.

6
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.520
I can sum them and I can subtract one from each other.

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.420
I can just try to multiply them or Divide one by another.

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.660
So as you can see these verbs of course this is not an app that you may want to upload to AppStore but

9
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.090
this will give you a good chance to practice what you have been learning so far.

10
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.660
So maybe your thinking right now there are some elements in here that we haven't covered yet.

11
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.340
Yes that's correct.

12
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.380
For example we don't know how to get this input from user right but it's fairly easy.

13
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.100
I suggest you pose read you after this lecture and try to google this and find out about how to do this

14
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.080
input thing.

15
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.240
Let me even give you a hint.

16
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.600
This is called text field.

17
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.360
OK.

18
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.590
You can't find is under library.

19
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.540
So remember how we dragged bodies from the library in the first section.

20
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.340
That's how you do that.

21
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.090
You can just try to quickly google how to use text fields in swift AOS and you can find about all these

22
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.950
operations.

23
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.990
And don't worry if you cannot do that.

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.050
Or on your own or don't worry if you don't want to do that I'm going to be explaining this and I'm going

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.680
to be explaining a lot more during these next three lectures.

26
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.500
But this will be a good chance for us to practice what we have been learning so far.

27
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.860
So that's where we're going to go and build the Versed calculator ever has been made in the history

28
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:04.490
of the world.

29
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.970
So let's stop here and continue in the next lecture.
