Hi.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.090
We didn't this lecture we going to see a way to detect the collisions between this ASCII sprite nodes

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.600
so that we can understand then a bird hits the box so that we can increase our score.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.050
OK.

5
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.600
So come over here two birds.

6
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm going to show you how to detect the collision of the birds.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.210
So if you see if you say bird that physics body and say contact test beat mask.

8
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.800
So this is kind of a mask that defines which categories of physics bodies that cause interaction notification

9
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030
intersection notification actually sewn.

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.390
So when the did use ASCII sprite nodes intersect with each other we will get notified and in order to

11
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.200
do that we have to create some categories.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.890
And it asks us to create a u i n 32 bit category as you can see.

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.400
So if you say context test it masks it asks us to do a u i int 32 bit category.

14
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760
So best way to do that.

15
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.840
Best way to create this category beat masks or contact B masks or coalition categories is to use enumeration.

16
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.440
So we have seen this technique in the intermediate swift section maybe you remembered that we we're

17
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.540
going to work with collision bit mask as well and this asks for a u i n targeted to bitmap as well.

18
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.810
So how do we do that.

19
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.890
Let me delete this and let me go back to my scene over here and before we go on to d the move to.

20
00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.290
I'm going to create an e num I'm going to create categories over here so this e num we'll have the name

21
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.920
of collider types.

22
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.490
OK so we how collider types and the type of this collider type is you.

23
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.740
I turned it too so we're going to define some cases over here like we have seen before.

24
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.420
First of all in case one we're going to have a bird and we're going to have a box.

25
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.070
So I'm going to detect the collision between bird and boxes.

26
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.830
But if I were to use it more than one actually more than two items I would have to go with 4 and 4 for

27
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.290
items.

28
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.940
I will have to go for 8.

29
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.280
So in this case you have to make sure that when some 1 and 2 when you some bird and box it shouldn't

30
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.630
give you the grounds.

31
00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:01.020
So it's something like it should be something like 4 and then use some 1 and 2 and 4 you will get 7

32
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.640
so you would have to be something like 8 over here.

33
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.000
So if I were to add a fifth element then it will have the number of 16.

34
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.130
So I don't need that in my game so I'm going to delete all of this.

35
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.350
I'm just going to leave bird and bucks.

36
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.990
But if you're if you're going to build a game later on on your own just pay attention that when you

37
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:34.360
edit case you have to make this 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 so you know how this goes.

38
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.640
And over here I'm going to go for Burke that physics buddy and I'm going to say this has the contact

39
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.670
test beat mask of Bert.

40
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.800
So this will have the collider type dot Bert.

41
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.810
Right.

42
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.940
And not just a bird but just bird Doctorow throw.

43
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.630
This will give you the 32 bit integers and again here I'm going to go for Bert.

44
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.080
That physics body and remember the second one is the category B masks.

45
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.260
So this is defining the category of the birds.

46
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.460
So this is again the bird every going to go for the turns 1 and this is collusion with mask.

47
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.070
So this defies.

48
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.600
Which is case sprite.

49
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.930
Note that our bird can intersect with.

50
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.090
I'm going to give this as bird as well.

51
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.440
Later on we are going to change this.

52
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.200
But right now I'm going to make it bird so that you will know the difference.

53
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.560
And I'm going to come over here two boxes and I'm going to do the same thing but this time I'm just

54
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:52.140
gonna go for collision bit mask and I'm going to give this the collider type of bird as well so that

55
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.710
they will collide with birds.

56
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.110
And of course I'm going to do that for each box that I have created inside of my coat.

57
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:09.030
So let me come over here and say bucks to and let me come over here and say bucks tree.

58
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.790
So let's do that four bucks for.

59
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.830
And finally let's do that four bucks five.

60
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.380
So let me run this on my simulator and test to see if everything is working as it's supposed to be.

61
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:32.530
If you did something wrong then maybe you cannot collide with the maybe it will just go over these boxes

62
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.070
or go through these boxes without touching it.

63
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:45.630
And so far it seems like it's working and we should be able to detect this collision by now.

64
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:53.500
So so far we have been hitting on these boxes anyway but we couldn't detect the collisions in order

65
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.480
to detect the collisions.

66
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.820
We have to make our scene to be a delegate of collision detector.

67
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:08.590
So you have to come over here and say s that physics world and a contact delegates so you can just say

68
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.730
contact delegate to self and this will give you an error because of course you're going to have to come

69
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.870
over your scene and you just have to say this is really a contact delegate.

70
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:33.100
So put that comb over here as say S.K. physics by the contacts delegate nope yep not not the physics

71
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.300
body not escape physics contact delegate Yep that's the one that we're looking for now when we do that

72
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.180
the air will go away and I will get to call this function.

73
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:53.740
So this function will let me detect the collisions and it's called did begin contact.

74
00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:01.180
So if you come over here air right did begin you will see this function did begin contact.

75
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.660
OK.

76
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.010
That's the one I'm looking for.

77
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:11.230
So when we first called this we have to make sure that the contact is the contact that we're looking

78
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.560
for.

79
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:19.480
So you can come over here and say if contact dot and you will have by the a and by the be by the a.m.

80
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.700
by the be referring to two by these two views contacting with each other.

81
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:30.780
So I'm going to say by the way that collision bit mask is collider type Dot.

82
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:43.930
Bert Doctorow value or do a pipe sign over here and say if contact dots body B OK by the B and this

83
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:51.140
will have the collision bit mask of collider typed up Bert Dr. O value as well.

84
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.550
Right.

85
00:07:51.550 --> 00:08:01.240
So collision bit mask is collider type dot bird Doctorow value.

86
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.790
So when curly braces and if that's the case I just want to print contact.

87
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.390
Right now we are to understand if this works or not.

88
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.430
So here we are assigned our collision with mask to be Bert.

89
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:22.120
So we have to make sure that we're really dealing with the bird over here of course in a complex game.

90
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:29.470
You can have more than one type of detection so you can just do it for some other cases as well.

91
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:39.310
So let me run this and let me try to just troll this and as you can see when it hits to the boxes we

92
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.800
get the contact.

93
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.440
Now we can detect collisions and we're going to stop here and within the next lecture regrouping to

94
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.450
see if we can increase the score with detecting this collisions.
