HI.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.980
WE DIDN'T THE SECTION WHERE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUR Snapchat clone.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.410
Really again using firebase in the section but we're not going to focus on what we have learned so far

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.300
but we're going to do different things we're going to improve our fire base knowledge for example as

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.180
you can see we have this sign in we've controller in which we have email and password.

6
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.260
But this time we have user name as well.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.790
So if I come over here and say cricket Metallica dot com and give car cameras as user name not Kirk

8
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:47.340
Hamlet but Kirk Hammett and give some random password over here and say sign up it will sign me up and

9
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.170
bring me the feet and as you can see we have the previous snaps over here.

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.140
Now if I want to view a snap I can click on it and I can even slight the images so that I can see all

11
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.340
the snaps in one weave controller.

12
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.630
And as you can see we have a time left label over here stating that this has only 23 hours left.

13
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.780
After that these will be deleted from the five year base again.

14
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
In the last as you can see we have another time label.

15
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.460
So it says that yep there is still 24 hours to we do this.

16
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.900
So this is what we are going to build.

17
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.490
But let me show you and demonstrate how it works.

18
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.350
So if I choose another image from here and I'm signed in as Kirk Kamath right now.

19
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.100
So let me choose one of the images and say upload it will upload this image to the storage and then

20
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.330
save it into the high your store.

21
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.410
And then I can come over here and click on it to see in another controller.

22
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:59.560
And now I can not slide this because I I only have one image by the fight upload and not there one.

23
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.090
It won't displayed as a separate post but they will be displayed in the same post.

24
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.590
But if I click on it I can see it's in an image slider.

25
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.520
OK.

26
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.620
So as you can see regrowing to have the logo out and remember user function and everything we had before

27
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.810
about we're going to learn a lot new different things as well.

28
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.420
So we are going to master our five year base knowledge and in the process we are not going to use the

29
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.410
old techniques.

30
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.420
We are going to work with models.

31
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.750
OK we're going to work with struct.

32
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.200
We are going to work with singleton classes for example here is our snap struct and so on.

33
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.350
So that's what we're going to build in this section.

34
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.200
So if you haven't watched these two Graham clone with five your base before I really suggest you go

35
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.320
back and watch it first because I'm not going to focus on what we have learned so far during this section.

36
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.020
So now if you're ready let's get started and build our Snapchat clone.
