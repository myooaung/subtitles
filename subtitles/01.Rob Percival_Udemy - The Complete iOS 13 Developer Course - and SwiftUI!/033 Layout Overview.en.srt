00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,860
Hi within this lecture we are going to work out with layouts.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,290
So far we have been creating some exemplary apps and we have been working with mains storyboards but

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,200
we haven't seen the details of them.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,510
We haven't seen how to use constraints and what our constraints really and how we can leverage those

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,560
so I'm going to go and create a new project that I'm going to call this project layout and I'm going

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:41,310
to of course go with swift and save my files in my desktop or a U.S. folder and we're going to keep

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:49,590
coding minimum in the section but you have to know this stuff before we go on and build some real apps

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,980
because this is one of the basic stuff that you need to learn in order to build up.

9
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,680
OK.

10
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:06,720
And here we have our view and we have our library in which we can drag and drop because we have seen

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,860
that before right.

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,630
But we haven't seen this.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:19,010
So in this picture in this layout over here we can't change the actual out there right now.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,130
The iPhone X R is chosen as default.

15
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,310
In my case so I can choose to display iPhone as C as you can see changes a lot.

16
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,200
So this is a lot bigger.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,700
And iPhone is ease a lot smaller so I can choose orientation even so I can do per portrayed landscape.

18
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
So this is where you change the layout.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:50,520
This is where you change the model of the iPhone or your station of the iPhone and in current days we

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:59,480
don't see too many apps that are supporting these layouts orientation landscape orientation sorry.

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,050
We generally use our apps in portrayed modes.

22
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,970
So maybe you wondered how can I make my app to be used only in portrayed mode.

23
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,480
It's actually a lot easier than you think.

24
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,310
You can go to the settings and you can just choose whether you will support landscape or not.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,910
So if you do it like this if you live the checkbox only in portrayed mode your app will be supporting

26
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,230
only portrayed mode.

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:37,080
So even if a user switches their phone as a Landscape mode it won't go to the landscape mode.

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:45,030
It will stay in the portrayed mode there in the left hand pane we if we drag a view over here you will

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:52,380
see that it will be placed in the left hand pane as well so you can choose your view by clicking or

30
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,920
here or we can choose your view by clicking over here as well.

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,310
So we haven't worked with this before.

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,280
So it displays a hierarchy in which you can see the views and you can choose them from that list as

33
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,610
well.

34
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,920
So let me make my label a little bit bigger or here and let me go to attributes pane in which I can

35
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,700
change the attributes we have seen this before right.

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:26,010
So for example I can call this project layout and I can make this central and I can even increase the

37
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:34,920
font size over here to make my text a little bit bigger so I can play with these options and I can change

38
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,960
them in whatever way I want.

39
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:48,900
So let me drag and drop an image view so that we will see a good example of leveraging layout options

40
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,280
in a good way in order to make good apps.

41
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,500
So let me put this image view in the middle of my screen and then I'm going to need an image of course

42
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,730
to work with to show you an example.

43
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,580
So I'm going to go for Google and of course I'm going to Google Metallica.

44
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:19,680
Again I'm going to download an image and I believe the landscape image like this will be much better

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,690
for our purposes rather than portrayed images.

46
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,130
So go for a landscape and just download one.

47
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:35,200
You can do it with your own favorite band if you're sick of Metallica at this point.

48
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm going to rename this Metallica.

49
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,750
I'm going to just take this picture and I can put it over there just make sure that this copy items

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,360
if needed to select it.

51
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,710
I can't reach Metallica that j pick from here or in the assets folder as well.

52
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:59,770
So far we have been dragging and dropping the images into assets folder but you can't do we'd like this

53
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,650
as you can see we now see the image inside of our image view.

54
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:13,110
So right now I have this image and I have stretched it a little bit.

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,830
Right next to the edge.

56
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,230
But there is some space between here.

57
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,480
So this is the look that I wanted in my app for example.

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:32,070
So let me run this and be aware that I haven't put any constraints from here.

59
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:40,110
So I have just put an image view on the label and I designed this in an iPhone X our layout and I am

60
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:51,000
running this on an iPhone makes our simulator and in fact most probably we won't experience any difficulties.

61
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:58,710
It's not going to be different than this because we're designing in the same layout same model as we're

62
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,010
running in the simulator.

63
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:09,540
And later on we're going to run this in another simulator in iPhone AC or iPhone 6 or something small.

64
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:19,640
And we will see if they look like like they've launched by the way because we're designing this in a

65
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,930
big screen.

66
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,390
According to this big screen so it should be something wrong displaying this big screen big design into

67
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,190
a small screen and an iPhone X are as you can see it looks perfect.

68
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,830
This is what I need to look at.

69
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,140
So this is what I want.

70
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,120
But let me go and change my simulator from here.

71
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,280
So if you don't have any simulators at this moment like a small one like iPhone 7 or iPhone AC you can

72
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,190
click over here and in the simulator section you can add whatever you want.

73
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,350
We have seen this before right.

74
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:10,440
So for example I have downloaded an iPhone as e so let me play let me run this in an iPhone ACA environment.

75
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,780
So right now I designed this in a very big screen but I am running this in a very small screen.

76
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,850
Actually I believe this is the biggest screen size right now and iPhone AC is the smallest screen size.

77
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:34,940
So it makes a perfect combination to see if my project will work the same in different green sizes.

78
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:42,380
So it's kind of important because when you put your app on the app store they will download your app

79
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,490
and they will try to run their own phones.

80
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,010
And by day I mean the users themselves.

81
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,480
So it's pretty important that it will look the same on different environments.

82
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,430
And as you can see it doesn't look the same or it was it isn't even close right.

83
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,710
So in the iPhone X R we have pretty much what we want.

84
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

85
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,910
This one but in the left hand side we see the iPhone as E.

86
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,660
So we don't see the rest of the image.

87
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,200
And this project layout label is pretty much skewed to the right.

88
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,260
So start in the center.

89
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,030
And this is not what we want.

90
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:35,750
If we don't do necessary actions if we don't take necessary cautions in the layout it won't work the

91
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,050
same for different kinds of models.

92
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,920
So we're going to stop here within the next like we're going to start learning about how to do these

93
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,140
kind of operations in a very efficient way.
