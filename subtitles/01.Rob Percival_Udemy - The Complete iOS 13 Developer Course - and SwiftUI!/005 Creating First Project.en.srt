1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,610
Hi we didn't this lecture where you going to create our first X code project.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,630
And we're going to start building our first AOS app.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,920
So if you have closed X code for some reason you can come over here to launchpad and click on The X

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,230
code icon or you can hit comment and space in your keyboard and search for X code and find it and click

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,690
on it to open the X code.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,740
Okay.

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:37,640
So if you have not closed the X code yet so it's better and you're seeing a screen like this.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,620
So you have key options over here.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,350
Okay.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:48,510
So first you can start with a playground so playground is actually a playground in which we can play

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,980
with the swift code in which we can learn the basics of the swift and the third one is to clone an existing

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,430
project.

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,910
So this is basically copying an existing X code project but we want this one.

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,560
K we want in the middle.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,460
So create a new X called Project.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,470
If you click on that you will see a screen like this in which you will choose a template for your X

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,140
scope projects.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,010
So as you can see we have a lot of templates and during the curves we will work some of these templates

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,030
and we will see this tabs as well.

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:37,260
So this is for TV shows and this is for Mac us if you know Swift you can just create apps for TV or

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:46,350
Mac OS or AOS but we're going to focus mainly on AOS and we mainly going to choose the single view app.

22
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,300
This is the most basic empty template because we are going to learn how to create teams from scratch

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,840
okay.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,280
We're not going to need any templates for us at least at this moment in the future.

25
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:09,510
In the following sections we are going to see some other ready templates for us but for the time being

26
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,470
I'm going to go for single view app and also keep in mind that if you choose single view app you can

27
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,010
later on add some more features on it as well.

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,130
So here you see a game.

29
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:28,440
So this basically lets you create a game with a physical vert and you're going to see what it is later

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,030
on.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,850
So this is for example an augmented reality app and we're going to work with that one as well and we're

32
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:43,590
going to see the other templates but right now do most basic thing to do is just to create a single

33
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:51,500
weave app and add everything in here manually and not worry about all these other templates.

34
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,670
At this moment so choose this and come here and click next.

35
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,840
So once you click next you will either present that this page or a very similar version.

36
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,790
So it has a slight difference in some versions and I'm going to show you what it is.

37
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,230
Don't worry.

38
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,850
So here we see the general settings of our project like a product name.

39
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,590
OK.

40
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,970
For example out for our product name.

41
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm going to go for my first app and of course later on we're going to see how we can change this name

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,020
from our exe called Project as well.

43
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,420
And in fact we can change every settings that we're making here later on but we need to make sure that

44
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,300
we're just doing the right thing from scratch.

45
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,140
So I'm going to show you how to work with this.

46
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,880
So in the team you're most probably seeing does none.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,250
And in my case I'm seeing my name which is not important at this point.

48
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,980
So if you're seeing none then it's okay to proceed with none.

49
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:02,550
Once we go into the X code I'm going to show you how you can add your Apple I.D. to your X code so that

50
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,300
they will be connected.

51
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,690
In my case now I see my name.

52
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,450
I'm just going to go with those.

53
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,540
But again it's not important right now.

54
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,250
We're here we have an organization name.

55
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:20,890
So either you write your company's name or you can write your own name if you're working for yourself.

56
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:28,250
So once you write your organization name it creates an organization identifier for you as you can see.

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,950
This is a reverse domain.

58
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,120
So it's com dot until Sam rather than until Sam dot com.

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:44,280
So this can be change of course but using this organization name and using these organization identifier

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,830
actually X code creates a bundle identifier for us.

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,020
So this is important because this is the unique I.D. of our app.

62
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,000
So as you can see takes the product name and it takes the organization identifier and creates a bundle

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,120
identifier for our app.

64
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:12,370
So this is a differentiating idea for our app so that the dummy upload these to the App Store they can

65
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:20,290
understand which app is which app by actually looking at their bundle identifiers so we can change this

66
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,850
later on as well when we open the X code.

67
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,680
But this is somewhat important.

68
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:33,520
So if you're building a real app just try to come up with a good product name and write your own organization

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,780
name you like your name.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,070
And over here we how the language section as well.

71
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,150
And as you can see we have two options either swift or objective c we are focusing on Swift in this

72
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:54,850
cause because Swift has been released by Apple five years ago and now it's actually very popular programming

73
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,330
language and it's one of the best ones in the verdict so it's very easy to understand.

74
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,520
Very easy to use and it's I believe in my opinion it's much more better Rummy compared to the objective

75
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,410
c so we're going to go for a swift softer Swift has been released most of the projects has been shifted

76
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,390
to swift anyway so that's what we're going to learn in this course.

77
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,770
And here we how does the user interface tap.

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:32,080
Okay so we're going to choose storyboard from this tab rather than Swift UI so swift UI is actually

79
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,300
a new concept introduced by Apple to into our worlds and it actually creates lets us create stunning

80
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,700
user interfaces later on in the cars.

81
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,290
We're going to have a swift UI section as well but right now we're going to focus on storyboards because

82
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:58,210
this swift UI is kind of new and it would be effective as of a U.S. 13 so that people would have to

83
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:04,010
install AI is 13 or a bo into their phones in order to make this work.

84
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,570
So we're going to have to wait a little bit more to shift every project to swift UI and we're going

85
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,040
to use storyboards as most of the time in these cars for that perspective.

86
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,280
And don't worry the codes are the same actually we use swift in storyboards.

87
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:27,670
User interface and we use swift in swift UI as well and this is only related to the user interface.

88
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:36,270
The design of the app if you may say OK and over here you will see some checkboxes like used car data.

89
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,850
So this will let us create a local database to use in our apps.

90
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,760
Right now we don't need those.

91
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,240
Right now we don't need any tests as well.

92
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,490
Later on we're going to see what we can make with core data and the other screen that you can see when

93
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,130
you open your first project is this.

94
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,160
So again here everything seems to be the same.

95
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,220
Like this language tab over here you can choose swift or objective see from here you can write your

96
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:12,250
product name in everything but as you can see swift UI is in the checkbox list as well.

97
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,050
So rather than choosing Storyboard You can just ignore swift UI or here just uncheck it if it's checked

98
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,330
then it will create a project for you using storyboards.

99
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,390
So this is the only difference that you can get with regarding two different x code versions.

100
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,250
So Apple hasn't decided which version to go with yet.

101
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,170
So you can either see this or the previous screen that I have shown you and it doesn't matter.

102
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,960
Just uncheck the swift UI.

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,830
Or just choose this story bought from the drop down menu and after you do all of these things now you're

104
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,230
ready to create your first project.

105
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,830
So don't forget to fill this information up.

106
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:07,220
And don't forget to click next here because we're going to choose where to save our project next.

107
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:15,010
So I have created a folder in my desktop named IOW complete because I'm going to save all of the projects

108
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,050
in here.

109
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,880
You can just choose wherever you want.

110
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,080
You can save your projects wherever you want on your computer and after you choose your folder you can

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:35,320
just click Create here and in this source control pain you will see some option to create get repositories

112
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,310
reading to see why they get later only in the cars.

113
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,750
This is basically a save point checkpoint for your apps.

114
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,300
OK so he can't go back in time.

115
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,770
If you mess up with something in your code and I'm going to go for that and I will say create a get

116
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,380
repository on my Mac we going to see what I give.

117
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,530
Hop and what they get is later on as I said so let's create our projects.

118
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:12,560
And once you do that it will actually create some files and folders and this will be the project pain

119
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,490
that we are king that we will be working on those files and folders.

120
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:25,430
If you open your folder over here you will see some apps you will see some project files project folders

121
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,900
in your project folder.

122
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,790
Ok.

123
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,910
And in fact if I close this down and if I close my X good project down I can go back to my folder and

124
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:46,220
I can find my project file and if I double click on this it will pop open again so I can start working

125
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,780
on my project.

126
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,080
If you how come this far we can't stop here.

127
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,490
Are we going to continue building our app on the next lecture.
