00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,250
Hi.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,280
We didn't expect you re going to create a profile.

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:11,250
I can and also I comment I can say I'm going to copy and paste this and I'm going to name this profile

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,800
icon.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,940
Okay.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,220
And if you come over here you can just delete this triangle and then I'm going to bring in some circles

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,910
some ellipses so that we can have a body and a head for our profile like him.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,480
So this will be the head of our profile person.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,220
Okay I'm going to field is in with this color one more time.

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,960
So this is like the head of our icon.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,320
And we're going to have a body.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,690
And for the body I'm just going to copy and paste this and make this a little bit bigger like that.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:58,240
Okay so that I can have this as a buddy but I'm just going to cut this in half so that we can have a

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,970
smooth by the over here like that.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:10,710
So let me bring in some rectangle and once I bring this in if I just choose this okay together and subtract

17
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,710
from each other.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,810
Here you go.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,450
Now I have my body like that.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,450
So here is my profile.

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,240
I can I can easily use this as a profile like in my tab bar forever.

22
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,190
Social media apps like Snapchat or Instagram right.

23
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,680
So it looks good and let's see how homes search play profile.

24
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,650
Let me copy and paste so that we can create a tag like icon as well.

25
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,230
So for example I'm going to go for an upper arrow over here in order to make a post like or dislike.

26
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:48,980
OK.

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,660
So let me create this simple line and let me give it some thicker boundaries like that for example five

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,080
will be the choice for us.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,880
And if I add a triangle over here like that I can just make this feel in the same color as this.

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,180
And then I can just choose to select two and make this a little bit bigger like that.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,970
And here you go.

32
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,490
Now we have our upper arrow.

33
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,590
We can easily use this.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,350
And I believe it should be a little bit shorter than that.

35
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,720
So we can easily use this to like an icon or you can just reverse it to dislike and post not an icon.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,420
OK.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,690
So you can just use this or you can just reverse it and use it as well.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,660
So I'm just going to cold is up I can.

39
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,770
And one more time I'm just going to copy and paste this because we're going to create our comment.

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,580
I can.

41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,550
So let me come over here and let me delete this.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,130
And this one as well because we're going to create on comment I can like that with a rectangle.

43
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,890
And once we do that we can field is in with this color one more time.

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,610
And let me make this a little bit smoother over here.

45
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,610
So let me choose this.

46
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,620
And I believe he can just do it from here as well.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,120
So for example let me come over here and give this for values for you for is a little with too much.

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,900
So let me go for a.

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,510
And here you go.

50
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,220
Actually this looks good.

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,370
So I just want to make this look like that.

52
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,700
OK.

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,980
So you can just use zero in one corner or we can use three over here as well but just bring in a new

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,160
triangle or some other shape.

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,580
So let me do this with triangles.

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,580
So you will see what I mean.

57
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:54,150
Once I do that I'm just going to field is in and I'm just going to rotate it to look like this.

58
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,870
OK.

59
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,610
So I believe that's good.

60
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,960
So let me try to add justice and let me feel listen.

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,270
So here you go.

62
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,880
Now it looks like a comment icon of courage we can do some tweaks like.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,460
Let me zoom in so we can see it better.

64
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,440
As you can see it's not perfectly aligned so you can just take this corner and make this perfect Clay

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,000
lined like that.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,130
So here you go.

67
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:27,160
Now we have our comments icon of course we can try to make this look better like maybe we can create

68
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,330
a triangle over here or a rectangle over here.

69
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,900
And I believe it doesn't look good so it was much better when we didn't have that body you can choose

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,750
to create your own icons in your own way.

71
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:52,500
So that's how you come up with new ideas new drawings and I actually suggest you to try much more so

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,770
that you can work on your Adobe Steve skills.

73
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,680
But this is not all we are going to stop here and we're going to do more practice in the next lecture.
