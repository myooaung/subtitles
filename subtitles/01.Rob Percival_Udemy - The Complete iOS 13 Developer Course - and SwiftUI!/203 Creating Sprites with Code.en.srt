00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,190
Hi within this lecture we are going to see how we can create views inside of our game scene that swift

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:08,910
file.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,440
So far we have been doing that inside of our game seemed out as gay yes and we know how to bring in

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,160
views using sprites and textures.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,080
Now where are you going to do that in codes.

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,610
So we haven't even looked at what's inside of our game scene that's 50 yet.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,220
So in here we have did move to function.

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,200
So this is kind of we've added loads inside of our receipt.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:46,080
So far we have this hello world label coming on and off and creating some circular views but I'm going

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,190
to delete all of this because we're going to write it from scratch.

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,770
I'm just going to leave the functions as it is.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,650
Because we may use them later on I'm going to tell you what these functions do.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Later on when we need them.

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:09,720
OK for right now I'm going to delete everything from here like under touches began touch his mood touches

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:18,400
and that and touch his canceled name of these functions are actually self explanatory right.

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,270
For example in here we have touches begin and when somebody taps on the scene when the user taps on

17
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,360
their scene dysfunctions gets cold.

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,920
So if they touch touches begin will get cold if they actually move their finger touches moved will get

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,480
cold if they end their touch touches.

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,060
And that will get cold and if some reason if it gets cancelled touches cancels will get cold ever again

21
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,820
to use most of these functions later on.

22
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,040
Don't worry we're going to see how to use them and a site from these functions.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,920
We have a touch down touch mood and touch up functions as well.

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:11,060
And this gives the exact point that a user touch down for example we're not going to need this function

25
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:18,020
in this course but we're going to learn most of the functions so that you will know how to work with

26
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,580
Sprite kids eventually.

27
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,680
Right now I just want to create and v2.

28
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,980
So I'm going to delete everything from here and I'm just going to go ahead and create a sprite called

29
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,100
Bert.

30
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:38,540
So I'm going to bring in the bird as we did in the game scene that is scarce but this time I'm going

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,740
to do that with the inside of our coding section.

32
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,310
I'm going to call this bird too because we already have a bird right.

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,610
And this will be an s case bright note.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,710
So this one as you can see this is an image or a solid color.

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,850
So I remember when we create scenes when we create sprite nodes actually been inside of scenes we may

36
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,220
give them colors or remake we give them images using textures.

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,900
So let's do that.

38
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:16,100
For example if I want to create a bird to I'm not going to use any of these functions yet I'm going

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,030
to do what I have to do.

40
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:27,680
Undo did move to function and inside of this did move to I'm going to called Bird 2 and I'm going to

41
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,940
assign bird texture for my bird to sprites note.

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,830
So let's do that first let's create the texture itself in order to work with textures you have to call

43
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:48,140
SDK texture class as you can see this is an image and this can be used to render various sprite kid

44
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,460
objects.

45
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:56,210
So that's what a texture does when you open parentheses it will ask you for a data or an image.

46
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,320
So we're going to work with image Nate because we're going to get this image from our assets library.

47
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,750
Remember our image is named Bert.

48
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:14,590
So what we're going to do we're going to assign this texture to be our texture of our sprite note.

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:23,030
So I'm going to say Bert to is an escape sprite note and if you open parentheses you will see an option

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,410
asking for a texture parameter.

51
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,480
That's the one that we're going to use you can see it's asking for a color in other options as well.

52
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:39,420
But we want the texture in this case and the texture will be the texture that we have created previously.

53
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,000
After that we have to actually assign the position of this bird too.

54
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,510
So this is the.

55
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,320
This defines the position inside of our scene.

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:01,250
So this asks us to create the C.G. point and if you do that it will ask you for an x and y coordinates.

57
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,480
So when we were talking about the anchor point that's what I was talking about right.

58
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:15,680
So if I say 0 0 right now it will place my view in the middle of the screen.

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,530
So let's do that actually and see how it works.

60
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,730
So zero zero means the middle of my screen right now because I said my anchor point to be the middle

61
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,020
of the screen.

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,860
Later on I'm going to give a size and this will be a C G size.

63
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,520
So this is actually very simple.

64
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,640
It asks us to create a width and height.

65
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,090
Right now I'm going to go four hundred to under it and we're going to change it afterwards.

66
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,910
Later on we can define the z position as well.

67
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,010
Remember we made our Berg to have a z position of 1.

68
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,380
I'm going to do that in here as well.

69
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:02,260
Finally we can just say self-doubt at child and add this bird to to be shown in my seat.

70
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,830
So here you go.

71
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,100
Now we are ready.

72
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,730
So let's run this in our simulator and see how our bird looks like.

73
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,540
Here you go.

74
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,620
That's our bird.

75
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:19,960
As you can see it's in the middle of the screen and it's has the weight of hundreds and height of hundreds.

76
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,110
And actually it's good for with and height.

77
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:33,530
But as I said before having done this in codes I have an advantage I can make does relative to screen

78
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,590
size.

79
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,800
So what can I do.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:43,490
I can just call s that frame and make it relative to the frame of the current screen size.

81
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:49,980
So if you say self-taught frame that that it will give you the current width of the screen.

82
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,080
Right.

83
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:59,120
So you can just go for something like s start frame that divided by 15 for example.

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,680
And for height you can just go for a self-taught frame that height divided by 10 am making this up.

85
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,890
So we will see how 15 and 10 looks like and we can adjust it later on.

86
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,210
So here you go.

87
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:22,490
It looks good but it's a little bit squeezed vertically so I believe we have to make our with a little

88
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,820
bit smaller.

89
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,090
So let's try 16 for example and let's see how this looks like and the up.

90
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,190
I believe this is better.

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,880
So we have a rounded circular bird right now and looks like our bird.

92
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,710
And I'm not gonna waste time to create all of the views inside of this code because we have already

93
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,230
done our design using game scene as chaos.

94
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:01,760
But in your app or in your own games you may actually do that in order to comply with different screen

95
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
sizes.

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:11,690
For example in this case if I want this bird to be here I may have to adjust the position a little bit

97
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,750
so that I can have my bird over here.

98
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:23,570
For example I can use the s that frame again to specify some position to my bird too and I will have

99
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,560
to do everything for this tree for this break and for other views as well.

100
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:36,580
So I'm not going to waste time doing that in this section but let me show you how this works.

101
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,520
For example I can come over here.

102
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:39,980
OK.

103
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,760
Not here but here rather than saying 0.

104
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:54,080
I can just say something like minus self-doubt frame dot width and divide it by something like 5 for

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,250
example.

106
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,440
Let me see how this looks like.

107
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,450
So let's see.

108
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,160
Here you go it's moved to the left a little bit but not quite what I want right.

109
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,630
So let me try this like for and let me try this why.

110
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,150
Something like minus self that frame that height over for.

111
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,120
So let's run this and see how this looks like and this time it's much better.

112
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,710
So we have to decrease the why we have to increase the X so that we will to have the same position as

113
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,830
this bird.

114
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,100
But do you understand the point.

115
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,910
You can't do everything inside of the coding section as well.

116
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,610
And this will be compliant with every other screen sizes as well.

117
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,420
So I'm going to comment this out and I'm going to continue with.

118
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:51,770
Well what we have right now but we're going to create views with code later on in the section as well.

119
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,180
So let's stop here.

120
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Continue within the next lecture.
