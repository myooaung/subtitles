Hi within this lecture where are you going to see how we can make our bird fly.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.530
And in this game we don't need actually to fly our bird.

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.540
We just want to stretch our birds so that we can show him off the air or we can push the birds to the

4
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.250
air.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.220
But I'm going to show you how to do that anyway because you may want to use it on your own games if

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.380
you want to have a flappy bird clone or something like that.

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.010
So let's go to touches begin.

8
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.690
So this is why we actually understand if the user tapped on the screen or not remember it gets executed.

9
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:53.550
Once a user taps on our screen on our receipt so when when we right over here something like this it

10
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
happens when a user taps on the scene.

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.830
So what I want to have a force over my birds physics body.

12
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.060
So if you say physics body as you can see we have worked with loads of rotation and something like that

13
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.340
but we didn't see this.

14
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.390
We haven't seen apply force.

15
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.150
We haven't seen imply apply impulse.

16
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:27.210
So if we use this kind of a method it means that we get to apply a force or an impulse or a talk to

17
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.400
our SDK sprite note and let's see apply impulse for example.

18
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.020
So impulse means some kind of force and it asks us to create a vector so we can actually specify the

19
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.050
direction of this impulse.

20
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.580
So let's create this vector and you will see what I mean.

21
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.670
So it asks us to create an x and y value.

22
00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.700
So I'm going to go for zero two to two hundred and it won't make any difference in the x direction in

23
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.370
the x axis but it will make some difference in the y axis.

24
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.440
So it will push our bird up to 200 points in divide direction.

25
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.470
Then we tap on the sea.

26
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:24.000
So if you tap on it as you can see when we click on the scene it will just go up and it's a little bit

27
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.170
high I believe.

28
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:34.530
So we made our birds mess a little bit too much because I'm having a hard time to lift my bird up over

29
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.350
here.

30
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.600
So I believe we have to decrease the mess a little bit.

31
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:49.530
So 500 grams is actually a little bit much for our birds so let's try something like four point twenty

32
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.390
five to see the results.

33
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.490
And here you go.

34
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.950
I believe this is much better.

35
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:04.170
So our bird feels lighter as you can see we can actually work with the physical attributes of the world

36
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.560
physical attributes of this is case sprite nodes as well.

37
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.980
So let me do something like 100 over here and just change it to 0 point fifteen.

38
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.250
So let's try something like this or point fifteen with a 100 impulse.

39
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.820
So if I step on here nothing will move but my bird will move because I made it so.

40
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.900
And here you go.

41
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.700
I can fly my bird.

42
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.660
So this is exactly how Flappy Bird is written.

43
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.240
So you make the birds fly.

44
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:47.640
When you tap on the screen so you can change these numbers or you can actually make this false to begin

45
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:57.750
it and you can make this too over here under touches begin so that you will actually stay the same when

46
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.940
you first open the app but when you tap on those it will start to be affected by gravity so that you

47
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.210
will start the game and will be effective when you start the game.

48
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.180
So here you go.

49
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.740
That's how we do something like Flappy Bird clone.

50
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.650
But we're not going to do that in our case.

51
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.720
For example if we make our d x 50 it will push the bird 50 points to the right.

52
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.730
When we click on it here you go.

53
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.060
Now our bird is trying to fly to the right.

54
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.850
So as you can see it actually doesn't go off the screen because we have a frame over our succeed right

55
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:52.560
trapping our scene so that our bird gets stuck and it just collides with the boxes and it just contacts

56
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.180
with the boxes and everything.

57
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.000
So this is very good.

58
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.290
And this is all thanks to sprite kids so let's stop here and then in the next lecture regrouping to

59
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.850
learn how to move the birds around so that we can give the stretch initial push that we want to have

60
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.310
inside of our Angry Birds clone.
