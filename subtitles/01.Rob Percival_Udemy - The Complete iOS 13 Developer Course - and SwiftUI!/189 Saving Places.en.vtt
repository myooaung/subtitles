00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.870
Hi we didn't this lecture regrowing to write our save on and clicked function because we want to save

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.210
all this information into our past database.

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.950
So now we have everything right.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.290
Let me import the pass here so that we can create a P.F. object and we get to have to just create our

5
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.640
object and assign the values to its keys.

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.380
So I'm going to say this will be a P.F. object and class name.

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
We're going to have to choose a new class name because I believe we don't have any current class so

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.990
so far we have been working on this fruits.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.730
Of course I don't want that.

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:50.610
I'm going to create a new class called Places OK with a C places and with those objects I'm going to

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.600
say object name right.

12
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.020
So we're gonna have a name.

13
00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.210
This will be our place name and this can be easily gathered from the place model.

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.070
So let me create a place model over here it will be place model dot shared instance.

15
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.590
OK so if we come over here as a place model dot place name we can actually reach the place name.

16
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.550
So let's go for type place model.

17
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.930
That's place type.

18
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.780
Right.

19
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.180
That's place type.

20
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:34.860
And again the utmost fear so utmost for your place model dot place atmosphere.

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.280
This one and we're going to have the image but I'm going to do that later on I'm going to go for latitude

22
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740
and longitude.

23
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.610
So we have this latitude and longitude right.

24
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.260
So how can I get this latitude.

25
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.700
Can I get it from place model dot.

26
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.110
No I cannot get that because I didn't actually give that property to my place model Singleton and I

27
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.130
can't just come over here and say that chosen latitude and for the longitude I can come over here and

28
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.550
say longitude is actually south.

29
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.800
That chosen longitude.

30
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.240
But I believe if we are doing something with a model we have to be coexistence rather than getting this

31
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.510
from chosen latitude and chosen longitude.

32
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.380
Why don't we define these attributes in the Singleton class so that we can assign its values inside

33
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.720
of our map we see.

34
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.390
So let's call this place latitudes and call this place longitude.

35
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.460
OK.

36
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.770
And by the way the other method will work as well.

37
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.390
I'm just trying to be consistent here.

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.660
If we're doing this with a model then I believe we should stick to the model and we should have all

39
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.800
the attributes inside of that model.

40
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.840
OK.

41
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.570
So that's why I'm adding this place led to do the longitude here.

42
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.740
So rather than using the South the chosen latitude I'm going to go for our place model dot shared instance

43
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.230
dot place latitude.

44
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.600
OK.

45
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.980
And for here I'm going to go for place model again.

46
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.680
Place model dot shared instance Dad's place longitude.

47
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.340
And this will be cool to strings.

48
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.820
So let me delete all of this actually.

49
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:38.970
We're not going to be using them and in here I'm going to go for place model dot place latitude and

50
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.310
in here I'm going to go for a place model dot place model Dad's place longitude.

51
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.570
So here you go.

52
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.140
Now all we have to do is just add the image.

53
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.680
So how do we add the image.

54
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.650
Of course we're going to convert that to data as we did in the fire base as we did in the core data.

55
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.780
So if we tried to upload an image we have to change it to into a data first so that we can actually

56
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.120
upload that data.

57
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.620
So I'm going to say if that image data and this will be coming from place model dot place image.

58
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:28.790
So this is a UI image and we're going to convert it into a JPEG data with a compression quality of 4.5.

59
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.820
So that I can come over here and say object image is the P.F. files.

60
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:36.380
OK.

61
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:46.170
So this is going to be APF file and this file object will ask us for a data and I'm going to choose

62
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.130
this one name and data for a name.

63
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.100
I'm going to call this image that J pack.

64
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.690
And for data I'm going to give image data.

65
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.880
And here you go.

66
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.200
Now you know how to upload data to the server as well.

67
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:10.180
So now I have my name type atmosphere latitude longitude and image and I believe that's all we need

68
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.490
to create a place.

69
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.320
So let's say objects that save and remember we use save in background with block.

70
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.270
So if you hit enter on that block it will give you a boolean indicating if this is success or not.

71
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.080
And I'm going to check to see if areas not Neil.

72
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.480
I'm going to print out an error and else I'm going to do a Segway right.

73
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:45.290
I'm going to go back to our places we see so I believe we don't have that Segway right now.

74
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:54.480
So we have to go to main story board and let's create that Segway because we cannot go to places we

75
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.960
see right now.

76
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:05.490
So let me choose here two other places we see as a show Segway and once I do that it kinds of I kind

77
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.470
of distorts the view so I'm going to go for present model T rather die show and I'm going to choose

78
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.290
full screen.

79
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.150
OK so here you go.

80
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.600
Let me close this down.

81
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.880
Oh no.

82
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:29.040
Let me just give you some identifier so I'm going to call this from maps we see two places we see because

83
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.940
we already have something called two places we see right.

84
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:42.960
So let me copy this identifier and paste it in here and send there will be nail so far so good.

85
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.430
And let's see if we have any Alec messages in here.

86
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.070
Nope we don't have.

87
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.190
So we are going to have to create it from scratch.

88
00:06:52.190 --> 00:07:00.440
I'm going to call this UI Elliott controller and title will be error message will come from the error

89
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.340
itself.

90
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.220
Error dot localized description.

91
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.120
OK.

92
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.890
And the style will be error.

93
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.110
And this is not error this is Eliot.

94
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.960
And I'm going to create an okay button.

95
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.230
This will be an UI Eliot action.

96
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:21.310
And title will be OK style will be default and handler will be nailed.

97
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.840
I'm going to add this to my Eliot.

98
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.310
OK.

99
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:34.120
As an action and then I'm gonna present this present Allard animated true completion nil.

100
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.900
So this is good.

101
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:43.280
Let's try this in our simulator and let's see if we can create our first ever plays.

102
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.470
So here we go movement of troops.

103
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.310
Let's see if we can actually upload something to the PA server.

104
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:58.610
So let me actually come over here and close this down to find some real restaurant or cafe images so

105
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.840
that we won't try this with Mona Lisa right.

106
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:09.830
Let's go for a restaurant and I'm going to just bring in the first couple of images to use it on our

107
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.550
app so I'm going to save this to my photos.

108
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:20.080
So let's find another restaurant and everything looks like the same but I'm going to go for this one

109
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.740
OK and maybe we can search for some cafes or bars.

110
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.860
Let's go for bar OK.

111
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.810
And yep let's choose this one.

112
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.450
Let's bring this in at two photos and let's find another one.

113
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:38.760
Yep.

114
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.250
This one is good.

115
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.610
But I cannot seem to get it.

116
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.570
Yep I'm long pressing but it doesn't work.

117
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.210
So let's go for another image.

118
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:50.870
Yeah.

119
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.860
This one maybe.

120
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.770
Yes this is can be edited.

121
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.710
Yep.

122
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.370
Here you go.

123
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.250
Now let's go to our Foursquare clone.

124
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.220
I'm going to give some real details right now.

125
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:08.660
And by real I mean not gibberish James a restaurant type will be restaurant and the atmosphere will

126
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.550
be nice.

127
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:17.600
Let's choose one of the images that we have downloaded and let's click on Next and let's choose a location

128
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.400
from the maps.

129
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:25.350
So let's go for lights a plane for this time let's go for Apple store over here.

130
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.510
Yep.

131
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.590
And long press for three seconds.

132
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.850
Here you go.

133
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.860
We see the James restaurant.

134
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.770
Now if I say save not now it will save all this information.

135
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.430
But we cannot see that and we cannot see the ad button as well.

136
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.670
So there is some some sort of ad bug over here.

137
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.310
We are going to have to figure out that later on.

138
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.760
We lost the UI navigation bar.

139
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.840
We got to take care of that later on down for just for right now.

140
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.320
I just want to make sure that if we manage to create our places class.

141
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.610
So let me refresh this page in my past dashboard.

142
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.800
And here you go.

143
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.150
We have the pass places class.

144
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.510
Now we see the name.

145
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.810
We see the latitude.

146
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.420
We see the longitude.

147
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.360
We see the type and we see the image as well.

148
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.510
So let me try to download this.

149
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.390
Here you go.

150
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.300
The image is uploaded so everything seems to be working fine.

151
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:36.080
Now we're going to have to find a way to get this data and displayed in our table view to the users

152
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:42.750
so that the user can tap one of them and see the details in another wheel controller.

153
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.080
Let's do that in the next lecture.
