00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.550
Hi.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.940
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.000
We're going to add our new map we've controllers so that after user heat snacks they get to choose the

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.050
continent from a map.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.210
So let me bring in vomit.

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.290
We've controller from here later on.

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.840
I'm going to add a map kit in this V controller and what I want to have is a safe way from ad place

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.020
where you controller to this week controller and this is going to be a show Segway and it will display

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.830
some kind of bar button over here.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:47.350
And I'm going to name this to map we see so in my previous Sig where I don't have identifier again so

11
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm going to name these two at place we see as well.

12
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.710
So now I'm down we'd say guys let's bring in map kids so let's say map good for you.

13
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.970
And within this view controller I am only gonna need one map view so I'm going to come over here and

14
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:13.940
say 0 0 0 0 2 all 4 constraints and it will stretch all the way to the edges so that I have a field

15
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.300
up map view in my new wave controller.

16
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.210
So that's what we want in here.

17
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:28.010
I can have a save by them or upload by them in the bar button or I can place it anywhere inside of the

18
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.650
view controller as well in my case.

19
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.590
I'm going to go ahead with the bar button item and I'm going to add it on my bar button.

20
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.870
So let me create the cocoa touch class and let's call these maps we see or map easy.

21
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.650
OK.

22
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.970
And place it under our project folder.

23
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.660
Later on I'm going to go ahead and delete everything in here and go to main story board and find our

24
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.610
latest we have controller and go to the identity inspector to choose map receipt.

25
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:13.010
So if I come over to my map we see now I can bring in this map kids map view to my map we see and I'm

26
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.730
going to call this map view.

27
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.250
OK so this is going to be my map view.

28
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.640
So let me close these down and as you can see we get some errors and it's because I don't have map kits

29
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.340
imported in my projects.

30
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.910
So let me import the map kids.

31
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.320
And here we go now.

32
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.890
The errors volunteer way.

33
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.770
So we are ready to do what we want to do inside of this map the.

34
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.210
However in this condition we cannot even test to see if our map works or not because we don't have the

35
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.710
Segway as yet.

36
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:55.850
So in the ad places we see I don't have segway to go to the next we have controller and in here as well

37
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.050
I don't have any Segway right now.

38
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.590
So under add button clicked I'm going to perform a Segway.

39
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.020
OK.

40
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.230
And the identifier will be to ads place of easy.

41
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.850
OK.

42
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.870
And the sun there will be Neal.

43
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.990
And in the ad place we we have controller I'm going to perform I say where one more time man user clicks

44
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.990
on next.

45
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.960
And it will take us to the map we see and on their map we see I'm going to add the save button that

46
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.790
I was talking about.

47
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.190
So let me delete this.

48
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.800
And under we've did loads.

49
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.480
I'm going to go for navigation controller.

50
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.800
That's navigation bar not top item and a right bar button item.

51
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.710
And this will be a you eye bar bottom.

52
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.050
Yep.

53
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:55.310
This one UI bar button and I'm going to go for this title one more time because I just want to save

54
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.030
this.

55
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.900
So style will be played.

56
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.760
Target will be self's action.

57
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.090
Let me create a selector and then we're going to add a new objective c function here.

58
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.620
So this is going to be at objective c function.

59
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.580
So save button clicked.

60
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.700
So that's it.

61
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.610
I'm going to assign this say button clicked to be my selector function and in the save button clicks

62
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.920
I'm going to do whatever I want to do to upload all of this information to my power server and we're

63
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.910
not going to do that.

64
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.090
Now we're going to do that later on.

65
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.360
So let me test.

66
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.610
Let me see if we can see all the weave controllers without any error.

67
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:50.090
So if I click on here it will take us to the ad plays view controller and that's fine.

68
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:59.660
If I click on Next it will take me to my maps and one error that I have seen in here that I don't have

69
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.900
my say button.

70
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.280
So if I go back I will see the save button in my apps place we have a controller even though I have

71
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.120
written this code inside my map B controller it displays that saved by them in the app place we have

72
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.180
controller.

73
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.890
This is some sort of mix up right.

74
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.620
I don't want that.

75
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:32.440
So why does it happen since map we see doesn't have its own navigation controller.

76
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.110
It kind of doesn't understand why should it put the save bottom.

77
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.570
So if we come over here to Maine sorry bought as you can see we don't have any navigation controller

78
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.360
just in front of this map.

79
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.810
We have controller.

80
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.940
We only have it in front of our places we have controller.

81
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.550
So what I'm going to do I'm going to add a Neill navigation controller in front of my map.

82
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.640
We have controller so that I don't have that kind of problem right.

83
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.310
So this will have its own navigation controller and then I write that code.

84
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.710
It will understand that to put it.

85
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.160
So it's a rises Neil questions it raises new problems as well.

86
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:27.570
Because right now I don't have any back button coming up because I'm doing this show segway to navigation

87
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.730
controller and it will create a new navigation bar in here.

88
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.770
Where are you going to take care of that problem later on.

89
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.510
So let's test this and see if we can actually manage to show the save button to the user.

90
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.470
Let me go over here and click on this add button and let me click on that next button.

91
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.070
Here you go.

92
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.130
Now we see the save but we see it as a pop.

93
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.850
Our Segway.

94
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.290
OK.

95
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.020
So I don't want that I just want this as a full screen mode.

96
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.540
So I'm going to do this present model.

97
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.290
OK.

98
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.180
And if I do this full screen then I believe this will take care of our problems.

99
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:20.160
So let's open this one more time and see if we can get a full good looking UI.

100
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.570
We have controller here we go.

101
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:29.460
Now we see the same button but actually we lost the back button because we have a navigation controller

102
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.590
along the way.

103
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.790
So it's fairly to overcome that problem right.

104
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.750
We can add a new navigation controller bar button item over here.

105
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.850
So let me just come over here and say navigation controller dot navigation bar the top item that left

106
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.490
bar button item.

107
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.480
This is going to be a UI bar button item.

108
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.620
It will ask us for a title and a smile.

109
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.590
Let me just open this one more time item.

110
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:09.540
In fact we can actually test to see if there is a system bottom for going back and let's see action

111
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.070
add bookmarks cancel.

112
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:19.320
Maybe we can do something like cancel as low but I believe there is no back by then option over here

113
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.790
and you can try.

114
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.560
Cancel or you can try others.

115
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:29.460
But I'm going to go for title again because we don't have backed by them.

116
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.100
So let me go to title and I'm going to do something like this like.

117
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.230
Back with this small sign over here.

118
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.130
OK.

119
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.800
In style I'm going to go for plain one more time.

120
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:50.910
You can choose the other ones and see how it looks like and maybe having a back button is not a very

121
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:58.140
good idea in this case because maybe we want to go back to places we have control or once the user cancels

122
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:05.610
this but in anyway I will show you how to have a back button in this case because it will actually improve

123
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.840
your skills as well.

124
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.730
So let me say.

125
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:18.750
Back button clicked and let me give the selector to here as sector function and under back button clicked

126
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:25.800
can I do navigation controller dot pop up we controller with animation.

127
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.330
Now I cannot do that.

128
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:37.110
This won't work because previously we had only one navigation controller and popping one item back works.

129
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:43.800
Now I have a new navigation controller along the way in the middle of our wheel controllers.

130
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.980
So there is no we controller to pop back.

131
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:49.530
So this won't work.

132
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.920
So I'm going to comment this out to rather I'm going to use something called soft dismiss and this will

133
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.070
dismiss the current we controller and go back where reverb previously.

134
00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.700
So let me run this and show you how this works.

135
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.790
Let's go to our simulator and hit on plus bottom.

136
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:19.080
It will take us here and if you say next this will display the save button on the right hand side and

137
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.100
back button on the left hand side.

138
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.050
If I hit back now I'm back in at places.

139
00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.770
If I hit back now I'm back in places where you controller.

140
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.870
So that actually works.

141
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.200
Now there is only one view controller left to add here.

142
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.640
And where are you going to do that in the next lecture.
