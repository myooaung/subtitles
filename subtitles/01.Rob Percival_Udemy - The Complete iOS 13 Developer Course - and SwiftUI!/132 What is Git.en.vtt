00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.030
Hi.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.790
We didn't this lecture we going to see what a gift is.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.160
And we have talked about it before right.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.420
So this is a way to do a version control.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.680
But we haven't really leverage it.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.150
We haven't really utilized it in our projects.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.510
So in order to do that we're going to create a project and every going to do some version control on

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.140
that project to see how we can leverage it really.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.160
And in order to do that let me just go over here and create a new project.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.440
It's going to be a single view app and in fact we're not going to write so much code in this project.

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.590
We're just going to do some exemplary codes and we're going to focus on Virgin control sides of things.

12
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.390
So I'm going to call does get test project and I'm going to hit next and I'm going to put this under

13
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.240
my IRS complete folder.

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.930
So let me make this into a full screen and tell you a little bit about version control.

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.330
So version control I really mean to control the versions.

16
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.800
So it means that create some check points or for your app.

17
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.520
So this is like a save point when you play a game.

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.310
So if you die or if you fail at game you can go to your save point rather than going back to the beginning

19
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.970
of the app.

20
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.320
OK.

21
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.050
So if you break something if you make your project in a real bad shape you can go back to your original

22
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:41.820
check point to south from your check point rather than starting from scratch maybe you can think that

23
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.600
I can just delete the code that I have written or I can do something like comment Z to take it back

24
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.000
but you will come across some situations that you cannot do that.

25
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.560
For example if I write print get that I can easily hit command Z to take it back and then I can write

26
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.760
whatever I want.

27
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.660
But eventually you will find yourself in a place that you want to go back to the previous stage rather

28
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.710
than doing a comment.

29
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.000
Easy because for example re going to work with external libraries.

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.340
OK.

31
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.460
We're going to add some others people's code in our own projects and it may have some bad effect on

32
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.690
our projects so maybe we want to take it back but we cannot do comment Z in a situation like that we

33
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:39.420
have to have a version control system that lets us to setting all the things that we have done so far

34
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:48.240
to make our project work again and in order to do that actually ex code provides us some version control

35
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.290
tools as well.

36
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.950
But we're not going to use them we're just going to use another tool called source tree because it's

37
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.230
much more convenient than the X codes source version control and if you come over here to source control

38
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.430
you will see some menus like committing pushing pulling and we're going to see what our dose so commits

39
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.730
means you commit the change that you want.

40
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.900
You're accepting the change that you have made so far.

41
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.430
Okay.

42
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.400
Pushing means pushing the code to an external environment like get hub and we're going to see what I

43
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.630
get.

44
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.620
Hub is and pooling means pooling this source code from the get hub.

45
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.010
OK.

46
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.470
And we're going to use another tool called source tree in order to do all of this stuff as I said before

47
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.000
because it's much more convenient and it doesn't work only on AOS.

48
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.890
You can work on great projects on source tree as well.

49
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.180
So if you go to source tree app that's com so you will see that this is a website providing the source

50
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.940
tree app.

51
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.970
And this is completely free.

52
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.760
So you can use it on your own.

53
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.740
You can just do the version control on the source tree app safely and you can connect this to your GitHub

54
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.790
account as well.

55
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.950
So all you have to do is just come over here to source three app dot com and you can click on the download

56
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.010
free icon and it will let you download this off to you agree to day or terms.

57
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.730
OK.

58
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.490
So you can see a download and will download it for you.

59
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.240
It's fairly a small file something like 80 megabytes so it won't take much to complete this and after

60
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.950
you download you don't have to do even as set up.

61
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.030
You can just run it on your own you can just put it on your applications folder and call it from there.

62
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.250
So let me close this and let me put it and as you can see I have downloaded it before.

63
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:04.010
And the other download has completed as well but I have downloaded the same thing so I'm going to move

64
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.000
this to trash.

65
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.330
I'm going to take this and put it on my applications folder so that I can reach it.

66
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.860
I have already an older version of source tree so I'm going to replace this.

67
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.700
OK.

68
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.170
And after that come over here to your applications and find source 3 to double click on it.

69
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:32.390
If you cannot find it for any reason you can always come to your keyboard and his comment space to open

70
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.550
the search bar and you can write source tree to find the related application.

71
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.710
So since I have found this in my applications I'm going to double click on this.

72
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.770
It will ask me if I really want to open and I'm going to say yes then I can close this.

73
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.210
And as you can see there is a list of the files that I have heard before.

74
00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.170
So most probably you're seeing a blank screen right now and it really doesn't matter I'm going to show

75
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.040
you how to import projects on here later on.

76
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.810
But for right now let me show you.

77
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.980
You can connect this source tree to your GitHub account.

78
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.360
Let's go to preferences here.

79
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.720
OK and there is an account's tap here as you can see it.

80
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.670
It's actually connected to my get hub account but I believe this is a very old connection.

81
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:31.480
So this picture of mine is from like eight years ago I don't know.

82
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.230
So if I double click on those e I can see these authentication type.

83
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:43.710
I can see the protocol over here being a CPS let me remove this so I can show you how to connect it

84
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.660
to on your own.

85
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.730
So if I click ad and choose get hub from here I can choose the all up.

86
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.910
And if I say click connect and it will connect the YouTube account for me.

87
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.300
But in order to do that you have to have a get hub account and I'm going to show you how you can get

88
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.540
one.

89
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.800
Don't worry.

90
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.480
And after you get it you can just click connect the account and choose a P.S..

91
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.080
And it will connect it for you and you can just say save.

92
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.400
So this is now connected.

93
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.410
And in order to use this sorcery you don't have to have get how a count is.

94
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.330
But I believe it's a good way to store your all gifts and project information.

95
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.440
So go to get hub dot com.

96
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.620
It will bring a page like this.

97
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.760
You can sign up here in a free way by choosing a user name email and password.

98
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.640
This completely free you can just sign up from here.

99
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:52.200
And after that you can do this connection thing that I have shown you.

100
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.550
It may ask you for a password.

101
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.150
Okay.

102
00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:01.010
Just create your account and just give your password to your safari.

103
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:08.140
And if sorcery asks for a password as well just provide your GitHub password so that it can connect

104
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.510
to your account.

105
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.340
So that's it.

106
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.900
That's how you connect your source tree to your GitHub account.

107
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:21.260
And again you don't have to have a github account in order to have local version control.

108
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.970
So let me show you what I mean.

109
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:31.580
If you save your project and if you find your project folder you can drag and drop the project directly

110
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.260
into source tree to import this project into source tree.

111
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:35.880
Okay.

112
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.120
Just choose wherever you want.

113
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.620
And let me close this and as you can see there is a number appearing here.

114
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.310
It means that there is one change in one of the files in the folder.

115
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.220
If you open it it will show you the change actually.

116
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.080
So green means we added something and red means we deleted something.

117
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.440
OK.

118
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.090
Since I have added this line it shows in green.

119
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.520
So let me go to my project and delete this comment line from here.

120
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:15.410
And I'm going to save this by comment s and then go over here and if I double click one more time.

121
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:20.390
As you can see we now see the deleted line and added line together.

122
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.880
So we're seeing every change that we made in the project.

123
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.620
So this is kind of cool right.

124
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.270
We can track what we're doing here in FISA commit.

125
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.630
Remember committing is accepting the changes that we have made so far and we have to write that comment

126
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.070
in the comment like the changes that we have made.

127
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:49.750
So this has to be some explicit explanation that we can understand later on.

128
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.480
So for right now I'm just going to go for first comment.

129
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.200
But this is not a very good way to commit.

130
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.320
So maybe something like I have added print.

131
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.480
Get line here would be a good comment message.

132
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:02.400
OK.

133
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.690
If I say OK it will commit the changes.

134
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.590
It means that now this is committed is accepted by me.

135
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.580
So if I go to this monster branch then I can see the first version the initial commit and the first

136
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.340
commit that I have made.

137
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.700
So there are two check points right now.

138
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.370
So let me add another one let me add another line here saying print get two and save this if I come

139
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.290
back to source tree.

140
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:37.670
And as you can see I have that commits appearing up in here if I go to File Status or here I can see

141
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.350
the print you two is added as well.

142
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.460
So let's do another comment and say second comment for example as a comment.

143
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.600
And now if I go to muster then I will see the first comment.

144
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.240
The initial comment and the second comment.

145
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.350
So the initial comment will be the original files.

146
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:03.740
As you can see we can see these old files here including the info that Peel is the app delegate and

147
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.090
view controller itself.

148
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:12.320
We can see all the files and folders and in the first and second commit we see the changed files like

149
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.670
we've controller.

150
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.250
So what is I want to delete this too.

151
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.960
Rather than I just want to go back to get one.

152
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:24.700
I can't come over here and double click on this and just say OK.

153
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:31.100
OK and this will make this a hat and it means that we're working on this comet right now.

154
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:35.160
And as you can see get too is deleted from here.

155
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:44.300
So whether I added a new line or I added a new repository or just and whole the external library on

156
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:51.020
my project it really doesn't matter I can't go back to previous commit and double click on that one

157
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:58.370
to go forward to the next comment as about so I can come back and forward the thing comments using this

158
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:07.760
double click and I can just I use this I can just utilize this gets versioning methods in order to save

159
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:13.270
some projects that I have messed up in real life examples.

160
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:19.040
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we going to see how to utilize GitHub as.
