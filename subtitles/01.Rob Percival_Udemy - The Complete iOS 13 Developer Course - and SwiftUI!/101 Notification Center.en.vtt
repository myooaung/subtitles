00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.530
Hi within this lecture we are going to see how we can send messages to the app.

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.860
From what we've controller to another or from one we use controller to the whole app so that we can

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480
trigger some functions trigger some actions at drive.

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.630
Now we have some problems even though we can add a new picture nail art to our paintings.

5
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.740
We cannot go back to do we have controller.

6
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.440
And in order to do that there is a simple line of code.

7
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.300
I can come over to details VCA and I can just say stuff dog navigation controller that POP V controller

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.670
animated.

9
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.370
Why not.

10
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.020
Let's say it's true.

11
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.100
OK.

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.570
And it will just take us back to the original.

13
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.570
We have controller OK and we can actually try this right now.

14
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.500
It won't fix our newly added art not showing on the table we have problems.

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.010
And that's why we're going to learn notification center because bringing us back won't help this.

16
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.000
So let me go to image and add one so you will understand much better what I'm talking about.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.240
So let me choose just flowers.

18
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.960
I'm gonna call this flowers.

19
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.430
OK.

20
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.080
The artist I'm going to go for Edward Munch.

21
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.150
So I believe not munch munch.

22
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.330
OK.

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.300
So I believe I'm very bad at Arts.

24
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.920
So let's save this.

25
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.430
And as you can see we got the view controller here but we cannot see the newly created painting.

26
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.850
So what we going to do.

27
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.010
We're going to have to send a message from the details we see to this view controller saying that this

28
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.990
new data has been added to the core data.

29
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.210
Please go on take it.

30
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.210
And in order to do that we're going to use something called notification center.

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.390
So modification center actually lets us broadcast messages in our app so that we can observe them anyway.

32
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.170
So if you're right.

33
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.110
Notification Center as you can see this is a mechanism that enables us to broadcast information for

34
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.030
registered users and we don't have any registered users right now.

35
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.840
Registered observers.

36
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.790
We're going to add an observer to our view controller later on.

37
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.460
First we need to send this message and then we need to find a way to get this message in the view controller.

38
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.480
And you know here to send this I'm going to go for default dot post.

39
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.770
OK.

40
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.470
So if you say pass it will display some options for you.

41
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.820
We're going to go for this one name and the objects.

42
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.910
So we're not even going to use an object.

43
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.670
We're not going to send any objects.

44
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.510
We just need a name.

45
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.710
So I'm going to say Neal to the object and for the name if you hit enter over this and it's notification

46
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.190
that name I will give you an option to write any name you want.

47
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.560
So I'm going to say something like new data in here.

48
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.370
I'm going to observe a message saying new data in the view controller and if I see that message I'm

49
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.890
going to call and action.

50
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.510
So it's that simple.

51
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.500
We're sending a message here.

52
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.830
And if I see this message anywhere in the app then I can trigger some function triggers some action.

53
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.220
And we already have our action as get data in the we've controller right.

54
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.870
So if you say no and this notification that name you will see something called the real value and you

55
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.500
don't have to do dot dot name and open parentheses and you will just see the row value in here.

56
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.470
So and this notification that name opened parentheses and you can write anything you want in here like

57
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.360
new data.

58
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.480
Now this will just sends a message to the whole app saying new data.

59
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.370
OK.

60
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.580
And if you don't observe this message anywhere it won't cause anything OK.

61
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.880
Nothing will happen but if you come over here and observe this message then you can do something with

62
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.380
it.

63
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.020
But there is a problem right now we cannot do that in the we did load because why we did load only gets

64
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.250
called once.

65
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.170
So I'm going to go for another function which is we will up here.

66
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.860
Remember we will appear gets cold whenever we see this view controller.

67
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.710
So I'm not going to do this under we did load but I'm going to do this under we will appear.

68
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.100
So that's the be of learning yet about view controller lifecycle.

69
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.890
So you're going to say that ad observer.

70
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.940
OK.

71
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.130
And this will add an observer for us and you're king for the options observers selector and the name

72
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.990
because the observer will be the view controller itself.

73
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.490
Because we're going to have a selector again in here.

74
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.270
And for the name we're going to use the same name.

75
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.680
So let me write the selector first and we can just use the get data right.

76
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.820
We already have this function to be called.

77
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.340
Now let me add objective seen here so that it won't display a problem.

78
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.130
And in here you have to say in this notification that name Open parentheses and for zero value I'm just

79
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.730
going to go for Neve data.

80
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.630
An object is again nil.

81
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.210
So this will get the message capture the message that is sent by the details we see.

82
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.310
And whenever it gets this message it the coldest selector get data.

83
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:59.840
And this function will get executed so that we will get this data again.

84
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.610
So so far we have key values over here and just go for a fourth one and add this waterfalls one more

85
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.900
time.

86
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:17.580
We can just call does something like nature and the doubling key again and fifteen hundred.

87
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.920
As you can see it got added to my list but it has some duplicates.

88
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:31.370
And this is because of previous values in the air race we have to clear those values if you want to

89
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.730
add these values one more time.

90
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:41.960
So in the get data function I'm just going to go for name or a data removal so you don't have to keep

91
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:50.120
this campus C or K idea or a dot to remove all keeping capacity falls and this will solve my problem.

92
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.120
So here we go.

93
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.720
Let's test this again and see.

94
00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.430
Make sure that everything works fine because we're almost completing this app.

95
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.160
We have to make sure that everything is working smoothly.

96
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.330
So let's go for another here.

97
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.010
I believe this is the same picture which I'm going to just go for a test test on fifteen hundred and

98
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.660
just save this.

99
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.430
And here we go we have the test here.

100
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.990
Of course we cannot click them click on them right now because we haven't implemented that feature yet

101
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.880
but it works right.

102
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.270
We can add new values.

103
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.080
So right now we have to make a way to go to the second we have controller again to display the details

104
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.600
of the selected paintings.

105
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.140
So that's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
