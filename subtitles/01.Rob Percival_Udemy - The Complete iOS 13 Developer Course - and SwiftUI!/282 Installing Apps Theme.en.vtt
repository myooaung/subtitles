00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.790
Hi.

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.020
We didn't this lecture reading to see how we can use vert press dashboard in order to create a very

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.990
good Web site to market our apps.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.130
So here you see the posts.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.610
So this is actually the blog posts.

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.260
Ok so as I mentioned before WordPress started as a blog team but right now you can't do much more than

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.010
blog.

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.280
You can create Web sites you can create even e-commerce sites but if you click over to add any posts

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.280
you can just insert a media insert an image insert anything you want like a link or some other like

10
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.160
a YouTube video as vote and you can just add a new post to your blog.

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.380
But we're not interested in blogging right now.

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.750
Rather we are going to use these pages.

13
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.240
So.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.860
So here you actually create a page to display in your web site.

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.520
We're going to see how it works.

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.640
So let me show you the other menus you can see the appearance over here which we're going to use in

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.010
and in a little bit soon so that we're going to bring in the Apps team so that we can use in our Web

18
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.480
site.

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.440
OK.

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.340
So we have these widgets we have these menus we have this editor to edit the scripts that we impart

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.030
in our page like the team of the apps.

22
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.700
OK.

23
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.820
And here we see the plug ins.

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.720
And if you go to this ad the new you can see there are a lot of plug ins that you can use like you can

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.410
use a contact plug in in order to let your visitors contact you using your form.

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.130
OK.

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.140
I'm not going into this plug ins or other menus deeply because we're not actually recording yet WordPress

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.860
cars are and vegetable month cars.

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.180
But I'm going to show you how you can work with teams.

30
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.660
So come over here take periods and under teams you will see a lot of teams.

31
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.140
And if you click over to add new you will see a lot of free teams as well.

32
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.310
So WordPress has a lot of free teams you can actually search for one you can just select one and you

33
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.230
can come over here on say install in order to use this existing pages but rather than that we are going

34
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.120
to see how we can manually import that theme and we're going to use these abs apps that team shaker.

35
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.310
So if you go to Google and just search for apps team shake her team.

36
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.130
Okay Apps team Shaker download it will take you to the download page of these apps team so you can freely

37
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.850
freely download this team by clicking the download button over here and it will try to download a zip

38
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.800
file in your computer and you're just going to come over here to upload team and just add this zip file.

39
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.410
Okay.

40
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.630
Altogether it will just unzip it and process it on its own.

41
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:09.750
You have to just click install now button or here again you're just uploading the zip not anything else.

42
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:17.280
If it's not zipped you can just zip it yourself and then you can say activate over here it will activate

43
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.160
the team.

44
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.980
Now you can actually customize the team and change everything.

45
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:29.250
Now if you is at your Web site you will see your Web site is actually a lot better compared to what

46
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.140
we had previously.

47
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.990
As you can see now we have this image we have these headings and buttons and everything.

48
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.720
Of course we are missing some items and we are going to take care of that in a little bit.

49
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.090
Now the most important thing that we don't have the slide there over here.

50
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.900
So if you come back to your dashboard you will see a slider popping up in the left.

51
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.920
So this is installed with the team itself.

52
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.160
If you come over here to slide there and if you click on ads new it will actually let you create the

53
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.690
new slider for your team.

54
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.920
So slider is this section I'm talking about this section.

55
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.070
So if you go to ABS that say Team Shaker dot com you can see the slider yourself.

56
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.760
You can just copy and paste as values just to try.

57
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.330
If this works or not.

58
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.450
So that's what I'm going to do I'm just going to copy and paste everything over here so that I can create

59
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.560
the exact same slider and I'm going to add a featured image over here.

60
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.610
So I want the exact same image.

61
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.390
So I'm going to download this OK to my computer and just and then I'm just going to upload it to my

62
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.320
work press.

63
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.160
So once you do that you can come over here and select files and upload the things that you have just

64
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.520
downloaded and of course you don't have to do that.

65
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.040
You can just watch and see how it's done.

66
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.430
So that you can actually apply this venue have your own app uploaded to the App Store.

67
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.700
OK so now wi fi come over here and refresh this faith page.

68
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.050
OK now I will see my slider popping up.

69
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:18.340
So if you get something like this If your image is not showing up then there is a small tweak that you'd

70
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.720
need to do in order to make this work and your urge to do that.

71
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.850
We are going to just change a little bit of script in Apps team.

72
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:36.400
So go over here to Ed on experience and make sure you select the Apps team to edit ok not the other

73
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.150
ones and then you just going to have to come over here and find the team functions.

74
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.670
So scroll down a little bit until you find this line.

75
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:56.340
So let me come over here it's actually at the bottom of this page and we're looking for this post top

76
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.890
male.

77
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.410
OK so this team item.

78
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.520
So if you see it as you will see something like that we need to remove this and just make sure we're

79
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.530
actually left with is our seat.

80
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.010
So if you make this change now this will show up on your Web site.

81
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.660
If you don't get this error of course you don't need to do that.

82
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.550
OK.

83
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:28.240
So update this file and then you will be ready to display the image in your web site.

84
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.540
Now let me just refresh this page and here you go.

85
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.330
Now we see the image in our slider.

86
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.270
And let me go back to my dashboard so that we can go back to our slider and add some more.

87
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.100
So let me say add new and I'm just going to create the second one and again you don't have to use these

88
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.150
apps team you can just use anything that you want.

89
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:59.110
You can just search for mobile app teams to use with part WordPress in Google or you can just search

90
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.460
it internally in the Web site WordPress as well so that you can install it quickly.

91
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.220
And I'm just going to download everything from here so that I can just show you this works and we can

92
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.950
have a nice slider.

93
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:20.710
So let me go back to my dashboard and I'm just going to upload the second image.

94
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.880
So let me say select files and choose this sums altogether.

95
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:34.450
K. I'm just going to upload every one of them so that we can use any of them whenever we want.

96
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.840
So I'm just going to choose this.

97
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.170
And let me copy the title and the message here as well.

98
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.370
So let me go back and get the title.

99
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.640
Yep.

100
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.920
This is minimalistic approach.

101
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.000
And here you go.

102
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.610
Now this will be published as Vo.

103
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:57.710
And then if I come over here I refresh this page then I will see the second slider.

104
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.360
Here you go.

105
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.430
Now this works.

106
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.970
Now let me do the third one and fourth one as well because they will be quick since I have the images

107
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:07.930
right now.

108
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:16.180
Let me copy the message and say easy to use and let me choose the image from here as well since we have

109
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.830
uploaded it.

110
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.290
We can just come over here and choose this one and say publish.

111
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.630
OK.

112
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.210
And let me add the fourth one as well so that it will be a complete Web site.

113
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.810
So does the styling options.

114
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:32.860
And here you go.

115
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:39.360
Now I have to choose the last one from here and publish it.

116
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:44.110
Now if I refresh this I will see my complete slider.

117
00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:50.980
You can add as many as you want as you can see because you can't slide them afterwards with arrows.

118
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.300
And it will be automatic.

119
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.630
You don't need to do anything after that moment.

120
00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:05.440
So now I have to configure is header over here so that I can have my own title and I can have my own

121
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.720
download button.

122
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:13.480
So come over here to a periods and team options under team options you will see the app name.

123
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.920
So rather than apps I'm going to go for cat years.

124
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:23.100
One more time and then later on we are going to have to provide the short apt description.

125
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.310
So I'm going to say learn how old your cat is.

126
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.080
OK.

127
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.320
And that's it.

128
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.990
And in the download link we can just provide a link to download our app.

129
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:39.700
So let me just find a simple app from the I TOS.

130
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.660
We don't have an app actually uploaded to the app store at this moment.

131
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.070
So I'm just going to go for Google Maps.

132
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:53.890
I tos and I'm just going to get the Google Maps link and I'm just going to link it over there to download

133
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.300
by them.

134
00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:02.130
So now if I paste is over here I will just link it to my download them and in the copyright you can

135
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:09.660
just say whatever you want like or Percy will or you can just write cat years and in the styling you

136
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.530
can change the background color and every color that you want.

137
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:20.240
And over here I believe you want to get rid of this watermark so there won't be any retirement in your

138
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.690
website.

139
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:29.250
So now you fire refresh this then you will see my cat years is showing up and if I click over here it

140
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.300
will take me to the I Tunes download page.

141
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:40.440
So now we are left with the main description and the other page stuff over here.

142
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.880
So let me show you how to edit that as well.

143
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.770
So as you can see they added some good images and good description over here.

144
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.800
I'm just going to take this over but it's actually kind of tricky to get one.

145
00:10:55.110 --> 00:11:02.010
So you have to say we've Patti Page saws in order to reach the source of this Web site.

146
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:08.190
So this is the HDMI code and you can just copy and paste whatever you want from here.

147
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.170
And I'm just doing this for an example.

148
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.380
You don't have to do that but if you want to you can find this article.

149
00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.010
Okay.

150
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.360
And just copy it.

151
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.190
Not the article part but the part between the articles.

152
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.410
OK this one.

153
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.180
And then you can come over here to your Web site in the posts.

154
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:35.070
Let me just go to this hallowed post and edit it so does hallowed displays.

155
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.820
Welcome to the word press right now.

156
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:44.610
So rather than displaying that I'm just going to paste the HDMI code in the text tab not the visual

157
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.390
tab.

158
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:52.740
So let me paste in everything so that I can save this and display exact same things on my Web site as

159
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.010
well.

160
00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.570
So if I go to visual tab now we will be displaying the things and in fact I could have copied the visuals

161
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:07.440
as it is without going into the source code and tried to paste in here as VO But doing that in an HDMI

162
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.200
way is much more reliable.

163
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.000
OK.

164
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:19.170
Now now if I can refreshed is then I will see all those things popping up in my web pages up.

165
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.370
So here you go.

166
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:24.630
Now you know how to create a Web site for your own app.

167
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.370
And again you don't have to use Ecolab posting hosting.

168
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.190
You don't have to use the domain names if you don't want.

169
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.060
You don't have to use this app steam if you don't want.

170
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.070
You can just go for alternative ways but you can easily use WordPress on.

171
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:48.090
I really suggest you to use WordPress if you don't know the web development so that you can create easily

172
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.270
whatever you want.

173
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:55.560
And of course in the pages section you can create a new page in which you can copy and paste a privacy

174
00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.710
policy that we have discussed in the previous section as well so that you can take the link and submit

175
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.080
it to the App Store.

176
00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.080
So let's stop here and continue within the next section.
