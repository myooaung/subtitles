Hi within this section we're going to focus on Swift UI so maybe you remember swift UI from the layout

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,220
section.

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,470
This is a way to create stunning user interfaces.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,370
This is a very new technique that came into our lives with a U.S. tour team.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,800
So we're going to learn how to use it how to create views with swift UI how to leverage it so that we

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:35,700
can have responsive abs that verbs in all of the screen sizes so that we can have beautiful apps.

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,480
