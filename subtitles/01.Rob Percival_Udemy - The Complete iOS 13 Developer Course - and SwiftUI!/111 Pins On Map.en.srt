00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,870
Hi within this picture we are going to see how to pin the map.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,840
However before we do that let's recap the previous lecture because we have learnt a lot.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,210
As you might remember in the location we have chosen another location we changed the user's location

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,130
and the map got updated.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,790
So it means that whenever I change my location we are going to get that location in the did update locations

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:33,810
functions and we're going to display it on the map so that then user walks or changes his location.

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:41,880
It will be reflected on the map because we're zooming in that through region K and again in the previous

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,370
lecture we have learned about something called spend and it defines the width and height of the current

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,090
map view.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,950
So with 0.01 we get some view like that.

11
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,990
So let me run from the beginning actually and we can see or point the one in an exact way.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,900
So it starts like this.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,650
It's kind of a zoomed out I believe.

14
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,710
So let's try 0 point 0 5.

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,460
As I said before it will give us a zoomed in more zoomed in view.

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,090
I believe it will be much better.

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,230
And now as you can see it's much better and we can actually tried for 0 point 0 3 as well but I believe

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,670
this is optimal.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,580
So I'm going to leave it as it is.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,590
I suggest you try with other numbers and experience on with yourself.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:40,500
So next thing to do is just to add a gesture recognize your here so that then user taps on one of these

22
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,560
map locations it will get pinned.

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,330
So yeah we're going to use the old gesture recognizing in order to do that but we're not going to use

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:59,850
these same old UI tap gesture recognizing because we want to look press on here for like three seconds

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,220
in order to tag this.

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:10,140
If we make it with a tap gesture recognize her then it won't be very good because if every time I touch

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,420
on a map it will just tag the map will just drop a pin and that's not what I want.

28
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:23,580
I want to choose a specific location in which I can long press like hold for three seconds and then

29
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,980
I can see the pin I can see the tagged location.

30
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,860
So let me show you how it's done.

31
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,990
We're going to create the gesture recognize her as usual.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,860
Okay I'm going to say love gesture organizer and rather than saying you I tap gesture recognize her

33
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,540
I'm just going to go for you I long pressed gesture recognize her.

34
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,250
So this is again a gesture recognize her that looks for long pressed gestures.

35
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,720
OK.

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:02,040
And don't worry we're going to set it up as usual so we're just going to have to specify a target which

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,640
is itself and of course we're just going to have to specify a selector function like we used to do before.

38
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,760
So it's not different than UI tap gesture recognized.

39
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:20,310
So I'm going to say Objective C function and in here we can just something like we can just say something

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,730
like choose location OK and that's it.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,700
That's how you create gesture recognizes with you a long press gesture recognize type.

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,620
But here we're going to do something different rather than just saying this going to be a function I'm

43
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,730
just going to give a gesture recognize your input here as well because we're going to need that gesture

44
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,230
recognizing type to work upon you know what I mean.

45
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,050
Let's write that and I'm I will explain later on.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,950
So I'm going to call this gesture recognizing and it's going to be a type of UI long press gesture recognizing

47
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,700
ok like this.

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,430
So choose the UI long gesture recognize her.

49
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:16,770
And if I now come over here to this action and say choose location OK it will bring me as a view like

50
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,160
that and I can double click on this.

51
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,640
And that's how I assign this selector to my gesture recognize her.

52
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,370
So why did I even do that under.

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,350
Choose location function I have to use the properties of the gesture recognize her.

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,710
Like what.

55
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,370
Like I'm just going to see if gestures recognize her has begun.

56
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:48,390
So for example if I say gesture recognize her Dot I can reach the properties I can reach the attributes

57
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,600
of that gesture recognize the right.

58
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,910
So I can just control to see if gesture recognizes state is OK.

59
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:05,390
Double equal to dot began dot begin or cancelled or changed or failed.

60
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,840
If I want to see the current state of the gesture recognize her.

61
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,510
Now I can't reach and use it.

62
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:22,190
So when I do that it connects me to do you I long press gesture recognizing that my user will be doing

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,370
on the map so I can't see if it's failed or cancelled or begin I'm just going to control to begin by

64
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,690
the way.

65
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,590
So if we begin then I'm going to perform my operations but I'm just telling you for days like an example.

66
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,400
OK.

67
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,170
That's why I have given this gesture recognizing you UI long press.

68
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,560
Yes you recognize her in here.

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,700
And as usual I'm going to close down the series and I'm going to come over here and say map you dot

70
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:59,930
adjust you recognize her it will ask me for my gesture recognize her I'm going to give it one but before

71
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,840
we go on and do that we have two sets minimum duration of that gesture recognize her because it's a

72
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,460
long pass gesture recognize her and we gonna specify how long.

73
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,400
So whether we want something like five seconds or 23 seconds in order to do that say dot minimum price

74
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,900
duration and go for tree and we are going for tree because if we make it like one it would be too short

75
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:34,460
we can easily capture the other taps of the user by mistake if we make it something like five it will

76
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,900
be too long this time so user will think there is something growing I'm pressing over here and nothing

77
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,080
happens so I'm gonna go for a tree we generally use tree but you can experience with other numbers as

78
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
well.

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,540
So after dad under choose location I'm going to go ahead and actually control if this state is began.

80
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:07,570
So once my gesture recognizes begins I can get the clicked coordinates from that point Okay so we're

81
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,050
gonna see how to do it.

82
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,210
Don't worry.

83
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:19,070
First of all let's check if gesture recognizing that state is actually equal to begin so let's say that

84
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:27,860
that's state double equals sign dot begin so it means that has received touched objects as you can see

85
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,420
in the description.

86
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:38,930
So once we do that once it's begun it means that it received something called touch points and I'm going

87
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,540
to create that touch points with a variable I'm going to assign it to a variable because we're going

88
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,460
to get the coordinates out of that touch points in order to do that you have to say gesture recognize

89
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,150
the DOT location.

90
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:03,050
OK so this gives us a point in some view and of course we're going to say self doubt map the region

91
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:10,610
here because we're going to use that location from map view and again this gesture recognized gives

92
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,520
us a touchpoint.

93
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,200
So it means that very user touched on that in view K and we can create a coordinate with that touch

94
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:29,720
point and in order to do that you have to say s dot map view dot and converge and we're looking for

95
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,340
converting a point to a coordinate.

96
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:43,700
OK so we're looking for this one so we're converting it points and we could converting it from a view

97
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:53,390
so we have a lot of options here please try to choose the right one point two coordinate from so as

98
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,220
you can see this commerce a point in the specified views coordinate system to a map.

99
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:06,620
So I'm going to say touch point four for the point and we're going to say South dot map view here one

100
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:15,140
more time and again this will give us the touch point of the user and this will give us the coordinates

101
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,340
of that touch points.

102
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,820
Next thing I'm going to create the pin that we have been talking about and it's called annotation and

103
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:32,120
it's type of M.K. pinpoint annotation actually so if you come over here you can just say I'm K point

104
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,230
on notation as you can see this will create the object for us when you create an imitation you have

105
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,770
to give it some coordinates okay a notation does curdled and we say we have this coordinates right touch

106
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:53,210
coordinates and you can use subtitles to annotations as well I'm going to say annotation notation that

107
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:00,190
title new plays are new on notation and I'm just doing this for an example so that you will see what

108
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,930
is that title.

109
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,900
What is the subtitle and how they are displayed in the map.

110
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay so I'm just going to go for travel book here so that you can see why we're using titles why we're

111
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,790
using subtitles and then you can just call the map USA.

112
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,850
Dot dot dot notation and choose the annotation that we have created.

113
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,710
So let me run this and if this works I'm going to explain it one more time.

114
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,480
Don't worry if it's got too complicated for you.

115
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,470
Now let's zoom in into Eiffel Tower and I'm going to hit over here and hold for three seconds.

116
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,410
And here you go.

117
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,270
Here we have the first annotation.

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,850
So as you can see it says that new annotation and under the new annotation we have the travel book subtitled.

119
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,700
So let me zoom in and so we can see better.

120
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,570
As you can see this is the title and this is the subtitle that I have been creating so far.

121
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,950
So we're going to use this annotation in our travel book and we're going to display the name and the

122
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,650
comment of the user not of the user in that notation with title and subtitle.

123
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,080
So what did we do.

124
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,880
We created this gesture organizer and once it begins it gives something called touchpoint and we can

125
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,150
get this by saying that gesture recognizes that location and we convert that point to a coordinates

126
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,760
and we give this coordinates to the annotation that we have created.

127
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,030
You are seeing this for the first time and it might seem complicated but once you actually get used

128
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:48,420
to it you will see it's actually very easy compared to what we have been learning so far.

129
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,750
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
