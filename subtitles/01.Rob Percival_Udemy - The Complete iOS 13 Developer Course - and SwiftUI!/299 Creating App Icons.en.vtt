00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.810
In order to submit your apps to the App Store you have to have an app icon right.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.500
So we didn't elect you rigging to see how we can do that.

4
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.760
Yeah.

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.580
Did you do that.

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.300
I'm just going to create an exemplary X code project.

7
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:23.310
And are you going to work on that because we should know how to embed those icons in our X code.

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.440
So I'm just going to go for a single view app and I'm just going to name this vendor app.

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.880
Okay.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.760
Whether logo app because I will assume that we had that weather app and we agreed to create a logo or

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.560
an icon for that map.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.730
So let me put this under my iris complete folder and it will create that project for me.

13
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
And in fact we're not going to do anything in this project but we're just going to go into the SAT's

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.340
folder and just click on that app.

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.410
I can I can like that.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.920
Okay.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.830
So when you do that you can see the necessary icons that you should create for your app as you can see

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.390
it gives us the pixels as well like we have to go for 40 40.

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.730
You have to go for 60 60 and so on.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.510
So we have different sizes and we have to create icons for each size over here.

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.150
So how do we do that.

22
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.950
It's fairly easy right.

23
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.580
We can just open a new Adobe exciting project.

24
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.990
OK.

25
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.710
So let me open the adobe Steve one more time and we're going to go for custom size because we going

26
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.130
to create the same pixels.

27
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.060
We're going to use the same pixels that X called wants from us.

28
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.930
For example I'm just going to start with 40 to 40.

29
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.400
So let me zoom in and in my app I can I want to have a blue background and on the blue background I

30
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.190
want to have some.

31
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.980
OK so let me create this background first.

32
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.230
So let me lose this.

33
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:14.340
Actually I'm not going to use any border but I'm just going to fill this in with some nice blue color

34
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.350
like that.

35
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.600
OK so let me make this a little with dark like that.

36
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.020
So yep this is good.

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.640
And over here I'm just going to go for a perfect circle.

38
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.010
And in the circle I'm just going to loose the borders one more time but rather I'm just going to fill

39
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.100
this up with something yellow like that.

40
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.110
So it's going to be our sum and of course we we need some lights for our son like that.

41
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.470
OK.

42
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.820
So I'm just going to go for this vertical one to begin but so this looks good but I need something yellow.

43
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.770
OK.

44
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.520
So I need the exact same yellow actually.

45
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.550
So let me do this like that and I need some around that shape like this.

46
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.940
So maybe we can go for two in the thickness.

47
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.900
And here you go.

48
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.040
Now we have some.

49
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.070
Some like shape but we have to copy and paste is a couple of times in order to have some other lines

50
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.150
over here as well.

51
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.900
Yep I believe they are exactly the same size right now.

52
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.990
So let me copy and paste this.

53
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.970
And rather than just moving the zip around I'm just going to change this like that.

54
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.960
OK.

55
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.160
So I'm just going to have a horizontal line right now.

56
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.770
So I believe there.

57
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.970
OK so let me copy and paste this one more time so that I can have other lines here as well like that.

58
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:59.010
And let me bring in the end of this line over here and let me continue copying pasting these things

59
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.670
and I believe that's good.

60
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.920
So of course we have to adjust the spaces a little bit and adjust the size over here as well.

61
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.460
So let me make this a little bit to the left and this one a little bit to the right and let me copy

62
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:23.630
and paste it one more time and let me make this over here.

63
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:24.720
And I believe that's good.

64
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.470
So let me make this a little bit to the right.

65
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.380
So let me copy and paste one more time so that we can have our last line.

66
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.400
Of course we have to adjust this a little bit to make this actually better.

67
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:49.920
OK so maybe we can make this a little bit smaller so they had to be symmetrical in order to make this

68
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.910
a perfect son.

69
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.620
So this looks good right.

70
00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:03.950
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to export this and see if we can use it on our eggs scope project.

71
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.700
So I'm just going to name the sun logo okay.

72
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:15.360
And by clicking over this little icon or just right the right clicking over here I'd say Mark for export.

73
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.690
You can just market for export things and if you come over here to file export batch it will just create

74
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.500
this icon for us.

75
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.090
So I'm just going to go for AOS and export this.

76
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.280
OK.

77
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.670
So let me see if we can make this in our Desktop.

78
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.170
No.

79
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.780
So let me go back and rather than just searching for it I'm just going to export it one more time and

80
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.990
I don't want it in the Creative Cloud files.

81
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.000
I just wanted on my desktop.

82
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.330
OK.

83
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.280
So here you go.

84
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.500
Now we see the PND are here so this is 40 to 40 and we have two X century X as well.

85
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.010
So in the 40 to 40 I'm just going to bring in the first one and drop it over here and here you go.

86
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.750
Now we have our first icon.

87
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.350
So this should be 80 to 80.

88
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.970
OK.

89
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.510
So do we have something over here like 80 to 80.

90
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.380
So let me see.

91
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.660
Yep I believe.

92
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.350
And as you can see if I make this into another position like that it won't accept it then it will just

93
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.700
display an error message.

94
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.420
But if I make it in the right place it won't display an error or a warning.

95
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.130
OK.

96
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.040
So let me bring in this as well.

97
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.150
And do we have something like 120 to 120.

98
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.030
I don't think so.

99
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.510
So let me bring in one forty two forty one more time.

100
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.780
And here you go.

101
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.380
Now we have some of these icons.

102
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:59.230
So what can we do is just copy and paste is and try to scale this up or down or we can use some online

103
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.790
service as well.

104
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.330
So let me show how it goes.

105
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.880
Let let me go to Google and I'm going to search far app Apple IRS guess I can generator.

106
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:16.060
OK so this will give us some options over here like millions of options.

107
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.370
So I'm just going to go for the first one which is app I can make her dot co.

108
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.760
So it asks me to choose a file.

109
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.460
So let me do so.

110
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.760
Let me choose the some logo.

111
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.090
And if I click over here to generate it will generate it for IRS.

112
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:41.690
And if you scroll down you will see it created so much variations of this file.

113
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:50.560
So right now in fact I can go for dots like for 48 and just download it to use it on my app.

114
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.400
Let me see if we have something like 48.

115
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.600
Yeah.

116
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.320
We have 58.

117
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.540
So let me go for seven to six for example.

118
00:07:59.590 --> 00:07:59.950
OK.

119
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.920
So let me download dads and let me download 60 as well.

120
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.940
So let me just close that down and let me go back.

121
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.440
So let me start with seven to six so it should go up here.

122
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.670
Yep that's the one.

123
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.760
And let me go for 60.

124
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:24.220
So let me open this and bring in the 60 over here.

125
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.130
So as you can see it works right.

126
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:36.190
So let's do a couple more examples and we can just use it for iPhone so that we can try to see if it

127
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:42.780
actually works on the real life one as well so I'm going to go for debt and 87 as well.

128
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.900
So let me come over here and try to find out.

129
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.980
This is 87 and the other one yep this one.

130
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.480
And let me go for the 87.

131
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.650
So here we go.

132
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.100
Now in order to test is I'm just going to run this on my simulator.

133
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.900
OK.

134
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:08.950
So if I run this on our simulator you will see the app will actually open and we don't have anything

135
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:15.790
on our apps so we won't be seeing anything on our storyboards or view controller but if we close down

136
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.520
the app on our resume later then we can actually see the icons.

137
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.480
So we're going to test that.

138
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:29.870
Let me open the simulator so that we can see it and let's see if this is done.

139
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:38.290
So here you go it's opening and after it's uplands all you have to do is just close down this app by

140
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.600
just dragging this up.

141
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.410
And here you go.

142
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.350
Now we see our icon like that.

143
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.380
So let me test the search as well.

144
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.950
So let me come over here and search for a weather app or weather logo app.

145
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.740
And here you go.

146
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.690
Now we see our red their logo app.

147
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.670
So icons actually work.

148
00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:04.140
And in this I can generator or app generator.

149
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.270
I you have to pay attention because let me come over here and let me scroll down you will see some peak

150
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.940
salvation on the big sizes.

151
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:22.270
So in order to avoid this problem you can just go for the biggest icon that you may create in the adobe

152
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.910
steam.

153
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.290
And if you actually provide a bigger I can to this website it will try to scale it down so it won't

154
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.340
be pixilated.

155
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.270
OK but if you try something like 40 to 40 like with it.

156
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.920
In this lecture it will be pixilated like dad.

157
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.900
So it's fun to look good.

158
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:48.620
So of course alternative way of doing this is going into the adobe extant create everything on your

159
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.380
own.

160
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.430
So if you're trying to upload your app to the App Store.

161
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:59.960
I believe this would be very helpful for you if you can come over to the weeks that you can create your

162
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.510
app.

163
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.220
I can like that and you will be good to go to submit.

164
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.910
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
