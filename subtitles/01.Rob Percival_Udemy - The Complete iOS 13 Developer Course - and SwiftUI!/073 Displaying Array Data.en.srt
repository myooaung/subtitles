00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,370
Hi within this lecture regrouping to see how we can display those values in our table we use using this

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,520
table view functions that we have created before.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,730
So right now I'm just displaying tasks for 10 times.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,230
So how many data do I have in here to display in my table view.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,080
I have five data right.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,800
So coalesce assume great while Kremlin Stonehenge and Taj Mahal.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,550
So I can easily come to my number of rows in Section.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:42,090
I can just say five fine it will work as well but I'm not going to go for that because there is a better

9
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,860
way to do this.

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,170
I'm going to go for Landmark names dot count.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,190
So we have seen this before right.

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,420
We have a dot count method in our landmark names actually in all areas.

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:04,470
So if you come over here and say landmark names will give you the array and if you say dots count it

14
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,710
will give you the number of elements in that area.

15
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,020
So later on we may decide to add new landmarks.

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:19,430
So it's wise to use landmark names dots count in here rather than just saying five.

17
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,960
But I cannot reach that right now.

18
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,560
How can I do that.

19
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,400
Of course we have to define these variables outside of the we did load.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:39,390
But inside of our class so that we can reach those variables from all the functions inside of our class.

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,310
So you know how to do that right.

22
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:50,760
So you you just can copy this or you can just even cut this with command X and paste the here and then

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,130
later on I'm going to do the same thing for this one as well.

24
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,190
Cut this and pasted in here.

25
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,910
So all right now I can't reach those values from everywhere.

26
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,300
So here I can change landmark names I can upon new values let me delete this as well.

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,450
And here we go.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,380
So we can reach landmark names landmark images from here.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,090
And let me create a note here saying that these are landmark book deep data.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,620
OK.

31
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,170
And then later on I can come to my number of ROVs function.

32
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,500
I can call landmark names that count.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,440
So this is landmark names that count and it will return five.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,310
To me anyway.

35
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:44,200
But it would be much more practical if we want to add some more data here later on.

36
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,180
So here we go.

37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,150
We have our rare number of rows in Section function ready.

38
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:57,390
Now we have to find a way to display those names in our row cell that text labeled so rather than saying

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,760
text I'm going to refer to my landmark names.

40
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,750
So let me run this and let's see what we get.

41
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,950
We're going to get test five times.

42
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,510
Right.

43
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,280
Because we are creating five rows in here but we're just displaying tasks in those rows rather than

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,900
displaying this task.

45
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:29,070
I'm just going to display the elements inside of my string list one by one and we have indexes in order

46
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,880
to achieve this result.

47
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,250
As I said before table view has its own index and a race has its own index as well.

48
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:47,160
So if you go over here and say landmark names then you can choose an index to show in relate to the

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,020
rows.

50
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,640
And there is a very good way to do that.

51
00:03:51,810 --> 00:04:01,100
If you open a parentheses in here you can just go for index path that is given to you in this function.

52
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,180
So this is the current index that we see in the row.

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,250
So this is 0 for this row one for it is two for this tree for this and it goes and on and on.

54
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:23,190
So it has its own index since I am algorithm and it says it's only indexing logic and it overlaps with

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,220
the logic of array in the same place.

56
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,260
So that's why we use table view with arrays because it's so efficient.

57
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,670
If you come over here as a index path that's your.

58
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:45,520
It will just you do related to row to you in each related array elements so that we will get coalesce

59
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,430
Hume first grateful seconds Kremlin Stonehenge and Taj Mahal.

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,530
So that's very good.

61
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:53,850
Right.

62
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,580
That's very cool.

63
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
So that's it actually.

64
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:05,520
That's all we have to change in order to make this work so we're calling landmark names and we are saying

65
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,440
index path.

66
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:12,830
That's row in order to get 0 1 2 3 and 4 in order.

67
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,770
So here you go.

68
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,170
Now we see the Colosseum Great Wall crumbling Stonehenge and Taj Mahal here.

69
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,490
So that's good.

70
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:30,060
Right now we have learned how to display those arrays inside our table view but we don't know how to

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,010
make them clickable right.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:39,720
So what we want here is actually to let the user click one of these rows one of these cells so that

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,750
we can pass this data to another real controller in which we can show the details.

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,230
That's what we going to do within the following lectures.
