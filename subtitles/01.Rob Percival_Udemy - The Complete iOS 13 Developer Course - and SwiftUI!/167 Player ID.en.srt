00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:07,410
Hi within this lecture we going to see how we can gather to play your ideas and save them to a database

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,960
like fire your base so that we can get those whenever we want.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,150
Okay.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,730
Right now we're sending our push notifications to this device but we don't send our push notifications

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,380
to this device only.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,640
So we want to know what device that we should send our push notifications and in order to do that we

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,530
going together every play your I.D. every device that we have in our app and going to save all this

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,950
information into fire base so that we can gather them when we need them.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,400
So there are a lot of ways to do that.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,750
And even though we can use any other databases as well since now we have the fire base.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,540
I'm going to do that in five year base and of course if you're working with parts or any other database

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,850
that you want you can do it with that as well.

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,820
Right.

14
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:12,510
Because all we need to do is just to find somewhere to store these data and then reach them afterwards.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,530
So I'm going to comment this out because I don't want to send this same notification every time we run

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,040
this and I'm going together to play your I.D. over here.

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,830
So let me show you have to do that.

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,710
Of course you can find this in documentation as well but I'm just going to show you because documentation

19
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,760
can be messy sometimes or can get complicated.

20
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,790
It's not messy structural but it's sometimes hard to find what you're looking for.

21
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,730
So how how do we get the play your IED off the current device.

22
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,330
Of course we're going to use different signal methods.

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:59,370
So I'm going to create a status over here and the status will indicate whether this device is subscribed

24
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,480
or not.

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,860
And in order to do that I'm going to use something called or ask permission state subscriptions state.

26
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,590
OK so this is one signal permission subscriptions state.

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,980
And I'm going to get it from one signal.

28
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,090
OK dot get permission subscriptions state.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
So this will give me the current subscription state.

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,020
If this is subscribed I'm going to get to 0 or if this is not subscribed I'm getting going to get false

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,440
but I can't get play your I.D. out of that state as well.

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,790
So let me create the play your I.D. and I will call the status and Dot.

33
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,910
And as you can see it gives me so many options over here.

34
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,260
What we want is the subscription status itself.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
This one.

36
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,540
So if you come over here and say that one more time you can actually get whatever you're looking for.

37
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:05,640
So in this case we're looking for user I.D. even though it says user I.D. is actually the same as play

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,780
your I.D..

39
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,110
So I'm going to print out this play your idea and see if that's the real thing that we're looking for.

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,330
So as you can see it's an optional strange and you can check to see with a flat as well.

41
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,300
So for right now I'm just going to force a wrap this.

42
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,970
But in this case I believe it's safe to do that with a flat.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,970
So let me run this and see if we can get the play your I.D..

44
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:44,100
So here you go now once it's five years up I'm going to see the logs and I'm going to just filter this

45
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,270
with player I.D..

46
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,080
And here you go.

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,720
Now we have this play your I.D..

48
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,540
Of course we can check this so that we can be certain are getting the same data.

49
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,880
And let me refresh this.

50
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,880
And as you can see this is the same play your I.D. that I'm seeing over here.

51
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,470
So I know how to get a player I.D. right now.

52
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:07,860
Right.

53
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,530
So if I save a replay your I.D. to firebase.

54
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,470
Now when I need them I can just get them.

55
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,780
Right.

56
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,310
So let's do that actually.

57
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,590
So after getting the play your I.D..

58
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,940
I'm going to create a five star reference and let's see if we have one.

59
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,750
Yeah we have imported Phi Phi your base over here and let me open my file your base file your store

60
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,530
as well.

61
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,010
Rather than saving under Paul's.

62
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,480
I'm going to create a new collection.

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:46,160
Of course you can come up with some other algorithm as well but I'm just going to keep it simple.

64
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,890
So let me create a five star reference over here.

65
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,010
OK so this will be five years store.

66
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,660
That's five years sir.

67
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,760
Remember this gives us some instance of these five years sir okay.

68
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,550
And then I I'm going to call these fires to reference that collection and I'm going to call this collection

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,600
play your I.D. so you can call whatever you want.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,530
But after that you have to call and document and this will ask you for a data and a completion block.

71
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,760
So this will be our dictionary so I'm going to call this play your I.D. dictionary and I'm going to

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,400
save the mail of the current logged in user.

73
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,330
And remember we can get this from off that of dots turned to user.

74
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:44,120
OK so this one and I'm going to force unwrap this and say email and I'm going to force unwrap this as

75
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
well.

76
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:52,580
And this site from email I'm going to just save display your I.D. so I'm going to say play your I.D..

77
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,170
OK.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,890
And this will be the play your I.D. that we're looking for.

79
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,720
So this one.

80
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,040
And here you go.

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,030
That's how we say play your I.D. to defy your store so that we can filter the results regarding with

82
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,790
e-mail and we can get those and I'm going to do this.

83
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:16,120
If that thing because it won't be safe to force our app this.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,830
So I'm going to call this play your new I.D. And as you can see it's not optional anymore.

85
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:29,510
So I'm going to delete this and I'm going to take everything from here to there and rather than saying

86
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:37,100
play your I.D. over here I'm going to say play your new I.D. And I'm going to have a non optional string

87
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,420
and I'm going to use this play your I.D. dictionary to save in my five year term.

88
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,980
And then I can just call the current e-mail to get the related play your I.D..

89
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:59,900
So as you can see this is our play your I.D. dictionary and let's say it says that it's string to string

90
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,620
and I'm going to cast this as a string to any dictionary because Firestarter store asks me to provide

91
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,330
a string to any dictionary.

92
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:15,060
OK now if I come over here as you can see it's string to any dictionary and now it's done.

93
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,910
And if I hit enter over here it will give me an error if there is one.

94
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:27,050
And I'm going to check to see if error is not nil and if area is not nil your let me close the three

95
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,610
down and your if area is not nil maybe you may want to print out the error or you may want to display

96
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,350
the error message to the user.

97
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:44,110
It's your call at this point but I'm just going to test as if we can actually save this data to define

98
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,160
your base.

99
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:53,220
So let me run this in our simulator and let's see if we can see the data in the fire store.

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,730
Now it's over here running.

101
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,680
So let me refresh the fire store.

102
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,800
OK and let's see if we can get the new collection from here.

103
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Here you go.

104
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,250
Now we have the player I.D..

105
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:14,000
If I hit on that you will see that Kirk at Metallica dot com has displayed your I.D. So it's working

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,690
fine.

107
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,820
But there is some sort of a trick or here that we may want to do.

108
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:30,300
Because let me run this in our iPhone as well to test this out and you will see it will work fine.

109
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:38,140
But I believe every time we run this app it will just upload a new value to the fire store.

110
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,770
And that's not what we want.

111
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,240
So let me go over here and see if we can see my iPhone's play your I.D. as well.

112
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,840
Here you go.

113
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,160
Now James said Metallica outcome has this play your I.D. but let me run this from scratch and let's

114
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:04,610
see if we can see two results but we won't be seeing this I believe because we're not checking for anything

115
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,850
else.

116
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,960
So let me run this in my simulator.

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,670
No not in my simulator but I'm running does it on my real phone.

118
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,690
And here you go.

119
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,090
Now we have to James is in our play your I.D. collection.

120
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:29,480
And even though they're having the same player I.D. We don't want to James in our play your I.D. collection.

121
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,000
Right.

122
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,210
Because it will get complicated.

123
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:41,070
So I believe we have to figure out a way to check for this if we have this I won't create a new one.

124
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,000
If we don't have this then I will create a new one.

125
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:52,400
So it's fairly easy to do and it's all related to the fire base not the push notifications but we're

126
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,410
going to have to do it anyway.

127
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,180
So I'm going to stop here and within the next six you re going to take care of this problem.
