00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,320
Hi.

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:07,810
We didn't this lecture we going to implement counting down functionality into our game.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,240
And you can imagine that we are going to use timers for that.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,260
K So you now know how to use timer's right.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:25,400
We can just create the timer and we can just create a time counter like counter variable and we can

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,950
make sure that we display this in our counter time label.

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,470
So here we have our time label.

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,950
It can just start with 10 or 30.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,000
You can choose it whatever you want to choose.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:46,640
And then we going to create another timer actually within the next lectures to estimate the Kennedys

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,300
as well.

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:57,620
So whatever you decide for the number you may want to refresh it at does mean that storyboard as well.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,940
But it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,750
I'm going to do that on the.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:07,220
We've added loads so it will be on there even before user sees it.

16
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,220
So let's go.

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,640
Let's do that.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,440
I believe you can do that on your own by the way you may want to post a video and try this on your own.

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:25,690
If you haven't completed this assignment yet so this will be our variables and this will be our view

20
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,570
so I'm taking some notes.

21
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,990
Zach good practice.

22
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,430
Right.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,790
So this will be our images and we're going to have a lot of coding here.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,730
That's why I'm doing that.

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,340
So after you open your notes open your code you will know what you have been up to.

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,870
So let me create timer over here so we can reach that timer from everywhere.

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,700
Right.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,080
So this is going to be our timer.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:02:00,900
Of course we're going to redefined is actually change the value to scheduled timer in the way of the

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,370
load.

31
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:10,340
And we will need the counter variable as well so that we can subtract one from this counter every seconds

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,850
so we did that before.

33
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,100
You know how this goes.

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,610
So let me go to we did locked in here.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:27,340
First of all I have to make sure that this timer or this counter will be displayed in the time label.

36
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,340
OK.

37
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:36,140
And then we can actually create our timer with scheduled timer.

38
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:44,630
So this is where we will be doing the timer stuff so time Labour or counter I'm going to go for 10 in

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,820
order not to wait too much between tests.

40
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,870
OK.

41
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,240
So you can adjust this number later on.

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,490
I'm going to make sure that time label that text is the counter.

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,360
Of course I cannot say counter because this is an integer.

44
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,580
I have to count convert this into a string.

45
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,250
It will give me an error.

46
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,310
OK.

47
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,300
And in order to do that I'm going to do it like this.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,310
And this will convert this into a string as well or you can just say string wrapped with counter like

49
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,310
this.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,290
So you can choose your own way.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,440
So this will be our counter.

52
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,960
This will be our time label actually.

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,680
So next I'm going to take my timer and I'm going to create a scheduled timer out of this variable.

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,740
So this will be scheduled timer.

55
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,800
And we want this timing terrible target selector user in and repeats.

56
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,440
So timing interval.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,590
I'm going to go for one second one more time because I just want to subtract one from the counter every

58
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:02,930
second target will be self and self refers to we've controller and selector.

59
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:10,650
We're going to create another object to see function and we are actually going to call this count down

60
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,130
or just subtract one.

61
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,200
You can call this whatever you want.

62
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,870
Okay I'm just going to go for count down.

63
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,510
So next step will be to define selector in here.

64
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,920
I'm going to go for countdown.

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,630
So this is good.

66
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,910
Later on for user E4 I'm going to go four nil and repeats true.

67
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,260
So here you go.

68
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,420
We have our timer.

69
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:44,760
So what do we want to do in the selector function in the countdown function.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,110
This is going to be fairly easy.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:56,960
We're just going to deduct the one from our counter variable and then we're going to display that on

72
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,130
our time label.

73
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,390
So let's see.

74
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:10,400
Count three minus equals one and our time label dot taxed K will be again counter of string representation

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,090
of counter end them.

76
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,740
We can check to see if counter has reached zero.

77
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:25,270
So we're going to have an if statement in here I'm going to say if counter is actually zero and open

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,910
curly braces here and you can go for a timer that invalidate.

79
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,310
OK.

80
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:40,610
This will stop our timer and we will do some other stuff like displaying alert message to the user.

81
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,630
Right.

82
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,400
And in this alert message we will just provide some replay functions and other stuff as well.

83
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,530
But for right now I believe we can create our alert message only.

84
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,120
So how do you create alert messages of course you use UI Elliott controller class.

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,660
Right.

86
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:11,660
So first let me do the alert and say let's Allard will be a you eye alert controller not action controller

87
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,760
but just controller if you open parentheses so you will have a title.

88
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,090
So what do we do for it's title.

89
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,570
We can say something like time's up or time is over.

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,280
OK.

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,280
And this is good for a title for message maybe we can say want to play again.

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,160
OK.

93
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,390
So that user will know what to do.

94
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,400
And let me say do you want to play again and forward a preferred style.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,380
I'm going to hit enter and see that dot and then say Elliott.

96
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,660
So do we have a bottom line here.

97
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,610
Yep we have a replay button and we have no of.

98
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,630
Right.

99
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,400
So we have to create two actions.

100
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,930
And you know how to do this you just have to use UI alert action in order to do that.

101
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,060
Let's start with the cancel button.

102
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,760
Okay.

103
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,260
So I'm going to call is okay by then and I'm going to say you a to action.

104
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,690
And the title can be cancel or.

105
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,760
Okay.

106
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,590
And the style let's go for cancel this time to see how this looks.

107
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,230
So the default will be more highlighted.

108
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,210
Okay.

109
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
And the handler.

110
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,160
We don't need any handler.

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,370
We don't want anything to happen when user taps on this cancel.

112
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,260
So we're going to have a replay button as well.

113
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,320
Right.

114
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,630
So that's where we want handler in this case I don't want any handler.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,860
So let me create the replay by them now.

116
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,150
So a replay button will be again a UI alert action.

117
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,570
Right.

118
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:59,590
And then we're going to go for replay and then for a style I can go for default this time.

119
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,770
And the handler.

120
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,170
Yeah.

121
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,460
We want handler because we have to have a replay function in here.

122
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:15,230
So hit enter and hit enter one more time to make this visible and in the coding section we're going

123
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,810
to write a replay function.

124
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,620
Right now I'm not going to do that.

125
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,450
We're going to do that last.

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,320
So we have to add these buttons to our Ellard.

127
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,270
So I looked that ad action.

128
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:36,690
OK button alert that ad action replay button and then we're ready to present this view.

129
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,430
So I'm going to say South dot present and it will ask me what to present.

130
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,290
Right.

131
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,910
So I'm going to present this alert and it will be animated.

132
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,040
Why not.

133
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,270
So let's say true.

134
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,410
And the completion I don't need any completion because I'm doing what I had to do in the replay button.

135
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,790
So far so good.

136
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,980
Let me test is actually because we don't have to write anything else at this point.

137
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,410
We're just going to take care of those things later on at the end.

138
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,910
So far I don't know what to do to create a replay function.

139
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,200
So here we go.

140
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,630
It's already started counting down from ten.

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,610
And as you can see I can still click on the scores.

142
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,750
And here you go time's up.

143
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,240
Do you want to play again.

144
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,750
So if I click or replay or okay nothing will happen.

145
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:41,120
So because we didn't write our handler obviously we didn't write our replay function.

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,050
We're going to do that later on.

147
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:49,830
But right now I can say that we're making progress and we are ready to estimate the Kenny.

148
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,480
So we're going to stop here and that's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
