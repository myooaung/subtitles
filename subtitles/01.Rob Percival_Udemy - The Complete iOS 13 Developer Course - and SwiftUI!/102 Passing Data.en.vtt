00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.180
Hi within this lecture we are going to find a way so that when user taps one of the created art it displays

2
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.900
the details in the details we controller.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Right.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.250
So whenever a user chooses an art that he or she previously added We have to display the details.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.640
And there are two ways to do that actually we can create a new wave controller and we can display all

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.870
the details in that we have controller but also we can use these details we have controller as well.

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:43.230
All we have to do is just find a way to differentiate if user is trying to add a new art or he or she

8
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.030
is displaying an previously existing art.

9
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.830
So we are trying to figure out if the user clicked on the table view.

10
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.490
So if they click on the table view they're trying to display an existing recurred right.

11
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.400
Or if they clicked on the plus button if they click on the ad buttons.

12
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.980
So we have to come up with a way to differentiate between those.

13
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.740
So I'm going to come over my details view controller and I'm going to create a new variable like a chosen

14
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.090
painting or chosen art and it will be empty if they click on the ad buy them.

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
And if not if they click on the table view then it won't be empty.

16
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.510
And you know how to do that right.

17
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.500
We can just set selected painting empty.

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.430
If they click on the plus button and if they click on the table view then we're just going to take whatever

19
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.860
they click on and display on the next we have controller.

20
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:54.510
So we're going to use prepare for Segway really going to use this select item function as we did before.

21
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.720
But if they click on the plus button we just going to make Selected Item B equal to an empty streak.

22
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.570
So I'm going to call his chosen paintings and of course I'm going to create a chosen painting idea as

23
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.890
well.

24
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:18.450
And this will be a you you idea optional because I'm going to transfer the chosen painting I.D. because

25
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:27.600
I'm going to take chosen paintings details like name like yea like image from the Core Data using that

26
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.310
idea.

27
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.800
Of course we can't do that with name as well but it won't be efficient as I.D. because two paintings

28
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.080
can have the same name but two paintings cannot have the same I.D..

29
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.910
Okay.

30
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.440
And under we did load.

31
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.710
I'm going to just control if chosen painting is not empty and if it's not empty I'm going to retrieve

32
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.190
data from core data.

33
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.880
Else if it's empty.

34
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:03.600
Actually I do not need to do anything because it will be displayed as a default for me but for remembering

35
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.520
things for remembering how to proceed in the else you can just add something like name tags that text

36
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.680
is empty year text that text is empty.

37
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.870
This will be default in this way.

38
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.710
You don't have to do that but just for safety precautions I'm just going to do that as well.

39
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.370
Name tags.

40
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.790
That text is empty artist's text that text is empty.

41
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.400
And the year tags that text is empty.

42
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.900
So if chosen painting is empty.

43
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.300
This all will be empty as well because it means that we are going to create another entry in the car

44
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.890
data.

45
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:50.400
But if it's not it means that we have to retrieve data because we have chosen painting from the table

46
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.480
view.

47
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.690
So Reagan to do what we generally do when we try to pass data where you're going to create another variable

48
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.810
in here.

49
00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:59.510
OK.

50
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.330
Call the selected painting for example and selecting select painting I.D. and I.D. again will be a you

51
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.710
you I.D. optional.

52
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.260
And we're going to make the selected painting and selected painting I.D. equal to the index path of

53
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.300
the selected table we row.

54
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.060
OK.

55
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.380
And the reason I pass these information to you the details we see of course if you're going to use prepare

56
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.490
for Segway and did select item in order to achieve this.

57
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:39.090
So I'm coming on the bottom of this and just right prepared for Segway and did select row not d d select

58
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:49.110
but did select row so under that select row what I want to do I want to just do a Segway as usual because

59
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.090
eventually I will be landing on the details view.

60
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.790
Right.

61
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.450
So I'm going to say perform Segway and the identifier will be two details we see.

62
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:08.320
And the center well with nail biting here I have to make sure that under Add button clicked my selected

63
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.880
I.D. selected painting is actually empty.

64
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.080
So whenever a user clicks on the plus button it will send selected painting as an empty string.

65
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:29.020
And in here I'm going to make this equal to name array index path Doctorow and select ads painting I.D.

66
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.530
should be again getting from the idea array as well.

67
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:40.000
Remember we we are passing the data off the I.D. And in fact I'm just passing this named dates just

68
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.700
to check if name data is empty or not.

69
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.380
So I'm I'm going to be using I.D. in order to retrieve data from Core Data database.

70
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.420
So let's say selected painting I.D. I.D. array index path that's a row.

71
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.300
So this is now.

72
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.120
Okay.

73
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.140
All I have to do is just define the details we see as a variable here.

74
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.400
And remember in order to do that I'm just going to check if say grade that identifier is the same way

75
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.460
that I'm looking for.

76
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.300
So this is two details we see if indeed this is the Segway that I'm looking for.

77
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.740
I'm just gonna go ahead and create a destination we see variable so destination we see we'll be Segway.

78
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:34.690
That destination am going to first cast us as details we see and then later on I'm going to come over

79
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.070
here and do a comment B to synchronize everything and say destination we see Dot.

80
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.710
It will give me chosen painting.

81
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.010
And this will be equal to selected painting.

82
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:53.130
OK and destination we see Dot chosen painting I.D..

83
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.920
We'll be now equal to selected painting I.D..

84
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.390
So this is great.

85
00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.920
Right.

86
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:08.900
So I believe we managed to pass the information to the details we see and we knew how to do that.

87
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.410
That's not even different from the things that we have done in the previous sections.

88
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:23.140
So if we come over to details we see and if we get a chosen painting it means that we have to go to

89
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.130
correlate I retrieved those information.

90
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:35.140
I will use the same thing as we did in the view controller but now I will just filter the results with

91
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.320
the I.D..

92
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.970
With the help of the I.D..

93
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.550
OK.

94
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.410
So we're going to have to learn how to filter the results in the card data database because I'm just

95
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:53.080
going to get the image the name the year and the artist of one the record only one I.D. only I'm not

96
00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.830
can I just take all of the information from the database because it won't be efficient as much as we're

97
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.800
doing this.

98
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:10.000
So let me show you how to convert this chosen painting I.D. interest and if you say chosen painting

99
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.340
I.D. dot you you I.D. string it means that it's going to take your I.D. from here and convert it to

100
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.500
a string.

101
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:26.170
So for right now I'm just going to print out this string you you I.D. just to show you how does it look

102
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.520
like.

103
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.090
OK.

104
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:33.270
So so far we have been creating this new I.D. but we didn't use them.

105
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.940
So as you can see in the logs we see this.

106
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:44.200
So this is optional right now but it doesn't matter we can just come over here and put an exclamation

107
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.640
point here rather than question mark and it won't be optional.

108
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:54.550
So let me run this one more time and you don't have to do that by the way I'm just trying to show you

109
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.300
what does a new idea look like.

110
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:06.310
And it looks like this is you can see as I click four different items on the table view it displays

111
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.160
different values so they don't have the same values.

112
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.720
They have unique ideas.

113
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:21.980
And as far as I continue adding new information to my database they will all have unique ideas.

114
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.200
So we're going to you know use those ideas and we're going to get information from the database filtering

115
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.920
only these ideas.

116
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:36.490
And it will be much more efficient than just downloading or getting any information from the database

117
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:42.730
and having to find out what we're looking for in all of those information.

118
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.740
So let's do that in the next lecture.
