00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.090
Hi.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:08.220
We didn't this lecture we are going to see how to work with images inside of swift UI and in order to

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.770
do that.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.290
I'm going to create a new file so that we will have different files to work with different kinds of

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.290
views.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
So I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to choose swift UI view rather than cocoa touch glass

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.790
and swift file.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.910
Okay so make sure you choose the swift UI view ads I'm going to name the second view.

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.910
OK.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.400
And we're going to work inside of that view since we have our own preview.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
It won't matter which we we're looking at.

12
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.550
So if I make a change over here then I can just see it on inside my preview as well.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.190
And we got a crash so I believe this is kind of a buck.

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.680
So let me open it one more time and he'd resume to see the hallowed texts.

15
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.280
So when we create a new view we'd switch to iView.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:12.630
It will just create the preview as well so that we will have separate previews for our separate files

17
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.440
like this.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.510
OK.

19
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.020
So I'm going to work inside of that view and along with the images we're going to learn one of the hidden

20
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.780
features and a very powerful feature Ozzfest UI as well.

21
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.580
I'm going to show you what did this.

22
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.870
Don't worry I'm going to search for a metallic image as usual and I'm going to choose the first image

23
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.570
that we see and I'm going to download it.

24
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.890
OK.

25
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
So let me open my downloads and just named as a Metallica.

26
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.600
OK.

27
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.080
I'm going to bring this inside of our assets folder.

28
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.890
So here you go.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.640
Now we can come over here and rather than having this text I'm going to say image.

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.920
So this is a new view for us.

31
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
This is not a UI image or this is not an image view.

32
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.720
This is an image.

33
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.590
And this is actually a view that we use inside of swift UI as you can see there are a lot of ways to

34
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.480
create images like a name with a UI image with this image.

35
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.970
But I'm going to go for a name because we already have our image.

36
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.880
I'm going to call this Metallica.

37
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.850
OK.

38
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.910
If we say resume right now it will bring in the image that we have downloaded.

39
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.930
Here you go.

40
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.290
Now we see the image but as you can see this is kind of big for our screen.

41
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.100
So I want to read size it and I want to see the full image inside of my screen.

42
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.700
So how do I do that.

43
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.030
If you don't know what to do when it comes to image or any other view you can always check the inspection

44
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.920
menu if you cannot find anything in here you can go to documentation to see further usage.

45
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:12.090
For example in here we'll all we just see the frame and we just see the padding and we're not interested

46
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.620
in them but rather we're looking for something called Re sizable.

47
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.110
OK.

48
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.890
So this literally makes our imagery sizable.

49
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.640
If we don't do that whatever we do will not matter and it won't resize.

50
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.650
First of all I'm going to make this very sizable.

51
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.750
OK.

52
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.580
So when you do that it will resize the image in a way that it will fill up all the screen like this.

53
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.920
So if you're satisfied with this view then it's OK but I'm not because it's not looking good.

54
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.320
So I'm going to change the content the aspect ratio.

55
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.680
OK.

56
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:02.960
So remember we had fit we had fill in terms of aspect ratio in our regular UI image view as well.

57
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.990
Now I'm going to do that inside of our image and I'm going to call aspect ratio and it will ask me for

58
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.210
a content mode and the content mode that I'm looking for.

59
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:23.820
Is that fit rather than feel OK if you say fill it will fill up all the screen like this and I'm not

60
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.820
looking for that I'm going to go for fit and it looks good.

61
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.010
Now if I'm satisfied with this Don it's good to go.

62
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.960
But what if I want to have more specific size.

63
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.010
Like what if I want to have a margin from the left from the right or from top and bottom as well.

64
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.000
Of course we can try to do that with padding but it won't work in every scenario.

65
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.380
OK.

66
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:01.150
So I want to have a good frame I want to have a specific frame regarding to this so if you click on

67
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.280
this image you will see this frame.

68
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.670
The blue lies covering up of our image.

69
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.580
So this is exactly the same thing as we have seen in the text.

70
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.770
But if you say that frame you can actually change the frame you can actually contain your image inside

71
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.060
of a frame.

72
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.220
So it will ask you for an alignment and we don't need that so I'm going to delete this.

73
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.760
So rather I'm going to work with width and height.

74
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.790
For example let's give two hundred and two hundred.

75
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.040
It will just reframe this.

76
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.420
So here you go it created a frame in the size of two hundred to two hundred.

77
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.850
And now our image is contained inside of that frame.

78
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.610
Now if I make this 300 it will be a little bit bigger.

79
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.460
Let's go for three hundred and fifty and for height.

80
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.090
Two hundred and fifty.

81
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.010
So it's good.

82
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.540
It's what I wanted.

83
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.110
All right.

84
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:04.930
So this looks good but this won't look good on any other screen so I'm inside of iPhone X are right

85
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.570
now.

86
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:13.720
What if I want to run this app on iPhone as E or something smaller actually iPhone AC is a lot smaller

87
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.610
compared to iPhone X are.

88
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.200
So how do I get responsive screen sizes inside swift UI.

89
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.920
Yes there is a way to do that and you cannot find this in any other tutorial at least for right now

90
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.930
regarding swift UI.

91
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.250
But this is a great feature of Swift.

92
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.800
You did that.

93
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.090
This is one of the reasons that people will move to swift UI in the coming years.

94
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.870
So this goes like this.

95
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:53.200
You have to go for UI screen in with K. and this will give us this screen as you can see this is associated

96
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.150
with the hard way.

97
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.620
Hardware best base display.

98
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:03.020
OK if you say you ice cream that's Maine you will get the main screen.

99
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:11.810
And if you say dots bounce you will get the actual screen size invert why that whatever or whichever

100
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.520
ever phone you're working with.

101
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.520
So if you say that that you will get the current width of your phone.

102
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.320
So if you're on X are we going to get the width for X are if we are on as E where you're going to get

103
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:34.600
the width for S E and for example I can just multiply it by 0 point 8 to get this a 80 percent of the

104
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.270
current.

105
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.720
That's I can't do the same for height as well.

106
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.390
Right.

107
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.340
So come over here and say UI screen.

108
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:48.870
That's main dot bounce and dots bounce dots height.

109
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.720
And this time let's go for something like or point three.

110
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.310
So here you go.

111
00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:00.690
Now I have created this relative to the screen sizes so that's cool.

112
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:07.510
Now if I want to change this to iPhone AC for example if you come over here and choose one of the other

113
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:15.730
screen sizes it will try to change our layout to the whatever phone that we have chosen.

114
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.270
And here you go.

115
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:24.500
Now I'm inside of iPhone AC and it looks exactly the same as we have seen in the iPhone 6.

116
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.520
Ah now I am having some responsive design.

117
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.090
So this is cool.

118
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:39.940
So if I had these two hundred fifty two hundred fifty as static numbers over here then it wouldn't work

119
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.020
like this.

120
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:48.590
Now I'm seeing this inside of iPhone X are in the same proportions.

121
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.860
Now let's switch back.

122
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:56.500
Let's go for two hundred and fifty three hundred and fifty over here on two hundred and fifty over here.

123
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:05.020
So I will get the same in the iPhone X are about if I went back to iPhone as e you will see that this

124
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:05.940
won't work.

125
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:12.040
This won't even fit in the current screen because iPhone see is a lot smaller.

126
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:20.440
So we have to go like this UI screen that mean that bounce so that we will how the exact same look in

127
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:27.340
the iPhone X are and we will have the exact same look in the iPhone as e as well.

128
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:36.820
Previously developers chose to create their apps without means storyboards but inside of code like we

129
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:42.280
have seen in the layout in order to create this responsive screen sizes.

130
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:49.530
Now we can do that with swift UI as well and it's much better than ever before.

131
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.610
So that's one of the greatest power of so if you are.

132
00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:02.170
And let's stop here and within the next lecture regroup to see some other news like lists and sections

133
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.600
and so much more.
