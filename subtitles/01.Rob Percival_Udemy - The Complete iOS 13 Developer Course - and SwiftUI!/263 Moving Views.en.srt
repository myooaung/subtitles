00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,800
Hi within this lecture regrowing to see how we can make our spaceship more.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,670
And of course we are going to see the other animations as well.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:17,480
To sum up we're going to end the meta version spaceship and by using this we're going to learn how we

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,670
can animate anything that we create or that we bring in the augmented reality as well.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,620
In order to do that I'm going to show you a way and technique to work on.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,740
And later on when we create our own views it will make much more sense to you.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,320
But right now just try to understand that we're working with something called nodes and I'm going to

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,750
show you what a node is don't worry and we're trying to reach the nodes of the sea.

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:55,850
So I'm going to create a for loop and within this for loop I'm just going to say for node Ensign view

10
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,910
that scene.

11
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,040
OK so I'm getting this scene.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,310
And in this scene actually we have a root node and child notes.

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,890
So we want everything we want every node that is placed in this scene.

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,670
OK.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,650
In order to get that you can just call this root note.

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,540
So this is the root note of our scene.

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,030
And in order to get the child you have to say dot child notes.

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:31,460
OK so this will create a node variable and gets every nodes inside of the scene and assign them to be

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,560
our node variable.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:42,080
OK so let me do it like this child note we that capitalized N and I am talking about nodes all the time

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,600
but we haven't seen what our day.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,600
So let me write something like SVM node so we're working with CNN node objects.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,040
Actually you haven't seen it yet but you will see it now.

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,440
So if you write a S.A. you will see the object type.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:09,680
So this is an element that we use to represent a shape or represent a a represent a geometry or an lights

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,970
and so on.

27
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,110
In fact this shape isn't much by itself.

28
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,760
OK.

29
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:23,510
It just defines that our objects reveal be on the space coordinates where our objects will be displayed

30
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,100
in which shape they will be displayed.

31
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,410
And it gets the objects it gets the materials it gets the contents and it displays them inside of our

32
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,420
scene.

33
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,070
When we create our own objects you will much better understand this.

34
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,830
Okay.

35
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,870
So far right now know that we're working with views inside of our receipts.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,120
And if we run no doubt around action we can add an action to them.

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,610
So as you can see it asks us to create an ICN action and that's what we're going to do.

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,830
There are a lot of CNN actions but I'm going to show you the most common ones for example moving and

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,320
objects so I'm going to call this move ship and this will be an in action and a few say adapt and move

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,710
by.

41
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,330
It will ask you for an x y z coordinates.

42
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:27,530
So right now we're working with 3D so we don't have only one X and one Y but also we have Z the Z coordinate

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,250
as well.

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,170
And we need that duration here.

45
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,930
So x and x is the horizontal and by is the vertical or axis.

46
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,890
And as you know the Z is the third axis.

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,450
It's coming toward us or is going away from us.

48
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,050
For example in the z axis.

49
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:54,330
So for X I'm going to say zero but for y I'm going to say or point five.

50
00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,750
And in order to make up an object move further from us we have to say minus.

51
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:09,680
And if we want them to come closer to us we have to say 0 point 5 and a positive 0 point 5 for example

52
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,190
or a positive one.

53
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,160
I don't know when the metric over here is in meters.

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,520
OK.

55
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,280
So don't go crazy over here like a 10 or 20 because it will move the object in meters.

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,390
So let me run this on my phone so we can see how it goes and pay attention because we will only see

57
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,100
for like a second.

58
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,600
OK.

59
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,080
So as you can see it opened up and it moved towards me and it moved up a little bit.

60
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,550
So like 500 centimeters I believe.

61
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,990
So let me go back and change the numbers.

62
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,950
Maybe we can't see it better because it's moving toward us right now.

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:59,150
I'm just going to give in that give you the x axis as well and I'm going to make this move away from

64
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,460
us by making this minus so let me run this one more time and be very we're going to see it for a second

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,590
only.

66
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
OK so here you go.

67
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,970
It's moved a little bit up a little bit right and a little bit further from us.

68
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,350
Now I believe you.

69
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:24,480
You managed to say it but this doesn't make sense really just to move it for one seconds.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,200
Like a health meter.

71
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,090
OK.

72
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,030
So what if I want to do it repetitively continuously.

73
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,760
Is there a way to do that.

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,410
Of course there is a way to do that.

75
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,450
We can call a repeat of the action and we can just repeat whatever we want.

76
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,750
So I'm going to call this repeats forever.

77
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,920
OK.

78
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,920
And this will be an ASEAN action and ASEAN action that repeats forever.

79
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,150
So this will ask us to give an action to repeats forever.

80
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm going to say move ship and rather they're running more ship.

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,530
I'm going to round the repeat forever over here.

82
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,980
So this will repeat this moving ship action forever.

83
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:14,230
So let me run this and you will see what I mean inside of my phone.

84
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,970
So let me run my phone.

85
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:23,340
Let me come over here and you will see it's moving and it will move away continuously as you can see.

86
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,470
Now it's almost leaving my sight.

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,040
So it's kind of cool right.

88
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,320
And that's not it.

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,700
Actually we can see other actions we can add other actions as well and even we can make a loop out of

90
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,290
those actions.

91
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,350
So let me show you fade in and fade out actions because that that these are common too.

92
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,290
So let's start with fade out.

93
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,320
So this will be ASEAN action.

94
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,360
Dot fade opacity.

95
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,910
OK.

96
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,160
So we have two or passes over here one is two and one is by.

97
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,010
So by is relative value.

98
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,710
And two is we just give the value.

99
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,510
So I'm going to go with two and I'm going to make it all point five.

100
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:18,430
So this will make this transparent like 50 percent and I'm going to call this fade in and make it 100

101
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,850
per percent.

102
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,040
One more time.

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:29,170
So this will fade out this ship and this will fade the ship in and I'm going to make a loop out of this

104
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,640
tree actions.

105
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,550
OK.

106
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,840
It's called a sequence in here.

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,100
So I'm going to call the sequence.

108
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,570
OK.

109
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:45,460
And let me say sequence and this will be an AC an action one more time.

110
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,420
But rather than repeat forever I'm just going to say sequence this time.

111
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,890
And this will ask me to give an array and within this area I will have the moon ship fade out and fade

112
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:04,750
in and this time rather than repeating the moves ship I'm just going to repeat this sequence.

113
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,150
And over here I will run the repeat forever action.

114
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,950
So when I run this on my phone you will see my ship moving.

115
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,610
But again with fading in and fading out.

116
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,370
So this will be cool.

117
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,290
Pay attention to here and here you go.

118
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:27,260
My ship is moving and fading in and fading out.

119
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,630
So this is cool right.

120
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,960
We now see the ship in our living room fading in fading out flying out.

121
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,520
So I believe that's good.

122
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,900
And my dog is still sitting over there.

123
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,850
So here we go.

124
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:50,050
Now we know how to move around the objects inside of our augmented reality projects.

125
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:57,760
And I believe it's now time to see how we can bring in the own objects like bringing our own views use

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,090
our own textures to create what we want.

127
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,590
And eventually we want to create an application in which we can display some Galaxy's some planets like

128
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,130
Mars or convenience or like Earth.

129
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,860
So let's do that within the next lecture.
