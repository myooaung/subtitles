00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,070
Hi.

2
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,090
We didn't this lecture we're going to finalize our app by testing to add some new places.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,270
So let me open my app and let me click on James restaurant and I can get this map and I can get whatever

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,370
I want so it works fine.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,810
So let me create another place and let's see if that works as well.

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:31,740
So let me call this Kirk pub and this will be a pub and for the atmosphere you can just call whatever

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,850
you want.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,260
OK I'm going to choose an image up here next.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,410
Let's go for a red light district this time and select one of the places over here.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,740
So this will be our Kirk pop location.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:52,170
And once I do that I can see the notation and once I hit the save.

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,770
Yep.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,420
Now I see the Kirk pump the problem over here is that we lost in navigation bar and again we have lost

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,440
it before.

15
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,930
And I said that yep we going to take care of this problem later on and we see those maps over here.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,820
But I believe this is the Maps app that we have opened before.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,070
Yep.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,920
This one.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,780
So this isn't related to overturn.

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,860
Problem actually.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,560
So let me go back.

22
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:21,780
Yeah.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,700
The current problem is that we don't have the navigation bar and it's related to say where's we're going

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,150
to take care of that in a minute.

25
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,890
Once I hit the James Shore restaurant and once I hit the Kirk pub it's opens but it opens as a pop over.

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,960
So again it's a related to say grace.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,220
So we have to take care of this problem right.

28
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:52,350
But the good thing is that Kirk pub is displaying its values so everything related to parse operations

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,750
actually work.

30
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,820
So how do we take care of that.

31
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,210
Let me close this down and go to main story board.

32
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,340
Let's find our lost Segway.

33
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:12,990
We're doing this Segway from our maps we have controller to our table view to our places we have controller

34
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,780
what we want to do actually is to make this segway to our navigation controller rather than table view

35
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,170
because navigation controller will display the places we controller anyway.

36
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:37,020
But what we are doing here to skip the navigation controller and just go directly to the places we controller.

37
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:46,300
So it actually doesn't understand that's places we have controller has one navigation controller.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,460
So in order to solve this problem I'm going to copy this Segway identifier from here.

39
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm going to delete the Segway by clicking over here and clicking on the backspace or delete in my keyboard

40
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,980
and I'm going to take this from map we see and bring it to my navigation controller.

41
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,480
If I do a show Segway it will distort all the views one more time.

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,330
So rather than doing a show let's come over here and do a present model and we going to go for a full

43
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:28,110
screen and for identifier I'm going to paste in what I have copied previously.

44
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,930
So now I'm doing my Segway to navigation controller so that navigation bar will be still in place even

45
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,970
though we add on the place and come back to our places we have controller.

46
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,710
So let's test this as well.

47
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,490
Let's go to.

48
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,210
As you can see it works out fine right now.

49
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:57,630
Let's go to add a new place and let's add LA's diner and this will be a diner and the atmosphere is

50
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,890
kind of a friendly atmosphere and let's go for our photo library and choose one of the pictures that

51
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,920
we have downloaded and let's go to choose a location within our Amsterdam map.

52
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,290
So let's zoom in.

53
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:13,540
Yep.

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,870
This one looks good.

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,400
And off to you press for three seconds hit save.

56
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,000
And the moment of truth.

57
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,480
Here you go we see the last diner we see the Kirk pub at the James restaurant and we see it's in and

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,760
navigation controller so that we can come over here and go back and it works as they as in the way we

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,890
want.

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,520
So I hope you enjoyed this section.

61
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,600
I believe this is working very fine.

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,860
And I believe you can do much more better using power servers.

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:55,050
So you have seen far your base you have seen pars now you're capable of building apps using cloud servers

64
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:01,640
and you can do much more than you would imagine when you first started this course.

65
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,700
So let's stop here and continue within the next section.
