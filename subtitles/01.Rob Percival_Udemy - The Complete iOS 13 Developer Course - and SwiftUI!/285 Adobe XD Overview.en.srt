00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,310
Hi.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,930
We didn't this lecture we're going to create our first project on.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,780
They'll be the envy you're going to see the overview of the next two legs.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,670
So as you can see we're not presented with some predefined sketches like predefined layouts for our

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,240
project.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,580
For example we can't see the iPhone acts we can see the eye pad and so much more.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,970
And it doesn't even matter what we choose over here because we can't change it afterwards.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,550
It's called something like art board and we're going to see what an art board is and how to change it

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,280
as well.

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,290
Don't worry so if you see something else over here like an iPhone access Max or other iPhone access

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,490
it's really super cool to just go along with something because later on when you choose one of them

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,550
you will see how you can change it easily afterwards and you can even create your custom size.

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,100
You can just specify some dimensions like 300 to 300 because you will get to change it afterwards as

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,430
well.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,370
So I'm going to double click on this iPhone X and as you can see it creates me the project.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,460
And now we are inside of our Adobe Steve.

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,850
So here very we do the design.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,920
Okay so we do design in this little blank box over here and it's called an art bought.

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,170
So if we click on some things we will see these Inspector her right hand sides on the right hand side.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,870
So it's called the property inspector like in X code actually.

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:45,330
So it's almost the same and we click over an object we see its properties on the right hand side for

22
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,500
example we can see the width we can see the height and other attributes over here.

23
00:01:51,930 --> 00:02:00,210
And if we had any other view if we click on them we will see the related attributes related properties

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,330
on the right hand side as well as you can see I can't change the within height as I want.

25
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:13,690
So it doesn't make sense to choose anything in here when we create the project.

26
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,400
In fact it makes sense to choose something but it doesn't matter because we get to change it like this

27
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,600
easily so we can make this bigger we can make the smaller we can create another template for another

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,790
phone we can do whatever we want.

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,340
We are completely free over here.

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,290
OK.

31
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,650
And on the left hand side we see some views that we can bring in like a rectangle like an ellipse or

32
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,580
like an art board.

33
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,960
So we're going to see a we have one of them one by one in the section.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,990
Okay we're going to test them all.

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,790
And over here we have an extra menu as you can see and it's called plug ins for me if you come over

36
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,140
here to view.

37
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,740
If you don't see the plug ins like this you can open this menu up and you can change it to assets or

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,220
layers.

39
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,230
We're going to use layers most of the time because we can see different views different objects inside

40
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,380
of our outboard or inside of our haste boards.

41
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,090
OK.

42
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:30,750
So this gray area is actually called pasteboard so we can create views inside of place where we can

43
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,120
create views inside of an art part.

44
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,240
So pasteboard is actually infinite.

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,010
You can have as many as art boards or as many as views inside the inside of this pasteboard.

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,240
So why do we even need an art board.

47
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,910
Right.

48
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,830
So it's actually to see better when we deal with a frame like this.

49
00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:01,110
So we're if we're trying to design something for iPhone X. Now it's very good idea to use iPhone X as

50
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,940
a frame.

51
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,120
If you come over here to this prototype section you can see we can create some prototypes like this.

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,780
So if we have more than one art person we can connect them together like as if we have been creating

53
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,210
say grace.

54
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,970
Okay.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,560
And we can actually play this in a simulator like view so that we can see how it looks like on a real

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,900
life form and we can't if we were designers already fever aiming to be and UI UX people then we can

57
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,850
just create these prototypes and we can just passes along to the developers to say yeah I have created

58
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,350
this design for you.

59
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,600
Can you just implement this on your code on your app.

60
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:55,800
And we're not going to be using prototypes very much in this section in this course because this is

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,630
not a UI UX course.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,880
It's just to get you a long to create basic visual basic images in your own apps.

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,350
So if you hit this play button over here then you get the simulator like V where you can actually play

64
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,800
the prototype by yourself so we have our menu as you can see.

65
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,170
Are we going to see the different menus different options that we have over here.

66
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,250
And I believe that's it for over real.

67
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,580
So let's stop here within the next like you're going to start inspecting these views one by one.
