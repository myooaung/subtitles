00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,170
Hi.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,500
We did this lecture re going to go ahead and find ourselves some landmark images and landmark themes

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,990
from Google.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,230
So that's kind of boring but I don't like to give you a ready dataset because if you were building your

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:25,820
real app on your own you would just go disk tabs by and one by one you will have to google it yourself.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
You will have to find the images and descriptions maybe yourself.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,280
So we're going to go over this in this lecture.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,330
So let me search for coalesce Hume and I misspelled it obviously.

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,210
So this is called less Hume and I'm going to download this image.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,280
OK.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,580
And maybe we can go for Great Wall of China.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,490
OK you can choose your own landmarks obviously and you can even find a whole other concept like this

13
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,120
on your own.

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,440
But I'm going to go back to landmarks.

15
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,420
So let's go for Kremlin and this is obviously not Kremlin.

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,050
This is a Cancer Journal so let's go for that image.

17
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,480
Yep.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,910
This is Kremlin.

19
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:21,540
So I'm going to save this to my downvote and then let's go for another like Taj Mahal.

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,660
OK.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,280
Let's find Taj Mahal his picture.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:33,200
So just choose a suitable one and download it to your folder and let's find a final one.

23
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:42,320
I'm going to go for Stonehenge okay and choose one of these and save it to your downloads.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Of course we can go for more.

25
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,580
But I believe that's enough for now because we're just building this app for an example.

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,410
So I'm going to close these down.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,230
OK.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm really going to take these pictures take these images and actually rename them.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,130
So this is great.

30
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,230
Well OK.

31
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,640
So this is great hold up JP.

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,420
So this is called assume and this is Kremlin.

33
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,850
OK.

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,330
And let's see this one these Taj Mahal and this is Stonehenge and that's all.

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:28,560
So let's open the assets folder and let's bring in those images so you can drag and drop to here or

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,310
else you can drag and drop these pictures drug and drag and drop these images to here as well as we

37
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,860
have seen before.

38
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,530
So choose your way.

39
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,700
It doesn't bother you but just make sure that you have to select these at two targets and you have to

40
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,650
select the copy items if needed.

41
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,750
So they will be actually copied to your folder.

42
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,110
Ok.

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,440
So as you can see now they're inside of my project.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,760
So we can reach them in our image views as well but I'm not going to go for image views right now because

45
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,840
we will work with table view first and then we're going to pass this information to another view in

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,690
which we can display the image and the name of the selected landmark.

47
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:26,580
So I'm going to create an array in fact I'm going to create two areas in which I'm going to search the

48
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,870
names of this landmarks and then store the images of these landmarks as well.

49
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,090
So we're going to go for your eye image as we did before.

50
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,880
And as you can see if we say Stonehenge for example we can just reach the Stonehenge UI image right

51
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,820
button.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,740
Right now I'm going to store those values inside of an array so it can be done right.

53
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,290
We can just show these values like we store Strings.

54
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,050
So let's go for Landmark names first.

55
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,840
So I'm going to initialize this as an empty string array so this array consist of strings.

56
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,370
But this will not be initialized.

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,400
So we have an empty array right now.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,650
So if I say landmark names that append I can append the new name to here.

59
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:28,230
Of course we could have just save our landmark names and just added all the names like we did in the

60
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,920
previous lectures.

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,240
However I'm going to go for appending here so that we can see the order that we are storing these values

62
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,670
and I'm going to explain why later on.

63
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:45,330
So call assume grateful Kremlin and then we have Stonehenge.

64
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,140
OK.

65
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,760
Do we have any missing.

66
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,940
Yeah I believe so we have Taj Mahal as well.

67
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,240
Right.

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,460
So let's say Taj Mahal.

69
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,810
So after that I'm going to create a landmark images array as well in which I will sir do you I image.

70
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:11,220
So I had to do that in the exact same order because I'm going to use the indexes.

71
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,860
OK.

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,610
I'm going to explain in a minute.

73
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:24,370
So let me say this landmark images will have this UI image type and this will be an empty array initially

74
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,030
and then I'm going to append everything like we did in the strings.

75
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,470
So let's go for Landmark images and as you can see this will consist UI image.

76
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,530
OK.

77
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,320
And as a new element it asks for a UI image.

78
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,030
And I will just give a UI image names OK coalesce Hume.

79
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,060
So I'm going to just follow the same order in here like I said before.

80
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,680
So let me check this is name.

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,030
Yeah.

82
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,260
This is Coliseum.

83
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,840
So it will ask me to first unwrapped is or do provide the default value.

84
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:11,470
I can force unwrap this as long as I am sure that coliseum that JP is added in my project folders.

85
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,510
OK if not it can be nil and it can crash my app.

86
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,310
And when you do that without the SARS folder I believe we have to add this JP extension as well so that

87
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,290
it will understand the exact file that we are talking about.

88
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,540
So this is great wall JP Kremlin JPM.

89
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,840
OK.

90
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,110
So the next Stonehenge and for the last one we going to go for Taj Mahal.

91
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,420
So why do we follow the same order.

92
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:53,530
Because we're going to work with indexes for example if we click on the Colosseum I'm going to say we're

93
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:01,390
going to get landmark names zero landmark names first of the month and this will be in sync with each

94
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,840
other.

95
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,080
OK so this is great wall to grateful Kremlin to Kremlin's Stonehenge to Stonehenge.

96
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,650
So if I have an index like zero I can come over here two landmark names and put zero in here.

97
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:24,700
It will give me the name of Colosseum and if I say landmark images 0 it will also give me the image

98
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,740
of Colosseum as well.

99
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,720
So it is vital that we follow the same order.

100
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,700
Then we add these valleys.

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:41,350
So that's why I have used the pens in order to make clear that I'm following the same order when I'm

102
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,790
adding these values into my race.

103
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,380
So that's it for right now we're going to stop here and within the next century going to see how we

104
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,650
can display those values in our table.
