00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,250
Hi within this lecture we we're going to see a new concept called guards left.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,510
So far we have been working with if left to manage the optional zone side of swift.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,410
But we're going to see guard let this time and it's very similar to if left.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,940
But there are some differences in syntax and there are some differences in implementation as well.

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:31,910
So what are the differences and why do we use guard led or why do we use if let in some certain cases.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,120
So this is not an official way to teach these or this is not an official way to tell about guard led.

7
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,610
But I'd like to remember it like this.

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:49,560
So if I'm certain that this is going to work and there is no other way to make this work and if I'm

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:57,930
confident that I should guard this I should have these value then I use guard let and it's kind of a

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,410
negative thing.

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,280
So it asks me what will happen if that doesn't work first.

12
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,510
And then if let it's kind of positive we're not very certain that if does this will work or not but

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,020
in guard lad we are certain that this will work.

14
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,330
So let me create a string and you will know what I mean.

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,810
So let's suppose that my string is five OK but this is a string and I'm going to convert this to be

16
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,960
an integer and apparently I have used my string before up here we have used my string.

17
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,000
So we have to change this to something else.

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,660
As you can see your re declaring it.

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,990
So let's call this my number.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,710
But this is a string okay not an integer.

21
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,470
Every going to convert this to be an integer using that function.

22
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,250
So I'm going to do this with guard led and if let's.

23
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,550
And you will see the differences.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,690
So first of all I'm going to convert this with guard light and it will ask me for a string input and

25
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,090
give me an integer.

26
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,830
OK.

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,830
As an output.

28
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,820
And we're going to use.

29
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,410
Guard let led in here.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,610
And of course we don't know how to use guard left yet but we know how to use it if let's.

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,190
Right.

32
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:25,590
So let me write another function called convert to integer if and this will again ask me for a string

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,750
input OK.

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,670
And this will be a string and this will again give me an integer and we can just say if let's.

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,750
My integer is in parentheses my number or string input sorry String input.

36
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,590
OK.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,650
Because we're we're going to take this by number as a String input and if that's the case if we can

38
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,450
make this then I'm going to return my integer.

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,890
Right.

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,410
And else if that doesn't work I'm going to return 0.

41
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,970
So that's how we do it with.

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:04,860
If let's.

43
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,620
So let's try to write the same thing with guard let's.

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:20,040
So if I say guard let over here I can again say my integer is in parentheses String input but this time

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,290
not string interpolation.

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
Yep this is String input.

47
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,700
But this time I cannot even do that because that's the that's not the proper rate to use God let you

48
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:42,690
have to say else before you open the curly braces and this is asking for you what will happen if this

49
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,980
doesn't work in this if that case it asks me what will happen if it works.

50
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:56,310
So in guard let it's kind of negative as you can see it's certain that this is going to work and it's

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,270
asking you for a first thing to do if this doesn't work what will happen.

52
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,280
So you can come over here as a return zero.

53
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,380
Right.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,530
And else you can just return my integer over here.

55
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,310
You can't just say you returned my teacher and as you can see in under this function we are certain

56
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,690
that this is going to Virg and we are providing a valley.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,610
This is if this doesn't work.

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,620
So we're really guarding it.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,960
OK.

60
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,550
So this is negative and confidence.

61
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:39,360
And if that is not that confident and it's kind of positive attitude.

62
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,460
So again this positive a negative think actually is for you to remember this is not an official documentation

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,310
or official way to teach you.

64
00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:00,540
But I believe this will make you a good way to remember this by so that you will know when to use which.

65
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,720
Well let's try both of them right.

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:11,730
So let's print out convert to integer if and again for String input we get to give my number and in

67
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,870
here we're going to call convert to integer guard.

68
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,290
And this time we're going to give my number again.

69
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,100
So let me try to run this and we will get the same result.

70
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,430
Right.

71
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:32,910
Like 5 5 because both functions are doing the same thing and instead of five if I write Apple the both

72
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,520
functions will return me they're zero.

73
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,520
So guard lad and if that eventually brings me the same result.

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,160
But there are some differences then we implement them.

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,230
So I hope you enjoyed the advance with sections so far.

76
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,590
Where are you going to stop here and continue within the next section.
