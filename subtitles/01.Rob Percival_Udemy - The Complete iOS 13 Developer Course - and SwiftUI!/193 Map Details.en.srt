00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:08,070
Hi within the lecture we going to add the function that is necessary to zoom into the chosen location

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,840
in our details we controller.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,810
So far we're getting all the data that we need from parts and we are showing the details to the user.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,460
But right now even though we have this chosen latitude and longitude.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,380
We didn't go into the maps and just zoom into that led to to the longitude.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,600
So after we get this latitude and longitude we may continue to do that under this function.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,340
Right.

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,310
Because we cannot do that under the load actually let's try to do that on the we did load on you will

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,810
see why we cannot do that on there we did load.

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:55,640
We had to do that in here because this query actually works I think erroneously so that when we tried

11
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:03,870
to do something under we did load maybe we won't have that data so what do I mean.

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:13,560
For example after having this get data from past executed let's try to are called this chosen latitude

13
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,860
and longitude and this tried to print them.

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,940
So even though we call this get data from pass and even the even after we print this we still get this

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,460
as zero point zero the initial value of this chosen latitude.

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,260
Why is this happening.

17
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:43,260
Because this works as synchro Knisley and even though we just called this after we execute this since

18
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,760
it's not being sync erroneously it won't print out.

19
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:56,850
So if I print out in here OK after we get this done this will be called in order.

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,660
And after we get this long it's done we can display it in the logs as you can see.

21
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Now we have the right parameter.

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,840
So when you try to work with asynchronous functions if you do something if you want to do something

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,550
with order then you have to do this inside of your asynchronous function as well.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,870
Joe I'm going to do this over here.

25
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,510
So these are all four object operations.

26
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,020
OK.

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Objects and I'm going to continue my maps operations under the same function as up.

28
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:41,460
So I'm going to create a location and this will be a square location coordinate to D and this will ask

29
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,210
me for a latitude and longitude.

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,730
So let's try to get SDR chosen latitude and south that chosen longitude.

31
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,180
Yep.

32
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,520
So this is good.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,180
And let's try to create a span.

34
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:07,620
Again we're going to use the M K M.K. Cardinals spend on K coordinates span and this will ask us for

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:16,580
a latitude Delta and latitude Delta will be all point all three five and longitude will be all points

36
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,760
all three five.

37
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,560
And I'm going to create an M K coordinate region.

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,270
So this will ask me for a center and the span and center will be location spun will be spent and then

39
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:37,730
I can call my map view okay details map for you not image view details map view.

40
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,240
Now I can just say details map view dot sat region.

41
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,660
And I'm going to focus on that region with that animation so far so good.

42
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,890
Let's try this.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,880
Let's see if we can see these chosen locations zoomed in.

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,550
If we can then we're going to have to add an annotation as well.

45
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,320
Here you go it zooms in the Amsterdam so it's working.

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,720
So we have to show the exact selected location without a rotation as well of course.

47
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,230
So let me create my own rotation.

48
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:21,120
So this will be M.K. point out rotation and this will be actually we have to give some coordinates.

49
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,620
So a rotation that coordinate is the location that we have just created.

50
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,500
Right.

51
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,040
And if we want we can give some title and subtitle as well.

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,960
We already have our title and subtitle over here.

53
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,680
Right.

54
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:45,920
And we assigned it to be our details name label so we can come over here and say a notation that's cardinals.

55
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,420
Yeah I believe I have deleted something.

56
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:58,200
So this will be a location and a notation that title will be details self-taught place details.

57
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,690
No this not this one details.

58
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,040
Name label I believe.

59
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,850
Details namely will that text.

60
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,210
Yep.

61
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
This one.

62
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:15,150
And we can have a subtitle as well a notation that subtitle is going to be solved that details type

63
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,130
labeled up text.

64
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,730
And finally we can add this annotation to our map.

65
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,050
You say s stop detailed map view dot ad rotation.

66
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,070
OK.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,420
And give this annotation.

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,740
Here you go.

69
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:39,580
Now let's Chesters and see if we can get D James restaurant pins in on our map.

70
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,350
Let's click on this.

71
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,130
Here you go.

72
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,430
Now we see the James first round.

73
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,410
Let me click over here to zoom in.

74
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:55,020
If I just hit over here we will see the title and the subtitle as we want.

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,910
So only thing left to do to finish our app is to add navigation by then over here.

76
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,100
Remember we have something called Disclosure by them and that's what we were going to add in the next

77
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:14,080
lecture to open our maps and do some navigation from our current location to the selected place.
