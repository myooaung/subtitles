00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,210
By within the section we're going to focus on maps.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,370
We're going to see how we can integrate maps into our maps and how we can leverage maps functions like

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,840
finding the user location showing the user's location on a map and choosing a location on the map to

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,360
get its coordinates.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,270
And in order to do that we are going to be focusing on an app called travel book Where are you going

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:34,440
to integrate core data in this table book as well so that we can read practice what we have learned

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,770
in the previous section.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,260
Now if you're ready let's get started.
