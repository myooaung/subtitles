Hi within this lecture we are going to add a delete functionality in our table to use as well.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,220
So maybe you have come across apps that let you swipe left and delete the current data in the table

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,480
view.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,470
So that's what we're going to learn within this lecture.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:26,010
So remember we have assigned this to be a UI table view delegate so we can reach some functions related

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,560
to this UI table to use and editing style committee editing style is one of them.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:40,470
So choose this commit editing style function and we're going to define an editing style in here and

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,330
we're going to say what to do when this happens in order to do that.

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,050
We're going to control is editing style over here so I'm going to say if editing style and as you can

10
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,980
see is a UI table view editing style.

11
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,060
Okay.

12
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:04,380
And we have some different kinds of editing styles actually if you say double eagle and hit dot you

13
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,930
can see delete insert or none.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,530
So he searches for inserting some new data.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,820
OK so this indicates a green circle on the right hand side but we're not going to go for that we just

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,950
want to learn how to delete it.

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,480
OK.

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,500
So this is kind of red when we swipe left.

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:34,920
OK so I'm going to go for if editing style is actually delete then I'm going to go and remove that relate

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,440
to the row from our chair and we'll.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,980
And how do we do that since we can do landmark names data paint or landmark images that append we can

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,350
do the opposite as well.

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,850
We can say landmark names that's removed and we can remove data from an array using that method.

24
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:04,100
So if you go over here and say landmark names that remove it will ask you for an integer and this integer

25
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,890
actually specifies the index that we want to remove the value from.

26
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,120
So for example if I want to remove the Colosseum I can just say remove at zero.

27
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,940
OK.

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,940
And how can I get this index off course I can say index path that throw because this is given to me

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:33,000
in the function and I'm going to do that for Landmark images as well not to break the synchronization

30
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,040
of these two landmark names and landmark images arrays.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:45,090
So that's how you delete the values from arrays but also we have to delete them from the table view

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,580
itself as vote.

33
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:55,500
So if you say table view we you can just go for table view dots delete two rows into will ask you Which

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,910
row to delete.

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,330
Right.

36
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:05,310
So we have the index path so it's it's asking for an index path and we have this here.

37
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,990
So if you just see the enter you can delete this and you can replace it with index path.

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,400
So this is the small one that is given us within the function.

39
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,480
And it says that do we do with animation.

40
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,340
OK.

41
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,410
So you can hit enter to hit dot and you can say Yeah why not.

42
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,130
You can do that fate.

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,940
So it will delete the row with an animation of fading.

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:41,970
So that's Oh I believe we can try this right now so let's open our app and let's swipe left a little

45
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,850
bit and as you can see we can delete all these values any time we want.

46
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:56,490
So it's reverse and if we just run this one more time of course we're going to see all the values and

47
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:03,780
it doesn't make sense to have this delete functional Tina app like this because we don't start those

48
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:12,540
values in at database we just write them in our code if we virtues store those values in a cloud database

49
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,520
which we will in the following sections by the way then it will make much more sense because we could

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,940
have deleted them the cloud file your base our cloud database as well.

51
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,330
But right now we know how to make this functionality.

52
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:37,050
So in the feature if we are working with that cloud database we can delete them from the arrays we can

53
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:43,800
delete them from the table view and we can delete them from the database as well and they won't be back.

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,460
So this is very useful to using your apps.

55
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,750
So going to stop here and we're going to continue making this clickable in the next lecture.
