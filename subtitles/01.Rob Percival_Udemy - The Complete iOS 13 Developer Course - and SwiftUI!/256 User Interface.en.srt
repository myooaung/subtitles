00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,520
Hi within this lecture regrouping to create our user interface in order to have our image recognition

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,510
app.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:19,470
So let's go over here and select single view app and I'm going to called is machine learning image recognition.

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,660
OK so this is kind of a long name but it's self explanatory I believe.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,250
So here.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,400
Next on here.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,960
And try to choose the folder that you always choose to create your first project of nation learning.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,800
So here you go.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,100
Let me put this into a full screen.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,810
OK.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,060
So let me make this like that so that we can see it clearly.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,990
And we're going to start by creating our user interface and it's going to be fairly easy.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,500
It's going to be fairly simple.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:02,720
All I want to do is just an image view to display the image that the user has chosen.

15
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,180
OK so that we can see what the chosen image is in here.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,630
And then we're going to have a label just below just under it is Image view.

17
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,090
OK.

18
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,890
And this will display the results of our process.

19
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,230
So this is going to be something like yep this is a monkey.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,890
OK.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,670
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,290
OK.

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,580
And let me make it central.

24
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,080
And the next thing I'm going to bring in above them.

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,520
So I'm going to change the image or select the image by using this button rather than the UI Image view

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,040
that we have done before.

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,820
OK.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,970
Because it can be complicated.

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:02:01,840
In this case to click on this UI Image view to select an image because we want user to clearly understand

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,710
they can change the picture by clicking on this button as well.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,020
So that's all we want for user interface in this app.

32
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,000
So let me raise reset this suggests its constraints.

33
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,800
OK.

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,060
I want to give this a fixed width and height constraint as well.

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,780
And once I do that I believe this is kind of distorted.

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,460
So let me bring this in turn.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,190
Better looking straight on say update constraint constants.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,570
Yep.

39
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,800
Here we go.

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,190
Now I have this label issue.

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,520
Let me select all of this and bring them into the center one more time.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:45,980
OK.

43
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:53,090
That I can't say update constraint constants and in fact let me try to make this a little bit bigger.

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,330
OK.

45
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,880
I say update constraint constants one more time.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,210
Maybe we can make this a little bit bigger as well because we don't know what we're getting as a result

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:05,910
right now.

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,550
So it can be a little bit longer than this.

49
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,610
So let me say update constraint constants one more time.

50
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,480
And here we go.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,310
So now we're ready to bring all of these views in our view controller.

52
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,940
So let me drag and drop this image view.

53
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,340
OK.

54
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,900
So this is going to be an image view.

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,820
And this is going to be my result label.

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,260
OK so let me called as a result label.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,360
And in here I'm going to bring this as an action.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,240
And I'm going to say change button clicked or change clicked.

59
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,560
Yes.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,250
This is good.

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,590
So now we're done over here.

62
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,900
You can just delete this label because we don't want anything in here.

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,670
Maybe you can just say something like SELECT image.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,030
OK.

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,990
And in the change clicked I'm going to write my function.

66
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:15,200
So first of all I want to choose a picture form from the gallery from the photo library of the user.

67
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,370
So you know how this goes right.

68
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,780
We create a picture.

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,310
So this is going to be a UI image picker controller.

70
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,400
Then we are going to have to make this delegate to self.

71
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,930
And once we do that it will give us an error because we can.

72
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,680
We have to come up over here and say this we've controller is in fact a UI image picker controller delegate

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,150
and also a UI navigation controller delegate as well.

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,190
Once we do that the error just will go away.

75
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,160
And remember you can just select if the speaker will allow editing or not I'm not going to do that because

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,980
I don't want to allow other things.

77
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,770
I just want the original picture in this case.

78
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:11,630
So what I'm going to do I'm going to select the source type of the speaker and this is going to be the

79
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,010
photo library.

80
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,350
OK.

81
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,300
And then later on I'm going to present this.

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,370
So let me just say present and choose speaker and the animators will be true the completion will be

83
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,640
nil.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,950
So the next thing to do is actually specify what's going to happen once the user chooses an image out

85
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,750
of photo library.

86
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,140
Remember how we do that we have to write did finish launching with options.

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,060
So this is what we looking for.

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,300
I remembered this gives us a dictionary in which we can get the original image.

89
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,480
So in order to do that we are going to call the Image view.

90
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:00,490
OK we're going to say Image view that image and this will get its data from the info dictionary with

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:10,250
original image key and we're going to cast this as a UI image and then we're going to display this dismissed

92
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:16,320
as actually in order to display the V controller so soft that this was animated.

93
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:25,940
Of course true and completion will be nailed and we're not done yet here actually after the user chooses

94
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:34,870
this picture we want to call the function to recognize this image and we're going to call this function

95
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,180
in here so that user will see what the picture contains once they choose is it.

96
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,770
And of course we don't have that yet.

97
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,200
We don't have that function yet.

98
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:55,550
And remember you can just come over here team for that list and just give it that photo library usage

99
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,020
description if you want but I'm not going to do that.

100
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,640
I'm just gonna test this on my simulator as you can see if I choose any picture here and let me see

101
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,740
if I choose one more time it will display on my Image view.

102
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,900
So that's it for our user interface.

103
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,470
So we're going to stop here and we're going to bring in the model in the next lecture.
