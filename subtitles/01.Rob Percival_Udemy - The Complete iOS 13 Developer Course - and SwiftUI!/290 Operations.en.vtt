00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.380
Hi within this section we going to see some really cool operations in order to do that.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.330
I'm going to delete everything OK.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:18.840
So I'm going to start with a fresh new art port so I'm going to have to use over here one the rectangle.

4
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.140
OK so let me give some color to rectangles so that we can see better.

5
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.310
And let me lose the borders because we don't need them.

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.220
And I'm going to have another shape over here.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.050
So let me delete that I'm going to have circles so that we would have two different views.

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:44.280
And I'm going to give some color to this circle as well and I'm going to make a difference so that we

9
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.630
can actually see that we have two different objects over here.

10
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.860
So one will be yellow and the other one will be green.

11
00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.480
And now I'm going to choose both of them and I'm going to do some operations that we have never seen

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.930
before.

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:09.170
So if you come over to right hand side you will see these ads you will see this subtract.

14
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.010
OK.

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.550
You will see the Intersect and also exclude overlap.

16
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.970
And these these are actually very literal.

17
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
So it will add two views together it will subtract one from the other.

18
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.210
OK.

19
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.640
And we're going to see how we can leverage them and we try to create some views.

20
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.240
For example let me hit on ADD.

21
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.990
And as you can see we added two views together and we actually made a union out of those views together.

22
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.760
So they're together right now.

23
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.310
They're in a union.

24
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
And we added them together but actually we get to edit them if we want.

25
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.690
If we double click on them we can see these subcategories over here sub views I mean and I get to change

26
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:07.110
the position I get to change the view if I want and I can just I hit somewhere out of this frame to

27
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.890
finalize my editing.

28
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.200
So here you go.

29
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:18.510
That's how you make unions so I'm going to hit the comment Z to undo this and I'm going to just subtract

30
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.230
this time.

31
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.910
So if I click over here as you can see subtracted the part that it intersects with direct signals.

32
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360
So I get to do this.

33
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.870
So it's it will actually come very handy if you try to cut something out of a shape like that.

34
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.830
OK.

35
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.990
Now let's try to intersect that as you can see we're left with the intersection of the two views.

36
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.430
So it's kind of cool right.

37
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.820
You can just take the intersection like that and let's do the exclude thing as well as you can see that

38
00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.820
excluding the overlap and we're left with the other views.

39
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890
So you can use these operations not.

40
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.290
And right now you can think that yeah we're not going to be designers Why are you showing these details

41
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.130
to us.

42
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.270
But actually it's very convenient to use these methods in order to create some basic views as well.

43
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.790
So this is a real time saver.

44
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.180
And over here we have some alignment buttons as well.

45
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.640
We haven't worked with them before.

46
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.050
So it's an alignment inside of our artwork.

47
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.780
So you can just click over here to make this eyeline centrally top bottom left right center.

48
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.520
Okay.

49
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:45.420
So for example if I hit two two centers that I place the view on the center middle of the screen over

50
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.380
here.

51
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.580
So that's it for our views for our operations.

52
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.620
We going to see a final operation called masking in the next lecture.
