00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,590
Hi within this lecture we're going to add a needle gesture recognizing to our map to choose a location

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,070
from the map.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,000
So we have done this in the art book section.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,710
So I'm going to be a little bit past you know how to do that already.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,120
In fact you can post a video and try to do it on your own.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,480
So I hope you managed to do that.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,610
So what we do is to create a recognizable in here and this will be a UI long press gesture recognizable.

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:40,320
So remember we get this gesture recognize ran a user presses for a long time over some view.

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,360
So this asks for action and the selector so we have to create the selector I'm gonna call this choose

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,320
location.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,450
OK.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,710
And under in this actually in this choose location where you're going to ask for a gesture recognized

13
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:06,150
her so that we will reach our UI tap gesture recognize or remember and this will actually give us opportunity

14
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,830
to do something with that gesture recognize her and I'm going to call this choose location gesture recognize

15
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,760
her and we have to give this some minimum price duration and I'm gonna go for tree as usual.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,110
And later on I'm going to add this yes you recognize here to my map view.

17
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,110
So here you go.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,960
And of course under this choose location we will start to check to see if this gesture recognizes or

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,820
has actually begun.

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,000
So how do we do that.

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:52,080
We just say if gesture recognize your dot state is a you I gesture recognize or dot state DOT begin.

22
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:00,210
So if that's the case remember what we do remember we create some touched points.

23
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,660
So we're going to say let touch is and this will get Yeah.

24
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,100
This will be gotten from the gesture recognize dot location and it will ask us for a view and this is

25
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,700
map view.

26
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,090
And again we are going to create this coordinates out of that touches.

27
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,840
So I'm going to say self that map view that convert.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,110
And we want something called converting points to coordinates from.

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:36,960
So regarding going to convert this touch this touched points into coordinates using our map.

30
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,320
So I'm doing this kind of fast because we have done this before and I explained what are those.

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,820
So if you don't know I suggest you go back and watch as a refresher.

32
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:55,740
So let me create my own annotation so my annotation will be M.K. point on notation and the cardinals

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,930
will be of course the coordinates.

34
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,200
Okay.

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,080
And we get some errors over here.

36
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,010
So yep this is called the map you.

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,140
Why are we getting that error.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,060
Because I misspelled it.

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,380
Yep.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,140
This has to be Matthew.

41
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,740
And the annotation coordinates will be coordinates.

42
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,130
Yep.

43
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:24,240
We have just created that coordinates and we can give it some title and subtitle as well title I could

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,670
be the map the place name actually not map name place names so you can get that from place modeled up

45
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,750
shared instance that's a place name right.

46
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:44,040
And we how we can have a subtitle as well we can just write the place type here like shared instance

47
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,300
that place type.

48
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,830
Okay.

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,420
If you don't know why the subtitle and title of the annotation is you going to see in a minute and later

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,040
on we going to have to just add this notation to our map view right.

51
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,020
Because we have defined our coordinates.

52
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:10,280
We have defined our title subtitle and everything yep we are ready to see a self doubt map.

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,130
Have dots adds on notation and we want to add our current annotation.

54
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,570
So that's it for us notation.

55
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,750
That's it for choosing location.

56
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,370
OK.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,640
This will give us the coordinates.

58
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:31,080
And later on we're going to get this coordinates every going to get the current selected locations coordinates

59
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,310
and get its latitude and longitude to save it to the pass.

60
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,910
So let me create a chosen latitude and chosen longitude over here.

61
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:48,420
They will be doubles because we can actually have these strings as well we can just save our values

62
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,200
as strings to do pass.

63
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,990
You will see how we can do that.

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,890
I'm going to show you.

65
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,100
Don't worry.

66
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,000
And in here I'm going to go for self that chosen latitude and this will come from coordinates.

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,460
Latitude.

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,480
OK.

69
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,310
And this will give us some coordinates.

70
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,820
And we're going to convert it to a string.

71
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:17,160
By saying this and I'm going to go for our chosen longitude again strings and coordinates.

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,120
That's long you toots.

73
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,520
So here we go.

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Let's see.

75
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:33,100
Let's try to transfer data from the ad place we've controller from here so let's say this is James restaurant.

76
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,870
OK.

77
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,860
And this is going to be a restaurant and for atmosphere I'm just going to write something like nice

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,240
and this choose a picture so that it would be much more real.

79
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:54,710
And then here let me go over to Frank House and choose a location for James.

80
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,480
So let me hear that here for three seconds.

81
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,380
And here you go.

82
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,890
We managed to add our annotation.

83
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:08,240
So if you click on that notation you will see James first round and the restaurant.

84
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:16,480
So we managed to transfer the coordinates not the coordinates transferred the place name and place type.

85
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:24,490
So that now we're ready to get everything together and upload everything to the pass because right now

86
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,810
we have our place name place type place atmosphere.

87
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,500
We have our place image.

88
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,570
We have our latitude longitude and everything.

89
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:42,080
Now all we have to do is just create a P.F. object to save this information to the PA server.

90
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,500
Let's do that in the next lecture.
