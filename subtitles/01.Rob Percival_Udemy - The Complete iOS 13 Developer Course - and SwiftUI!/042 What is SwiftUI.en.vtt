Hi we didn't this lecture we are going to discuss what Swift's UI is.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.130
So I'm going to create a new X code project for that and you don't have to do that by the way.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.810
You can just watch this lecture without applying what I'm about to do.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:24.720
Because this will be a small lecture just to give you an idea what that swift UI is so for example I'm

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.490
going to go for a serious UI test or swift UI intro as a product name.

6
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.790
And this time I'm going to check this you swift UI bugs if I click Next it will ask me where to place

7
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:48.660
it as usual and I'm going to create my application and immediately you will realize that there is something

8
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.030
different in our project.

9
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.440
So let me make this into a full screen so you can see better.

10
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.030
As you can see we have two sections right now on the right hand side.

11
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.000
We have something called Canvas and if you don't have this you can always open it from here Ed and you

12
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.250
can go for canvas in here as well.

13
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.480
If you say resume it will create a preview of your current app and on the left hand side we have something

14
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.860
called content for you in which we have one text saying hello world and then I mean that you will see

15
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.290
how does this look like in a real app.

16
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.790
And this is one of the beauties of the Swift UI.

17
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.230
It will just show you a light preview of your app so if you make changes on your app it will appear

18
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.680
on the right hand side and even you can play this like a simulator and you can click on buttons you

19
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
can go to other views and stuff without having to run simulator at all.

20
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.140
So as you might realize this is completely different structure than what we have seen in the course

21
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.210
so far.

22
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.710
We have something called struct where you're going to see what it is later on.

23
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.330
This is something like class but we haven't even seen what the class is yet.

24
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.600
So I'm not going to go into details all that I should tell you right now is that this is completely

25
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.270
different set up so we don't have we have controllers in swift UI.

26
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.370
We have views we don't have main storyboards and swift UI.

27
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.220
We just write what we want in here and it will happen for us as you can see if I say Halo series UI

28
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.140
it will appear on the right hand side so I can add some much more.

29
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.380
We use over here as well.

30
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.830
Okay.

31
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.110
So I can say text Halo but in order to do that I will have to create something called stack.

32
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.570
So vertical stack.

33
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.260
Okay.

34
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.310
So if I do vertical it will stack up the views in a vertical alignment.

35
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.810
I'm not telling I'm not teaching.

36
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.730
You have to use swift UI right now.

37
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.070
I'm just doing some stuff so you can see how swift the UI is acting how to work with swift UI how does

38
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.900
it feel to work with swift UI for example I put the spacer between tax and it just ad space it's really

39
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.280
cool.

40
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.910
By the way I really like the Swift UI but we have to be prepared for the main storyboards and we had

41
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.310
to be prepared for to make swift UI and we have to know it all at this stage in the U.S. development

42
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.500
maybe two years later.

43
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.940
We don't have to learn about main storyboards at all.

44
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.460
But for right now you have to learn that if you want to be a professional U.S. developer or if you want

45
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.970
to create your own apps it doesn't matter you have to learn about main storyboards.

46
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.100
You have to learn about swift UI.

47
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.440
Anyway at this point.

48
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.730
So again we're not going to do much over here I'm not even going to share this project with you because

49
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.810
we didn't do anything and we will have some dedicated section to switch to UI later on when we master

50
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.080
this fifth and when we master our U.S. development after the advanced sections we can go for a swift

51
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.940
UI.

52
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:34.590
Right now we will stop here and following the next section we're going to go ahead and learn about advanced

53
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.940
IRS techniques so that we can use them in our apps.
