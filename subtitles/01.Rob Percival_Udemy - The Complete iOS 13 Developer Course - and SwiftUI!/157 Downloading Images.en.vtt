00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:00.990
Hi.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.640
We didn't this lecture we going to find a way to download those images that we got from the fires store.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.910
Right now we only have the euro or else this one.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.630
OK.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.070
And we're going to download those images and show them to the user in our custom view sets in order

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.990
to do that.

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.010
We have to find a way to asynchronously download those images and show them to the users.

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.470
Why do I use the term missing cronies.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.360
Because as you know if we do this synchrony lead will block the user interface.

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.150
We will have to wait until it gets downloaded from the Internet and user won't be able to use the app

11
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.030
and it will crash eventually.

12
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.590
OK.

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:59.820
So let me go to Google and let me search for AOS Swift as sync OK and image load or image download into

14
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.570
Image view.

15
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.150
So that's exactly what we want.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.420
Right.

17
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.230
We want to asynchronously download some images from some your URLs and show them inside of an Image

18
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.870
view.

19
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.170
And in here as you can see we have a lot of tutorials and also some tools.

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.180
So I'm going to use this as developed image.

21
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.520
OK.

22
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.560
This is one of the most popular ones.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.260
You're more than welcome to try.

24
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.980
The other ones as well.

25
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.860
But I believe as these web image is good.

26
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.080
So if you're not satisfied with it's later on you can come back and try to Kingfisher for example.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.460
And if you come to this Web site GitHub dot com SD web image you may see DST web image tooling here.

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.350
So this tool is created for us and it's very easy to use it's very user friendly.

29
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.630
You just say the url and it downloads the image and shows inside of an Image view.

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.340
So if you come down a little bit you can see the usage and it's pretty awesome.

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.490
All you have to say Image view dot SD set image and specify a URL.

32
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.560
That's it.

33
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.830
It's it will download it and show it inside of a Image view.

34
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.900
And in here if you want you can add a place holder as well until it gets downloaded.

35
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.680
It shows the place holder if you want one.

36
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.230
OK.

37
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.270
So that's what we're going to do.

38
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.990
That's what we're going to use.

39
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.340
And in order to use that in order to import that we have to download it using parts.

40
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.980
So as you can see it gives you a description for using part files.

41
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.390
So all we have to do is just copy and paste this line from here.

42
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.480
And it's fairly easy path as the web image.

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.010
OK I'm going to copy this as it is and see if this works.

44
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.680
And I believe just writing pod SD web image will work as well.

45
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.430
But I'm going to try this first because it's instructed as it is.

46
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.250
OK.

47
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.620
And then later on I'm going to adjust it if it doesn't work.

48
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.910
Thank God we own.

49
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.690
We already have our pod because we have actually imported fire bays into our project as well.

50
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.570
So make sure you close down the access code OK and go to your pod file and open that this text edit.

51
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.750
So we already have some values in here let me zoom in a little bit.

52
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.320
OK.

53
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:44.310
We have the pods of the five your base and I'm going to paste this as developing image on the bottom

54
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.840
of this file and I'm going to save this and just run party install in the terminal.

55
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.770
So let's open our terminal as usual.

56
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.660
OK.

57
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.960
And we're going to have to go to our folder by typing C.D. and unless.

58
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.070
So remember how it's done.

59
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.880
If you type unless it shows the list of available files and folders if you type C.D. it changes the

60
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.050
directory.

61
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.410
So I'm going to inside of my download and Io is complete and e-book long firebase.

62
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.860
So I'm doing this kind of fast because we have been doing this for a long time right now.

63
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.880
So I'm just going to write all these tall and let's see if we can get this back from the server.

64
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.670
OK.

65
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.850
And as you can see we get an error.

66
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.600
It says that yeah I cannot find that version of a Steve Webb image cape.

67
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.990
So we specified it as five point 0.

68
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.460
So as I said before I believe the best way to overcome this problem is just opening this pod file OK

69
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.980
and deleting this.

70
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.780
So let me zoom in so delete those five O from here.

71
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.690
Just make sure that you delete that you delete this comma as well and just leave this as it is.

72
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.930
Steve up image.

73
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.670
OK.

74
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.160
So let's try this in this way this time.

75
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.220
OK let's run Polly install one more time from our terminal.

76
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.950
And as you can see now it works.

77
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.050
We're getting DSD web image.

78
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.450
It shows in green and all the other pods are shown in black.

79
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.750
As I've told you before we are just downloading the the web image this time.

80
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.790
The other pods are already downloaded.

81
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.290
So if you close this down and if you open the workspace not the X code project but the workspace you

82
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.840
are more than welcome to use sd that image in here.

83
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.890
In any view controller you want and make sure you wait until this indexing is completed.

84
00:05:51.890 --> 00:06:00.590
If you don't wait you may get an error when you try to get an AC web image library into your weave controller

85
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.810
by saying import.

86
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.080
OK.

87
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.310
So after this completes I'm going to go over here and say import.

88
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.810
So like does import as the in part as the that image.

89
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.190
So here you go.

90
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.890
And if this doesn't work out for you you can't come over here.

91
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.260
OK.

92
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:29.720
If you cannot import the SD web image come over it build faces tab build phases and in the linked binary

93
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:38.020
with libraries you can't click this plus button to bring in the SD web image from the list.

94
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.770
Right now I don't have to do that but if you get any error or if you cannot find the SD web image you

95
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.600
can just do that.

96
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:54.290
And that that's valid for all other external libraries you're gonna work with in your AOS projects as

97
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.560
well.

98
00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.800
So right now rather than saying this I'm going to go over and say Sell that user image that S D set

99
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.860
image.

100
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.700
So that's what we need.

101
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:13.970
We're just going to specify your URL and then it will just download this image from the URL and a sign

102
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.150
into DSD is assigning to the user Image view.

103
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.510
So we have other options here as well like a place holder image.

104
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.680
I don't want that.

105
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.480
Okay I'm just going to go with this.

106
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.560
And I you're more than welcome to use place holder image as well.

107
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:38.900
But in my case I don't need it and I'm not going to use completion block as well it gives us a completion

108
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:47.420
block but it doesn't make sense for me to check it every time I download this pass from the firebase

109
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:54.680
I'm going to do this for a lot of POS so I'm going to delete it later on and here I'm going to convert

110
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.710
my string to be a you are real.

111
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:05.740
OK so I can do this by saying your real strength because remember our user image array consists of strings.

112
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:12.350
So if you say you're real it will ask you for us drink and the string will come from user image array

113
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.970
index path that row.

114
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.630
OK index path.

115
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.460
That's right.

116
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.950
So again I don't need any completion block.

117
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.860
I don't have time to do that in this app.

118
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.270
But if you want you can create it like this.

119
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.800
So that's it.

120
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:38.480
I believe we can't test is now because this will just take care of our downloading problem.

121
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.510
So this is perfect.

122
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:40.790
Right.

123
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:46.490
This is one single line and it takes care of asynchronously downloading everything from the.

124
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.210
Given your eyes and displaying them into the image views.

125
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.790
If we virtually do that manually we will have to write a lot of codes.

126
00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:02.780
But thanks to the pilots thanks to the external libraries we can take care of our problems easily this

127
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.470
way.

128
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.370
And that's the BD of SWIFT as well.

129
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.160
So we have a lot of libraries working with swift natively.

130
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.650
So let me open this up.

131
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:20.490
Let me open my app in our simulator and let's see if we can get this in our feed.

132
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.570
We have controller.

133
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.340
Here you go.

134
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.790
Now we see the images.

135
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.780
So that's great.

136
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.700
So it's working as you can see.

137
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.330
So let's try to upload a new one.

138
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:40.450
OK let's tap to select here and let's choose another picture from here like this one.

139
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:40.900
OK.

140
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.290
Let's call this last supper or maybe DaVinci.

141
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.370
OK.

142
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:55.050
Let's try to upload this once I hit that the upload starts and takes me back to my feet and eat my feed.

143
00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:03.750
I see the DaVinci but as you can see there some kind of problems going on in here I see duplicate values.

144
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.540
OK.

145
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:13.620
And I don't see them by order so in order to overcome this duplicate values it's fairly easy we can

146
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:20.430
just clear the content of the areas before we go in the far loop.

147
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.410
Okay so let me go back here before we go in the for loop.

148
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:33.290
I can come over here and clear the content of the race so I can just say soft dot user imagery that

149
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.900
remove all not to remove add remove all.

150
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.020
OK so keeping capacity false.

151
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.140
And I'm going to do that for all the arrays.

152
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.380
So like user email or a dot to remove all OK.

153
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:57.900
False and then later on s dot user comments area that remove all keeping capacity false.

154
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.110
And finally like Eric.

155
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:00.510
Yeah.

156
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:07.640
S dot like her a dot to remove all keeping capacity false and that's it.

157
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.070
That's going to take care of my duplicate problems.

158
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:18.730
And in order to order everything by date we're going to have to do our query by dates.

159
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.700
We're going to see how to do that.

160
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:28.470
But for right now as you can see when I open this it's only shows me tree values here three parts.

161
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.140
And that's exactly what I want.

162
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:40.050
And we still don't have the order exactly as we want because as you can see the DaVinci is placed in

163
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.450
the middle in here and it's placed in the middle in my feed view as well.

164
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.720
So like button doesn't work as we want.

165
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.100
So we're going to take care of this problems in the following lectures.
