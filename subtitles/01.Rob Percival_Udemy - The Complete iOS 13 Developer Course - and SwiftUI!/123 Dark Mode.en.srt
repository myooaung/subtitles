00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi within this lecture we are going to learn about dark moat.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,600
So with the coming of U.S. church teen Apple has introduced dart mode into our lives.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,900
OK so let me go to Google and show you what I mean.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:22,280
So if you search for our dark mold IRS 13 you will have a lot of results.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,910
Of course you don't have to do that.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,390
I just want to show you the developer documentation of the IRS 13 4 dark mold.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:30,730
OK.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,320
So I'm going to go into do developer dot apple dot com and read the documentation.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,570
You don't have to do that.

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm just going to show you that there is a dark mold and we will use it.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,200
So what is dark moat.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,450
So it basically lets users choose whether they will use their phone in the light mold or dark mold so

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,220
dark mold means black backgrounds.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:06,780
Okay whites labels white texts white strings rather than having a white background with a black text.

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,690
Now users will see dark backgrounds with white texts.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:21,690
Of course it doesn't end there when a user chooses dark mold in their phone completely change phone

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,530
into dark mold in every menu in every app.

18
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,050
OK.

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,670
So you have to be ready to use this in your own apps to say I'm going to show you how to do that we

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,980
are going to create a very basic app so that we can see what it is to work in dark mode.

21
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,480
So I'm going to choose the single we've app as usual.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm going to name this dark mode app or dark mode.

23
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,860
OK.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,020
We're going to have only two we have controllers with two views inside of those.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
So let me click next and let me put this under my eyes.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,490
Complete folder.

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,490
Once we create our project I'm going to make this into full screen.

28
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,450
OK so that you can see better.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,820
And I'm just going to go into the main story birds.

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,350
So here as I said before I'm going to have to weave controllers in which I will have only one button

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,680
and one label so that we can see how they will react in dark mode.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
So let me search for a real controller and bring in one.

33
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:39,510
OK and here I'm just going to add a button and this button will segway to the next we have controller.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,190
OK.

35
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,400
That's all.

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,060
This button is going to do.

37
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,150
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

38
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,120
And here you go.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,980
I'm going to name this change.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,420
OK change by them because it will change the weave controller and I'm not even going to bother writing

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,940
the Segway code.

42
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:07,350
Rather I'm just going to do Segway from directly to this button from this button to DV controller and

43
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm going to embed in a navigation controller so that we can see how navigation tidal navigation bar

44
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,450
will behave in dark mode as well.

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,370
Now we have this back button and we will see the color of this navigation bar as well.

46
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,560
So in the second v controller I'm just going to have a label I'm not even going to have a view controller

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,440
assigned to this view controller like a wave controller class.

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,430
OK.

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,280
Because we only want to see how this label will change.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,480
I'm going to call this dark moat.

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,040
And as you can see we have a white background with dark black label.

52
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,650
OK.

53
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,650
So let me give this to you.

54
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,740
And this one to some constraints.

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,890
OK so let me add these constraints as well.

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,940
So here you go.

57
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,840
We're actually ready.

58
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,250
And the final thing I want to define this button into my v controller.

59
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:16,350
So let me open my assistant editor over here OK so that I can bring in this button to my coat and I'm

60
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,150
just going to bring this in as an outlet not as an action.

61
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:30,510
So make sure you bring this into your real controller OK by clicking and dragging and dropping it but

62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,930
rather than action just choose outlet and see a change by them.

63
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,780
So we have this outlet over here because later on I'm going to change the color of this button.

64
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,440
OK.

65
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,540
So let me just first test design and see how it looks like in light mode and dark mode.

66
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,900
Let me open my simulator.

67
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,460
And here we go.

68
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,210
I believe we are ready.

69
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,900
So let me just see if this is done let me open my simulator.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,210
Yeah.

71
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,340
Here we go we are still waiting.

72
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,490
Let me minimize the whole project from here so that we can only see the app.

73
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,680
Here you go it when we click on the change button it takes us to the second have controller and saw.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,770
So this is pretty basic.

75
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,190
Let me take this into the DART mode.

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,390
So in order to go into the dark mode in Iowa starting you will be able to reach it from the general

77
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,900
settings or imperious settings.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,840
But right now we in the simulator we have it under developer.

79
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,470
OK so if you go to developer you will see these dark periods.

80
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,940
If you cannot find it for some reason you can always search for it.

81
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,230
Right.

82
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,090
So let me close this down and no I don't want this as well.

83
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,900
So let me come over here.

84
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:01,640
A few swipe to the left one more time you can have this search bar and over here you can write dark

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,240
ads will give you dark periods of course you can search for dark experience as well and you will see

86
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,830
the related menu.

87
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,320
So when you click on that it will take you to the same developer menu.

88
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,160
And here you go.

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,420
Once I enable it now my app and my phone is actually in the dark experience mode.

90
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,850
Now I see the black background rather than this white background.

91
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,600
Right.

92
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,380
And I see texts in white rather than black.

93
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,360
Now let me go to my app and here you go.

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,780
My app is changed there as well because it affects all the apps and all the phone related menus and

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,210
everything inside of our phone.

96
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,180
Now I see the labels in white.

97
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,160
OK.

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,690
So this is cool right.

99
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,750
And it also adjusts itself actually.

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,410
So if you're working with black it will turn it to white automatically but you have to be sure that

101
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,930
this is working for example in this button.

102
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:12,380
It's shown in blue and I believe this is the default behavior.

103
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,030
But for some reason you may want to change this right.

104
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:25,880
Maybe you may want to maybe you want to actually show this in white rather than blue van user chooses

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,810
dark modes.

106
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:38,280
So we have to find a way to understand if the user is using their phone in the dark mode or light mode.

107
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,570
So is there a way to do that.

108
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,620
Of course there is a way to do that.

109
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:53,120
We're going to test to see we're going to check to see if the user has chosen this style in their phone

110
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,990
so that we can change what they were.

111
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,950
We want of course this is not mandatory.

112
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,280
Maybe we are satisfied with the current look current behavior but if you're not satisfied if you want

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,540
to customize.

114
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:13,730
Now we would have to know how to do that how to reach that variable that use the user is using their

115
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,680
phone in the dark moat.

116
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,340
So it's called trade collection.

117
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,430
So as you can see this is UI trade collection.

118
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,250
And this gives us the trade such as size class or scale factor.

119
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,760
So they generally describe the current environment.

120
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,220
So if you want to get something out of current environment then you're going to use this trade collection.

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,100
And if you say trade collection OK and if you scroll down a little bit you will see something called

122
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,220
User Interface style.

123
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:56,870
So there are some other aspects as well but you're not looking for a user interface idiom or level but

124
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,370
we're interested in the user interface style.

125
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,710
So if you double click on that that's what you want to get.

126
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:12,200
So let me as scientists do a variable and then you're going to see this is exactly the thing that we're

127
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,280
looking for.

128
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,960
So I'm going to called is user interface style.

129
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,970
OK.

130
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:26,000
And if you check if user interface style OK with a double A equals sign if you say dot you will get

131
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,430
either dark or lights or you can get the unspecified as well.

132
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,930
But most of the time it will be either dark or light.

133
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,460
So we are particularly interested in dark right now.

134
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,610
So if user is using their form in dark mode maybe I want to show the change button in white color rather

135
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,830
than blue.

136
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,880
So how do I do that.

137
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:57,400
It's pretty easy actually I already have defined this button as an outlet in my code right.

138
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,680
Then all I have to do is change the color of this button.

139
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:09,010
So if you say change button that color and you have to say tint color in order to reach the title color.

140
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,890
OK.

141
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:18,310
So you have to go for 10th color and you can just say you eye color dot White for example.

142
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:25,540
Now this will just make this into white when the user is using their phone in dark mode.

143
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,890
Of course you can just say the aisles as well.

144
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,890
You can see a change button that tint color you light colored dots blue.

145
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:41,560
So if the user is using their phone in dark mode then just do this button invite if this is not the

146
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,800
case then go for blue.

147
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,770
So here you go.

148
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:52,470
Now I how the White Bardin over here so text didn't change it was already in white.

149
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,410
But now my button has change.

150
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,180
So let me come over to the settings and try to make this into light mode.

151
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,870
So once I do that it should turn into the light mode.

152
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,620
But here you go.

153
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,930
It didn't turn.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,960
Now I see my button in white and I can't even see it.

155
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,580
So button is over there actually in the center.

156
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:28,720
But since I did that we did load hasn't been cold and I wasn't able to change the button into the blue

157
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,440
tint color.

158
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,530
So if I tried to click on the button right now it would click actually.

159
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,590
So let me try it.

160
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,530
And here we go.

161
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,620
I can't click on it but I cannot see it because it's in white.

162
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,520
So it's kind of not what I'm looking for.

163
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,160
Right.

164
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,030
So I want to be able to run this code whenever I see the screen.

165
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,220
Maybe you would think that.

166
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,170
Yeah let's do that in view will appear and it would work.

167
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,530
Yates can work.

168
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,550
Let's try that.

169
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,440
Let's go to we will appear.

170
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,740
OK.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,480
And as you can see if I run this one more time it will display those in blue because we have the load

172
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,590
gets cold.

173
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,450
When I run this from scratch.

174
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,880
But we have to do it in a consistent way.

175
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:26,970
So let me cut everything from here and paste under the we will appear as he or what's going on.

176
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,060
Yeah I couldn't do that.

177
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,950
So let me try it one more time.

178
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,940
Here you go.

179
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,640
Now let me run this one more time and see if we can get this.

180
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:35,850
Yeah.

181
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,430
We have the white.

182
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,800
Now we have the blue button and it's exactly what we wanted.

183
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,200
But if I change this and if I come over here it didn't change.

184
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,810
So we will appear hasn't been called.

185
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:58,090
So if I go over here and come back it will change into white but I wasn't cold in the first time I came

186
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,600
back from settings.

187
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:07,720
So maybe it can be a rare occasion that a user will change its periods while using our app.

188
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,860
But even so we have to figure out a better way to handle this situation.

189
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:23,140
So that many user changes the style then we will adapt our app to that style if we want to.

190
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,520
So how do we do that.

191
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,780
We're going to see how to do that in the next lecture.
