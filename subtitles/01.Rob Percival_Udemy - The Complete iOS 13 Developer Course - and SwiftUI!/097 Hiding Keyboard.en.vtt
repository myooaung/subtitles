00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.570
Hi.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.550
We didn't this lecture we're going to finish our user interface.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.790
We have to test the save button to see if that works.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.090
We have to add a new button over here to our UI navigation bar so that we can do a Segway between we

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:24.090
have controllers and then we going to finish up our user interface and then go to write our card data

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.730
with work.

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.310
So in the table view I'm going to create this UI bar button programmatically.

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.550
So it means that I'm going to write a code in order to reach that.

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.320
So you have to go for navigation controller but I believe it doesn't show up in here.

10
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:52.020
So let me try to delete this and do a comment B to build this up so that I can try later on one more

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.830
time.

12
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.420
So let's write now negation and it still doesn't show up.

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.460
Let me delete this and write it from scratch.

14
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.370
So maybe we can see it.

15
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.700
Yeah.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.040
Navigation controller.

17
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.460
Now we see it.

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.910
So this brings us the UI navigation controller.

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.230
So if I click on this I can reach the UI navigation bar as well.

20
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.430
So after you run you write this you can do a dot and navigation bar and it brings you the navigation

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.320
bar and if you do top item you reach the top top item of the navigation bar.

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.940
So we reach actually this area in the main story.

23
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.260
Let me show you so you can understand it better.

24
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.530
So we reached this area.

25
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.930
So on this area I'm going to reach for the right hand side.

26
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.980
OK.

27
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.800
So you can just go and say dot right bar about an item and a site from right.

28
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.620
We have a left by the bar about the item as well but we're going to go for right because that's what

29
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.180
usually developers do.

30
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.160
So we're going to actually go for the cooperation and create this right bar about an item.

31
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.170
So this will expect us to create a UI bar button item.

32
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:19.570
So this one as you can see this is a special button for placing on the toolbar or the tab bar.

33
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.880
So we can create this bar button and we can actually reach and choose the target.

34
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.100
We can choose the sector we can choose what will happen when we click on this bar button item.

35
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.210
So here you will see some options.

36
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.890
For example we have this tidal options if you want to write something inside of your button you can

37
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.660
go for this.

38
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.690
You can go for title but I don't want to actually write anything I'm just going to create this from

39
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.060
the built in icons from the Swifts from the X code.

40
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.970
So I'm going to show you how it works.

41
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.470
So choose the system one.

42
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.330
And if you hit enter and hit dot you will see these options.

43
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.340
For example we have the action we have the ads and these bring us some icons that represents the related

44
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.090
action for example if we choose the ad it will display a plus bottom.

45
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.610
If we choose camera for instance it will display a camera icon.

46
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.270
So you can go for other options as well.

47
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.850
For example if you choose the compose it will display a button representing compose items.

48
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.570
So developers use this to work with cause instant icon looks within Apple applications.

49
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.370
OK.

50
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:48.110
So I'm going to go for at so you will see a plus button appearing on the AH button navigation bar button.

51
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.040
Let me run this.

52
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.850
So Target's will be south because we're going to call the selector action selector from this view controller.

53
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.500
OK.

54
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.240
Like we used to do before.

55
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.220
So I'm going to create this function with objective c function at bottom.

56
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.680
OK.

57
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.160
Add button clicked.

58
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.660
So in this ADD button clicked I'm just going to do.

59
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.790
Performed Segway and the Segway identifier that I'm looking for is two details we see.

60
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.250
And the sender is nil.

61
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.880
So if I come over here and say Add button clicked then if I run this you will see a UI bar button an

62
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.770
item on the UI navigation bar.

63
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:39.630
And when I click on it it will bring me to the details of controller so that we can actually test if

64
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.480
our details we see is working or not because we fixed the bug remember.

65
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.700
So let me open our simulator and test this and in fact we didn't even make the set up for table view

66
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.940
but it doesn't by the ridges going to see an empty table view like here.

67
00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.440
Yeah.

68
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.190
We have the plus button on the right hand side of UI navigation bar if you click on it.

69
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.130
It brings us here in here we're going to have a UI Image view and text fields seems OK and if I click

70
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.780
on Save it prints out tests so everything seems to be working right now.

71
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.720
And if I click on one of these text fields the key keyboard will come up and there is a problem in here.

72
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.600
As you can see this keyboard actually prevents us from reaching the save button even if I click one

73
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.500
of the non text field areas of the view controller like here or here.

74
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.050
It doesn't go back.

75
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:52.010
So it's kind of a problem we have to make sure that if user taps on anywhere on the view it should go

76
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.550
back so we can reach the same button.

77
00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.270
So we generally use keyboard this way we say toggle and we don't see any problem while we use this.

78
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.450
However the user will experience this problem in the real world.

79
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.400
So we have to make sure we take care of this problem again.

80
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:19.190
So in order to do that we are going to work with a tap gesture recognizing one more time.

81
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.180
Because why.

82
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.430
Because we want a user tapping on anywhere on the view.

83
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.610
And when he taps we have to understand this gesture.

84
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:38.120
And we have to act accordingly before we made this gesture recognizes for UI image views right.

85
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.570
Image you use actually.

86
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.350
So in this image view when a user taps on the Image view be performed some operation.

87
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.150
But right now I want to create this gesture recognizing one more time.

88
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.030
I want the user to tap a rare on the View.

89
00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.860
I'm going to show you how it's done and actually bringing down the keyboard is very easy.

90
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.650
So it's one line of code.

91
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.010
But we have to take care of the gesture recognize there first so that we can implement the function

92
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:12.320
with the gesture recognize her.

93
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.950
So let's do it first.

94
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.870
We have to create a tap gesture recognize her in order to do that.

95
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.310
I'm going to say let gesture recognize there is a you eye tap gesture recognize her.

96
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.560
OK.

97
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.430
Remember this asks for a target and then action.

98
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:37.730
So Target of course will be self again and the action will be a selector that we will create.

99
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:45.140
So let's say selector here and in here I'm going to create go for creating another function.

100
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.250
So I'm going to say func height keyword.

101
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.110
OK.

102
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.630
So this will hide the keyboard for me.

103
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.250
And in order to hide the keyboard it's very easy.

104
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.530
You just have to say view.

105
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.230
OK.

106
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.850
It will bring up the view so does a predefined word in swift.

107
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:07.020
It refers to you iview and Dot OK and anything.

108
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:15.470
So when you do that it actually finishes up everything regarding to editing including bringing down

109
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.440
the keyboard.

110
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.760
So you have to say view that and editing too.

111
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:27.140
So now I have to make sure that this height keyboard is due in here as a selector.

112
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.390
OK.

113
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:36.790
And I have to make sure that this gesture recognize there is added to the view as a gesture organizer.

114
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:44.390
So rather than assigning to an image view rather than assigning to this to any view I'm just going to

115
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.270
assign this to my view itself.

116
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:54.800
So whenever wherever our user taps rather than the keyboard it will bring down the keyboard.

117
00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:02.730
So you can say view that at gesture recognized or so the gesture recognized there is the choice.

118
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.640
So here you go.

119
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.670
This will work.

120
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.050
Let me test this.

121
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.400
OK.

122
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:12.700
Let me open this from scratch and let me go to the other view.

123
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.690
Let me click one of the text fields so my keyboard will come up.

124
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.780
If I click on anywhere as you can see it goes down so I can reach the save button.

125
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.850
So we're done here actually.

126
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.130
This user interface can be much more better.

127
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.870
There is no point to put the save by the name here we can just put the save button to the UI navigation

128
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.640
bar for example here.

129
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:45.240
So it will look much more better but I'm not going to spend much much more time on the user interface.

130
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.910
We're here to learn about the car data.

131
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.970
And this is more than enough for us to perform our tasks.

132
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:53.780
OK.

133
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.970
That's what it counts right now.

134
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:01.170
So I'm going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to continue yielding our art book.
