00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,800
Hi.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,920
We didn't this lecture re going to add a new wave controller to our tab bar because we have to have

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,990
a low got functionality as well.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,190
And we're going to connect this view controllers to a Coco touch class.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,680
Okay so far we have our feed we have controller and upload.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,800
We have controller but we don't have their Coco touch classes.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,600
And in addition to that we're going to have to have a turd tab bar.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
We have controller as well.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,470
So let me open the library and bring in one controller.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,430
So this is going to be a regular controller so that you can drag and drop to anywhere in your story

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,270
board.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,410
So let me take this to the below and a line them and then we going to how to have I say way from our

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,310
tab bar we have controller tab bar controller I mean to the need we have controller and in here don't

14
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,140
select show Segway because that's not what you want.

15
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:07,440
So what do we want in order to understand that let me click one of these same ways that connect tab

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,430
bar controller to our view controllers.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,320
If you go to properties you will see that this is a relationship Segway.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,700
So we haven't seen it before.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,960
So a relationship Segway actually creates a relationship between a tab bar controller and the wheel

20
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,640
controller connecting to it.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,620
So let me do it one more time and select relationship Segway.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,550
So now as you can see this is connected and we see the third item here as well.

23
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:47,550
So if I go to item here OK I can change the title as I want like as settings we have controller and

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,310
for the icon of course we can go for s icon here as we did before.

25
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,700
So let me see where is the S I can.

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,580
Yeah I can not seem to find it.

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:01:59,860
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,720
Here.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,110
Yeah I can find it s circle.

30
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,480
OK.

31
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,740
That's what I want.

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,540
And now wi fi zoom in you will see that settings is here with an S I can.

33
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,370
So this is perfect.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:17,490
This is what I wanted but now I have to create the cocoa teach classes as well.

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,200
So let me click here and right click and see a new file.

36
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,930
Of course we are going to go for cocoa touch class and this is going to be a UI weave controller.

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,640
OK.

38
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,580
So the first thing I'm going to call feed we have controller.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:39,270
So this will be my weave controller feed we have controllers cocoa touch class I'm going to say next

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,030
and create in my in cyclone five your base project.

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,490
And here we go we have our wheat feed we have controller.

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,300
Let's do the second one as well.

43
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's add another cocoa to each class.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,390
And this time I'm going to call those upload we have controller.

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,070
OK.

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,680
So this will be the upload we have controller and say create.

47
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,990
And for the third time I'm going to go and do the same thing.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,760
Cocoa touch class and this time I'm going to call the settings wi controller.

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,390
And in fact in the settings we have controller we're only gonna have the logout functionality but I'm

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,430
doing this for an example so I believe that's OK.

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,940
So let me put all of this in the upper site so that we can see all we have controllers in one place

52
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,000
and the next thing I'm going to go to my storyboard to open it as a source.

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,230
So remember this I have this bug when I add a new wave controller my application fails my application

54
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,060
crashes if I don't change the values from this source if you don't come across this kind of a bug in

55
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,300
your X code then just don't do this step.

56
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:06,720
Okay but in case you have in case you experience this problem I'm showing you how to do that.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,140
And again if you don't come across this problem if you open your app without crashing it when you add

58
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,490
a new controller just don't do it.

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,060
So here as you can see my regular old view controller I have five attributes like custom class custom

60
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,880
module custom module provider.

61
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,860
But in the other way controllers there are added by me manually I don't have those items so I have to

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:43,200
copy and paste this custom class custom module and custom module provider so that I won't get an interface

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,160
failed.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,850
Error when I run this app.

65
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,540
So let me copy this and go back to the feed we have controller for example and paces in here.

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,590
OK.

67
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:03,770
Again if you don't have this problem then just watch and see how this is getting the result but don't

68
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,890
apply it because in the exam we're seeing an exam out cold right now.

69
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,940
It's likely to make a mistake.

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:20,450
OK I'm copying and pasting the view controller missing attributes to all you controllers so that I can

71
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,960
resolve this buck and we have seen this before so I'm not going to go into the details and I'm going

72
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,620
to go back to interface builder.

73
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,310
So this is very you can continue if you don't have this problem in your ex coat.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:45,230
So right now in order to see if it's working I have to define some variables here so let me create my

75
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,160
button in my settings view controller OK.

76
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:55,010
So let me make this a little bit bigger and change the name to log out.

77
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:02,090
I'm going to connect this logout button to my settings view controller cocoa touch glass in order to

78
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:08,990
that I'm going to select settings and come to this identity inspector and this is not going to be a

79
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,820
weave controller but it's going to be a settings weave controller and it doesn't show up here.

80
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:21,220
So I suspect there's something going on still even though we have corrected everything.

81
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:26,810
And if you click on this little button it will take us to the settings we controller.

82
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,470
At least it seems to be working when we write it manually by.

83
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,320
But I still suspect there is something wrong.

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,580
So let me write upload view controller here manually.

85
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,000
OK.

86
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,470
That's OK.

87
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,550
And let's go to feed.

88
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,010
We have controller identity Inspector.

89
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,580
And let's say that this is feed we have controller.

90
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,080
OK so that's cool.

91
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,390
I believe we are ready to connect this logout button to the settings we have controller cocoa touch

92
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,270
glass so open a new assistant editor.

93
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:09,140
And in here drag and drop the logout button with control and define it as an action and say logout clicked.

94
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,580
Yeah it seems fine.

95
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah it seems to be working so we're going to test this.

96
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,470
OK.

97
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:21,120
As you can see this is not connected to settings wi controller and I believe we're OK.

98
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,990
So let me give you some constraints to the logout button as well.

99
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,880
OK.

100
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
And we're done actually.

101
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,820
So in the low gobs clicked I'm just going to perform a Segway for right now.

102
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,230
Later on we're going to have to implement a logout function as well.

103
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:46,040
But I don't have the Segway right because I didn't create any Segway between settings with a controller

104
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,350
and our initial weave controller.

105
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,790
So let's do that.

106
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:58,310
Let's drag and drop from settings to our view controller signing we've controller and say show.

107
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,230
And when I say show it's displaying this as a pop over issue.

108
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,380
I'm going to change this to be present model.

109
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,590
So let me choose the Segway.

110
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,080
OK.

111
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:17,390
So present mildly and again in here I'm going to go for a full screen so it makes everything right.

112
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,350
And I'm going to say that this is to weave controller.

113
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,280
So here you go.

114
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,770
We are ready to test is performed Segway.

115
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:31,300
So let me go to two view controller in here and center will be nil.

116
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,560
So let's test to see if everything seems to be all right.

117
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:43,880
Because we have changed the exam code even though if you didn't do it you have to test us and see if

118
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,240
this works because we added a new tab bar controller.

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,470
So let's see the initial we have.

120
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,080
Controller.

121
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,550
Yes.

122
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,650
That's good.

123
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:02,030
And when I hit sign in it sucks it gets sucked and I believe we crashed the application for some reason.

124
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:08,560
Let's wait for the error message in here we don't have any error message.

125
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,570
But we see the black screen.

126
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:18,500
And if you go to the lugs as you can see it doesn't see the image of you.

127
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,310
The settings view controller.

128
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,880
All the other way controllers that we have connected so far.

129
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,340
So this is the bug that I was talking about then we corrected that in the source code.

130
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,360
But I believe we have to do it again.

131
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,550
So let me open the source code and if we don't have this problem just don't bother with it.

132
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:45,210
I'm not cutting this on purpose because if you come across you have to know how to solve this.

133
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,330
This is not specific to I started in this has been going on for years.

134
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,580
I don't know why they couldn't figure it out yet but we sometimes get this bug in next code.

135
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:04,200
So as you can see in the view controller we have this custom class custom module and custom module provider.

136
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,830
So let me look below.

137
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,330
We don't have anything else.

138
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:14,180
So let me copy this custom module and custom module provider because as you can see the wheel controller

139
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,890
we're missing that.

140
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,490
OK.

141
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,130
The other in the other we have controllers we are missing that for example in the feed we have controller.

142
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,740
We don't have that so I'm going to paste it in and in the settings of your controller we don't have

143
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:35,660
them as well as you can see and in the upload view controller we don't have them at all.

144
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,940
So let me paste it up.

145
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:46,430
So let me say this and let me go to interface builder one more time and we're going to have to test

146
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,320
this one more time.

147
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:56,720
But before we do that before you test is before you run this in your simulator make sure that before

148
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,650
you hit the sign in bottom go to your tab bar controller.

149
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,670
OK.

150
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:08,370
This one I mean not that we have controllers but the actual tab bar controller after you copy and paste

151
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,190
examples.

152
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,090
This class can get confused in the identity Inspector make sure the class is not think OK.

153
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,470
It shouldn't be a controller or like there's a feed controller.

154
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,530
If you see any value in the tab bar controller class just delete it OK.

155
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,640
As you can see all other controllers are in place and this should be empty.

156
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:39,680
So if you see any value just delete it hit enter and then run your simulator one more time to make sure

157
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,130
everything's seemed to be in place.

158
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:52,370
So let me open my simulator and click on sign in and as you see now it's OK in the upload them feed.

159
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,960
We don't see anything by the fee go to settings.

160
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,660
We see the logout button.

161
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,740
And if I click on it.

162
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,840
Here you go.

163
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:07,350
I'm in this I need the view controller if I click on it again I can go to my feed view controller and

164
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,740
as I explained before I could have easily just pulled the video and fix the bugs myself without showing

165
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,330
you guys.

166
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,190
But maybe you come across this kind of problem you're not right now or maybe you will in the future

167
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,090
so you will have to know how to fix those problems.

168
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:31,670
So apologies for taking too long for adding just one meal controller to our tab our controller but that

169
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:35,240
is just what we had to do in order to learn this.

170
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:41,030
So we're going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to see how to create users.
