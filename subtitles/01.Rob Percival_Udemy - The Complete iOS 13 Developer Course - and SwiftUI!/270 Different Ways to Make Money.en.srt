00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:08,180
Hi within the section going to discuss how we can make money out of those IRS development skills that

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,950
we have been monitoring so far.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,650
Now you know how to work with Swift now you know how to do all of ISIS apps.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,280
Now the big question is how we can make money out of that skill set.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,660
Of course there are a couple of ways to do that.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,880
For example you can get a full time IOW developer job.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,520
And of course there are pros and cons for that.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,320
For example you will get a stable income every month and that's a big pro because you won't be thinking

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,070
about what project that I'm working on next.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,460
So if I cannot make a project how I will just pay my rent or something.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,740
But of course there are calls as well.

12
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:59,860
So you will be doing what you're told so you will be only involved in a small part of an app development.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:07,290
Most probably for a long period so you will be mustering some skills but you will be left out of or

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,150
from others.

15
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,740
So you know how this works.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,270
You work 9 to 5.

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,850
Most probably 9 to 9 so you will be working after hours and you will be getting your paycheck every

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,330
month.

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,560
So in fact at this point it's your call to whether I apply for a full time job or not because you have

20
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,210
other options as well.

21
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,810
For example you can try working freelance right and there are pros and cons for working as a freelancer

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,190
as well so you will be getting some projects and you will be making and delivering these projects in

23
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,840
a given breed of time.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,890
When you work as a freelancer and for example you will be free when you do that.

25
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,750
You can just work from your home.

26
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,020
You can just work from another country.

27
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,600
You can work while you're travelling.

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,590
You can work wherever you want.

29
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,870
Then never you want but of course the money will be in stable.

30
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,590
So if you cannot get a freelance job for a month you won't get paid.

31
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:21,300
And if you get too much work done you will be working like 7 24 and you will just do your best to finish

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,900
the projects that you get and projects can be messy.

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,370
At some points for example customers may demand some other extra features and they will try to negotiate

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,550
you to do that for the same amount of money that you will initially get for less job.

35
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:46,290
And of course another con is that you will be working alone whereas in the IRS developer per job you

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,010
will be working within a team and working within a team actually improves your IOW development skills

37
00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:00,230
very much because people share ideas people share knowledge with each other when you work in that team

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,100
and they aside from all of this of course you can't create your own app as well.

39
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,830
And when you create your own app you can give it that prize and you can sell it with a price.

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,960
If you trust your app if you trust if your app you really has some features that any other app does

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:30,870
not in the market so you can sell it for a price and you can have in app purchases or advertisement

42
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,160
in your app as well.

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,470
If you're just distributing it for free.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,110
So now if you're distributing it for free in order to make money you can display some advertisement

45
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,910
with Google for example and within the section we going to see how it's done and there are a lot of

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,080
calls of pros for this option as well.

47
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:03,540
A big pro so you can do that while you're working freelance or in a real IOW developer job as well so

48
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,630
you can do that on your own time and you can release your app publish your app in the App Store whenever

49
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,800
you want.

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,230
Of course it's not easy as it looks.

51
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,400
For example if you look at very big games they do have huge advertisement budgets.

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,660
They get advertisements in their apps but also they give advertisements in order to make people play

53
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,890
their games as well.

54
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,920
But if you make it work then you will have a side income every month flowing into your bank account

55
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,400
so that you can increase your freedom.

56
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,840
Maybe sometime you can build that company out of that app as well.

57
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,040
So within the section we're actually going to see how we can implement ads in our apps so that we can

58
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,270
make money out of that.

59
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,320
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
