00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.470
Hi.

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:08.830
We didn't his lecture we going to see how we can create users using pass User class.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.090
So let me come over here and actually rather than just commenting out this I will just command out everything

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.170
so that I won't just update or retrieve any data using power server right now.

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm going to head back to my main that sorry bar because we need some text fields to get user input

6
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.140
here to create user accounts.

7
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.610
So I'm going to bring in two text fields and two more buttons later on.

8
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.400
I'm going to ask for user name and the password.

9
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:54.350
So let me bring in one labeled first because I'm going to have a title in my own app.

10
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.220
So this is going to be something like Foursquare clone.

11
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.630
OK and this will act as our title or our headings.

12
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.560
So I'm going to go for first square clone and I'm going to make this a little bit bigger.

13
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.570
So where's the form t up here this.

14
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.850
So this is OK right.

15
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.030
And under this header or under this title I'm going to go for a text fields.

16
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

17
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.090
So the first one will be for user name.

18
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.930
Okay.

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.220
And Empire as you can just create users with user name rather than only email.

20
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.800
OK.

21
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.410
You can get email if you want but I'm going to show you how to do this with passwords and user name

22
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.390
only.

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.460
And you will know how to do this with email as well.

24
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.580
Don't worry.

25
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.450
Username Password.

26
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.060
So let me bring in one button or here.

27
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.130
So this will be something like signed in by them so that if our user has an account they will get to

28
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.180
sign in from this button.

29
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.350
I'm going to copy and paste this button because I'm going to need another bobbin called sign up.

30
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.690
OK so if user doesn't have any account registered previously they will get to create one using this

31
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.790
option.

32
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.580
So let me see if this is a line.

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.160
Yep they were aligned but I've totally your exits.

34
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.150
So let me come over here and say reset to suggested constraints so that we can move on to our wheel

35
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.360
controller and define all this we use.

36
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.460
So let me go back to main story board over here.

37
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.770
So this will be my user name taxed.

38
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.440
OK.

39
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.000
So come over here I say user name text.

40
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.260
And also I'm gonna need a password text as well.

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.210
So this one password tax.

42
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.730
And we have two buttons.

43
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.590
I'm going to bring them in as an action.

44
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.320
So let's do the sign in first.

45
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.730
Let's bring in sign in and say sign in clicked.

46
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.150
OK.

47
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.600
So this is an action and we're going to do that for sign up as well.

48
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.380
So this is sign up clicked.

49
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.390
Here you go.

50
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.350
Now let me close this down and go back to my weave controller.

51
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.870
So in my weave controller in fact I'm going to delete everything from here because we get to practice

52
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.070
this reading and writing thing a lot and you will have your notes.

53
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.830
Don't worry.

54
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.050
And in the sign and collect I don't need to do anything right now because we have to start with signing

55
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.950
up first.

56
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.190
We don't have any prior accounts in that moment.

57
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.350
First we need to create one that we can sign in using that's a count and using authentication imparts

58
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.210
is very easy.

59
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.940
You called Pass user class just like we did authentication in the five year base.

60
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.050
Remember we have called all that off in five year base.

61
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.870
Now let me start by checking to see if user name text is not MTM password.

62
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.930
Text is not empty.

63
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:24.300
If they are indeed empty then I will display some Ellard message to the user saying that.

64
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.550
Yeah.

65
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.330
You need to fill out some user name and password.

66
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.210
Okay so I'm going to create to have make Ellard function over here.

67
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.350
Remember we are going to use this a lot during this.

68
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.560
We control the DOT swift file progress and we are going to need this function allowed.

69
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.680
So I'm going to go for Elliott.

70
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.510
OK.

71
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.920
This is going to be a UI Elliott not action actually controller.

72
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.880
So UI alert controller.

73
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.400
OK.

74
00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.140
If you open parentheses this will ask you for a title and message style of course.

75
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.320
I'm going to give title input as a string in here and the message input as string over here so that

76
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:15.540
I can come over and say yep this is going to be a title input and this is going to be a message input.

77
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.670
So it will display our title and message as we want and the sale will be doubts.

78
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.730
ELLIOT Since we have done this a lot before so I'm doing this a little bit fast.

79
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.880
So this is going to be an ad buy them like you.

80
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.890
Action and title will be okay.

81
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.510
And this is not this is not going to be an ad button.

82
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.350
This is going to be okay by them and the style will be default and we don't need any handler.

83
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.680
And then I'm going to add this action to my Elliot by saying that Elliot out to add action.

84
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.640
And finally I'm going to go for self-taught present.

85
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:03.850
I'm going to present this Elliot with an animation of curves and that completion we don't need any completion

86
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.240
right now.

87
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.700
If you come over here you can just say make Elliot and for title you can just go for air and if they're

88
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.440
empty you can just say something like Yeah.

89
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.590
Give me username and password.

90
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.600
If you don't give me How can I create an account for you OK.

91
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:30.940
And if they are correct if they are not empty strings then I'm going to call my pass User class like

92
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:39.250
I have said before because that's where I manage the authentication procedures like signing in signing

93
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:39.770
up.

94
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:49.390
So I'm going to say let the user be a P F user as you can see this is what we want in order to go with

95
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.530
user management.

96
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.400
And I'm going to give you a password and the user name to that user as you can see you get this email

97
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:06.610
option as well if you want to you can sign them up with e mailed but I'm going to go for a user name

98
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.550
because in fire res we don't need we don't have this kind of option.

99
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:18.480
So this is may be some kind of an advantage compared to firebase.

100
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.450
So I'm going to go with the user name.

101
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.430
So let me see this is password we have other methods here.

102
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.950
So I want to user name.

103
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.720
Yep this one and I'm going to take this user name from user name tags that tags I'm certain that this

104
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.060
is not empty right now.

105
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:42.000
So I can put some exclamation mark at the end of this text.

106
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.120
I'm going to do this for the password as well right after I give the user name and the password.

107
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.780
I can just say sign up.

108
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:56.680
So if you say sign you will see some options like if you go for a sign up.

109
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:02.850
It does it sync erroneously sign up in background with block of course what we want.

110
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.380
OK.

111
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:10.130
So this is again seeing cronies please sign up in background not seeing erroneously but a Synchrony

112
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:17.980
is even though we don't get any block but what we want is the general one sign up in background with

113
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:25.740
block so if you hit enter it will give you an boolean indicating whether deserve success or failure.

114
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.060
So I'm going to say success and error if error is not nil.

115
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.820
I'm just going to display an alert message so I'm going to use my make Ellard function and for a title

116
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:45.430
I'm going to go for error and for message inputs I'm going to use this error that is given to me so

117
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.260
far so good.

118
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.710
So does asks us to provide a default value like before.

119
00:08:50.710 --> 00:09:00.190
So if this error message is empty I'm going to go for error OK and else else meaning the user has been

120
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:07.690
created as we get another message here indicating that that we want to have a cell phone we're here

121
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.580
because we are in a closure and that's right.

122
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.420
So else I want to do a Segway here right.

123
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:22.990
I just want to take user to the other we have controllers but right now I don't have any controllers

124
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:29.980
so I'm just going to take a note saying Segway and maybe we can do something like printing out.

125
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.940
Yep this is created.

126
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:40.270
So let me say OK for right now and let me run this to test actually because we are ready to test to

127
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.330
see if we can create users with passwords and user names.

128
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.770
So let me open my simulator.

129
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:54.500
Come over here and say user name is James and the password will be 1 2 3 4 5 6.

130
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.350
If you say sign up here you go.

131
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.120
We see okay.

132
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.830
Now let's go back to our pass User class OK.

133
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.500
And let me rephrase this.

134
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.740
And here you go we have our user.

135
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:16.650
So we have an object I.D. And we have the user name as James we have the password but it's hidden default.

136
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.870
So we cannot see it.

137
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.180
And we didn't provide any e-mail here.

138
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:29.630
So my suggestion is to get e mails when you deal with a real app so that you can use their e-mails after

139
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.760
words if you need them.

140
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.980
And you know how to do that already.

141
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.590
So let me go back and do something like empty string.

142
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.190
And here you go we have the alert message.

143
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.250
So our function actually works.

144
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.800
So that's good.

145
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.870
We have created our user.

146
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.160
Where are you going to stop here.

147
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.510
And within the next lecture we are going to see how we can sign this user in.
