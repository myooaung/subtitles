Hi.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,520
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see how we can create an ellipse or a circle and a triangle with

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,930
idle B.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,090
So let me really do everything from here and we're going to choose this ellipse or a circle and as you

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,110
can see it's the same thing as a rectangle we get to choose its field we get to choose its borders we

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,720
get to delete the borders we get to increase the size of the borders the thickness of the borders.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,910
So it's the same as a rectangle a few hits shift while you create this view it will create a proportionate

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,060
Elop so it will create a proportional circle for you like this.

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,820
OK.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,560
So if you don't hold on.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,910
So shields then you can create any circle like this.

12
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,850
OK.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,180
And if you want to create a perfect perfect circle like this you have to hold on to shift and you can

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,510
use this option think in here as well.

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,980
So if you hold on to option it will just take the first point as a center and it will expand the circle

16
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,200
around your center.

17
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,940
So that's it actually for the circle let me just try the three a triangle as well.

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,990
So as you can see we can create the triangle here with the same technique but I'm just going to show

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,810
you something that we haven't seen before.

20
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,960
So let me create an image triangle over here and let me go over to select two.

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,910
And now after you create that view if you double click on that it will go into the edit mode.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,710
So now we get to edit and by editing I don't mean changing its color in something we get to edit everything

23
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,860
every aspect of this view like this.

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:03,690
So we can just take one corner and we can just movie there out and we can do that for other coroners

25
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,280
like this as well.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:12,720
So once we create the triangle now we're not down we can just get to we can just change it later on

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,930
and let me take this more on further steps.

28
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,790
So if we come over here we can even choose this path to move around so we can create something like

29
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,680
this rather than a triangle.

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
Now we're having some V shape over here.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,770
So as you can see we have a great freedom here.

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,460
Like we can just play with this thing we can just make this a little bit bigger a little bit longer

33
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,420
and we can just fill this up.

34
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,360
We can do whatever we want with that.

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,720
For example I can rotate this like that.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,620
OK.

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,790
And let me just move this around a little bit and let me zoom out so that you can see it better.

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,860
Let me give it a black color.

39
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:10,440
And like I can't just make this a little bit smaller so that it would look like the Send message thing

40
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,630
or send the direct message thing in Instagram right.

41
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,570
So I can get to edit this a little bit more if I hit double click on that.

42
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,400
And here you go.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,410
Now we have a Send message icon.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,560
Of course it's not perfect right now.

45
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,890
And are you going to have to work on that a little bit if you want to use this on your app.

46
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:40,040
But I believe that's the essence of this section so we get to create some basic images basic visuals

47
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:48,720
easily by using these Adobe axes and as you can see we can do that in circles in ellipses and in every

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,310
other views as well.

49
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,450
Now I get to change this ellipse in whatever whichever way I want.

50
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,010
Like I can't even come here and do like this.

51
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,460
Right.

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,550
So it gives us a great freedom.

53
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:11,840
I get to change the ellipse I get to change the circle I get to just change whatever aspect for their

54
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,350
point that I want in a way that I want.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:23,740
So as you can see I managed to create a very ugly object in a very simple manner.

56
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:33,710
OK and it doesn't make sense to create views like this but it's actually very good to have this freedom

57
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,880
so that we can change the shapes change the views in a way that we want whenever we want.

58
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,150
So let's stop here and move along within the next lecture to see the other views as well.
