00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,090
Hi.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,490
We didn't this lecture we going to create our user interface.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,530
We're going to see how to work with Tab bars.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,170
And before we go on and dive deep in our main dot story board as you can see this is indexing processing

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,060
files after you integrate the parts before you do anything.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,920
Please wait to make sure that this indexing is done because there are too many files in your project

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,620
right now and they're newly integrated in order to make things synchronize.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,650
You just going to have to wait for them to index and remember for the step five.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,830
We have this importing Firebase and adding this firebase app dot configure in our app delegate.

10
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,930
So let's do that.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,500
And then we can go back to our main story Bart.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,750
So first thing to do is just importing this file your base here.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,120
OK.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,080
And as you can see we see the other modules as well.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,360
So everything seems to be working right now but it asks us to import the firebase itself.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,240
So I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,690
OK.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,990
And under D did finish launching with options I'm going to configure the firebase so this is one of

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,610
the first functions that is I executed actually when our app is opened and something like we've did

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,630
load but it's not specific to a controller.

21
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:34,740
OK so we did load these specific to a controller and did finish launching with options of KERS is related

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,040
to whole app.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,530
OK.

24
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,520
So even before the view controller gets slowed this gets cold.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,880
So I'm going to configure my firebase app in here so I'm going to say fi your base app.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,340
So let me go back and check one more time.

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,890
Yes firebase app dot com figure so far based app.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,020
Yes this one dot com figure.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:09,540
So this will actually start our firebase process now generally after we integrate some parts some external

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:17,100
libraries we want to come over simulator and test that to see if that's working but we don't have any

31
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,650
tab bar we don't have any user interface right now.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,720
So quickly let's go to main dot sorry Bert in order to make sure we have a user interface then we can

33
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,780
see what's going on.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,180
So in here we have an empty controller and that's good because we're going to need a sign in sign up

35
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,170
view controller as you have seen in the previous lectures.

36
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:40,850
Right.

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,500
We're going to use this we have controller for that reason we're going to have our sign up and sign

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,870
in.

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,180
But also I want to have a tap bar and some we have controllers connect to that tap bar as well.

40
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:02,610
So remember we could have chosen that when we first create the project but we got we have gone for single

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,760
leave up anyway and now we're going to manually import this and in order to do that if you search for

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,870
tap bar here you will see something called Tap Bar controller if and if you drag and drop this and it's

43
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,740
quite large as you can see it will drag and drop.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,830
So let me just take this view controller and take it to the right side.

45
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,680
So here you see a tab bar controller and two we have controllers connected to that tab bar.

46
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,910
So you see these item one and item two here.

47
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:42,170
So this is for item 1 and this is for item 2 If we click on the item want first will we.

48
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,740
Controller will open if we click on the item to the second view controller will open.

49
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,130
So this is kind of cool.

50
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,110
This is very easy to work with.

51
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,620
We have this tab bar controller and we have two we have controllers connected to that tab bar and we

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,230
can actually add tab bars until 5:00 we have controllers.

53
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,220
OK.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,190
And then the first tab bar I'm going to use a feed view controller and in the second one I'm going to

55
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,700
use a upload we have controller.

56
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,330
So here I'm going to have a sign and sign up.

57
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,820
We have controller I'm going to ask for the user e-mail and the password.

58
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:30,180
I'm going to have a two buttons and I'm going to of course do I say go away from here to that tab bar

59
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,570
controller so later on when and when a user signs in.

60
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,930
We will take them to their feet.

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,440
So in order to do that let me do the Segway here.

62
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:50,430
If I say show Segway as you can see this is not we expect we're going to take care of this just hit

63
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,860
on Segway and you see this is kind of a show Segway without navigation controller.

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,170
OK.

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,710
So this is kind of a pop over over here but I don't want that.

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:08,070
And in this case I don't want a navigation controller as well because I don't want to go back to my

67
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,050
sign in.

68
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:15,690
Once I signed in you shouldn't take back take the user back to the signing we have controller unless

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,650
they log out OK so we don't want navigation controller but we don't want that Pop.

70
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,050
Our feature as well until we have to change our Segway type this time.

71
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,570
So far we have only been working with show say grace and we have dealt with this kind of problem with

72
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,430
navigation controllers.

73
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,790
But if you click on the Segway and go to the identity Inspector you can see the other selections as

74
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,300
well.

75
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,780
For example let me choose one by one.

76
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,990
If I say show detail for example nothing will change.

77
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,640
So let me go to another one like presents model.

78
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,150
So that is the one that we were looking for but I'm going to show you later and this is present as pop

79
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,710
over.

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,180
And this is not we want actually.

81
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,340
And then here we have some deprecated ones of course we are not going to use them.

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
So if you go to present Maudsley you can see the presentation and you can see this.

83
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,310
What we want is the presentation.

84
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,210
If you go to automatic or full screen you will see we want this full screen as you can see we don't

85
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,440
see a pop over here anymore.

86
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,070
So this is exactly what we want.

87
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:40,380
If you go to if you go to automatic this will be the default one and you can actually try and see the

88
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,700
other ones as well.

89
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:50,610
But in most of the cases we want to go go to full screen OK so let's choose full screen.

90
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,980
And here you go.

91
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,380
And we are changing the presentation not the one below it.

92
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,340
OK so presentation full screen.

93
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,820
So this is not a show Segway present model the Segway.

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:09,380
And we are doing a full screen presentation and of course we have to have an identifier as well.

95
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,520
So I'm going to call this to feed view controller.

96
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,460
OK.

97
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:25,770
So if you click on this item over here OK if you E You can change the item one to feed for example and

98
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,860
you can change the icon as well.

99
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,810
Right now we only have some kind of square.

100
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,590
I can hear and you can choose whatever you want from this image if you want to import an image you can

101
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,180
choose that one as well.

102
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,500
For example I'm going to choose the F icon.

103
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,930
OK.

104
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,870
Four feet and indie item two.

105
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm going to go for upload and I'm going to look for you circle.

106
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,690
Ok so now I have a good tab bar in here with feed and upload and I have my Segway.

107
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:06,170
So next thing will be to bring in the buttons and tax fields in my signing we've controller.

108
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,010
OK.

109
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:13,140
So we're going to have two buttons in here one for signing in the other one for signing up.

110
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,980
Signing up means registering for a new account.

111
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,450
OK.

112
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:26,650
So let me change this to sign in and this is for you accounts that have that have been created before.

113
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:31,050
And this one is going to be signed up.

114
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,460
So that's good.

115
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,260
We have our buttons.

116
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,130
Let me try to bring in the text field as well.

117
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,070
So first one will be the e-mail tax free.

118
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:42,420
OK.

119
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,620
This is where we're going to take the input from the user.

120
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,640
So let's say e-mail to here.

121
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,140
Now let me make this into a central way.

122
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,790
So let me put this into the center and copy and paste it.

123
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,780
The second round will be the password.

124
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,230
OK.

125
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,170
And that's it.

126
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,670
Actually let me just make this a little bit in line with each other.

127
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:18,060
Let me shake this down a little bit so that we can have a label as a title over the top like this.

128
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,870
So this is of course not mandatory.

129
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:28,230
I'm just doing this so that we would have a good looking sign in view controller and I'm going to name

130
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,930
this Instagram clone.

131
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:35,030
OK so you can name yours whatever you want.

132
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,120
And I'm going to increase the phones a little bit.

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
So here we go.

134
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:47,820
We have a good looking signing we've controller in which we will have to sign the user up or in.

135
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,510
So here you go.

136
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:57,410
Now let me give the suggested constraints here so that they will be sitting on the right place when

137
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:06,190
we open it up and the next thing will be to actually define all of these values in my view controller.

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,000
So let me go to buttons first.

139
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,350
First I'm going to drag and drop as an action and I'm going to call the sign in clicked.

140
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,630
And of course we're going to have a sign up clicked as well.

141
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,950
So let me bring in this one.

142
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:28,100
Sign up clicks and we're going to have to text fields here.

143
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,110
So first of which e-mail tax.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,650
OK I'm going to call this e-mail text.

145
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,980
And the second one will be the password text so password text.

146
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,820
So here you go.

147
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:50,290
We're done with the sign in button and sign up by but then signing view controller user face in fact.

148
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,870
So in the sign and clicked let me perform a safe way for right now as an example.

149
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,270
OK.

150
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,730
To see if my tab bar is working.

151
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,950
I'm going to call this to feed we and sender will be Neal.

152
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:11,330
I'm going to run this so remember I have imported why you're basing my project and I have opened the

153
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:19,460
workspace project even though it got indexed it will still take a little bit time to build all of these

154
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:27,320
files for the first time after you do this once it will get much more faster it will just start like

155
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,210
it used to starts in general a examples like when you don't use Firebase but for right now we're going

156
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:42,680
to have to wait to build all of this file based modules so that we will have a working simulator.

157
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,520
And of course feel free to pause the video and come back when it's done so that we can see if our tap

158
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,690
bar is working in a way that we do we want it to.

159
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,320
OK.

160
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:03,140
By the way on the left hand side you see a lot of warnings and they're all in the firebase pops.

161
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,470
OK.

162
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:08,170
So when they're in the pods you don't have to worry about that.

163
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:15,470
And the yellow means warnings and red means errors if you get any error you won't even be able to run

164
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,110
your project on a simulator.

165
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,170
If you get a warning it just warns you to take care of possible future problems.

166
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,090
And if you're working with a pod you just don't have to worry about that.

167
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,590
So here you go.

168
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:38,030
We're good looking in here and if I hit on this sign in as you can see it doesn't pop over or anything

169
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,190
it just brings us to the tab bar in which we have two tabs first of which feed.

170
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,220
Second one is upload.

171
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,880
So when I click on this it just actually changes the view controller but we cannot see it because we

172
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,240
don't have anything in them.

173
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,100
But right now we know that this is working.

174
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:06,020
And of course we have some problems here like we don't have a logout type bar or we don't have a logout

175
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:13,010
button so we cannot go back to our design in we have control or even though if we wanted to we have

176
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:20,890
to add a new wave controller here we outside the need tab bar and then later on of course we re going

177
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,790
to have to check the user.

178
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:28,170
We're going to have to create the user and check to see if they're giving the right credentials.

179
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,910
Only then we're going to perform the Segway and let them in.

180
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,360
Let's do these in the next lecture.
