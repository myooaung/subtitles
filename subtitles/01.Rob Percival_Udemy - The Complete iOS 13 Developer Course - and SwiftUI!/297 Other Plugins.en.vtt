Hi.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:08.160
We didn't this lecture regarding to see in other examples of plug ins so that we can know how to work

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.330
with them efficiently.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.190
So let me create the new art bird over here OK.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.980
And this time let's go for this pattern maker.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.400
OK.

7
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.990
Since I already have this.

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.800
And let me change his name to something like dating app.

9
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.840
OK.

10
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.980
So this will be our dating app design and this will be our other example of plug ins and we can just

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.020
try this pattern maker as well.

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.840
So it actually lets us create patterns using some shapes or images of cars.

13
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.730
I cannot do that right now because I don't have any shapes but in fact I can choose how many columns

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.380
and how many rows I want in a pattern like this or debt.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.810
So if you say bank pattern right now it won't make any pattern because I don't have any shape.

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.840
So let me create a shape over here so that we can work with that one.

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.990
So let me bring in some circle again and this time I'm just going to fill this in with a color like

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.860
that.

19
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.970
OK.

20
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.270
And then I'm just going to use this to create this scattered pattern.

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.030
And as you can see it easily created the pattern in less than one seconds.

22
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.990
And of course we can go with that one as well but since I already have too much it's created a lot of

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.120
circles over here so let me do common Z and just with one circle let me try to create this pattern and

24
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:47.460
as you can see I have these dice shaped color dice shaped actually designed so that I can even use this

25
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.920
as a dice or any other pattern that I want in my app.

26
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.970
So as you can see it's very easy to use plugins and it's actually very helpful if you try to come up

27
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.950
with a shape like that.

28
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.050
So let me try to find another one and as you can see we have a lot of options.

29
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.590
And if you want to go for most popular ones you can just come over year and choose the popular to see

30
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.230
it as sending like that.

31
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.160
So as you can see the UI faces is the most popular one at this moment actually.

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.660
And here you go.

33
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.410
Now we have other options like on icons and symbols.

34
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.190
So let's try to install this and use this.

35
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.370
So let means told us and you will see it will provide us with very good icons and symbols so that we

36
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.850
can use it on our own projects.

37
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.070
So let me close this down and let me come over here and it asks us to search for an icon.

38
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.040
For example I'm just going to go for search.

39
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.940
So since we already have done one before and as you can see we have a lot of options over here.

40
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.860
So if you want to use any of them you can just click onto them and it will just add it to your project.

41
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.640
So here you go.

42
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.750
Now we have some kind of search icon over here and it looks like ours but it's much better as you can

43
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.250
see it has this little options over here.

44
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.060
And the best part of this you can actually get to edit them as well in a way that you want.

45
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:33.060
So you can get icons from that plugin and you can try to create your own way by editing them later on.

46
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.600
So I suggest you go for the flag as a use search for the most popular runs and try to use it to make

47
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.530
yourself self comfortable beds and there'll be seen in a much better way.

48
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.130
So we're going to stop here and continue on our practices in the next lecture.
