00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.400
Hi within this lecture regrouping to see how we can get the values that we want from this JCU response

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.530
so that we can finalize our app.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.950
So what we want is to have a dictionary in here so that we can get the values that we want.

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.470
And this time if you write Jason's response you will see that this has the object type of any.

5
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.500
So first of all I don't want this to be any object.

6
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.340
I want this to be a dictionary so that I can get whatever I want from out of this dictionary.

7
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.330
OK.

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.570
And best way to do this actually.

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.700
Cat casting.

10
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.860
This Jason responds to be a dictionary.

11
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.690
So I'm going to cast this to be a dictionary of string to any.

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.100
Okay so why am I doing this.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.870
Like can I do a string to string or string two integer.

14
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.810
No I cannot do that I have to cast as a string to any.

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.720
Because remember if you go to other actual data you will see that this is a string.

16
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.250
The keys are actually strings but the values are not strings so this is a boolean disease an integer.

17
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.350
So this is a string and this is actually a dictionary itself.

18
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.540
So we have every kind of objects in the value type so I cannot do a single value here so I have to do

19
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
is drink to any dictionary.

20
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.290
So if you're working with another API another response of course you can do something like string to

21
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.910
shrink but in our case it's not string to string or string to integer it's string to any.

22
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.580
And once I do that I can't try to get the values by providing some cheese.

23
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.360
For example let me try to print the success of this Jason response.

24
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.620
So this is either going to be true or false are something like 1 or 0.

25
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.630
OK so let me print this out and we're going to see the results in the logs once we hit get rates.

26
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.890
And as you can see we see the van.

27
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.560
So this is optional right now but we're going to take care of that.

28
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.880
And if this was a failure then I would have gotten zero.

29
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.200
Now it means that I'm getting the success.

30
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.400
So can I get this right dictionary.

31
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.600
So I'm not interested in the timestamp bays or data right now but I'm interested in the rates.

32
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.190
So this will give me a dictionary as well.

33
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.060
Right.

34
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.510
And I'm interested in that dictionary.

35
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.550
So this is going to be the rates of keys and the values of the rates.

36
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.660
So if I say rates over here it will surely print out the rates.

37
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.480
Right.

38
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.520
So I'm digging my way one by one till I reach the values that I want.

39
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.980
As you can see.

40
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.980
So here you go.

41
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.530
Now I have the rates.

42
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.680
So this is good.

43
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:22.980
Now all I have to do is just to create a structure that I can use this as a dictionary as well.

44
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.430
So this is kind of optional right.

45
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.560
Now I cannot be sure of the types.

46
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.050
OK.

47
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.190
So I'm going to use the flat in order to cast this as a dictionary.

48
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.460
We're going to see what we are getting clearly.

49
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.210
OK.

50
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.420
So I'm going to say a flat rate and this is going to be Jason response rates.

51
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.330
OK.

52
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.580
I'm going to cast this optionally as a string to any dictionary.

53
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.180
And let me open curly braces in here.

54
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:07.560
And this time this string to any actually can be something like string to double or string to integer

55
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.390
as you can see this kind of looks like a double but it may be a string as well in order to understand

56
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.730
this.

57
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.370
I'm going to print the rates so let me print the rates are we going to see the actual rates in here

58
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.950
once we click on this gets rates above them.

59
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.230
And here you go.

60
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.760
Now as you can see the keys are strings and the values look like doubles K rather than strings.

61
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.940
Of course we can still test design we can actually see if this works or not.

62
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.650
And best way to do this since we have this dictionary is a string to any.

63
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.630
We can just call whatever we want.

64
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.750
Okay whatever key where they we value that we want and we can't try to cast this as double or cast as

65
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.470
teacher or test is a string.

66
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.960
Then we can be sure of the type.

67
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.250
Once we do that we are going to display them in our label says vote.

68
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.830
So this is kind of the end of our app.

69
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.280
Okay so I'm going to say if that and we can just start working with CJD.

70
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.690
Okay so this is Canadian dollars and this is going to be something like a rates.

71
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:39.320
Okay I'm going to call this rights dictionary and in the key I'm going to U.S.A. D it's uppercase letters

72
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.500
of curse and I will try to cast as optionally as strings first.

73
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.510
Okay so this is going to be string and I will see if this works or not.

74
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.960
So let me try to print this cat and let me run this.

75
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.720
OK.

76
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.240
And let's see if we can print the cat or not.

77
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.210
So the value looks like double to me.

78
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.430
And as you can see once I hit the get get rates I don't see the results.

79
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.650
So let's try to do this like a double.

80
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.810
And this time I believe we're going to see the results and then we can start working on our process

81
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.930
with other values as well as you can see.

82
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.340
Now we have one point four eight in the cat.

83
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.490
And in order to be sure you can't go over this browser and look the value of CAD.

84
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.360
Yep this is 148.

85
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.080
So this actually works.

86
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.910
Now you see the importance of studying your Jason response as you can see we get the double.

87
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:56.420
And we have a string to any dictionary and we try to cast as a string and it didn't work.

88
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.600
So now I had to cast as as double.

89
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.740
So if you're working with another API or another Jason response you have to make sure that you adjust

90
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.630
codes according to their structure.

91
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.570
OK.

92
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.550
And in here I'm going to say South that Chad labeled dog tags and this is going to be Chad.

93
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:24.910
And since this gives me a double I'm going to do this like this string cat.

94
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:34.170
So all we need to do is just run this and let's see if we can display this cat value in the CAT label.

95
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.710
And here you go.

96
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.300
So this is working.

97
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.370
And this is not exactly what I want.

98
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.580
Let me do it like this.

99
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.500
Let me create this string over here as say cat column.

100
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.130
And open this back backslash parentheses with Cat.

101
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:56.360
And this will convert these interests drink automatically so that we can have a nicer look like this.

102
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.050
Here you go.

103
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.360
Now it's working.

104
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.230
So we're going to do this for other currencies as well.

105
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.790
So I'm going to copy and paste this six times.

106
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.650
OK.

107
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.790
So let me go over here and paste all of this.

108
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.590
Now instead of CAD I'm going to go for C H F.

109
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:23.600
So this is going to be my Swiss franc and this is CHF that's these big letters and this one as well.

110
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.860
And in the church one I'm going to have GBP.

111
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.480
So this is GBP and GBP again.

112
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.590
And this is great Britain pounds.

113
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.220
So the fourth one is Japanese yen.

114
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.190
So JP Vi.

115
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.860
Okay.

116
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.920
So this is again JPY.

117
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:50.990
Let me change all of this JPY and the fifth one USD.

118
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:58.460
Yep the popular Rome USD the US the USD and again the USD.

119
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.060
So here we go.

120
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.170
Final one.

121
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:02.690
Yeah.

122
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.250
We cannot say TR VI because it will confuse it for try.

123
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.530
So I'm going to call this Turkish.

124
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.880
OK.

125
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.430
We can't say to our why in here and here as well.

126
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.260
But this will be Turkish and we don't need the seventh one.

127
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.320
So I believe we are ready to test this.

128
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.870
Let me run this and let's see if we can get all the details in here.

129
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.870
OK.

130
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.160
Let's click on the Get rates.

131
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.100
And here you go.

132
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:38.000
We didn't get the data because I didn't change the label variables at all.

133
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:53.060
So in here we have to have C H F label GBP label JPY label U.S. the label and this t r y label.

134
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.400
Now let's try one more time and hopefully we will get this right this time.

135
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.020
OK let's run this in our simulator and hit the button.

136
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.110
And here you go.

137
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.690
Now we have the rights.

138
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.120
So this is cool.

139
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:15.470
Now we are getting information from the Internet and we're getting this from an API.

140
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:25.260
And we're passing we're processing the Jason data and he can use does API you can use this Jason techniques

141
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.120
in other API has other projects other platforms as well.

142
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.640
I believe you're not ready to go with something big like Facebook or Twitter at this point but you can

143
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.950
try something with like a weather API some simple API like this.

144
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:50.220
And after you complete this cars I'm sure you're going to be ready to go.

145
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:58.860
Go ahead and work with some big API like Facebook or other runs and you will actually be more capable

146
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:06.460
of using Swift's once you complete this cars like the Advanced swift section and other sections as well.

147
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:14.010
And this will give you a big freedom you know to integrate data as from the cloud servers and use it

148
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.290
on your own apps.

149
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:22.620
And this is not even the only thing that's we're going to be doing with the cloud servers our internet.

150
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:29.340
We're going to learn to fire your base we're going to create our users we're going to save data to a

151
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.260
database.

152
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.670
We're going to upload some image.

153
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.150
We're going to download some images as well.

154
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:43.550
And it will be much more clear to you to how to use cloud servers in your abs.

155
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.780
Once we do that both for right now.

156
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.700
Congratulations on your first Internet active app.

157
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.570
So let's stop here and continue within the next section.
