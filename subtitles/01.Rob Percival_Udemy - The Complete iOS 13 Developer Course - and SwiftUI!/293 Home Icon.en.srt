00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,410
Hi within the section re going to practice what we have learned in the previous section.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,220
So we are going to be driving some icons and we are going to learn how to create logos icons for our

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,490
app and in order to do that we are going to use that there'll be sixty one more time and you will see

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,920
it in practice.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,020
So I'm going to go for custom sites this time because we are going to be creating icons rather than

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,510
a full size screen.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,370
So I'm going to come up here and choose the art part okay.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,180
Then I choose this it creates the iPhone X as default but actually let me show you another thing.

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,840
So let me delete all of this and let me go over here and choose one.

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,430
If you draw something over here it will create this in a specified size.

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,960
Of course you can actually change the size after you create any art bought by clicking over the art

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,430
board and coming to properties inspector as well.

13
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,310
So let me go to Google and search for a concise so that we would know what I can say is that we have

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,600
to use.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,520
OK.

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,520
So here as you can see there are a lot of different options for icons.

17
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,460
But in my experience I have seen mostly we use this 24 by 24.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,220
OK.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:35,520
Of course we can adjust it to another size later on but I'm going to go for 24 and 24 so that we would

20
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,170
have a realistic art board over here to create our icon.

21
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:49,140
So for our first icon I'm thinking of and a home button icon like in Instagram.

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,970
And this is generally in the shape of a house or of a home.

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,800
OK.

24
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,160
So we're going to create a home over here.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,280
You know we're going to do that.

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,010
I'm just going to take this rectangle and just draw some rectangle over here.

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,800
OK.

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,020
So let me put it this way.

29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:14,100
And then later on I'm going to need their roof and in order to that I'm just going to use this triangle.

30
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:23,550
And let me just put this triangle on top of my house over here and let me try to adjust its size by

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,530
making this a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller.

32
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,270
And I believe.

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,590
Yeah.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,620
We can't leave it like that or we can just do like this.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,660
OK.

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,700
So let me try to adjust this Here you go.

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,490
Now we have a house OK.

38
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,420
We have the roof.

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,860
We have the house.

40
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,950
So let me draw a door as well in the shape of a rectangle one more time.

41
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,800
Of course we can adjust does a little bit.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,450
So it looks like a house.

43
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,700
It looks like and home.

44
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:04,740
I came to me but we can just do some tweaks over here to make it look better like this or like that.

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,640
OK.

46
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:15,120
So of course you can try to make this in a better way by adjusting the size or just deleting some lines

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,040
on the bottom.

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,180
So let me just rename this by double clicking over here and I'm going to name this home icon or a house

49
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,010
I can.

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,920
OK.

51
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:33,600
And then if you do comment C.M. comment we will just copy the art bought and paste it in the right hand

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,860
side of this current artwork and I'm just going to call this home I can too so that we can create another

53
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,760
house icon over here with another technique.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,180
So over here we have this icon.

55
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:54,130
But maybe you didn't like it so I'm going to delete this and I'm just going to use pen this time.

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,560
So I'm going to start from here and draw a straight line you can he hold on to shift in order to draw

57
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:10,200
this line in a straight way and I'm just going to draw my house like this and then I'm going to come

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,590
over here and close this line and then later on you can just draw a door over here like that.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,690
OK.

60
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:25,200
And this would be another example of an home icon like this.

61
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:31,020
So if you're not satisfied with either of those of course you can just adjusted that little bit so that

62
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,870
you can see this in a better way like that.

63
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,240
OK.

64
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,280
You can just make it central you can make it a little bit smaller.

65
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,390
OK.

66
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,540
And don't worry if you're not satisfied with this at all.

67
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm going to show you how to find a better I can so that you can use it for free in your apps later

68
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,410
on as well.

69
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:02,640
But right now just try to play with it and try to make it look better so this is how we try and draw

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,390
icons in Adobe.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,050
STEVE In fact I'm going to stop you about within the next lecture we're going to see another examples

72
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,720
of I can draw Rick.
