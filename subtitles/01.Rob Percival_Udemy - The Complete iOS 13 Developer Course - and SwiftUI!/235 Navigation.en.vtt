00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.650
Hi within this lecture we agreed to create our second view.

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.590
Are we going to see how we can navigate from our first view to the second view.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.300
And in order to do that I'm going to create my second view first.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.580
So come over here and say new file and choose swift UI view.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.420
And I'm going to name mine details view because we're going to show the details of the selected element

6
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.090
inside of that view.

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.440
OK once we do that we get a brand new view and of course we are going to do some design over here a

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.460
user interface over here as well showing the image the name and the description of the selected item.

9
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.810
But for right now I'm just going to live it as it is because first we have to understand how we can

10
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.070
navigate from here to other view.

11
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.640
And there are a couple of ways to do that and we're going to see the most common one which is a navigation

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.240
link.

13
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.930
So we're going to wrap every element with a navigation link so that when we hit one of them it will

14
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.630
take us to the details view.

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.460
So in order to do that I'm going to come over here to my for each and I'm going to write navigation

16
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.320
link.

17
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.910
OK.

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.270
Once you do that you can open up parentheses and not like but the link open the parentheses to see the

19
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390
parameters.

20
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.480
And for some reason it doesn't show up or here.

21
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:45.510
So let me try it at both so that you can see what it is asking for because it's important to see the

22
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.230
parameter names.

23
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.720
So let me right now ligation link over here and you will see that it will ask us for a destination.

24
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.480
Yep this one and a label.

25
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.980
So we're going to provide the destination as the destination view that we're going to go and for a label

26
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.290
of course we are going to provide what we want to show inside of that navigation link.

27
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.500
So our destination is the details view K so open and close parentheses.

28
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.280
And if you hit enter over here it will create a coding block for you in which you will display the text

29
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.480
actually.

30
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:33.600
So let me take this from here and cut it and pasted over here and I'm going to take this text inside

31
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.490
of my navigation link.

32
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.400
So it means that I'm wrapping everything around with that navigation link inside of these lists.

33
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.170
Of course not the section names but just the element names.

34
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.980
OK.

35
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.060
So as you can see now it's chosing green.

36
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.850
And if I run this in live mode I cannot even click one of them because we cannot use navigation link

37
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.500
like this in order to use a navigation link.

38
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.430
We have to have a navigation view.

39
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.700
This is like embedding in and navigation controller inside of your view controller in the main storyboard.

40
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.950
So you have a navigation bar you have a navigation controller.

41
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.360
And when you go to another view you will get a free back by them to navigate back.

42
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.580
That's exactly what we are trying to do here.

43
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.720
We are going to have an navigation view before everything else inside of our body and we are going to

44
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.570
use our navigation view.

45
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240
So let's call this navigation view.

46
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.660
Let's open the parentheses and close it over here.

47
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.110
Now you will see it will push down a little bit because we have our navigation bar right now.

48
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.260
And if we run this now we get to click each of the elements.

49
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.720
So here you go it takes us to the details view less click each of them to see if they work or not.

50
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.690
Here you go.

51
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.970
Now they work.

52
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:14.160
They take us to the details view and I cannot even click on the section names because I wrapped around

53
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.060
text element that name only.

54
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.750
OK.

55
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.280
And if you come over here to that list you can have a navigation bar.

56
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.410
This one OK navigation bar Title I mean you can go for navigation bar title and in the navigation bar

57
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.920
title you can actually write whatever you want something like favorite book will do the job so that

58
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.230
you will have a title of your own app.

59
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.620
So that's cool.

60
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:51.180
Now all we have to do is just to figure out how to pass information have to pass the selected model

61
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.860
selected instance to the other view so that we can use its attributes use its properties in order to

62
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.520
display the displayed the name and the description.

63
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.560
Let's do that in the next lecture.
