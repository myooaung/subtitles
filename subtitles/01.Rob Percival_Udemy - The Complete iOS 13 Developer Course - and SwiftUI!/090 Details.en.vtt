00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.160
Hi.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.640
We didn't this lecture we going to finalize our app by displaying the image name and the job of the

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.000
chosen Simpson.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.920
In the details we have comptroller.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.210
So we already have our views defined in here like image you you name labels job label.

6
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.250
We are going to need as Simpson object in this class.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:23.970
Right.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.430
And the Simpson object will come from the main view controller so we can easily create our Simpson object

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.090
right now in here and we can try to display the related value using related views.

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.100
So let's say this is going to be a selected Simpson and this will be as Simpson type.

11
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.290
I will later on get this value from real controller dot swift using prepare for Segway function as we

12
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.040
did before.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.540
And in here I'm going to go over and say that name label dot tax is going to be selected Simpson Dot's

14
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.810
name.

15
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.910
So this is going to take the selected Simpson dot name.

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:17.880
So if I do can't control beads will give me an error saying that this has no initialize or and I cannot

17
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.640
go for an initializing kind of thing in here like this because it will ask me for some parameters.

18
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.370
All right.

19
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.980
So I cannot construct a Simpson object in here simply because I don't know the values I cannot do it

20
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.430
like this without giving any parameters.

21
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.360
So this is kind of tricky rather than doing this I'm going to go over and say this is going to be a

22
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.880
Simpson type but it's going to be optional at this point.

23
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.960
I don't know whether it's going to be here or not but in real life of course it's going to be there

24
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.050
because I'm going to pass that information from view controller and if I do this optional this won't

25
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.250
be an issue on this I give an optional value to here as well.

26
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.450
So rather than saying name they will dot taxes selected Simpson that name.

27
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
I'm going to say selected Simpson optional dot name.

28
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.010
And since I'm going to pass this information as I said before this won't create any issue for me and

29
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.440
this is much safer.

30
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:36.210
So again job labeled up tax is selected seems some optional dot job ands image view again.

31
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.700
So image you use dot image.

32
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.150
So this is going to be selected Simpson that image these are all options.

33
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.740
So that's great.

34
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.610
We're done.

35
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.670
And as you can see when you work with the models when you work with that class it's much clear what

36
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.380
you're trying to do right.

37
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.400
We're displaying the name job and image Sheen here as much more structural much more clear code.

38
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.550
So how we gonna get the selected Simpson be equal to this chosen Simpson in the table view in the weave

39
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:20.640
controller dot Swift the same way as before regarding to use prepay for Segway we going to use our firm

40
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.190
Segway and we're going to use the old Segway related functions.

41
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.880
OK.

42
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
So first of all let me call this did select throw.

43
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.850
OK.

44
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.420
Remember this is the function that gets cold when somebody clicks one of the items on the table for

45
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.680
you.

46
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.830
So I'm going to create a Segway here rather not create.

47
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.660
Actually I'm going to perform a Segway here.

48
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.440
So say two details we see.

49
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.760
So that was our Segway identify right.

50
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.180
Let me check.

51
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.330
So let me go over here.

52
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.690
Yep.

53
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.210
Two details V.C..

54
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.830
This has to be exactly the same.

55
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.890
So make sure that you're writing the same thing.

56
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
And here I'm going to use no sender.

57
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.590
And before we do that of course once somebody clicks one of the items we're going to make sure that

58
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:25.830
we're getting that number we're getting the index of the clicked Simpson chosen Simpson and we're assigning

59
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.210
this to be a variable so that we can use it on our p paid for Segway function.

60
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.850
So I'm going to say chosen Simpson my Simpsons and indexed path Doctorow.

61
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.740
So this will give me the selected Simpson over here.

62
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.530
Right.

63
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:53.030
So I can come over to my prepared for Segway function and use these variable so that's it for.

64
00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:01.040
Did select Roe and let's go over here to another function to create another function as they prepare

65
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.200
for Segway.

66
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.370
So what do we do here.

67
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.140
First we check if these Segway that we're talking about is the same Segway that we want to commit all

68
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.250
of these operations.

69
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:23.930
So I'm going to say if Segway Dot's identifier is really the two details we see and then this app again

70
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.570
we only have one Segway but it's kind of important to get this habit of checking this identifier because

71
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.970
you're going to have a lot of SIG ways in your apps later on.

72
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:47.870
So we're going to have to take this chosen Simpson and pass his information to our second view controller

73
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.360
again in order to do that.

74
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.450
We cannot define those Simpson in here because we want to take the selected Simpson and make this equal

75
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.850
to chosen Simpson.

76
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.890
So let's adjust is a little bit let's first create the destination view controller.

77
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.610
OK.

78
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.060
So destination we see is going to be Segway.

79
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.560
That destination.

80
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.860
And remember we have to first cast this as details we see.

81
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.190
OK.

82
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:25.920
And now I if I do comment be I can't reach the details we these attributes and properties.

83
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:35.270
So let me go over here and do comment B and say details we see or destination we see sorry destination

84
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.020
we see dot image view.

85
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:46.160
Job label we have seen all the views here and what we want is the selected Simpson I'm going to make

86
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.490
the Z call to chosen Simpson and as I said before we cannot do that over here.

87
00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:01.290
We have to define this in our class but outside of this function because I cannot simply come over here

88
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:08.150
and say chosen Simpson It is not in the scope we have gone over this several times.

89
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.260
So let me delete this and go over to the top here.

90
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.890
Let me create a new variable called chosen Simpson.

91
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.290
And this is going to be a Simpson.

92
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.000
And again if I open this parentheses it will ask me for some parameters.

93
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.190
I don't want that I'm going to do the exact same thing as before I am going to say that this is going

94
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.240
to be a Simpson type.

95
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.960
OK.

96
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.710
It will give me an error.

97
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.390
So I'm going to make this optional.

98
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:48.110
So I have I chosen Simpson of variable and it's an optional Simpson type.

99
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:57.080
So here as you can see now I have this I can go over here as say chosen Simpson my Simpson's array index

100
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.570
path.

101
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.510
That's row.

102
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.930
So this is now OK.

103
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:08.250
It should be working once I come over here as a chosen Simpson.

104
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.560
That's great.

105
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.320
Now we can test is actually we're done with our app.

106
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.580
We have written so many codes during this building process.

107
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.620
And let's test them all.

108
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.630
So click on Homer.

109
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.570
Here we go Homer Simpson nuclear safety.

110
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.520
Let's go for March.

111
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.050
Marge Simpson housewife.

112
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.110
So let's go for Bart Bart Simpson students.

113
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.000
So this looks good right.

114
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.520
Lisa student and that's test for Maggie.

115
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.320
Maggie Simpson baby.

116
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.420
So this is great.

117
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.210
This is what we had in mind when we first started this project.

118
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:58.160
Again you have learned a lot during this section you have learned what it feels to be working with object

119
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.290
oriented programming with classes with models.

120
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.460
So you have created your own class in which you define your own attributes.

121
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:15.910
With some initial ideas and you created your Simpson objects you set up your table view you connected

122
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:23.630
those arrays with table we use and you displayed older later to the information in a structural manner.

123
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.440
So far so good I hope you enjoyed this section.

124
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.660
So we're going to stop here and we're going to continue within the next section.
