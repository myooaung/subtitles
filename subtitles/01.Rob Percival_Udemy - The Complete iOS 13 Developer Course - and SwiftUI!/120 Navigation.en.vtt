00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.400
Hi.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.380
We didn't this lecture regrowing to learn how to add to navigation and finalize our travel book app

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.690
right now.

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.720
That may click on this detailed disclosure by them we want to open a navigation so we have to find a

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.730
way to detect if the user tapped on this accessory view and there is a function to do that of course.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.920
Remember this is called D the right call out accessory view and this is generally called accessory view.

7
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.520
So if you come over here and search for call out accessory control tapped.

8
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.780
So this is the function that are that we're looking for.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.270
If you double click on this function you will see something like this call out accessory control tapped.

10
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.880
So our call out accessory control in this case the detailed disclosure by them.

11
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.330
OK.

12
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.310
So when a user taps on this button this function will get called automatically so under it is function

13
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.660
we have to open the navigation in order to do that.

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.190
I'm just going to control if selected tidily is not an empty string again because why.

15
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.370
Because we're going to need the latitude and longitude in order to just open the navigation and we have

16
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:31.590
to make sure they are not nil or they do not have any other value than we are looking for.

17
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.240
So if the selected title is not an empty string it means that we have a chosen latitude chosen longitude

18
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.430
and we can safely use them.

19
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.370
Okay.

20
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.150
And the reason why we're using them we're going to leverage a function called leverage a method called

21
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.950
S.L. geo location.

22
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.310
I'm going to show you whether this but we're going to take this imitation latitude and annotation longitude

23
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.010
before we forget the what were those.

24
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.460
Okay.

25
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.410
So we're going to use those in other colored accessory control tapped function.

26
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.040
So what is the CAGR coder that I'm talking about.

27
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.400
If you're right si Alger coder This is an interface for converting between geographic cordons and place

28
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.210
names.

29
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:31.510
So if you say CAGR coder dot reverse zip code location that will give us some object called place Mark.

30
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.450
And this is what we need to open in the navigation.

31
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.190
Okay.

32
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.070
So we have to use this and this will give us and place Mark and in order to use this as you can see

33
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.620
it asks asks for a location.

34
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.990
So this is kind of a function that we will use to give the location and convert it to a place Mark.

35
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.430
And then we will use that place Mark object to open in navigation.

36
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.760
But before we do that of Curt we need a location every again to create that location by using a notation

37
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.430
latitude and on notation longitude.

38
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.340
And that's the reason why we're checking for if selected title is not empty.

39
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.290
So let's go first see our location and this will just ask for some parameters and easiest way to do

40
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.290
that is to choose this latitude and longitude one.

41
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.610
And we're not going for second location according to these because in the Seattle geo cadre function

42
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.160
that we have seen before it asks for this yet location specifically.

43
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.070
So I'm gonna say annotation latitude and annotation longitude in here.

44
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.750
Okay.

45
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.300
And this will create my Seattle location and I named this request location.

46
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.630
But you can name this whatever you want.

47
00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:02.760
Okay now I can easily come over here under if select the title is not empty string I'm still in this

48
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:12.000
if block after I create my request location I can just call the Seattle location dot geo reverse thing

49
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.550
that I have shown you and I can give this request location as a parameter so let's do that and see what

50
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.470
we get back.

51
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.480
Sociology or color dot reverse geo called location.

52
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.870
Okay.

53
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.720
This form.

54
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.260
So find one with the Beats location and completion handler so what is a completion handler.

55
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.940
Let me write the location here first so request location and if you come over this completion handler

56
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.890
on the hit Enter you can see that we are getting two outputs back.

57
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.460
So first we are getting an array on in which we have a sealed place Mark objects.

58
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.200
So that's what we were looking for.

59
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.560
Remember we going to use it for our navigation so I'm going to call this place marks.

60
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.100
And the second one will be in there so I'm going to call this error.

61
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.530
So what's a callback.

62
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.360
What's a completion.

63
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.540
So this type is called closure.

64
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.870
Then we get something back from a function and it's called callback function in some of the programming

65
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.870
languages.

66
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.900
It gives us some outputs and we generally get some multiple outputs here like a completion error or

67
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.980
place marks.

68
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:39.130
So vendor's action completes we get some output as a result of that action action.

69
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.230
And we can decide what to do with next.

70
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.850
For example we can check to see if error is not nil if error is not nil down can display an alert message

71
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.670
to the user or if placed marks is not nil.

72
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.710
We can go ahead and do whatever we want to do.

73
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.950
So I'm gonna do that exactly safe place marks that count is actually bigger than zero then I can create

74
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.930
my place Mark object right.

75
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.730
I can just call new place Mark is an M K place Mark I'm going to get this place Mark from my place Mark's

76
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:22.630
array so all I'm doing this for is to find a place Mark or object to using my navigation remember and

77
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.520
this is giving us an error.

78
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.340
So let me do a command B to see if this an actual error.

79
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.010
Yes that's an actual error.

80
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.700
It says that place marks is actually optional.

81
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:42.880
So either we make this force a wrap and I believe it's not too safe and it's not a safe operation to

82
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.700
do that so I'm going to go ahead and use that E flat.

83
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.380
Okay I'm just going to say a flat place Mark equals to place marks.

84
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.500
It means that if place marks is not actually nil.

85
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.360
So if place Mark is equal to place marks that I can come over here.

86
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.980
Safe place Mark dots count is bigger than zero.

87
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.440
So I replaced place marks with that place Mark object.

88
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.560
OK.

89
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.650
And just for a variable name I mean I replace the name place marks with the place Mark.

90
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.310
And in here I believe.

91
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.770
Let's name place Mark.

92
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.170
M.K..

93
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.790
Place Mark.

94
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.990
Yeah.

95
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.300
We have to change this place marks as well because we have renamed this with a flat and since we have

96
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.600
our place Mark we have to create an item a map item.

97
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.480
OK.

98
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.080
You're going to see whether this.

99
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.770
So let me just to write this.

100
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.050
I'm going to say let's item and this will be an M K map item.

101
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:46.480
OK.

102
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.500
So this is a point of interest on the map.

103
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.960
So this will ask us for a place Mark.

104
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.530
And this is the place Mark that we have been trying to figure out.

105
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.910
And now I can come over here and I can give it a name and you will see why I'm doing this I'm just going

106
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:09.430
to say chosen title from here so let me see what was our title.

107
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.470
Yeah.

108
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.920
A notation title.

109
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.970
OK.

110
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:21.490
So let's say our notation title it will display a title for us when we go for navigation and it gives

111
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:27.180
us an error since we are in a closure we have to say s dot notation title.

112
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.670
Okay.

113
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:34.600
Remember this is a closure type in order to make this explicit we are referring to a notation title

114
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.910
that we have created before.

115
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:44.620
Now I can come over here and say item dot opening maps and it will ask me for a launch options and this

116
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:52.090
is what it's going to bring out the navigation for example let me create this launch options as you

117
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:59.260
can see this asks for a string to any dictionary and the string that I'm looking for is actually DMK

118
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.740
launch options mode.

119
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:11.310
OK mult key so I'm going to define my M.K. launch options directions mult key so whether I'm going buy

120
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.700
a car or a bicycle or on food.

121
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.650
So if you write M.K. launch options here I'm going to go for driving.

122
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.830
OK so it will just show me how to navigate between points v driving.

123
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.750
Of course we can change that but this will be the default.

124
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:38.630
So let me run this and if the Berkes I'm going to take you over all these calls one more one last time

125
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:47.900
so you will understand it better Don't worry if I click on this it will open the maps and it will just

126
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:55.580
bring up and navigation I need to ask me for a permission of course I'm going to give it one and here

127
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:55.930
I am.

128
00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:01.700
This is my current location and it gives me a navigation to the Notre Dame Cathedral.

129
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.070
So that's very cool right.

130
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.930
I can just see how can I go to Notre Dame Cathedral by car or by walk I can choose other options as

131
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.160
well.

132
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:17.510
But since I made this a default option I'm seeing the driving first.

133
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.410
So I have to bring up the navigation by saying items that open the maps.

134
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.670
And it asks me for it launch options and it's very easy to create that.

135
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:38.450
But before we do that we have to create this item with a place Mark and we create this place Mark from

136
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:45.560
Seattle geo coded dot through geo called location and in order to get this place marks array we have

137
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:53.600
to give in a location so the location will be the annotation glad to do that on notation longitude.

138
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.550
And it says that yet you created it but you didn't change it.

139
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.920
So let me do it with let.

140
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.540
Yes it actually makes more sense.

141
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.950
So I believe that I explained that the reverse way.

142
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.340
So we created the item and it asks for this.

143
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.900
So it asks for that.

144
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.980
It's more easy to understand but maybe even the first time when we were doing it for the first time

145
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:27.410
it may seem complicated for you as you can see it brings up the navigation for different kinds of places.

146
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:35.840
So it's working very fine and I believe this is kind of hard to remember by so we have learned a lot

147
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.240
of information during this process right.

148
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:46.370
But if you understand why we are doing all of the things then it's OK you don't need to remember this

149
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:57.470
coats you may just taken notes and if somebody asks you to do some app you including a map OK you can

150
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:03.790
come over here and you can take a look at your notes and you can write it on your own later on.

151
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:12.590
You don't need to remember anything in here regarding two pinwheel customization regarding to navigation

152
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.500
opening launch options.

153
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:20.340
If you understand why we're doing all of these things then that's OK.

154
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:27.740
Furthermore in order not to make the section into a very long one we'll method some operations like

155
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.300
hiding the keyboard.

156
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.800
We omitted some operations like hiding this saved by them.

157
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.860
So you know how to do that right.

158
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:42.650
If you are to make an app in which you will use this map options and then you will upload it to the

159
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.510
app store then you should definitely implement those functions as well.

160
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.230
But luckily you know how to do that.

161
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.480
So let's stop here and continue within the next section.
