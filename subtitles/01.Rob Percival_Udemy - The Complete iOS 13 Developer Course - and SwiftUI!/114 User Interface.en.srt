00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,690
Hi within this lecture we are going to add another view controller in which we will display the table

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,800
view so that we can get the list of the names that we have saved and display them to the user.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,310
So let's go to our main story Bert and this is not even the first V controller that we want to see when

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,800
we first opened the app.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,920
Right.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,830
We want to see another view controller in which we display the names that are saved in the card data.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,940
So let me open our library and search for we have controller.

8
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,700
OK.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:43,620
And let's bring in the view controller and let it lets us put it here and take this arrow and put inside

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,250
of the first view controller.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,780
Remember desire always cold entry points.

12
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,390
So this will be displayed by me first open the app.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,890
So let us create a new Swift file near we'll controller files so that we can associate our cocoa touch

14
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,460
class with this new wave controller.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,060
So let's choose cocoa touch class.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,760
I remembered this has to be a UI with controller but we already have a class called Wheel controller

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,160
so I'm going to call the something like table we've our list we have controller.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,310
OK we're going to list the places in this.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,920
We have controllers so you're more than welcome to choose anything you want in here.

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,060
So let's say next and create is in our tribal book folder.

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,850
So let me put this up here and then here.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,220
And as you can see we have to delete this comments.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,840
And I believe there is something buggy in here going round one more time.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,930
So let me just see let me go to identity inspector and as you can see we cannot see the list.

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,870
We have controller in here so I'm going to write this manually and we have come across this kind of

26
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,860
problem in the previous section as you might remember even though it seems like it's working there is

27
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,240
something buggy.

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,920
So I'm going to just solve this problem by coming over here with so source code off the main story board

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,340
so I'm not going to explain why I'm doing that right now because we have seen how to deal with this

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,200
problem in the previous section.

31
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,570
So we have this custom module Lancaster module provider missing from the newly created The View Controller.

32
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,980
So I'm going to add it.

33
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,130
OK copy and paste it here and that's it.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,140
That's all I want to do to solve this problem.

35
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,140
I did it a little fast but as I said in the previous section we already have seen this in great detail

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:55,620
so I'm going to go over to interface builder to work start working on my newly created view controller.

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:03,680
First of all I'm going to need a table view and I'm going to need a Segway between this and my new controller.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,490
So let's say table with you and bring in the table view.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,480
So I'm going to only have this table view over here so I'm going to say 0 2 all constraints.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,520
So it will fill up the whole weave controller.

41
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,760
So let's bring in the Segway.

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,970
Click over here controlled drag as a show.

43
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:30,060
I'm doing this kind of fast and as you can see there is some gap over here but it doesn't matter because

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,490
I'm going to bring in the navigation controller anyway.

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,570
So let's say to we controller to the identifier of the Segway and let's go to this we have controller

46
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,720
and editor say Ed embed in navigation controller.

47
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,660
Once we do that as you can see the top of this we have controller gets fixed because it gets fixed with

48
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,500
the navigation bar.

49
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,140
So here what do we have we will have the table we do of course we are going to have an ad button as

50
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,860
well but we can add the Add button with codes.

51
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm just going to bring in the table we've from here and I'm going to call this table view.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,640
OK.

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,160
And that's it.

54
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,510
So as you can see this is filled up.

55
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,800
So it's working.

56
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:27,270
So let me close this down and I believe that's all for our user interface.

57
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:34,880
Now we are ready to start setting up this table view and add this add button on the list we controller.

58
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,810
So let's go to list.

59
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,910
Have controller.

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,970
OK.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,370
In the we did load.

62
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,640
What are we going to do.

63
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,580
We're going to say table to you that delegate is self.

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,800
Ok table we got data search.

65
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,050
This is south again.

66
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,980
And as I said before we're doing this for like a million times so I'm going to go a little fast here.

67
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,420
This should be like a second nature to you right now so that you can easily do this.

68
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,920
OK so we're going to call a number of roads in section four right now.

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm going to return 10 suffer all at index path.

70
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,090
OK.

71
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:19,130
This will ask us to return the cell so I'm going to create a cell.

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,800
This is going to be a UI table we cell.

73
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,520
I'm just going to return that cell.

74
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,390
And of course if you want you can display some tax in the cells as well like Soledad tax labeled tax

75
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,900
is tests.

76
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,870
So that's it for our table we have set up.

77
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,330
And in the we did load we have to do something else.

78
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,710
We have to add the navigation bar item.

79
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,340
OK.

80
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,660
So I'm gonna go for navigation controller dot navigation bar the top item.

81
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,150
That's right.

82
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:53,830
K right.

83
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,060
Bar about an item.

84
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm just going to add it to right.

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,980
As you know there is left as well but I'm going to go for right.

86
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,570
So let's choose the UI bar about an item and I'm going to go for system items one more time.

87
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,180
Remember we have a lot of options in here but I'm going to go for ad targets will be self and the action

88
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,060
will be a function that we will create right now.

89
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,200
So objectives C function add the bottom clicked.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,480
So this is how fast I can write swift code as you can see once I know what I'm doing.

91
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:39,100
If I don't know if I'm reading from somewhere else it should be actually much more slower.

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,910
But right now we all know how to do this stuff.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,450
So I'm going really fast.

94
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:51,070
So if you cannot type that fast if you cannot write swift go that fast it doesn't matter you can just

95
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,250
pause the video and try to do it on your own.

96
00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,030
I'm just trying to not make this course a little longer than it should be.

97
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,850
As you can see if I click on the ad button it brings us the view controller and in the list we have

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,230
controller we can see the table view that we have created so far so good.

99
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,110
It's working right now.

100
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:22,030
Now we have to get the data from the car data and display them to the user in the next lecture.
