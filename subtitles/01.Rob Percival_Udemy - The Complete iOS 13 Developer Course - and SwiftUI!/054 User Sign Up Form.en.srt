00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:07,680
Hi in this lecture we are going to complete our sign up registration form and congratulations on your

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,960
first sign up registration form.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,720
If you managed to do it yourself.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,650
If not that's OK.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,710
We're going to do it right now together.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,400
So of course I'm going to use if statements here.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,930
OK I'm going to check if user name text is blank so I'm going to do it like this.

8
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:35,640
If user name tags dog tags is actually blank OK so that's all you need to do to check if a string is

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,730
empty string.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,600
So if this is the case I'm going to show this message as user name not found.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,050
And in fact I'm going to comment this out OK.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,520
If you do slash and stir and if you do two slashes it will just comment out one line if you do slash

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:04,770
and stir it will create another star and slash for you if you do it like this it will comment out everything

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,350
inside of that block.

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,440
So these are all commented out.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,590
These will not be counted as a code.

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,440
It will be counted as a note.

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,360
So I'm going to rewrite everything so that we can practice it so the LRAD is going to be a UI alert

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,390
controller.

20
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm going to use the title air and the message will be user name not found and the style that I want

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,510
is the alert.

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,320
So I'm going to create okay by them and this will be an action indeed.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,740
And the title will be okay.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,540
Style will be default.

25
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,470
Okay.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,090
And the handler I'm not going to need any handler so I'm going to say nil.

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,130
So ELA does add action.

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:53,510
OK.

29
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,810
Button and sussed out present alerts.

30
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,150
So this will present an alert.

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,810
OK.

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,380
And animated true completion nil.

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,680
This will present an alert if only if user name tags that tax isn't given to us.

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,260
So that's cool right.

35
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,380
That's all we have to do.

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,310
Of course if we are going to continue checking for passwords as well.

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Right now we finished it so we can actually test as in our simulator and see if this actually works.

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,730
By the way I'm using this close as you can see so you can close it and open it anytime you want to have

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,600
more space in your coding section.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,970
OK so here you go without the user name if I click on sign up this will be given.

41
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,420
If I write any user name over here.

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,820
OK.

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,000
And if I click sign up this won't display me any error messages.

44
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,160
So that's cool right.

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:04,200
It's working but I also want to control the passwords so username obviously works.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:14,160
So if this is the case and we're going to display this message as if password text is missing OK so

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:22,650
password text that text is actually an empty string then I'm going to display all these messages one

48
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,970
more time so I'm going to copy and paste it and rather than saying user name not found I'm just going

49
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,900
to say password not found.

50
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,610
So this will be OK.

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
Right.

52
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,810
And if that is the case I'm going to display an alert message.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,310
Else else if we have to check if password text and password to text match or not.

54
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:57,420
So I'm going to say as if password text dot text okay is equal or is not equal actually is not equal

55
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,390
to password to text texts dots texts.

56
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,830
Ok.

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:12,870
If these two do not match then I'm going to display another Ellard message and this will be password

58
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,720
one then password two are different or something passwords do not match.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,640
So that's cool and else if everything works out fine.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,570
What should we do if these conditions are not valid then I'm going to display an alert message saying

61
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,010
success.

62
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,940
OK.

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,250
And in this message I'm going to say user created or user.

64
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,790
OK.

65
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,750
So this will be our registration form.

66
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,520
So that's cool.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,160
Let me run this and try it.

68
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,270
So user name user name not found.

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
OK.

70
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,460
So let me write another one.

71
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,540
So I'm going to write this as still okay.

72
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,860
And I'm going to leave the password blank for this sign.

73
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,410
So passwords not found.

74
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,290
Good.

75
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,910
So let me give me a password over here.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,880
So it says that passwords do not match because I have not written anything in the password to texts.

77
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,190
So let me do everything right.

78
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,920
And as you can see it says that user OK.

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,280
Success.

80
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,530
So this is good.

81
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,780
This is working.

82
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,030
So let me try one more time let me try without user name but with passwords and this work as well.

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,130
Whenever I do something like this I'd like to try all the possibilities to see if I'm missing something.

84
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,630
And as it seems it works pretty good to me.

85
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,830
OK.

86
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:53,920
Actually that means that we have created our sign up registration app but I'd like to make an improvement

87
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:01,900
in here because maybe you have realized that we have copy them pasted these codes too many times so

88
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:10,390
we are using almost the same codes in every function in a if control then actually we can make this

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,920
into a more efficient structure right.

90
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:21,880
We can create a function creating user messages Alec messages and we can only change the messages or

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:30,580
titles and I believe we only change messages and for the last Elliott Bill we only change title and

92
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,430
message.

93
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:39,180
So maybe we can create a function in which we can ask for the title and the message from the developer.

94
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,730
And this function can generate this Elliott message and show it to the user.

95
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,840
It will be much more efficient than writing this or copying and pasting this all the way.

96
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:59,770
So let me create this function and you will see better because in real apps also you will see something

97
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,270
like this a lot because we will use other messages a lot.

98
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,820
So I'm going to say this is going to be a make Ellard function of course named do not matter.

99
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,870
Okay.

100
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,810
You can choose whatever you want.

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,180
So I'm going to copy paste an alert from here okay.

102
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,540
You can take this and you can call does make Ellard and it will display exactly the same message to

103
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,000
the user.

104
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,980
But we want to change this message and we want to change this title.

105
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,810
Right.

106
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,060
So let's get them from the developers.

107
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,580
So I'm going to ask this as a input.

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,370
So how do I do it.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,160
I'm going to say title input and this will be a string.

110
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,210
And also I'm going to say message input and this will be a string guess both.

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:08:00,100
So rather than saying success I'm going to say title input in here rather than missing message I'm going

112
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,430
to say message input.

113
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:10,950
So this will create this UI Elliott for me with the title and the message that is given in here.

114
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,750
So when you write make a left right now it will ask for a title input and it will ask for a message

115
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,070
input.

116
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,200
So that will be much better than what we used to have in here.

117
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,560
So we're just going to use this messages.

118
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,940
So let me copy this and let me delete everything in here and say Make Elliott rather than saying user

119
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:41,920
Okay I will say pass Reg do not match and let me delete everything in here.

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,730
So rather than saying user Okay I'm going to go for passwords.

121
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,500
Password is missing or password not found.

122
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,010
Yeah.

123
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,640
And this will be error rather than success.

124
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,100
Right.

125
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,990
So this is password not found.

126
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,800
And finally we're going to delete everything in here and use the same function.

127
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,260
And going to say error and user not found.

128
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,770
So this is code.

129
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:21,640
And as you can see this is much clear this is much more structured and much more efficient than copying

130
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,080
and pasting everything.

131
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,610
So you can use functions efficiently like this.

132
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,590
So when I say sign up it will say user name not found.

133
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,770
Let me try the other possibilities as well to see if we broke something.

134
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,950
And everything seems to be working right now.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,860
So if I say one two three four or run to three one over here and say sign up it say success user.

136
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,500
OK.

137
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,400
So that's it.

138
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,390
That concludes our Ellard message lectures.

139
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:03,440
We're going to stop here and we're going to continue learning ISIS advance operations in the next lecture.
