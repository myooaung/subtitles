Hi within the section we're going to build our Angry Bird clone and you're not ready to do that.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,860
We're going to use a framework called sprite kit.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,290
So this is a framework by Apple that we generally use to create to the games.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,840
And in order to learn this we are going to create this beautiful Angry Birds clone.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,020
So now if you're ready let's get started.
