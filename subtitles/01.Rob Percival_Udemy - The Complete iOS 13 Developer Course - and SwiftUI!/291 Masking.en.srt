Hi.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,480
We didn't this lecture going to see an operation called masking.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,340
OK.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,950
So in order to that I'm going to delete those two views and I'm going to create fresh ones.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,320
OK.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:21,000
So let me create them rectangle over here and I'm going to give you a blue color in the field and I'm

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,600
going to lose the border and then I'm going to create another view over here let me do a triangle this

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,220
time.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,890
OK.

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
Like that.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,110
And now I have a triangle and I have a rectangle.

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,920
OK.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,250
Now I will just change the colors so that we can see the triangle in a better way.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,940
Now I want to mask this by using this triangle.

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:55,440
So if I choose this views to weaves together I can come over to my menu to the object I can say mask

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,940
which shape.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,040
So it will mask the view with a shape like that.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,390
OK.

19
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:08,830
So he took the triangle out of that rectangle and it's it's actually masking this view right now.

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:16,500
If I double click on that I can just see the contents and I can just see the contents from these layers

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,090
as well.

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,390
If I click on that I can see the individual views as well.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,570
So I get to edit them later on.

24
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:32,490
But it is not a great example of masking so let me show you a great usage or an ideal usage a real time

25
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,230
usage of the masks in order to do that.

26
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,950
We're going to need a real image.

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,090
So I believe the best way to display disease to find an image of a person so I'm going to Google myself

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,050
out and I'm going to bring in an image of myself.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,060
OK.

30
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,750
So this is my picture.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,480
Let me copy this.

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,370
OK.

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,380
And closes down and paste it over here with command V.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,180
And here I have my picture now.

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,870
Well I want to do I want that clip my picture so that I can just show a circular image.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,250
So how do I do that.

37
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,130
Just choose the circle over here.

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,000
And by holding the shift I'm going to create this circle or an ellipse.

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,050
OK.

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,680
And I'm just going to live this over here like that in the center.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,820
OK.

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,490
So choose them together and say mask.

43
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,680
And here you go.

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,870
Now I masked my image.

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:41,520
Now I have this beautiful circular image you you that I can use on my screen and I can actually double

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,650
click and edit if I'm not satisfied with how it looks.

47
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,700
But I believe it's looking great so that you can create shapes like that.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,530
You can actually create masks with shapes like that in real life examples as well.

49
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:06,450
So let's stop here and try to export some of the views that we have done to use them in the X code in

50
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,830
the next lecture.
