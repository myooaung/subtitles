00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.830
We didn't this lecture we going to see how we can delete this name and birthday information that we

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.550
have saved in the user defaults.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.670
So far we have been saving this and it works right now.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.350
I will add a delete button to my means storyboard so that when a user taps on this button our data in

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.950
the user defaults will be deleted.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.060
So I am going to add another button over here.

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.840
Okay.

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.410
Right next to save button and I'm going to name this delete.

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.760
Yeah.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.580
So let me make this a little bit bigger okay and then align it.

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.900
And I believe that's OK.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.620
So right now I'm going to go for the constraints.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.420
And we have given constraints but now we added the new view right.

15
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.020
So we have to give one more time so I'm going to say clear constraints.

16
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.260
I'm going to go over and say reset to suggested constraints.

17
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.590
Of course you could have just said add missing constraints as well.

18
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.100
So let me open the assistant editor over here and choose.

19
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.570
We have controller that's fifth in here.

20
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.650
I'm going to take this delete button and define it as an action in my view controller that's Swift.

21
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.370
So hold control and drag and drop.

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090
Now I'm going to call this delete clicked.

23
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.350
So now we're ready.

24
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.020
So let me close this and let me go to we've controller that Swift.

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.630
So what do we want to do here.

26
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.790
I want to remove this value from the user defaults right.

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.970
And it's actually very basic.

28
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.470
So you have to just go like this user defaults that Senate that remove objects and you can just give

29
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.280
the key like name birthday and that's all.

30
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
That's all you had to do to delete the value from user defaults.

31
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:24.450
OK but of course before we do that I believe the basic safety precautions will be good years so I'm

32
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.330
going to check to see if those values are not existing or not.

33
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.200
OK.

34
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.280
So let me just define these variables one more time.

35
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.230
So let's start.

36
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.130
Name user defaults.

37
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.380
That's standard.

38
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.050
That object.

39
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.390
OK.

40
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:52.410
And the object that we're looking for has the key name and we're going to do the same thing for birthday

41
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.310
as well.

42
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.410
So I'm going to say surge birthday.

43
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.480
So this is good.

44
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.060
We know this far.

45
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.350
Right now I'm going to check to see if this can be casted as a string.

46
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.110
So how do we do that.

47
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.170
Of course we do.

48
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.400
If that new name Saad name.

49
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.830
So this is optional any and I'm going to try and cast this as an optional string.

50
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:29.480
And if this works out I'm going to remove this object so I can cut this and paste over here.

51
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.470
And the reason that I'm doing this from the scratch not copying and pasting to show you this as you

52
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.810
can see it says that you created a variable called Name name but you have never even used it.

53
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:54.090
So if you're not going to use this new name at all you can replace this line as this surname as string

54
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.240
is not nil.

55
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.620
OK.

56
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:06.690
So this will do the same thing if I say fix and you will see that it's third name casted as a string

57
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.740
is not nil.

58
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:18.230
So it basically means that if we can do that then just go and remove this name object.

59
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.580
So you know the difference between nil and an empty street.

60
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.030
Right.

61
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.150
So we have talked about this.

62
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.920
And if it if it's not nil it means that I have saved something so I can remove it safely if it's nil

63
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.650
then I must I can I may have some difficulties removing it I may crash the app and I don't want it to

64
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.490
happen.

65
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.640
So I'm trying to understand if this is nil or not.

66
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.840
And before we did if that thing because we casted this as a variable and we used that variable right

67
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.490
now we're not using that variable so we can do the same thing.

68
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.670
As for birthday as well.

69
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.880
So I'm going to remove birthday object from here.

70
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.710
So that's it's we're controlling if this exists and we're controlling if we can remove it.

71
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.440
If it's nil or not.

72
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.800
So later all I'm going to just say a name labeled up tax name birthday label dog tags birthday.

73
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.740
So I'm going to reset the labels as well.

74
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.310
And in here we're just assigning these to be new name rather I'm going to go for this name.

75
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.370
Okay.

76
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:46.710
A reverse slash and open parentheses close parentheses So remember that's how we actually use variables

77
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.250
inside of strings.

78
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.340
OK.

79
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.500
So I believe now this is consistent and this is gonna work.

80
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.040
So let's try this.

81
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.170
Let's run this in our simulator.

82
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.760
Right.

83
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.290
Right now I have a values chart right Dave.

84
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.780
And the birthday.

85
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.710
So when I open this.

86
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.370
Yes.

87
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.370
This is now showing up.

88
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.900
If I hit delete button it will delete these values from here.

89
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:23.310
So in order to check if we deleted them from the user defaults as though I'm going to just close this

90
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.740
and the run one more time if we see an empty label then it's working.

91
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.620
If we see David again it's not working.

92
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.270
As you can see we have a name to label over here so deleting works.

93
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.790
Okay.

94
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:46.600
So now you know how to work with user defaults in order to save small data in user defaults database.

95
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:55.980
If you're going to store some 2000 people or some hundred people in the database then this is not going

96
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.540
to be practical for you in order to do that.

97
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.810
We going to learn something called core data but we're not going to learn it's for until like four or

98
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.570
five sections but we learn it.

99
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.520
You're going to be working on real databases.

100
00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.390
We're going to stop here and we're going to continue for IRS advanced options IRS Advanced Structures

101
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.580
in the next lecture.
