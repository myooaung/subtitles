1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,910
Within those picture where are you going to start building our favorite book app.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,070
So you know to do that I'm going to go ahead and create the new X SCOPE project.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,200
And of course I'm going to go with single we lap one more time.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,400
And don't forget to check the swift UI bugs.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,470
And this will be our favorite book.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,410
So here you go.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,520
Now I'm going to place this under my U.S. complete folder.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,810
And let me make this into a full screen.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,840
So remember the app.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,940
We have two screens in which we have the list and we have the details of the selected element.

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,550
Right.

12
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:50,090
But before we go on that list and the other design we have to create our models.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,270
So I'm going to create my model first and I'm going to build my way up from there.

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,410
OK.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,130
And in order to do that I'm going to work with trucks.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,530
I'm going to create another Swift file in which we will have other struts.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,430
And yes we will have more than one struct so that we can work this with very structurally and very professionally

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,140
of course along the way.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,920
We're going to have to deal with images we're going to have to deal with some sample codes.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,010
And it's going to take time but I believe this will be a good practice for you to understand how to

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,780
work with structures how to work with structures.

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,420
OK.

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,890
So let's create a new file and I'm going to go for swift file a rather than Swift UI view because we're

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,760
not going to need any views inside of our model.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:52,380
And this time I'm going to call this favorite model cars you can call those favorites as VO But I'm

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,570
going to be explicit over here and I'm going to call this favorite model.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,560
So in here we have the foundation and we're just going to have our struct.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,800
OK.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,440
So remember how we create struct.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,380
It's actually very similar to the classes.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,220
All you have to do is just come over here and right struct and write your struct name.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,000
So in our case it's favorite model.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,620
I want to make this favorite model identifiable OK.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,790
We have talked about this before.

35
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:35,220
Remember how we had to give you a manual idea when we deal with for each loop or for lists.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:45,570
Now if we do this as an identifiable struct then we can just skip that step because this will be identifiable.

37
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,770
And if you cannot reach the identifiable maybe then you will have to import the swift UI but if you

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:03:01,470
can reach it doesn't matter and all you have to do to make your struct identifiable to have is just

39
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,480
to have an I.D. In your struct as an attribute or as a property.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,960
OK.

41
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,870
So come over here and say var I.D. And this area will go away.

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:20,490
So you can have your I.D. in some different ways like you can come over here and say I.D. is a you you

43
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,670
I.D. and remember what is a you you I.D. It is universally unique I.D..

44
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,570
So every time you create an instance of this truck it will just a sign and universal unique I.D. to

45
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:41,340
that object so that you will have a made up string and you will have a made up you you I.D. and you

46
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,830
can do it like an integer as well.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,060
But this time you will have to manually give some I.D. like 0 1 2 3.

48
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,910
So I'm not going to do that.

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,130
Rather I'm just going to say you you I.D. and swift with take care of this for me.

50
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:06,720
So inside of my favorite model I'm going to have a title and this title will refer to my titles in the

51
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,500
lists.

52
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,710
OK.

53
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:14,500
So remember our titles like favorite movies favorite bands favorite.

54
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,320
I don't know if you want to have another example like favorite books.

55
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,210
So this will be our title.

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,030
OK so this will be like the categories that we are going to work with.

57
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,120
And inside of that categories we are going to have some elements.

58
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,170
OK.

59
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:40,890
And in fact I'm going to create another struct to have elements because we're going to have some properties

60
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,680
too in our elements as well like an image like a description like a name.

61
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,700
So you have seen how this app works.

62
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,520
Right.

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,040
And we click on Metallica and we see the image we see the description and we see the name of the Metallica.

64
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:04,420
So let's create another struct for that and you can just call this something like favorite elements.

65
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,000
OK and you have to make this identifiable as well.

66
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:16,020
And over here you have to just say Wah I.D. you you I.D. one more time because design identifiable.

67
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,410
So I'm going to have a name and this will be a string.

68
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm going to have an image name.

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,390
And this will be again as string.

70
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,890
And again I'm going to have a description or something like that over here and this will be again as

71
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,980
string.

72
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:42,180
So I can come over here and say this will be an array of favorite elements.

73
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,930
So if I can open this area Yep.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,710
This one favorite elements.

75
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,140
OK.

76
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,540
So our favorite model will have a title and a favorite elements area.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,940
So maybe I can create one example you would understand it much better.

78
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,360
So let's come down here and try to create our favorite musicians or favorite bands.

79
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,990
Of course I'm going to start with Metallica.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,750
We're here as usual.

81
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,950
So I'm going to say let's Metallica.

82
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,180
OK.

83
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,180
And this will be a favorite elements.

84
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,790
So I named its elements but it doesn't matter as you can see we get two options one asking for ideas

85
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,890
and one that does not.

86
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,320
So I'm going to choose the second one.

87
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,870
If you choose the first one you can write you You idea with the parentheses and it won't matter.

88
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:41,520
So for image name I'm going to say Metallica and for description I'm just going to say something like

89
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,150
no one band or no one musician.

90
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:45,680
OK.

91
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,710
So for the image name we're going to have to find an image and name it's Metallica later on.

92
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,470
So I believe we have this image because we have previously used it in the same section.

93
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,620
So I'm going to bring in the Metallica image.

94
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,830
And here you go.

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
Now I can create this.

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,300
OK I can create this with image as well.

97
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,180
Of course we are not going to need image for until like two or three lectures right now but no doubt

98
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,000
we have to find images for other musicians as well like mega that let's call this I remained in.

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,830
OK.

100
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,430
And let's change this a little bit so let's make this.

101
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:36,000
Number two let's make this number three and four image name I'm gonna go for Megadeth and this time

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,010
I'm gonna go for I remade them and let's change the names as well.

103
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:49,080
So this is Megadeth and this is I really made them and let's create our favorite model right now for

104
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,690
our favorite musicians.

105
00:07:51,690 --> 00:08:00,380
So I'm going to call this something like favorite bands OK or favorite musician model.

106
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:07,110
I don't know I'm going to call this favorite bands and we are going to have to give some title which

107
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:15,480
is favorite bands and we're going to have to give some array of elements and inside of that array I'm

108
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,860
going to have Metallica.

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,550
I'm going to have Megadeth and I'm going to have I remade them.

110
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,800
No here you go.

111
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,580
This is how our structure will look like.

112
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:34,500
Of course I'm not going to stop here because I believe we need to have at least one more example to

113
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,270
understand this app in a better way.

114
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:44,250
So I'm going to create a favorite movie favorite model and favorite elements as well so that we will

115
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,290
have enough examples and we're going to have to find some related images as well.

116
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,080
So I'm going to stop here and continue within the next lecture.
