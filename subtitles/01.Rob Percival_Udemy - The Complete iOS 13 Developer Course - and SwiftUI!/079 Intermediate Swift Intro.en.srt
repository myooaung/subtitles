1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,370
Within the section we're going to focus on object oriented programming.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,410
So we're going to learn about classes and how we can leverage them in our code.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,180
And furthermore we're going to learn about some concepts called e num inheritance excess levels.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,730
And these are all related with object oriented programming.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,850
And we're going to see how to leverage them as well.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,140
And at the end of this section we're going to write a new app called Simpson book and it's similar to

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,830
landmark book but this time we're going to use classes.

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,620
So if you're ready let's get started.
