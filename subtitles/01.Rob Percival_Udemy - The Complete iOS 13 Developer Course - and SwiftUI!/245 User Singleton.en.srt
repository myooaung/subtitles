00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,290
Hi.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,880
We then this lecture regally to create our user model.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,980
So what do I mean by that.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:16,730
We have to upload the user name to the fires or when we hit the upload button in our Snapchat clone.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,160
Right.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,250
So let me come over here.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,970
As you can see in the feed we've controller we going to get the data from five star and in the upload

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,030
we have controller we're going to upload the data to the your star.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,370
But in the upload we have controller.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,290
I also want to upload the user name.

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,720
Who made this snap.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,530
Who made this post to the file year star.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,670
And in order to get that I'm going to get it in the feed we have controllers so that I can share it

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,950
with my other view controllers as well.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,420
So I don't want to run a five year base clergy in a review controller.

16
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,070
It wouldn't be efficient.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,800
So I'm going to get that once in the feed view controller.

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,880
I'm going to share it with other controllers.

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,750
So that's what we're going to do within this lecture.

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,930
So let me create this five year base import this five year base in the Feed the controller.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,230
OK.

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:24,300
And I'm going to get this under and they function because we're going to get a lot of things inside

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,810
of our feed view controller and getting user info is just one of them.

24
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,630
So I'm going to write this under a function.

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:38,850
So under this function I'm going to do a very simple thing first I'm going to create my five star database

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,560
variable.

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,130
OK.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,530
So this will be five star instance as usual.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:51,390
So far your store far your store and in the under get the user info I'm going to use this database to

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,420
reach my user info collection.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,390
And here actually I'm just going to get the data sets.

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,800
So right now I have only one document.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Of course I will have like a thousand of them when this app is released.

34
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,760
So I'm going to filter my results with e-mail.

35
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,400
OK so I'm just going to get the data who matches my email.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,690
So that's how I get the user name.

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,040
And by the way we don't have to add an snapshot listener in this case right.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,610
We can just get this data once.

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,770
Remember when we want to check for updates we use this at snapshot listener.

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,050
But this time I don't need to listen for changes it won't even get changed so I can just use this dot

41
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,980
get documents to get this for once.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,950
So remember these get documents.

43
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,440
Now we're going to use it.

44
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:55,010
So first of all let me filter this and the field that I'm looking for is the e mail.

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,880
OK.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,640
And this will be equal to my user my signed in users email.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,170
OK.

48
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,680
So all thought of that current user I can force I wrap this because I'm signed in right now and say

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,520
that's email.

50
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,710
So later on I can just say get documents and this will give me a snapshot.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,920
BLOCK And let me close this down and once you hit enter on that you will either get a snapshot or an

52
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,580
error.

53
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,780
So now we're here if error is not nil.

54
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,810
We are going to display an error message to the user.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,250
OK.

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:43,920
And if areas nail down we're going to go ahead and just pass this snapshots process this snapshot to

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,370
get the user name.

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,790
So let's do that.

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,910
If error is not mail.

60
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,250
OK.

61
00:03:51,270 --> 00:04:00,960
So else and I believe we have to go back and find the make Ellard function in order to speed things

62
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,890
up.

63
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,270
So come over here.

64
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,850
Copy this come below and paste it so that we can use it over here.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,500
OK.

66
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,920
If areas not nil I'm going to display an alert message to the user.

67
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,350
So this will be error.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,270
This will be airdropped localised description.

69
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,790
And we're going to say error.

70
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,960
So if that's the case if error is nil then I'm going to check to see if snapshot is empty false.

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,480
OK.

72
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,900
And if snapshot is not nil.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:40,680
So it means that I really have a snapshot because over here I'm going to say for document in snapshot

74
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:48,540
that documents and I'm going to force our app this I remember this gives us a snapshot array so that

75
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,870
we're just looping through this area.

76
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:00,020
And once we iterate that array I'm going to say document that get and I'm looking for the fields user

77
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,730
name right.

78
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,630
And if we say user name we can just cast his optionally as a string.

79
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,790
And of course I'm going to do if let's.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,350
In order to get that.

81
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,550
So that's easy.

82
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:19,290
That's how we get data from the five year base and we already know about this.

83
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,870
But right now how I'm going to transfer this information to the other controllers.

84
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,540
That's the question.

85
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,200
So in order to do that I'm going to create another group which is called model and I'm going to create

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,140
my model in this folder.

87
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,180
Ok.

88
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:44,510
So I'm going to go ahead and create the new Swift file by right clicking over the model folder and I'm

89
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:51,060
going to say a file and choose swift file because you're going to create a class rather than that Coco

90
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,460
touch class.

91
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,970
So I'm going to call this something like user Singleton.

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:04,040
OK we could have just called it user but I believe there are other classes called user so I don't want

93
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,880
to confuse and make things complicated.

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,130
OK so I'm going to say.

95
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:16,790
Class User Singleton and open curly braces for some reason if you haven't watched the Foursquare close

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,860
section then you wouldn't know what a singleton class is.

97
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,180
It is a class you that you have only one instance.

98
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,730
OK.

99
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:33,470
So nobody can create any instance from this class but we will because we are going to have our initializing

100
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:40,640
function as private so that nobody will reach and create an instance of this class but rather we are

101
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:48,900
going to create this instance ourselves so that we can reach it from anywhere we want during this project.

102
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,940
So I'm going to create a static variable called shared instance.

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,690
And of course we can't call this something else.

104
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,770
We have used this shared instance term before.

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,410
I'm going to call this shared user information.

106
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,680
Not now series so shared user info.

107
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,150
So this will be our only user Singleton instance.

108
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,670
OK.

109
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,990
So that we are going to set some values and we're going to get this exact same values in other view

110
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,490
controllers and we're going to have an e-mail and the user name in this case.

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:34,080
So we're going to change this e-mail and user name and we can get the same values from other controllers.

112
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,160
So that's what we have used in the Foursquare clone.

113
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,180
So if you haven't watched it now you know how to work with Singleton classes.

114
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:50,650
So let me do a comment B and come over here so I can say user Singleton that shared user info dot e-mail.

115
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,320
OK.

116
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,480
So this will be the email of the user.

117
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,710
Of course you can use of lot of dots.

118
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:03,140
Current user dot email in order to get that.

119
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,200
OK.

120
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:12,950
And you can go for user Singleton That's shared user name for dot user name is the user name that we

121
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,690
have just created.

122
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,610
So here you go.

123
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:24,260
Now we have defined our user name into a singleton class so we can't come over our upload view controller

124
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,010
and we can easily reach that data or here.

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm not even going to test this because we have done it before because in the next lecture regrouping

126
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:41,600
to upload a picture to the storage anyway and we're going to see if that works or not if it doesn't

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,930
work of course we can go back and revise our code.

128
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,870
So let's go to the next lecture.

129
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,650
We will upload our data.
