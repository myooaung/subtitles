00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.430
Hi.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.440
We didn't his lecture reading to learn about how to troll our bird into the air.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.810
So far we can drag the bird they round in a way so that we can stretch the bird.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.670
Right.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.370
So what we want to do is after stretching the bird.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.540
We will let go of our finger and Vons we do that.

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.700
We want bird off the air and we have to take the distance into consideration as well.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.310
So the father these stretch thus the more it should go away and the less we stretch this the less it

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.870
should go away.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.610
So we're going to do the same thing that we are doing in the touches begin in the touches.

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.290
And that as above.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.470
So this is the function that will let us know that the user let go of his or her finger.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.630
So I'm going to copy everything from here.

14
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.410
I'm going to paste in the touches and that as well.

15
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.470
Of course I'm not going to change the bird position in that way because I'm going to troll the bird

16
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:23.010
in the air and I believe we have one extra curly braces over here or we have one less.

17
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.870
So let me delete one and hit the comment B to see if we make this right okay.

18
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.340
No we are still getting this error.

19
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:43.890
So let me add two curly braces over here one for dad and maybe let's do command Zee to see if we really

20
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.650
have this problem.

21
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.040
Yep we have this problem.

22
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.200
So let me add one and let me delete this and let me do comment B to see if we overcame this problem.

23
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.990
Yep.

24
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.890
Now this is good.

25
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.740
So instead of changing the position I'm going to delete this and what we gonna do is to understand this

26
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.870
distance between the original position of the bird and the named position very user just let his finger

27
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.980
off.

28
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.370
So we're going to calculate that distance and we're going to take this distance to apply an impulse

29
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.530
to the bird in the opposite direction of the stretching.

30
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.630
Okay so how do we do that first.

31
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.870
We know the touch location so we know the current location of the bird but we don't know of the original

32
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.030
position.

33
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.000
So I'm going to create an original position variable over here so I'm going to call this original position

34
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.040
and this will be a C.G. point optional.

35
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.120
OK.

36
00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:00.270
And under did move to function I'm going to a sign my current position as the original position so I'm

37
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.710
going to say or general position is the bird.

38
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.170
That position over here.

39
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.340
So this will be my original position.

40
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.690
OK.

41
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.550
So when the app is loaded I will know the original position.

42
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:23.010
So if I come over here if I subtract the original position from the current position I can calculate

43
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.950
the distance between two positions.

44
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.660
So how do we do that.

45
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.810
We have to do this by x axis and by yet y axis separately.

46
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.570
So if you come over here and say touch location that X OK.

47
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.240
This will give you the current location and if you subtract original position up X from this you will

48
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.980
get the difference in Devi in the x axis.

49
00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:01.110
So you can't call this something like D X and it will ask you to force our app design you can do that

50
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.400
obviously because we have assigned our original position over here and we can do the same thing for

51
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.040
Devi as well.

52
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.500
Difference y and this will be the same thing.

53
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.080
So touch location dot y.

54
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.060
Okay.

55
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.410
Minus original position.

56
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.890
Dot Y.

57
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.620
Again force are up this.

58
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.440
So now we know the difference between X axis is and y axis.

59
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.840
So we can create our impulse and this will be the ACG vector.

60
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.860
It will ask us for it X and Y and the X is going to be x d x and the Y is going to be d y.

61
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.790
However we want to apply this force in the reverse direction of the stretch.

62
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.800
So I'm going to make this mine so I'm going to make this negative okay.

63
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.310
So either multiply this by minus F1 or just add and minus sign in front of this parentheses.

64
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.380
So now we have an impulse in the reverse direction of our stretch.

65
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.610
So I can come over here and say Burt Dot Physics body dot apply impulse and the plus that I want to

66
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.610
apply is the impulse.

67
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:26.370
And then later on I can just say Burt Dot Physics body affected by gravity is true now.

68
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.560
And again I can just say Game started is true.

69
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:40.580
In order to prevent the user from grabbing the vert in the air and dragging him around so far so good.

70
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.980
And our initial affected by gravity attribute is false.

71
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.400
So this will work now.

72
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:53.630
So let me open my simulator and try to stretch the bird and let it go.

73
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.760
Here you go.

74
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.840
Now we can push our bird.

75
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:06.080
We can throw our bird in the air and of course we don't have a function to make the bird come to the

76
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.520
original position.

77
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.790
So if you open one more time you can just push the bird in another direction.

78
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:21.730
So let's take care of this resetting problem in the next lecture and continue building our Angry Bird

79
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.090
clone.
