1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,190
High within the section where you're going to learn how we can upload our app to the App Store.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,700
And in order to do that I'm going to use a test app so I'm going to create a new app from our X code.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,190
But if you want to use your previously finished app of course you can do that.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:21,560
OK.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,560
So I'm just doing this for an example and I will show you all the necessary steps to take to upload

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,030
your app to the app sir.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,900
So here I'm going to go for a single view app and I'm just going to name this something like app store

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,580
test.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,680
So once I do that I'm going to hit next and create my project.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,690
So let me create this under my AOS complete folder and in fact in this lecture I'm not going to go ahead

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:00,780
and upload my app directly because before we go on and do that I want to show you what you can do to

12
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,660
ensure your app is ready to be uploaded.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,220
So Apple is actually very strict about apps.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
So they want quality apps in the App Store or else they will reject your app.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:23,020
So make sure you select some different options from the simulator menu and you try your app in various

16
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,740
simulators to see how your app looks like in different kinds of screen sizes different kinds of phones

17
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,440
and even maybe you may want to plug your iPhone and test your app with a real device and you can come

18
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,170
over here to create new additional simulators as well.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,920
And if you're building for a pad make sure you create some iPad simulators and test your application

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,750
in iPad simulators as well.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,920
OK.

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
So it's very easy to do that.

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,860
You just select one of these and created like we have seen before.

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:12,870
So generally when you develop your app you work with one or two simulators but after you complete your

25
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:20,220
development make sure you adjust your app to different sizes you adjust your app so that you can work

26
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,530
on both iPad and iPhone.

27
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,530
If you want to.

28
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:31,350
And after that come over to Google and search for Apple human interface guidelines.

29
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:37,980
So this is a really good documentation to understand what Apple wants from us.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,030
Just click on this and it will take you to the developer dot apple dot com in which you will find some

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,460
guidelines about apps.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:55,350
For example we see some different guidelines in respective for other platforms as well like Mac OS watch

33
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,650
AWS but we're focusing on us in this course.

34
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,990
And when you know swift vine you muster the swift you can easily develop four apps for like a Mac OS

35
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,750
and watch us and other platforms as well.

36
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,200
All right.

37
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,880
Now let me focus on AOS and as you can see there are a lot of explanations and descriptions over here

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,680
describing what Apple expects to see in the App Store.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,270
So for example if you come over here to user interaction you can see some modules like authentication

40
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,440
and if you come over here you will see some tips and tricks about you authentication usage in an app

41
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,640
like you can use signing with Apple you can use face I.D. and touch I.D. which we have seen in this

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,490
course.

43
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,620
And of course you can find further information regarding two authentication here as well.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,190
So I really suggest you go here and try to read at least the related parts for your app.

45
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,880
OK.

46
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,250
And try to understand what you can improve better in your app to be accepted in the App Store because

47
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,140
Apple doesn't accept every app Apple rejects.

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:21,990
Most of the time actually and they make you improve your app and they make you bring out your best in

49
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,880
your development skills so that you would have some good quality apps in the App Store.

50
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:39,300
OK and for example when you work with data Apple asks you to have a privacy policy and refer your users

51
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,860
to your privacy policy in case they have questions.

52
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,110
And don't worry I'm gonna show you how this works and how to do that later on in the section.

53
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:57,410
But I'm trying to make a point here so that before trying to upload your app you have to make your best.

54
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,260
You have to be sure you are trying to improve your app in a way that Apple wants.

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,650
Apple guides you.

56
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,160
Okay so that's it.

57
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,500
Actually before you go on and upload your app make sure you try your app on different simulators make

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,150
sure you try your app on a real iPhone and make sure you at least take a look at this human interface

59
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,410
guidelines.

60
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:32,430
And after that of course you will be ready to go to the developer that I pulled out come and create

61
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,100
your certificates and other procedures and upload your app to the App Store.

62
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,300
Now let's stop here and see how we can do that in the next lecture.
