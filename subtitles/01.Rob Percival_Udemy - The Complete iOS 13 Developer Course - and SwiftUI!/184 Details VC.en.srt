00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:08,640
Hi within this lecture Regan to finalize our user interface by adding the last week controller.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,360
So we're going to have to add a new wave controller because once user clicks of one off the table view

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:22,500
items we have to display the name the type the atmosphere the image and the location of that place in

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,750
a one single view controller.

5
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:31,780
So we cannot use these older real controllers because we have to view controllers in here.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,500
We have to combine everything in one controller and display to the user.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,500
So I'm gonna create a new wave controller or here.

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,470
Okay.

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,110
And in this we have controller we're going to have everything together.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,240
So we're going to have another Segway from here.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,720
And if the user clicks on the table view Reagan around the Segway.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,690
If user clicks on the Add button we're already running the other Segway.

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,140
So this will be two details we have controller.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,650
I'm going to call this detail we controller.

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,470
OK.

16
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,550
And makes sense to have back button over here so I'm not going to change the show type.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,150
So under this view controller I want to have some image view first to display the image of the restaurant

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,040
or image of the cafe the image of the place.

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:33,140
So let me make this into the full screen in terms of width and in terms of height.

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,570
I believe this is kind of good.

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,130
Maybe we can decide that later on after we bring in the labels because I want to bring in three labels

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,120
for the place name place type and place atmosphere.

23
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,690
So the first one will be the place name labels.

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,520
So I'm going to call this place name night label.

25
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,620
OK as a place holder over here so that I know where I'm putting all of these labels.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,380
So let me put this into center and let me copy and paste this and bring it down.

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:17,340
I'm going to call this place type label OK if I can a line this hopefully.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,300
Yep.

29
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,550
Place type label.

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,680
And then we're going to need another one of course to display displays Utmost Fear label and you can

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,240
call the something like place description and place information maybe you can just give some basic information

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,550
like if this place accepts credit cards or accessories aeration or something.

33
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,950
So this is goods we will have three labels and under this tree labels I'm going to have a map.

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:57,510
So let me put this a little bit down so that I can make this image view a little bit bigger because

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,860
I have enough space here to bring in a map kids view.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:11,420
So this map kids view will fill up all the way to the bottom from the middle of the screen.

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,350
Yep this looks good.

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,300
So I have the image view about.

39
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,160
I have three labels in middle and I have a map view on the bottom of my screen.

40
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:31,140
So I believe this is OK and this will let us show you all the information that we have gathered from

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,680
the user to another user.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:43,350
So let me come over here and create a cocoa touch glass and this will be details we've controller details

43
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:50,700
we see so click on Next to create your view controller and put that under your Foursquare chrome project

44
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,590
and come over here to me and sorry bought to identity Inspector.

45
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,940
They choose the details we see class that we have created.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Open your assistant editor and choose details we see over here to define everything every view inside

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,510
of our weave controller.

48
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,450
So let me delete all of this comment lines and I'm going to start with the image view.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,170
So I'm going to call these details image view.

50
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,160
OK so this is going to be something like details place name label.

51
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,360
So let me bring in details.

52
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,420
Name label.

53
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
OK.

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:43,320
We're going to have two more so details type label details type label and bring.

55
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,700
And the third one.

56
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:52,460
So this is details Utmost Fear label kind of long name.

57
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,030
And finally we're going to bring in the map view as well.

58
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,120
And rather than map you I'm going to call this details map you because we have another map for you.

59
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,430
I just want to avoid any confusion and I'm going to import the map kit over here to get rid of this

60
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,810
warning.

61
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:12,860
Here you go.

62
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,060
Now we are ready.

63
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:24,080
So we have this detail we've controller in order to just provide every information to the user in one

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,150
single weave controller.

65
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,900
And finally we're done.

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,110
It's our user interface.

67
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:38,750
As you can see in the main story board we have a very big main story worked in here because we're working

68
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,250
with a lot of weave controllers so we're working in a big project right now.

69
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,800
And we completed our first drafts.

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,360
Now we get to go into individual weave controllers to write our code.

71
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,750
That's what we going to do in the next lecture.
