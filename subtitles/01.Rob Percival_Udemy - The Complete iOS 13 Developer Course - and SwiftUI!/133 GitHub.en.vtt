00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.800
Hi we didn't this lecture we can see what is GitHub and how we can use it in our projects.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.330
And also we're going to see how to use terminal which is a good skill for us.

3
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.250
So in here we have the first commit second commits and the initial comments.

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.470
So we can go back and forth whenever we want using this source tree application.

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.240
Right.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.030
So what happens if I want to add this to a good hub so that I can share my codes to the other developers

7
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.200
or I can collaborate with other developers to work on my projects simultaneously.

8
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.250
So after you create that and sign up you sign and I with your account you can easily create new repositories

9
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.060
need projects in your GitHub account and you can share your projects on github.

10
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.500
And it's not only saving the project called Zeke's saving the Goetz versions as well.

11
00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.970
Right.

12
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.700
So we can't track what's going on inside of a project by tracking the gifts.

13
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.080
Of course you have to make sure that your deed hub is a count connected to your source tree application

14
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.660
in order to do what I'm about to show you.

15
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.850
So if you click on new to create a new repository meaning a new project on Github you have to choose

16
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.400
a repository name.

17
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.140
So I'm going to go for a good test and if you see this or Cape then here it means that it's okay to

18
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.740
go.

19
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.150
And that's a good name.

20
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.050
And under here you will see two options one is public and the other one's private.

21
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.640
So public means everyone can see your project on GitHub and private means no one can see your project

22
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.100
on Github unless you invite them.

23
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.930
But in order to make this private do you have to have a premium github account.

24
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.680
So you have to pay for it.

25
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.880
OK.

26
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.490
So we're good to go with public anyway.

27
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.640
And in here you will see initialize this repository with the read me option.

28
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.160
And this will create the read me file that you can write the instructions but I'm not going to do that.

29
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.830
I'm going to show you how to manually do that later on.

30
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.320
And if you create the repository you will see a screen like this in the screen you will find some comments

31
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.610
that you have to run on your terminal and you have to run this comments on your projects folder.

32
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:41.280
So in our case get test project folder and if you have never worked with terminal before don't worry

33
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.050
I'm going to show you have to do that.

34
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.210
And what's a terminal really.

35
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.600
So click comment on space on your keyboard.

36
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.930
OK.

37
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.470
So let me put everything down for a while.

38
00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.870
So we have a clear screen and hit command face on your keyboard so it will bring up the search menu.

39
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.720
And in here I'm going to write terminal.

40
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.260
So as you can see this is the terminal that we are looking for when you see it just click on it and

41
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.160
it will open a terminal for you.

42
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.140
So let me zoom in a little bit so you can see it better.

43
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.520
OK.

44
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.590
So you can come over here to view and say bigger.

45
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.480
And then once you are good to go you can stop but I'm actually going to make it a little bit bigger

46
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.650
so you can see better.

47
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.210
So this is the terminal.

48
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.710
This is very very wrong comments.

49
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.070
So then we type a comment.

50
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.650
The computer the Mac OS will execute that comment for us.

51
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:48.150
Of course if the comment is valid and if you have worked with Linux before I I am pretty sure that you're

52
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.680
familiar with this kind of concept.

53
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.200
But if you're not.

54
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.950
Don't worry.

55
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.230
I'm just going to show you the basics.

56
00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.940
So for example if you say clear and hit enter it will clear the screen so clear is that comment.

57
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.600
So it executed the comment and now we're getting the result out of it.

58
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.750
So in this command line in this terminal I can write whatever I want as long as it makes sense.

59
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.780
For example if I say unless it means list the folders and files that I'm currently in.

60
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.170
So I'm in my user folder.

61
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:33.270
So I mean the teal folder and inside of that folder I have this folders and files so I can move in or

62
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:38.720
out of this folder by using a command called C D.

63
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.460
For example if I want to go to documents or downloads I can use the C.D. comment and I can browse to

64
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.560
these folders in my terminals.

65
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.530
So I have to write exactly it is as it is shown in here.

66
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.630
So with a capitalized D for example and if I do lower case deeds won't work.

67
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.630
For example if you say C.D. downloads it will change directory so C.D. stands for changing directory

68
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.850
to downloads folder.

69
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:18.590
Now I'm inside the downloads folder if I say less right now I'm going to see the files and folders in

70
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.820
the downloads folder.

71
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.270
So if I open the downloads folder from here for example this is exactly what I'm seeing right.

72
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.650
So these are the files and folders inside my downloads folder.

73
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.360
So that's the list that I'm getting.

74
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.660
So I want to go into Io complete and then get test project because that's where I should run.

75
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:49.670
These comments that are given to me by you hop in in order to go that's file I'm going to say IRS and

76
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.590
be very that we have a space in here.

77
00:05:52.670 --> 00:06:00.710
So in order to do this I'm going to hit tab on my keyboard and it will auto complete it for me.

78
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.750
So as you can see we have to use a backslash before a space.

79
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.870
If you don't remember that you can just type the first three characters off your folder and hit tab.

80
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.340
It's the lotto completed for you.

81
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.910
Now when I'm inside I was complete.

82
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.010
Now I'm going to write get and it hit tab.

83
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.540
And as you can see it auto completed it for me.

84
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.680
Now I'm inside of get test project.

85
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:34.720
Now if I run there less I will see the available files and folders in here like this.

86
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:43.550
So that's where I want to run these comments that are given to me by GitHub in order to connect my github

87
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.370
project GitHub repository to my local file.

88
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:56.660
Okay so that I can push all of these files and folders to my github repository.

89
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.790
So if you zoom in a little bit you will see some commands in here.

90
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.770
So these are basic Unix or Linux or Mac OS comments.

91
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.200
So echo means write something.

92
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:16.330
And these two braces means write this get test inside of read me file okay.

93
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:26.600
And this means that initialize the get process and then we going to add an add read me file to our guests.

94
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:34.910
Okay so this is where we create the read me file and we are going to commit this for the first time

95
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:43.160
so it's going to write first comment and then we're going to connect as you test that get this repository

96
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:49.250
to our local file and then re gonna push the origin master.

97
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:56.660
And in order to run all of these commands you can just copy them and paste in your terminal or you can

98
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.580
just write one by one.

99
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.640
It really doesn't matter but I believe we we can just copy them in order to be practical here.

100
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:13.120
So let's go for copy and let's come here and right click cancel pastes and here you go.

101
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:22.790
I believe I should hit enter one more time to run the last comment and I'm pushing the repository to

102
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.520
pushing the project to my repository right now.

103
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:34.220
And once it's done I can click over here to see my project is already here.

104
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.290
So that's good.

105
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:43.010
As you can see we have created this project Twain five trading 1 minutes ago and we have changed this

106
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.960
file eleven minutes ago.

107
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.840
Okay.

108
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:52.080
And if you come to we controller that's with you will see the print yet and print get to.

109
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.910
So that's cool.

110
00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:02.060
And remember we have done this commits in the source tree if we haven't done any comments yet it will

111
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:08.700
push the original we've controller files so it will just push the initial commit and then we re gonna

112
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.890
have to come here commit the changes and then push this man really from the source tree.

113
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:24.080
So let me see me let me actually show you how this goes because you might need it to push the changes

114
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.900
to the github account later on.

115
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:35.050
For example let me bring in my let me bring up my project file from here and I'm going to add the G3

116
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:44.780
I'm not going to prepare for anything let me delete this and I'm just going to print get three yep that's

117
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:52.610
it and I'm going to save this OK once I do that it should reflect on the source tree and as you can

118
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:59.720
see it says that there are uncommitted changes so let's commit those changes and say terse comments

119
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:08.480
and let's commit and now we FISA push it will push my project to my github repository.

120
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.170
OK so that's a push and click OK.

121
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:19.550
And of course in order to do that I'm going to have to give my password here and this is not my github

122
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.120
password.

123
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.470
This is my local computer password.

124
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:30.360
It's going to take you the hub from my key chain and push it the project push the project for me.

125
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.750
And as you can see change is change.

126
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:39.120
Twenty nine seconds echo and we see the get three right now.

127
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.900
So it's kind of cool we can see all the changes we can see.

128
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.840
Why then did we do the changes.

129
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.950
What did we change and everything and we can go back and forth with being comments anytime we want.

130
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.850
So working with GID is actually kind of cool.

131
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:02.960
So if you're a developer or you're a freelancer it doesn't matter you're going to be needing it eventually.

132
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:11.610
So I suggest you work with gifts if you're working on an important project so that you can go back and

133
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:19.140
save your project if something fails or just use get to share it on GitHub to collaborate with other

134
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:22.820
developers or share your code with everyone in the world.

135
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.100
So that's it for right now we're going to stop here and continue within the next lecture.
