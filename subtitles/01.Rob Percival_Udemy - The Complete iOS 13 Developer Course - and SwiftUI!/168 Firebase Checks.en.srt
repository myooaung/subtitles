00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:09,180
Hi we within this lecture regarding to add an if statement to our player I.D. saving function so that

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,210
we won't create a duplicate its value of this James said Metallica dot com.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,110
When we run this Instagram clone from scratch.

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,680
OK so we have to check if this play your idea exists in our five your store.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,490
Right.

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,260
So let me bring in this fire store to our we've added loads and I believe we have this fire store over

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:43,500
here so let me do that over here so that we can use the same fire store in the get data from fire store

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,330
function and in d we did load.

9
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,770
So let me run this over here and rather than creating new fires stores we're just going to call this

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,980
5 years store database.

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,010
OK and down below.

12
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,510
It still works because we can easily reach the a variable that we have just created.

13
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,540
Right.

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,070
So over here I'm going to use fire star database and before we go on we have to do a query over here

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:23,220
and say Play your I.D. So we have to get these play your idea of the current logged in user.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,230
So at this point we have to choose between adding this snapshot listener or getting the document for

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,080
once.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,650
I'm just going to get the document because I don't need to add the snapshot listener because there won't

19
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,480
be any changes during we use this app.

20
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,280
Right.

21
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:46,410
So I'm going to say gets documents and it will only give me the related document just for once and that's

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,940
what we need.

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,500
And over here I'm going to filter the result before I say get document.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:00,300
So I'm going to use a I feel like we did in the previous section and I'm going to say Email is the current

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,370
user's email.

26
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,130
OK so remember it asks I have fields for us and I'm going to provide email over here.

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,880
And the value will be the current email.

28
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:19,020
So I'm going to get this from all that of that current user and I'm going to force our app this and

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,090
say email.

30
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:29,960
So this collection will return the documents related to the current email that we have over here.

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,030
So I'm going to call this snapshot and I'm going to call this error and if error is nil I'm just going

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,930
to go for is nil this time rather than is not nil.

33
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,470
Of course it's your call you can go for is not nil and display an error message to the user as well.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,470
But I'm going to keep things simple and we will get a snapshot over here so you can check to see if

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,600
snapshot is empty is false or you can check to see if snapshot is not Bill because we're going to do

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,930
what we have been doing over here.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,930
So we will go into a for loop after we say snapshot that documents.

38
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:18,990
So I believe it's best to check to see if snapshots dot is empty is false so that we will be much safer.

39
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:26,820
So we're here we can come and save for document in and I believe I have forgotten to add the snapshot

40
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,870
is not new.

41
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,580
Yep.

42
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,430
So let me add this one as well so snapshot is not nil.

43
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:42,320
And then I can safely come over here and say four documents in snapshot documents.

44
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,080
OK.

45
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,640
And I will force wrap this when I do that.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,940
So can I come over here as a snapshot but documents.

47
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,230
Yep.

48
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:59,340
I can say that but once I do that it will ask me to make it optional or for shoring up this so I'm going

49
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,650
to force our wrap this.

50
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,150
That's why I'm doing all this checks.

51
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,130
So I'm going to say for a document in snapshot that documents.

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,170
OK.

53
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,350
And as you can see it makes it optional but I'm not going to make it optional I'm going to force I'll

54
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,230
wrap this.

55
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,230
And over here we need a value right.

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:27,750
We can get this out of our document and we need the player I.D. So remember before we were working with

57
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,220
areas and getting all of these different values but design we don't need those we only need the one

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,570
values.

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,180
I'm going to say document that gets and the field that I'm looking for is the play your I.D..

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,980
So that's the one.

61
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,020
Yep.

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:53,220
So it will give me the player I.D. And I'm going to say if let the name player I.D. OK display your

63
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:02,540
I.D. I think is can be casted as string as optional string if that's the case it means that I have a

64
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,740
previously created play your I.D. So if that's the case.

65
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,810
OK so let me call display your I.D. from firebase so we won't get confused because we already have a

66
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,000
player I.D. over here.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,570
So player I.D. from fi your base if this exists then I don't need to create a new one right because

68
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,610
I already have one so I can check to see if they are equal or not.

69
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,450
So let me just print this out and let me just test if we can get this.

70
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,850
So let me say play your I.D. from fire base.

71
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,170
OK.

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,800
And I'm going to say play your I.D..

73
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:50,450
Player I.D. from 5 your base and later on if we want to do a merger if you want to update the current

74
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,480
documents we will need the document idea as well.

75
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,390
So let me created for any case so I will call this document I.D. and it will be document that document

76
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:00,880
I.D..

77
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,480
OK.

78
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,290
So remember that's how we get document I.D..

79
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:13,400
So let me run this on my simulator to see if we can get the player I.D. of the current logged in user

80
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,850
from firebase.

81
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:22,790
Of course we're doing all of those things like play your I.D. dictionary and saving IDs to define your

82
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,050
base again.

83
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,980
So it will be a little bit complicated.

84
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,580
It will save the same thing in the fire store one more time.

85
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,140
But we're going to take care of that anyway.

86
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:41,000
So as you can see we can get the player I.D. from Firebase and we are getting it twice because we have

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,260
this data twice.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,670
Now of course we have to take care of this problem.

89
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,670
So what I want to do.

90
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,990
Let me just cut this from here.

91
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,740
OK.

92
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,940
And under if let's let me paces over here rather than printing this out I'm going to check to see if

93
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,530
the player I.D. If the current player I.D. is equal that this player I.D. from firebase.

94
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,380
OK.

95
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,960
So that's what I'm going to do.

96
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,970
If they're equal then I don't need to do anything else.

97
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,660
So let me say play eve play your I.D. and I'm trying to refer to that play your I.D. but I believe we

98
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,470
have to use play your new I.D. because that is not an optional string.

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,860
So if player new I.D. OK is equal to play your I.D. from five year base then it means that we have the

100
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,410
same I.D. in the firebase already.

101
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,160
So we don't have to do anything over here.

102
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,090
Right.

103
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,190
If that's they're not equal then we have to save this.

104
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:53,150
Then let me cut everything from here OK and paste the play your knee why these things on there over

105
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,850
here.

106
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,900
So this will create the Navy dictionary for me.

107
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,700
And if they do not have the same value then I'm going to upload it.

108
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,240
So let me check.

109
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,530
Yep.

110
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,210
This is getting the current user e-mail and this is getting the player I.D. from firebase if they are

111
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,290
not equal.

112
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,120
We are just uploading them to the fire sir.

113
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:25,190
And in here I believe we have to say self-taught fire star database in order to refer to the fire star

114
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:25,970
database.

115
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,160
OK.

116
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,630
So that's good.

117
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,200
If they're not equal I'm going to upload the value.

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,890
So let me test is let me come over here and delete the duplicated values.

119
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,910
So let me delete one of the Turks and let me delete one of the James says well so that we will only

120
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:52,850
have one Kirk and one James says they will be equal it won't upload a new one to the fire base of Kersh

121
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,720
we can do this some alternative way as well.

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,980
For example if they are not equal.

123
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,470
But I suppose that the player I.D. has changed then we can do an update.

124
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,570
We can do a merger as well.

125
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,050
Right.

126
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,460
So let me test this.

127
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,390
And as you can see we don't have any data over here duplicated so it works.

128
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:20,690
But also we have to figure out a way if they're not equal but if we don't have any snapshot if we don't

129
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,920
have any data.

130
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,790
So what do we do.

131
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,400
Right.

132
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:31,510
Because this time we're going to go or to play your I.D. and we're doing this very fields in which we're

133
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,230
trying to figure out the current player I.D. of the user.

134
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:43,700
But if this snapshot does not exist if snapshot is empty it means that maybe this is the first time

135
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,060
this user is using this app.

136
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,850
Right.

137
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,570
And in this case we're not saving the player I.D. right now.

138
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:58,310
So we have to make sure to find the L statement of this if snapshot is empty statement.

139
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,200
OK.

140
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,950
And I believe that's the one.

141
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,600
Nope.

142
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,980
We have to open an aisle statement over here.

143
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,360
Yeah I believe this is the one.

144
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,110
Yes.

145
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:16,220
If snapshot is empty then we have to save this data to defy your story again.

146
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,840
Right.

147
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,530
Because we won't have the data in the fire store at this point.

148
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:30,680
So let me copy this one and paste the under L. says well not cut but copy and paste over here as well.

149
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,120
So this will just save the play your I.D. for the first time into the fire store.

150
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,340
Right.

151
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:46,760
So let me just make this right by leading this unnecessary indentation over here and here you go.

152
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,050
Now we're ready.

153
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:55,000
Of course we can improve and improve this algorithm as I said before we tend to emerge up in the first

154
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:02,770
US block and we can try to update the current value or we can delete the current value.

155
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,410
So here you go.

156
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,610
As you can see our algorithm is working since we have the player I.D. over here.

157
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,010
It won't say 1.

158
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:19,490
So let me delete the Kirk's I.D. and let me run it one more time to see if we get the Kirk's I.D. in

159
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,580
the fires sir.

160
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,330
And if that works out as well that it means that we have a complete algorithm.

161
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,150
So let me come over here to fire your store and here you go.

162
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,570
We really have the Kirk's play your I.D. saved in the fire store.

163
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,500
So that's it for right now.

164
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:44,780
I believe now we are ready to go into the like functionality and find the related player I.D. and send

165
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:51,790
a push notification to the liked post to the Post owner of the liked post actually.

166
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,510
So let's do that in the next lecture.
