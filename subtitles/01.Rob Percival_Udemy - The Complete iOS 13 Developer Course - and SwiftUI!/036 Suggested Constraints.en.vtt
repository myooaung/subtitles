Hi.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.590
We didn't his lectures.

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.710
We're going to see a way to implement this constrains in a very easy way.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.990
So far we have been doing this constrains in a manual way.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.540
So if you choose the view if you choose your phone from here and click on the turned option over here

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.310
you will see some menus.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.860
So we have worked with this before.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:32.420
So if you choose one of the views the upper side will just work on that view and the below site.

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.600
The bottom side will work on all of these views.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.580
OK so if you see clear constraints here.

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
If you click on that bottom it will clear all the constraints.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.030
It will delete all the constraints in your app as you can see.

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.300
Now I clicked it and all the constraints that we have been worked on so far have been erased.

14
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.980
Now I'm going to go and do this automatically rather than manually.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.350
So you can't try to choose a review or you can just click on here and come over this option one more

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.810
time you will see add missing constraints then reset to suggest that constraints for right now I'm going

17
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.390
going to go for a reset to suggested cost traits.

18
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.150
OK.

19
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.910
If I do that this will add the constraints itself.

20
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.610
So this is pretty much what we have done in the previous lectures.

21
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.690
It's kind of different but it's adding some constraints to Image view and it's adding some constraints

22
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.480
to label as well.

23
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.890
So after you do this after you reset to suggested constraints you can't try to run this on iPhone AC

24
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.590
or iPhone X R and try to see how does it look like on your phone.

25
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:03.480
So if you're satisfied with this view that it's OK you can go for it and if you're not satisfied at

26
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.920
this point you may have to clear constraints or you may have to go these constraints one by one and

27
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.280
try to adjust them in your own way.

28
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.280
So in the apps that we are going to be building we're just going to use this ad to suggest that constraints

29
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.460
generally.

30
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.390
So let me change this to scale to feel or aspect feel or aspect fit.

31
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.080
OK.

32
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160
And try like this.

33
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.930
So you find satisfied with this look that I get that I don't have to change anything else.

34
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.240
And again if I'm not satisfied so I'm going to have to start from the beginning.

35
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.890
For example let me clear this constraints one more time and let me add some manual constraints to my

36
00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.540
Image view on the second option over here.

37
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.260
OK.

38
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.330
So let me choose the left right and the top constrains.

39
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.390
Add this three constraints as you can see there are still some missing constraints that I need to add

40
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.590
in order this to work and I have this the red lines stating that there is a problem with the layout

41
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.120
then I can go over here turned option and I can say add missing constraints.

42
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:36.600
So after I specifically choose after I specify what I want to specify I can leave the rest to X code

43
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.350
as well.

44
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.610
I can just say Okay I have done my thing now add the missing constraints and it will give me the same

45
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.300
results.

46
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.730
So this is how you work with layout.

47
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:56.910
This is how you try to make your app work exactly the same in different kinds of screen sizes or iPhone

48
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.530
models.

49
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.100
And of course depending on your complexity you may have to spend more time working on this manual call

50
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.620
strings or automatic constraints after this section.

51
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.410
We will be focusing on the coding side rather than this layout side.

52
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:23.100
So we will be using reset to suggests that constraints a lot but I'm going to show you some other ways

53
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:31.170
to create to use for example not with using the main storyboard but just using codes and then we will

54
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.640
be ready to move on.

55
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.370
Let's do that in the next lecture.
