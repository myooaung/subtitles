00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.950
Hi within this lecture we are going to see how we can bring in the V's being in the sprites that we

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.860
have created in the game scene to our game scene that swift and how we can give some physical attributes

3
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.010
to the sprite nodes that we have created.

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.700
So first of all we have to give them some names.

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.220
This is like an I.D..

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.880
Okay.

7
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.960
So I'm going to call this bird for example and we don't even need to name the background and T because

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.870
we're not going to use them inside of our coding section but we're going to do some operations with

9
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.370
the boxes as well.

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.100
So I'm going to name all of these bricks all of these boxes.

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.730
So I'm going to call this something simple like Box 1 OK.

12
00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:01.470
And I'm going to go over to here and say Box 2 and this is Box Tree and let's go for a box for over

13
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.810
here.

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.100
And finally we have this box five.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.810
So after doing that after giving names I can come over in my game scene that Swift I can call this Sprite

16
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.040
nodes inside of my coding section.

17
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.070
Now again we don't need to name the background and the three because we're not going to be using them

18
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.580
inside of our code.

19
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.920
But if you want.

20
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.860
Of course you can just do that.

21
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.410
And if you want to interact with the background or interact with the tree in some way in your own games

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.520
later on you're more than welcome to name them all and work them inside of your coding section.

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.100
And again we're going to give some physical attributes like the birds will be affected by gravity because

24
00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.500
the biggest advantage of the sprite kids is actually that it lets us to work inside of a physical world

25
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:08.810
where we have gravity where we have collisions and everything you're going to see what I'm talking about.

26
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.220
First of all let's bring in the bird inside of our did move to function in order to do that.

27
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.280
I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to call this bird and again this will be an escape sprite note

28
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.490
but inside of our deed moved to function I'm going to write something new.

29
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.350
So I'm going to save bird is a child's note.

30
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.070
OK.

31
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.060
So this one.

32
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.920
So this is again an escape note but we're going to give it a name and the name is the idea that we have

33
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.170
just defined.

34
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:52.230
And then later on we are going to be we're going to cast this to be an SDK sprite note because this

35
00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.090
gives us an escape note which is not we want but we want it to be in this case bright note after doing

36
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:09.990
that we actually define this as a variable like we did it over here of course previously we didn't call

37
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.140
this child mode with name because we haven't had a bird created the inside of our game since that is

38
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.880
scarce.

39
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.620
But this time we have it.

40
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.720
So we can call it this way.

41
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.860
After doing that I'm going to assign the physical world attributes that I have mentioned before.

42
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.170
For example if you come over here and say bird that physics body This will let you access the physical

43
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.390
attributes of the bird.

44
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.190
In fact we're going to have to create the physic body manually later on but for right now I'm going

45
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.500
to show you some attributes of the physics body.

46
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.130
So if you say physics body dumped you will see something like this effected by gravity.

47
00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.150
So we have a gravity inside of our physical world.

48
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.270
So if you say true it will be affected by it.

49
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.050
And again we have something called is dynamic.

50
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.180
So this defines whether this body is moved by the physics simulation like if we push it if we can throw

51
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.580
it.

52
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.320
And this is exactly what we want for our Bert and I'm going to call this true and you will see what

53
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.890
I mean once we test this later on and again I'm going to say Bert that physics body OK.

54
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.920
If you say a dot there is a mass attribute.

55
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.210
So we can actually give a mass to our Bert in the KG measure.

56
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.680
So if you say 0 point 5 it will be 500 grams.

57
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.440
OK.

58
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.830
So I don't know if it is too much or too low.

59
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.490
We're going to test this later on.

60
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.030
We're going to throw our Bert into the air.

61
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.670
If it doesn't fly it means that we made it too heavy.

62
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.990
So in order to do all of this we have to define the physics body.

63
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.810
So I'm going to say Burt that physics body and this will be in this gay physics body.

64
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.620
And if you open parentheses it will ask you to create this physics body manually.

65
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.420
So this is like a shape that you draw around your view drawn around your escape sprite.

66
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.170
And in our case our bird looks like a circle.

67
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.290
So I'm going to go for a circle.

68
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.290
But in other cases for example for boxes we're going to go for a rectangle because our boxes are in

69
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.790
the shape of a rectangle.

70
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.840
But our bird looks like a circle right.

71
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:54.420
So we can go with the circle because it will actually draw a physical body outside of our sprite note

72
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.960
Emery going to see that to test if we made it right or wrong.

73
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.180
So here as you can see we have some poly gowns and everything but I'm going to go for a circle of radius

74
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.170
and we had to give some radius over here.

75
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.710
Of course we can go for something like 5 10.

76
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.390
I don't know about the best way to do that is to drive this from the texture of the bird itself.

77
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.290
So as you can see we have the texture bird.

78
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.220
But remember this texture was too big.

79
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.960
So we made it smaller like 10 times or something and we going to actually do the same thing in here

80
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.860
as well.

81
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:43.170
I'm going to create that texture over here one more time just to get it size just to get its radius.

82
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:51.330
OK so I'm going to say S.K. texture and the remember our image name is Bert.

83
00:06:51.360 --> 00:07:03.060
Now I can use this burst texture to get get it size like this bird texture dot size OK that size and

84
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:10.620
this gives us as e.g. size but this time if you say that height or width and it doesn't matter in this

85
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:12.960
case because it's kind of a circle.

86
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.490
OK.

87
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.200
Because we're looking for a radius I'm going to divide it by 10 and we're going to see if we made it

88
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.380
right or wrong.

89
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.100
So in order to see this physics body there is a method.

90
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:36.660
So if I run this right now you won't see the physics body but you will see its effects maybe you realized

91
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.420
that once we run this birds fell off.

92
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.430
So pay attention here you will see the bird but it will fall off as you can see it falls off because

93
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:53.340
now the gravity of is affecting the bird so it falls off.

94
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.730
So it has a mass and we have a gravity over here and it actually only affects the bird.

95
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.070
So everything stays the same.

96
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.620
But our bird falls off.

97
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.230
So remember we have this minus nine point eight gravity over here.

98
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:18.720
So let's do it something like minus one interval again fall off but it will be much slower as you can

99
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.480
see it's kind of nice right.

100
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:28.320
You can actually play with the physical world rules so let's do something like positive 1.

101
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:34.950
So let's leave this and just write the one and we will have a reverse gravity over here.

102
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:40.550
So let me run this and you will see that bird is flying upwards.

103
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:49.200
So this is kind of different to have a positive gravity but I believe you can just do whatever you want

104
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:49.510
this.

105
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.490
That's your game.

106
00:08:50.910 --> 00:09:00.390
So I'm going to just make it nine point eight one more time to have irregular regular gravity but this

107
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:08.220
time we're going to see if we made this physics by the right or not because we're creating some physics

108
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.170
body right now.

109
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.920
But we cannot see it.

110
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.640
So again this is like a drawing outside of our circle outside of our escape.

111
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.590
Escape note.

112
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:28.180
So we may we have to make sure that this falls right a round our SDK notes.

113
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.950
So if you come over here to game with a controller as you can see there are some settings over here

114
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:42.000
like show FP as show not count and these are the things that I'm talking about so frame per seconds

115
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.770
not count I don't need that I'm gonna delete them rather I'm going to say something like view that show

116
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.940
physics.

117
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.590
Yes.

118
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:58.770
This one shows physics of course in the real game we don't want that but for debugging purposes it's

119
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:04.320
good to have so that we can see the physics body that we have created.

120
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:09.680
So let me run this and we have to make sure our bird stays the same.

121
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:19.040
So I'm going to make this false so that we can see its SDK physics body and we can decide to make it

122
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.080
smaller or make it bigger.

123
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.230
And here you go.

124
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:29.600
We have a blue droving over wrapping around our bird over here so this is what I'm talking about.

125
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.840
This is the physics body of course.

126
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:38.390
This is the representation of the physics body but we have to make sure it wraps around it fits in the

127
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.030
birds.

128
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:45.710
So I believe this is too much because we're going to have them over here as well and they will collide

129
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.480
with each other so they don't actually collide with each other.

130
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.960
They are physics body collide with each other.

131
00:10:53.990 --> 00:11:00.410
So we have to make sure that this physics buddy is a good fit on our textures.

132
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.160
So we have to be careful with their sizes.

133
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.470
OK.

134
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:09.000
We don't want them too large or too small we want them just right.

135
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:18.070
So let's make this something like twelfth and let's see if we can see the blue line fitting on our Bert.

136
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.510
Yeah.

137
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:24.540
This is better but maybe we can do it something like 13 or 14 as well.

138
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.800
You're more than welcome to try this with your own numbers and have an optimum solution.

139
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.150
So this looks good.

140
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:40.700
I'm going to live this as it is but I believe maybe we can try with something like 14 or other numbers

141
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.290
as vote.

142
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:51.410
So for example what if I want to don't lose my bird and don't let it just leave the screen even though

143
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:58.220
it is affected by gravity for example it falls off but it stays on the screen on the bottom or on the

144
00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.510
ground.

145
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.390
So you feel safe soft out physics buddy.

146
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.790
You can just actually control the physics body of DSK seen as well.

147
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:17.840
So if you can just come over here and say ask a physics buddy you can't choose etch loop from and this

148
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.570
will give you a physics body for your seat.

149
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:31.400
So if you can just come over here to actually prom and if you can say frame OK not that frame but just

150
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:39.890
frame it will give you a frame shapes physics buddy and your bird will not fall off or will not just

151
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:48.910
go high up to the screen it will just create a frame for you so that nothing will leave your screen.

152
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:56.420
So now we have a frame of course we cannot see it right now but if we make this true if we make sure

153
00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:02.190
this will fall off you will see that it will fall off but it won't leave the screen.

154
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.910
Now we only see the hat of the bird.

155
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:11.810
So I believe we have a problem over here as well and we're going to take care of that later on.

156
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:19.280
But right now I know that my bird won't leave the screen because we have a frame covering up our screen

157
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:23.030
covering up our scene actually.

158
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.080
And if we make this bird a little bit bigger we can see it better.

159
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:34.050
So let's come over here to our game scene and try to make this a little bit bigger.

160
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:34.910
OK.

161
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.480
So if we make this a little bit bigger we may have to adjust the physics by the as well.

162
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:47.900
However we are just experimenting over here so let me make this tree a little bit bigger as well.

163
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.540
Yes.

164
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.490
This looks good.

165
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:52.150
Maybe a little bit higher.

166
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.690
Yep this is great.

167
00:13:53.690 --> 00:14:02.330
Right now we can try this within our simulator to see birds falling off but hopefully we will just see

168
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.460
the head of the bird this time.

169
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.030
Yep.

170
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.220
We can't see better but it's not good enough.

171
00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:14.170
We're going to take care of that in the next lecture don't worry because we have a problem concerning

172
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.500
of our total less casein over here.

173
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:22.350
So this won't fit in in the way that we want.

174
00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.690
But for right now we know how to deal with ASCII sprite knows how to give them physical attributes in

175
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:36.270
the next picture re going to do this for older boxes and then we're going to take care of the same problem.

176
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:43.340
And of course we're going to move on to throw our bird to the air so that they will just hit on the

177
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.530
boxes and get us some points.
