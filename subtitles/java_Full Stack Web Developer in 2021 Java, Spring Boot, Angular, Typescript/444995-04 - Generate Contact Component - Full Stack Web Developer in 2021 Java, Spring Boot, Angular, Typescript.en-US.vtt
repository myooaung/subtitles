00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
Under this video, we will need to generate

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.035
the contact component for our angular application.

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:10.110
So let's do this.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.510
We need to go to the CMD for terminal and type in NG generate component components.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.270
Let's call it contact.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.419
So this content component will be added under the components folder.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.515
You see it here being generated.

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:40.990
We have HTML file and also ts file for our type script.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.930
Now let's go to the browser and check it out.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.370
Type in contact.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.325
And you see that it does not work.

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:03.685
So in order to make it work,

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:08.395
we need to go under our routing module.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:14.980
So let's search for it. Let's go up.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.735
And under the upper multimodal TMS,

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:24.970
we need to set this contact pad in place.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.115
So Let's go into a pet contact.

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:34.550
And for our component, of course,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.860
we need to use the contact component that we just created.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.369
So this will map to the contact component.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.110
And let's go back.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:03.605
And let's also handle the case that the user will navigate to a nano page.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.870
So in this case,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.840
we will redirect the user to the unique component that we have so far.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.900
So re-direct to contact to the contact component.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.934
And of course, under the app mode two Ts,

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:33.020
you see that the contact component is already in place since we created it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.630
with using the NG January component.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.640
Now you see that we are able to navigate to the contact component,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.020
but we have also that app works messaging place.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.580
So let's remove it.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.480
So under app component HTML, just remove this,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.060
save and the contact component properly works.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.420
Now.
