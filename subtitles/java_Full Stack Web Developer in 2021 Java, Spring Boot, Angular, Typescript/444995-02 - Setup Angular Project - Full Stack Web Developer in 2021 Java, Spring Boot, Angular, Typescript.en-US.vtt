00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
Okay guys. So under this first video,

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:09.690
we need to set out the basic structure of our Angular application.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.840
So under your favorite location,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.615
you need to open a command prompt and type in n g mu from.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:22.110
Then. You will be prompted with this.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.280
Would you like to add angular routing question and you need to select yes.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.015
For which style sheet format would you like to use?

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.680
We'll go with CSS.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.770
And basically this will create a folder

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.495
called front-end that will keep our angular application.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:49.850
And all are specific components under the specific folder.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020
So packages installed successfully.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.660
You see the folder in place here.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.275
And now, since we have Visual Studio already set up on our environment,

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:13.020
we can open it using code space and a dot.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:22.265
And you see here from them folder at his basically on

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:28.805
Angular specific application with all its related components,

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:31.745
Angular JSON package JSON.

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:35.910
For this, we are using Angular ten.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.360
Let's increase the font a bit for it to properly see the content.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:56.240
And now I would like to update the script stack on the NG serve minus minus o,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.235
so that when we start the application using npm start.

00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:09.540
Now Angular application will be shown automatically in our default browser.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.460
So the scripts are compiling now.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.809
We should wait for this to finish.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.055
And you'd see that Angular application runs on port 4,200.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:38.910
And by default, we have this welcome page.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.915
And in fact, we need to clean this welcome page.

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:56.780
So we should go under source,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.410
app, app component, HTML.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:10.380
And it move all these default content right to the bottom.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.760
And we need to live the router outlet.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.510
Let's save this.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.310
Okay. Let's also add a specific message so that we

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.235
should know that the app is actually running with success.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:37.085
So app works.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:41.915
And you see that the Apple works now.

00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:48.330
And really move that the default content from the main page.
