00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.165
What we have so far is all of the HTML content on the screen.

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.340
We've finished off the last two sections,

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.650
which is this sport section just here,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.535
and also the footer area with the links down at the bottom.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.679
This video is going to be focusing on the styling for these two new sections.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.460
Remember, the first section of the class is sports,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.310
and this contains the image and also the text.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.100
We're going to need to center the text into the middle of

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.805
the div regardless of what screen size be using.

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.680
To make this easier,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.385
we're going to add a class to this section, the wrapper.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:43.425
This will be the sports-text. Save this.

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:44.745
Over to our style sheets,

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:50.075
the very first thing I'm going to do for this section is to add a new background color,

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:51.710
it's going to be pretty simple.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.895
I'm just going to add a light color, which is eee.

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.920
Over to the browser, this is just a light gray color which

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.045
will just separate this from me other sections.

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:03.345
Then the class which we just added,

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:07.795
which was the sports-text, this,

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:10.655
we need the display type to be flex,

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:15.965
which will allow us to set the flex direction vertically and also horizontally.

00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:20.705
This will stay in the middle of the div regardless of the screen size.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.730
First, just by content into the center.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.920
Then also align items into the center too by having both of these properties set.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.165
This means that if we have the flex direction to be either row or column,

00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:38.920
the text will always be centered in the middle of this div.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.790
Some padding to make this a little bit bigger of two rems.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.630
Even with this extra spacing,

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.790
we still see the text is centered vertically and horizontally.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.650
We can make this level 3 heading a little bit bigger.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.810
Let's only apply this to the section of sports-text.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.850
Grab the level 3 heading and increase the font size to be 2.2 rems.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.810
Just to emphasize the link,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.725
you see that I'm going to make this italic and to do this,

00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.740
we can grab this particular section.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.510
This was the link, just here are the class of italic.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.390
Then we can grab this over in our CSS.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.990
This was a class, so we use the dot.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.830
Now what we need to do here, is to set the font style,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.765
give this a value of italic.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.685
There we go. This has now been applied.

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:40.795
This is all we need to do for this section, it's pretty simple.

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:44.020
Now we can move down to the footer area.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.880
First of all, grab the footer element,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.245
which is the wrapper.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:52.880
What we're going to hear here is to align all the text into the center of the section.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.995
We can change the background color and also the text color too.

00:02:56.995 --> 00:03:00.850
To begin, the text-align of center.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.940
Good, we'll make these links stacked vertically in just a moment,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.990
but we'll need to apply this to the unordered list.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.615
Before we do this, we'll carry on with the background section,

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:18.990
which is going to be an RGB value of 62, 61, 61.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.520
Now I can't see the text because our text color is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.505
now the same as this background which we've just set.

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:30.320
To offset this, set the color for this section which will apply to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.040
the text of ddd. There we go.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.150
We also need some padding down at the bottom to give us some spacing.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.650
Add some padding value onto the bottom of one rem.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.630
Next, we can select the footer unordered list and make sure

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.670
that all of the links are place vertically on the page.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.400
The footer is like the unordered list inside.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.090
All we need to do for this is to set the display type to be equal to flex.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.125
By default, the flex direction is row,

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:08.280
so we need to change this to be a flex direction of column.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.600
Just like with the final version,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.260
we will switch this back to a flex direction of row in a later video.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.670
These go across the page on the larger view.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.720
Now let's continue on with

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.085
the small screen view and add some spacing between each one of these links.

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:30.670
Next, the font size of 1.8 rems.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.900
The unordered list will also have some default margin so we can remove this.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.590
We can see that just as soon we remove this,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.985
this has now moved back up closer to our title.

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:46.040
If we just comment this out and refresh,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.490
we can see that there's more spacing applied up at the top.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.340
But the space in between each one of these elements,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.685
we need to target the list item.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:58.005
Again, within the footer section,

00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:00.395
this padding only applies to this area.

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:02.300
Remember, we don't want this to apply to all of

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.955
our list items since we also have these in the header area too.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:10.350
For this, some padding is fine.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.500
To make this apply to the top and bottom,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.665
we'll add at 1.6 rems for the first value,

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:20.670
and then 0 on the left and right. There we go.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.690
The very last thing we need to do for

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.875
this section is to increase the font size of the copyright area.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.935
Inside of the index.html.

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:34.615
Down at the very bottom, we apply this inside of the P element.

00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:41.875
For the footer, crop the p elements and the font size.

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.320
Go for 1.6 rems.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.110
This is all now completed for the mobile screen view.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.030
In the upcoming videos,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.690
we'll start to take a look at how we can apply media queries to both sides,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.080
which will make our project look good on all screen devices.
