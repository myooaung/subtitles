00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.315
Hi, everybody, and welcome back.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.550
We have our Bootstrap project all set up now.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.960
What we want to do is start work on the top navigation bar there.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.950
If we just start by deleting the Hello, world header.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.605
We head back over to getbootstrap.com.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:22.395
If we select the Components section at the top,

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:28.245
we need to look down the list and find the Navbar section.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:31.620
What we're going to do is copy the standard Navbar there.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.950
If you copy the coder there,

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.430
I'll paste that into the top of the body section.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.700
The first thing we wants to do is we're just going to change

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.870
the container from fluid just to the standard container.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.660
I'll delete the comments as well,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.450
and as you can see, Bootstrap provides a comments at the end of each closing there,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.245
so we can see exactly where we're at.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.980
So the first thing I want to do,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.600
if we look at our example,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.625
we need to put our,

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:12.095
MyHotel name in there and start any four links at the top.

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:16.770
At present the Brand is the placeholder text.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.520
So we'll change that to MyHotel.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.650
The four links at the top,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.370
what we need to do is if we look for the unordered list,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.660
which is there, and the individual list items which is there.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.170
The first one, if we change the link text to "STAY WITH US".

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.840
Then the second link is going to be "RESTAURANTS."

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.135
If check our preview and that looks great.

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.280
You'll notice that there's a drop-down navigation there.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.180
We want to get rid of that for this example.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.780
So what we are going to do is if we look for the list with

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.870
the class of drop-down and we're just going to delete the,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.580
I'm just looking for the close on list item there,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.915
before the last unordered lists.

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:24.140
So if we select that and leave that section,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.850
what we're going to do is we going to copy the list item and we'll paste that in twice.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.860
Okay, it's quite fine. We'll change the text.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.130
The next one wants to be "SPA FACILITIES".

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.570
The last one wants to be the, "WEDDINGS" link.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.300
I want to separate this a bit so we can see it more clearly.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.115
So next we have the form.

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:02.415
This form section is the search box there.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.065
You can see there's the input type of text,

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:07.210
which is where we put the search text in.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.005
There's also the Submit button which we used in the first project.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.145
Then we see unordered lists on the right-hand side,

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.890
which has the Navbar right class.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.660
If we just stretch the page out wider,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.970
we'll see that the flow is the right.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.000
On smaller screens they'll drop to the position below.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.550
Again, we'll change the name of our links.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.455
So the link shown on the left,

00:03:38.455 --> 00:03:41.350
we're going to locate in the unordered list,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.955
the first list item.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:49.460
The first link, if we look at our final project is going to be "CONTACT US".

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.480
We want to change the drop-down texts.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.605
Going to change that to "DISCOVER". Check our preview.

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:09.890
Okay, that looks great. Our next one is change the names,

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.470
the list items are on the drop-down menu.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.490
We need to find the first list item which starts with action,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.170
which is just there,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.830
and we want to change ours to the "NATURAL SURROUNDINGS" link,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:39.870
and then "WHERE TO VISIT", "TAKE A TOUR".

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.790
Lastly, the "CORPORATE" section.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.465
Okay, such all our list items in place.

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:56.105
Next we need to put the little image of the telephone there and sell our project.

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:59.795
So we do that by going back to the bootstrap.com website.

00:04:59.795 --> 00:05:05.285
We're going to the Component section and we scroll down and look at the glyph icons.

00:05:05.285 --> 00:05:08.450
What we need to do is find the examples.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.930
If you click on the sample code there,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.670
and we want to place it just before the CONTACT US text.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.860
Let's put that on a new line and who pacing the example.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.095
If we check our web page earlier,

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:26.280
it's a magnifying glass,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.790
that's just the example in which we have used on the website.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.120
If we locate the telephone,

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.350
which I'm wanting to use.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.625
That's glyphicon, glyphicon-earphone.

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.825
So if we go back into our class,

00:05:41.825 --> 00:05:44.525
it's glyphicon, glyphicon search.

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:48.540
So we just need to change search to earphone.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.465
Check our preview. There we go.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:57.490
There's a picture of the telephone in place.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.050
So that's our navbar finished.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.230
It looks great out-of-the-box because of all the Bootstrap CSS,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.760
which is already preset,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.985
we can override any the Preset styles,

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:09.755
but we'll leave it as it is for now.

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:12.390
Next, we'll look at the Carousel.
