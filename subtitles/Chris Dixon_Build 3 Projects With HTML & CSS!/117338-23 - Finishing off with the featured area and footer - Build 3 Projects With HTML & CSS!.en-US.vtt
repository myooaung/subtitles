00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Hi everybody, welcome back. In the last video we looked at adding

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
the carousel and we also added the three buttons below,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.190
so we're going to finish this website off by adding

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.690
the featurettes and also the photo section at the bottom.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.560
So if we go back into the getboostrap.com website in the getting started section,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.385
we're going to use the same example we used for the carousel,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.770
which is the carousel example.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.275
If you right click on "View Source",

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:28.110
we will copy the section below,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.900
the one we copied last time so if we locate the start of the featurettes comment,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.340
and then we go all the way down

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.140
past the end of the featurettes and we'll also copy in the footer.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560
We don't need to copy in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.710
the last container because we've already got that in our website, so copy that,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.170
and then we need to go just below

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.305
the last row there above the closing container, and we paste that in.

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:02.385
So all the contents now in place in the website there.

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:06.875
Before we go any further, I just want to talk about the responsive grid in bootstrap.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:12.360
You'll notice that there's various classes such as col-md-7 and five,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.185
what they are is they're the number of columns.

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.560
If you notice on the first featurette,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.370
the image size is a five column grid,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.105
and the text left of it is a seven column grid.

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:29.190
So it's a 12 column grid we're using,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.835
so the seven on the left and the five is the full width,

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:36.030
and if we look at the last section we did in the last video,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.740
the three equal parts are divided up into four columns each.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.260
That's how we lay things out in Bootstrap,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.000
you can make things narrower or wider by changing the number of columns in the grid.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.875
So I will switch over to our finished website,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.125
so we can see what to type in.

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:54.370
So we first want to start off with the heading,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.125
so if we locate the featurette heading and delete the first featurette heading section,

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:04.150
and we'll call that wedding packages,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.155
and then the span section afterwards,

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:13.360
we'll change that to, tailor made to suit you.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.715
Then we'll look at the paragraph tags, which is just there,

00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:25.975
and we'll just include the text of the final website there.

00:02:25.975 --> 00:02:28.430
I'm just trying to copy and paste that in.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.840
We'll check our preview, see that's all okay.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.285
Next we'll put the image in there,

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:40.550
and if we change the image location,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.440
and we're all in the Images folder,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.510
and actually let me just change the data-source on that.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.460
So images/wedding.jpg for the first one,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.940
we'll change the second image also.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.920
So images folder and we'll add the restaurant.jpg image,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.245
and the third image, again,

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:15.450
delete the data source,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.685
and the third image is the spa.jpg.

00:03:20.685 --> 00:03:23.340
Okay that's all the images in place,

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.320
we just need to change the text now.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.030
So that's the first section,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.890
and the middle one,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.420
preview backup, and we just copy the text in there,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.450
we'll put that into the paragraph section.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.640
So for the heading,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.750
it's first class dining,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.440
and we'll change the see for yourself part in the span tags as

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.420
taken care of by world class chefs,

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.145
and then the third and final one,

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:13.380
I'll just copy in the photograph there,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.900
and we'll change the heading.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.540
So discover our spa facilities,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.680
and then, you'll never want to leave.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.355
Which is the only previews in our sleeper.

00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:43.800
Okay so we move on to styling these in a minute,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.710
we just want the text to be a little bit bigger.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.730
First of all, we'll just finish off the footer area,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.835
so we'll just change the text on there,

00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:57.440
and we change that to 2015, My Hotel.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.390
To add the styles for the text on there,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.920
the most preferred way to do it in Bootstrap is by

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.005
overriding we're creating your custom CSS.

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:15.195
So if we go back into the sidebar and if we go into File,

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:19.000
New, I'm going to create a new style sheet.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.265
So we'll save that straight away,

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:23.990
and we'll call that style.css,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.810
and we'll want to place that in the CSS folder of the bootstrap theme.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.720
So we'll save that, and then we head back into our index page,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.970
and if we go back to the top,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:44.760
we want to include our own CSS just below the bootstrap board, so overrides it.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.445
So we change the comment to custom CSS,

00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:53.310
and it's also in the CSS folder.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.480
We just need to change the name to style.css.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.665
So if we go back into our style.css,

00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:05.360
the first thing we want to do is we want to increase the font size.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.930
So if we go back into the index page and we find

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.785
the intersection need for the featurette,

00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:16.770
so that's the first one,

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.060
and then the text,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.320
the first class dining has a class of featurette heading.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.585
So we'll just copy that,

00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:28.035
and in our styles, and paste that in.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:31.875
Just want to add a dot in front of there if its class.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:35.740
We'll try the font size,

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.280
we'll try that with 4ems.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:51.000
Okay it looks better, and we've started with a little bit of padding onto the top,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.700
just to push the text down a little bit,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.760
and we'll set that to five percent,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.770
just a little bit more,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.050
set it to eight. Okay, that looks better.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.130
You'll notice how much faster and easier it is to build a website

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.400
using a framework such as Bootstrap,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.410
and feel free to customize this website or

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.075
any others as much as you want using the custom CSS file,

00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:29.715
but we'll leave the website at that,

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:33.035
we now have a fully responsive and a great looking website.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.370
So thanks for joining us,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.020
and that's the end of the fair project.
