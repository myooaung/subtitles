00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.795
When building websites at any stage of your development career,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:09.310
there is going to be a point where you need to take a look

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.705
some some valuable resources to help you on your journey.

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:18.445
One of these great resources which I use regularly is the Mozilla Developer website.

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:22.975
This is a resource for most of the core web technologies,

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:26.360
such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.545
and also lots of other things such as game development,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:33.529
and also has some guides to some back-end technologies using Python,

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:36.085
Express JS, and lots more.

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:40.070
At the moment though, we're just going to be concentrating on HTML and CSS.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.040
We won't really be covering JavaScript throughout this course,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.685
but this is probably something which you want to focus on after learning HTML and CSS.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:51.470
If we take look at any of these technologies,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.400
we can find out more information about the background, about what it does.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.250
But one of the really useful things is the HTML elements reference.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.600
Inside here, we can take a look at all of

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.615
the available elements which we can use in our project.

00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.270
So far, we've not got very far with our project,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.330
all we've added is some simple text,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.535
and we added these inside of the P elements.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:16.835
As an example, if we scroll down and select this,

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:19.780
we can see this represents a paragraph of text,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.965
we have the opening and the closing tags with the text inside.

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:28.160
We can find out exactly how to use any one of these elements by clicking on this.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.555
This is really useful if you get stuck at any point throughout this course,

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.885
and also when you move onto your own projects too.

00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:39.240
As well as this, inside the Technologies,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.010
if we go down to the CSS.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.000
We'll be working quite a lot with CSS in this project,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.060
CSS is the way we can add styling,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.875
we can add colors, we can add a layout,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.695
animations, and so much more.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:59.215
It can take our plain HTML and convert it into something really nice and visual.

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.400
Again, you can read through and find out

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.885
small information or you can go through to the CSS reference.

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:08.945
This will give us a lot of the syntax examples which we're going to be using.

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:10.865
We can take a look at these selectors,

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:16.580
which is a way to select a part of our HTML which we want to add some styling to.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.540
But we are going to be applying a lot of these techniques throughout the course.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.050
Next up, we have the W3 Schools website.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.210
This is also a useful reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.085
alongside some other things such as some server-side technologies,

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.725
some programming languages, artificial intelligence,

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.940
a lot more other subjects.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.740
Again, for this course,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.645
and when starting out the HTML,

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:46.460
only CSS section is going to be really useful if you want to use this as

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.610
a reference for any of the elements or to even find some code examples too.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.040
It's pretty simple to use.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.270
For example, if we are unsure about how to add an image,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.655
we can go to the images section,

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:01.730
where we'll see various examples which we can click on,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.575
and we can play around with the code,

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:06.545
and also the output over on the side.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:11.660
Until we have some code, we also want to make sure that we are writing it correctly.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.430
One way of doing this is to use a validation service such as the W3 validator.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.335
If we have a live website online,

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:24.110
we can add in the web address just here.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.665
We haven't published any of our sites to a live server just yet,

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:32.050
so one way we can do this is by clicking on the File Upload Validator,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.510
and then we can select our HTML pages from our projects.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.310
Check this. We can see this has finished

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.215
checking the document and we don't have any errors in this page,

00:03:45.215 --> 00:03:48.350
although we haven't added much content at the moment.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.120
Next up, we're going to take a look at some useful resources to add images,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.225
video, and also audio to our site.

00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:58.760
One of these is pixabay.com,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.460
which has thousands of free images which we can use in our websites.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.920
We can do a search, we can filter these down by photos,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.965
illustrations, vectors, video clips,

00:04:09.965 --> 00:04:12.445
and also music files too.

00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:14.040
It's pretty simple to use,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.895
we just need to click on any of these pictures which we like,

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:19.475
and then we can click on the "Free Download".

00:04:19.475 --> 00:04:22.040
You don't need to sign up unless you want to use one of

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.775
the large images, it's free to use.

00:04:24.775 --> 00:04:28.070
We often don't need to add attributions to the author,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.355
although it is appreciated.

00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:35.240
Also, if you do have some images of your own which you want to upload and contribute,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.625
you can also do this too.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:41.090
As well as this, we also have unsplash.com,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.690
which is another popular website for stock photography.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.940
Again, this has thousands of high-quality images which you can use free of charge,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.835
and if we click on this link just here,

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:56.330
we can see here that the photos have a free to use

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.245
license for commercial and also non-commercial projects.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:03.415
We don't need to ask for permission to use this in our projects,

00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:06.525
although of course, attribution is appreciated.

00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:10.885
The next resource we're going to take a look at is caniuse.com.

00:05:10.885 --> 00:05:12.490
This is a really,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.955
really useful website for checking if a feature is available in a certain browser.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:20.650
As we go through this course, we're going to be writing lots of

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.130
HTML and also lots of CSS too.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.165
For this CSS, we want to make sure that it looks the same on all of our users' browsers.

00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:33.970
For example, we may be able to use the latest CSS features in our own projects,

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.970
and it may look amazing on our up-to-date browser.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.295
But we also need to consider that some users may have some older browsers,

00:05:42.295 --> 00:05:45.310
especially maybe in things like schools or

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.360
some bigger companies that don't update their browser as regularly.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.865
It's simple to use from the homepage,

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:56.615
all we need to do is to type in a CSS feature, which you want to use.

00:05:56.615 --> 00:06:02.215
For example, if we want to use the CSS Flexbox in any of our projects,

00:06:02.215 --> 00:06:05.680
we can type this in and we can find out exactly what browsers,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.785
and also what versions is supporting the flexbox.

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:14.455
Here we can see that Internet Explorer only has partial support,

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:18.500
although this is supported in the more modern Edge browser.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.645
It's completely fine to use in Firefox, Chrome, Safari,

00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:26.500
Opera, and also all of the popular mobile browsers too,

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.600
in all of the latest versions.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.700
Meaning this is pretty safe to use in our project.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.110
This is really useful to check and also find out exactly what kind

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.615
of experience our users will have if they are using a older browser.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:44.060
Next, as well as some images and videos,

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.870
we may also just want to add some simple icons too.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.855
This, the unicode-table.com is a really useful resource.

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:56.180
We may want to add some icons such as arrows,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.950
and we can check through the catalog of thousands of different ones we can choose from.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.500
For example, if we wanted a right arrow,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.770
we could click into this.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.925
We can add these inside of our HTML with the HTML code just here.

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:14.500
We'll take a look at how to do this in our project.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.920
Next, we also have a dedicated icon library too,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.140
which is called Font Awesome.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.130
Of course, there is also lots of other icon libraries available too,

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.165
but Font Awesome is a really popular one.

00:07:28.165 --> 00:07:32.345
It also has a free version which has lots of different icons,

00:07:32.345 --> 00:07:36.560
and there is also a paid version too if you outgrow the free library.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.970
As you would expect, this is just a handful of some popular resources,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.690
there is hundreds and even thousands of more available online.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.010
I'm sure you will come across lots of these on your development journey.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.540
But for now though, this is just a handful of resources to get you started.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.345
Next, we're going to jump back into our project,

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:58.980
and begin at the header section.
