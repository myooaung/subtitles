00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.630
Currently, we have a pretty empty website,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.280
we just have this text of hello up at the top,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.355
which has been created with this paragraph element.

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:14.490
For the rest of this video, we'll be adding some more content by

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.805
creating our header section up at the top of our page.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.735
To take a look at exactly what we're going to be creating,

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:23.035
this is the final version.

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:26.460
The header section will be this gray section about the very

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.195
top and this is going to be split into three parts.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.565
We'll have the two links on the left.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.795
We'll have the site logo and also the image in the center,

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:39.495
and then some additional links over on the right.

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.070
To create these three sections,

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.840
we're going to be using what's called a div.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.675
A div is a section or a division inside of our website where we can place content inside.

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:55.355
To see more about this, we can go over to the Mozilla Developer website,

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.590
which we looked at in the resources video.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Under the technologies, we can either go to the HTML,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.530
but I'm going to do a search for div.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.210
Here we have the div, which is the content division element inside of our HTML section.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.250
This is a generic container.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.410
It doesn't have any special meaning.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.250
It's just used two group together content.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.445
We can see here we have a div which has the opening and the closing tag,

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:25.405
and then we can place our content inside.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:30.920
This particular example has an image and also a p-element for some text.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.940
We'll use this for all three of the sections and also some sections later on too.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.680
Let's get started, and the first thing we're going

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.005
to do is just to click on this icon up at the top,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.775
close down our sidebar,

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:47.450
and then we're going to move this hello text inside the body,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.700
as well as containers such as a div,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.140
which is pretty generic.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.760
In HTML version 5,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.280
we've also got some more descriptive elements,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.785
often called semantic elements.

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:02.455
These semantic elements are used to describe the content which is nested inside.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.605
One of these useful ones which we can use is the header elements.

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.830
This has a opening and a closing tag and we can

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.325
place inside all of the header related content.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:18.200
As we've just seen, we're going to be using the div element and all of

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.060
the content for our first section on the left will be placed inside of this div.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.840
When using Visual Studio Code,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.615
this also comes complete with a plugin called Emmet.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.725
Emmet is used to speed up our code in.

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:35.390
If we type in a div and then hit "Enter," we can

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.790
see this is automatically closed off as follows with the closing tag,

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.775
and it also adds the brackets around each section too.

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.110
So if you want the practice, you can either type this out

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.945
manually or you can make use of Emmet.

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:52.355
This now gives our first two div sections and I'm going to create the third one,

00:02:52.355 --> 00:02:54.665
which is for our links over on the right.

00:02:54.665 --> 00:02:57.740
But how do we go about creating these links?

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.680
If we wanted to, we could go pretty simple

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.580
and just have the p-elements like we've seen before.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.085
But generally, when we have multiple pieces of text like this,

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:09.890
it's a good idea to place in a list.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.920
With HTML, two of the popular types of lists which we can

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.930
use is the ordered list and the unordered list.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.320
A ordered list is a way to list out multiple items just like this,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.500
and these are ordered by numbers.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.335
This would have number 1, number 2,

00:03:26.335 --> 00:03:28.940
and continue on for each item.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.620
Unordered list on the other hand,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.425
instead of placing numbers next to each list item,

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:35.995
it will place a bullet point to the left.

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.570
Currently, we don't see this for our items just

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.785
here since we've removed this with this CSS.

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:43.725
Seeing how to use a list,

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:48.995
we're going to go back over to the Mozilla website and do a search for unordered list,

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.140
which is the ul tag.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.555
This is the one we need just here.

00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:57.440
Like many elements, we have the unordered list which is the wrapper,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.180
and then nested inside,

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.605
we have each one of our items surrounded in this li tag.

00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.380
This particular example is a little bit more complex.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.945
It also has a further unordered list nested inside of this cheese list item.

00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:14.620
You can see by the example over on the right,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.080
this will provide a nested unordered list.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.655
But all we're interested in for our example is this one single unordered list,

00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:24.710
which will contain our list items.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.440
Back over to the project, we'll create our first section inside of our first div.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.385
Create the unordered list for the wrapper,

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:37.180
and then place inside all of our list items.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.880
The first one, just like we're going to see here,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.445
is popular, and then the second one is what's new.

00:04:43.445 --> 00:04:46.360
So we'll create the list item.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.945
The text of popular.

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.550
Then the second one is going to be what's new.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.640
Save this, refresh the browser,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.770
and there is our two list items.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.170
Just like mentioned before,

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.150
since this is a unordered list,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.105
we will see a bullet point next to each one of these,

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:08.275
but we will remove these weird CSS very soon.

00:05:08.275 --> 00:05:12.300
If you don't have this index.html page currently open, remember,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.385
you can right-click on the page name,

00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:17.115
copy the path, and paste it into the tab.

00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:20.194
Or instead, you can go into the projects,

00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:21.800
into the recipes folder,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.050
and then double-click on the Index page.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.020
Or alternatively, if you don't want to keep

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.785
refreshing this browser after each one of the saved changes,

00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:33.695
you can use a live server extension.

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:37.730
The way to do this inside of Visual Studio Code is to go down to

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.820
the extensions button and then do a search for live server.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.960
This is one just here. I already have this installed in Visual Studio Code,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.569
but if you don't and you want to use this extension,

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.980
you will need to install and activate up at the top.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.415
Once this is done, you may also need to restart Visual Studio Code.

00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:03.265
You should then have a Go Live button at the bottom. Click on this.

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:06.350
This will then open up the page inside of the browser,

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.130
and now each time we make a change to any of our sites,

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.109
this will automatically be updated.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.820
Next, we're going to move on to the middle section,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.495
which includes an image and also our site title.

00:06:20.495 --> 00:06:22.520
For this, we're going to link to one of

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.010
the images which had been provided with this course,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.865
and then set our title as a heading.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:30.000
After our first div,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.735
jump inside of our second div section,

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:35.495
and then we add our elements from top to bottom.

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.310
The first one is our image,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.335
which is the img element,

00:06:39.335 --> 00:06:43.355
and an image is one of the elements which doesn't have a closing tag.

00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:46.370
This is because we don't nest any content inside.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.690
All we need to do is to make use of these attributes.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.520
The first attribute is the source,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.875
and this is the location of our image.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.310
This is all relative to our current index page.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.565
Currently, we are inside of the index.html,

00:07:01.565 --> 00:07:04.525
and alongside this, we have our images folder.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:09.160
Step 1 is to go into the images and then forward slash,

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.315
and we can now choose any of the images inside of this folder.

00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:15.854
What we need is the chefs-hat,

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.805
and this is an svg file,

00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:23.005
and this is really useful for scaling our images up and down without losing any quality.

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.625
After this, we also have the alt text,

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:30.260
which is some alternative text to display if this image cannot be displayed,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.815
and this is useful for multiple reasons.

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:36.065
For example, if the image cannot be downloaded for any reason,

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:38.365
this alt text will display in place.

00:07:38.365 --> 00:07:40.910
Also for accessibility, if people are using

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.015
a screen reader rather than a traditional browser,

00:07:44.015 --> 00:07:46.205
this alt text will be read out in place,

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.289
so make sure this is descriptive.

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.205
I'm going to say chefs-hat logo,

00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:55.440
close the side bar, and this is save and alt to the browser.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.840
There's where chefs-hat now appearing.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.655
Now, at the moment, don't worry about the positioning and also the layout.

00:08:01.655 --> 00:08:05.635
We will set this all up in just a bit when we move onto our stylesheet.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:09.170
Next out, just after our image, just below this,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.970
but still within our div section,

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.940
we're going to now make use of a level 1 heading.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.780
This is the h1, and with HTML,

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.655
we can add headings from Level 1 right through to Level 6.

00:08:20.655 --> 00:08:25.350
H1 being the most valuable of a most important heading in our site,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.020
we should only use this ones on our page,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.865
right through to h6,

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.745
which is the least important head in for our site.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:36.329
Personally, most commonly, I use h1 through to h4,

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:38.400
but this is totally up to you.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.160
Inside here, the title of my recipes,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.510
save this, and there's our site title inside of this section.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.935
The last section in this header is just like the first section.

00:08:49.935 --> 00:08:52.720
Over on the right, we have two additional links.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.165
This is for submit recipe and also the meal ideas.

00:08:57.165 --> 00:09:00.930
You should already know how to do this from the first section,

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.525
go into the third div at the bottom,

00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:07.260
create our unordered list, our list item.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.570
The first one was submit recipe,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.840
the second list item was for the meal ideas.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.510
Give this a save and check this out in the browser.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.490
Currently, acknowledging these bullets over on the left,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.965
which we're going to remove in our CSS.

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:26.990
If we take a look at the final version,

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.630
we do see we have one little bullet in between each one of these sections.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.540
This is just to place a divider between these two list items,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.560
and the way we can add these is by using a HTML entity.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.030
From the resources of video,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.025
we looked at a website called the unicodetable.com.

00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:48.545
This guy was a list of lots of different icons such as arrows,

00:09:48.545 --> 00:09:50.840
such as text, emojis,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.315
and one of these entities is this dot.

00:09:53.315 --> 00:09:57.210
To see this, we can go over to our unicode table.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.740
Let's do a search for dot,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.775
and this is the one which we are going to use up at the top.

00:10:04.775 --> 00:10:09.110
This is a dot which is placed vertically into the center.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.105
Grab the HTML code,

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:15.340
include the ampersand at the start and the semicolon at the end.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.045
Go over to our list,

00:10:18.045 --> 00:10:19.880
and then between our first two links,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.975
we're going to place this inside of a span element.

00:10:22.975 --> 00:10:27.739
A span element is pretty much just a basic generic container.

00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:32.540
We can place inside anything we want such as text or even these HTML entities.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.165
A span also falls into what's called an inline element.

00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:42.535
An inline element will naturally take up some space in the browser across the page.

00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:45.200
That is providing it space to do so.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.960
If not, it would drop down onto the next line.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.170
This is the opposite of something such as a div,

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.990
which is what's called a block level element.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.900
This means regardless of the size of the content,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.410
it would naturally drop onto its own line.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.985
We can see this if we look at our first section,

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.450
and then the second section is on its own line,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.400
and the same for the third section on the bottom.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.200
Just before we wrap this up, we'll also add

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.250
these dots to the third section at the bottom.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.720
Place in our span, place in the entity code,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:19.075
and there's our dot appearing in both of our sections.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:23.240
Good. This is now the HTML completed for our header section.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.040
It doesn't look too great at the moment,

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.475
but this will be all fixed when we come to the styling section.

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:32.450
But just before we add our styling and layout to this section, in the next video,

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.890
we're going to take a look at how we can add

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:39.180
some additional pages and also converts our list items into links.
