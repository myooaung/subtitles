00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.510
Welcome to learn HTML and CSS by building three projects.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.605
My name is Chris, and I'm excited to be your instructor for this course.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.704
I will guide you through the process,

00:00:12.704 --> 00:00:14.895
step-by-step, of building free,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:19.700
real website projects, each one building on what you have learned in the last.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.145
It's going to be a fun and practical way for

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:25.430
anybody looking to learn how to build websites.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.350
First, we will begin by creating a recipe-based website.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.500
This will be a static website,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.385
we will introduce you to the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.410
You will learn how to create the basic file and folder structure,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.030
how to create a basic index page.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.425
Then how to create all the sections of the website,

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:46.925
such as the header,

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.150
the body section, and the footer.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.090
We will then use CSS to style a website and also

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.050
for layout and positioning of all the various elements,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.275
such as positioning the images and also the text,

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.815
and adding the background images.

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:06.080
We'll then move on to a college-based website,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.000
which will be project two.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.015
This will be a fully responsive website,

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.840
which means that the website will look great on smartphones,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.240
tablets, or computers, and will respond to whatever screen size it's being viewed on.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.085
If you shrink the browser down,

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.730
you'll see that the two divs, which are side-by-side,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.350
will become stacked on top of each

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.759
other to make the project look better on smaller devices,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.340
and all the areas, such as the logo and the navigation,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.790
all responds to look back on a different sized device.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.545
Let's expand the browser back up.

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:47.795
You'll also be introduced to some new concepts,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.855
such as media queries and breakpoints,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:54.980
mobile phone styling, and even some more modern advanced techniques,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.715
such as the CSS Flexbox.

00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:01.390
Project three is a hotel-based website,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.025
which will introduce you to the popular bootstrap framework from the cradles of Twitter.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:10.340
Now we have a good understanding of how to create websites

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.770
from scratch after building the first two projects.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.670
Introducing the bootstrap framework will really speed up

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.800
your development time and allow you to add some really great features to your sites.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.555
By the end of this course, you will have built all three of these websites,

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:28.655
which will really give your web design skills a boost.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:31.490
The ideal student for this course is somebody new to building

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.545
websites or somebody with a little experience,

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:38.510
looking for a structured, project-based way to expand their knowledge.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.180
It will give you a great foundation,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.620
if you're looking into building websites for

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.315
a career or even if you just want to build a website for a personal or business use.

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:51.210
Thanks for your interest, and I look forward to having you on board.
