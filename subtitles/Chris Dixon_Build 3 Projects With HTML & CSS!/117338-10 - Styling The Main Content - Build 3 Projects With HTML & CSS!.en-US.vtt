00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.895
Welcome back. We now have some content on the page which we need to apply some CSS to.

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:12.765
Not only your styling but we need to do a lot of layout work too.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.380
We need to position all of this text into the center of the page.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.740
We need to add a background image, some general styling,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.590
and then at this section and just below with our free images,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.030
and also the text,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.450
we need to place these across the page and also find

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.385
a way for this text to replace each one of these images,

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.760
just like we have in the final version, just here.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.360
From the top, we want to begin with the sign-up section of in the styles.css.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.050
But just before we do this,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.600
we need a way to actually grab this section so we can apply some styling.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.180
All of this content is placed inside of this section element.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.155
But if we were to go ahead and grab the section with a CSS,

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:57.395
this would also apply to the section below too.

00:00:57.395 --> 00:01:01.180
What we're going to do here is to add in id attribute.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.510
This id is a unique value for this single element,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.415
so when using id's it's important that we only add this once on our page.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.545
Give it a name of "sign-up".

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:17.470
Now we have a way of grabbing this section in our CSS file.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.400
Now before we added our selectors just like this,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.575
we added them via the tag name.

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:25.755
We used the a, unordered list, the h1.

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:27.720
But when we are selecting an id,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.085
we use the # followed by the id name, which was sign-up.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:37.490
Then inside of here, we can place in all of our CSS rules, just like we did above.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.300
The first thing we need to do is to add a background image.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.050
Now earlier, we added the background values.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.205
Now previously above we've used the background-color property just here.

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:52.000
This is to set the color of the background.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.260
But this time what we're going to do is to set the background image.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.380
Then we can place it in a URL,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.995
which is the location of the file path of this image.

00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:09.050
Ours is in the images folder and the image for this section is the main.jpg.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.890
We can see immediately once we save that this image

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.235
now appears as the background for this section.

00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:19.030
We also need to add to the height property to make it a little taller,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.565
and I'm going to set mine to be 500 pixels.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:26.200
This will give us enough space to cover all of the content.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.090
Next, we also want this text and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.590
also the form input to be placed in the center of our image.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.195
A simple way to do this is by making use of the CSS flexbox.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:40.790
Just like earlier, we set the display type to be

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.765
flex and remember that the default flex direction is row,

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:47.590
so all content is placed across the page.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.960
However though, we want these to be stacked vertically,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.475
so we can change the flex-direction be column.

00:02:54.475 --> 00:02:56.730
Now we're making use of the flexbox,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.665
we need to add in two new properties to place these items in the center.

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:07.560
The first one is align-items and the value is in the center.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.960
So when the flex-direction is set to column,

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.245
the line items will make these centered horizontally across the page.

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:16.985
The next thing we need to do is the exact opposite,

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:19.970
which is to center our content vertically.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.100
The way we can do this is by using justify-content and placing these into the center.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.390
Okay, now if we take a close look,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.890
these are pretty much in the center,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.330
but it looks as though as a little bit more spacing on the top rather than the bottom.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.225
The reason for this will be to do with browser defaults.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:40.295
If we go into the Inspect,

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:43.160
click on this, and we can see that

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.150
the level 2 heading has some default margin on the top and bottom.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.505
The same with the level 3 heading,

00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:51.020
we don't see any on the form.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.040
So what we want to do now is work with our two headings.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.780
From the index page, these two sections were

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.350
placed in the level 2 heading and also the level 3.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.510
We can target multiple elements by separating these with a comma.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.480
The h2 and also h3,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.395
all of the styles inside here will apply to both of these headings.

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:15.085
First, the background-color,

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:19.310
and earlier we mentioned there is different types of colors we can add.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.360
We can use the rgb values which we have just here,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.970
and we can also use a hex value too.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.475
We can also extend this rgb type to be rgba.

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.680
Let's take a look at how we can do this just here.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.705
If we add rgb,

00:04:35.705 --> 00:04:37.370
we can add our regular values,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.890
I'm going to go for 46 for the red,

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.470
39 for the green and also 39 for the blue.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.150
If we save this, as expected,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.315
we see a dark background color.

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:53.045
Now, this background is pretty solid and it covers up the image.

00:04:53.045 --> 00:04:56.825
So what we're going to do is to apply a little bit of opacity.

00:04:56.825 --> 00:05:00.400
This means we can apply a certain level of transparency.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.690
To do this we add the fourth channel, which is a,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.325
and this is for alpha,

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:07.800
and then between zero and one,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.345
we can set a value.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:10.820
If we set this to be one,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.590
this will be a solid background with no transparency, just like we already have.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.360
But if we change this to be zero,

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.249
this will be fully transparent.

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.200
I want to place this is somewhere in the middle,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.185
such as 0.05, this means we still have a slight background color.

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:29.840
We also see some of the background image appearing too.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.410
This can give us a nice-looking effect.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.365
To make this bigger,

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:37.460
we'll set some padding of five pixels on

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.460
the top and bottom and zero on the left and right.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.935
To apply some space in inside of this element,

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:45.175
make the background a little taller,

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:47.855
in fact, we'll also add this on the side too.

00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:49.865
We'll just remove the zero value,

00:05:49.865 --> 00:05:52.285
so applies to all four sides.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:57.860
Next, the text, we're going to make this lighter by setting the color property.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.535
This one is an rgb value of two 235,

00:06:01.535 --> 00:06:05.695
222, and then 222.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:09.175
Giving us this lighter color which we see just here.

00:06:09.175 --> 00:06:12.365
If we compare this to the final version just here,

00:06:12.365 --> 00:06:17.980
we can see that the text on these two headings is slightly lighter than our version.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.760
This is because of the font-weight.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.170
I'm going to change this to be a lighter value of 300,

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.170
so it's not quite as bold as the default.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.040
Next, the level 3 heading level we can remove some of the browser defaults.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.935
Remember from before that we had some default margin,

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.755
and I'm going to remove this.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.680
Now if we set this to be zero,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.600
this would apply to all of our sides, or instead,

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.340
if we only wanted to apply this to a certain side,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.250
we could also place this into,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.175
so we could place it on the top, the bottom,

00:06:47.175 --> 00:06:51.370
the right and left, and this will now only apply to one side.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.925
In fact, it just wants to be a level 2.

00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:55.985
So this will apply to the top one.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.969
Now the margin has been removed from our top heading,

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.175
this will place this more in the center.

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:06.125
Going down we now have this form section with the input and also the Submit button.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.200
If we wanted to, we could go to our index page and add a

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.560
unique id or even a classlist input.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.315
Or we could also target this input by the type.

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:22.805
The way to do this is to add the input followed by the square brackets.

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:26.005
From here we can set the input type of email.

00:07:26.005 --> 00:07:31.430
Now all of the styles which we add inside here will only apply to the email input.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:38.275
First, the width, we can set this to be a fixed value of 250 pixels,

00:07:38.275 --> 00:07:40.850
which will make this a little wider.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.595
I'm padding, which remember is the spacing inside of the element.

00:07:45.595 --> 00:07:50.140
Any values which we add inside of here will either make it taller or wider.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.465
Let's go for five pixels on all sides.

00:07:53.465 --> 00:07:58.360
The border-radius and this will give us a rounding on the corners.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.610
Just like when using margin and padding,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.860
we could also add in multiple values.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.220
Or if we wanted to apply this on all sides,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.490
we just add the single value,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:12.765
the font size of 14 pixels.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:17.305
This will override the 18 pixel value from the body section.

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:19.835
Next, after the font size,

00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:24.275
we can also remove this border which is surrounding all four sides.

00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:26.240
This is pretty simple to do.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.430
All we need to do is to set the border property to be equal to none.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.075
We can do the same for our Submit button.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:35.865
Remember this has the type of submit.

00:08:35.865 --> 00:08:39.910
So just like both, targets all inputs,

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:45.420
and then narrow this down to the type which is equal to submit.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.435
First of all, we'll set a background color.

00:08:49.435 --> 00:08:52.090
For this we could either use the background-color,

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.125
which we've used above or could shorten this to simply background.

00:08:56.125 --> 00:09:02.440
Again, we have access to all of the same colors like RGB or also the hex values too.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.620
I'm going to go for cccccc,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.920
and this is the gray color which we see just here.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.800
Next, some padding on the inside.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.725
The first value will apply to the top and bottom

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:18.055
and we want to match the padding value from the email.

00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:21.670
Just like this we'll set this to be five pixels,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:26.185
and then to make it wider, we'll add 15 pixels on the left and right.

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:28.150
Also too match the e-mail,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:32.515
we also need to round the corners and also remove the border too.

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:36.250
Just like above the border none,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.820
then the border-radius, round the corners,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.410
all five pixels, and also the same font size,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.640
which is 14 pixels.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.225
Good. That's now our top section complete.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:56.840
We're now going to move down to these free images and also the text.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.370
For this, we also need a way to select the section and if we scroll down to this section,

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.320
we can also place it in an ID,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.635
which I'm going to call ideas.

00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:13.390
When using CSS, there is multiple ways we can use to place our images across the page,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.370
just like we've used previously,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.595
we're going to be using the CSS Flexbox.

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:25.345
First of all, we'll target the container which had the ID of ideas.

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:30.880
Set the display type to be flex and as mentioned previously,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.250
the default flex direction is row,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.295
which will place these horizontally across the page.

00:10:36.295 --> 00:10:38.350
If we take a look at the final version,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.830
we see there's some spacing around this whole section.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.860
To do this we can make use of a padding value which,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.500
remember, will appear on the inside of the section.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.420
That will be padding, and let's go for

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.250
15 pixels and there's some spacing around the edge.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.840
The next thing we need to do is to reduce the size of these images, so again,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.090
grab the idea section,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.945
and then we'll select all images which are placed in this section.

00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:11.040
Inside of here, if we set the width property to be 100 percent,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.350
all of these images will either scale up or scale down to fit inside of the container.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.945
Now we need to place all of these tech sections above each one of these images.

00:11:20.945 --> 00:11:23.290
Now, this may be tricky to understand if you've

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.915
not used the position properties in the past,

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:31.495
but we're going to be making use of two position values called relative and absolute.

00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:33.190
First of all, before we do this,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.970
we need to apply a class to each one of these sections.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.105
Now just like here where we placed it in an ID,

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:44.350
we could instead place a class inside of any one of these elements.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:49.855
A class is also another way to grab any of these elements using our CSS.

00:11:49.855 --> 00:11:55.090
But the difference between a class and an ID is an ID should only be used once,

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.970
but we can use a class multiple times.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.265
This is perfect if we want to add the same CSS values to multiple elements.

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:06.070
For this I'm going to give this a name of relative,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:11.450
I'm going to also apply this to our second and also our third div too.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.235
We grab this over in the CSS,

00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:19.810
go to our style sheet,

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.410
and rather than using the hash which we've seen for our ID,

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.020
we use a dot for a class.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:33.625
This was relative. Then we're going to set the CSS position value to relative.

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:36.430
We'll take a look at what this means in just a second,

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.700
but for now, we're going to go down to this title.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:45.190
The text inside of our index page is contained inside this level 3 heading.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.020
There is multiple ways we could grab this,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.534
we could target the ideas,

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.500
and then select the level 3 heading,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.040
or we could also place a class inside of each one of these.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.150
I'm going to go for the class option and name this the category title.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:07.855
Copy this and also place this in our two other sections. Back to the style sheet.

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:12.200
We're going to use the dot and this was the category title.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.120
This time we'll set the position value to be absolute.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.745
Now we have two different position values set just here,

00:13:20.745 --> 00:13:24.465
we've set the images to have the position of relative,

00:13:24.465 --> 00:13:27.585
and the title to have the position of absolute.

00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:31.640
A relative position is the element's original position.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.760
It will remain in the flow of

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.870
the documents and take up the original space which it was intended.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.560
We could also push around these sections with a top, right,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.860
a bottom, or a left value just like this.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.140
But I'm going to leave this as it is.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.050
Now, the reason we've set this to be relative is

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.965
because if we set another value inside to be absolute.

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.455
Here we can also make use of the top,

00:13:56.455 --> 00:13:57.940
right, bottom, and left,

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.745
but this time the difference is the section will be referenced from our relative image.

00:14:03.745 --> 00:14:08.245
If we set a top value of 20 pixels,

00:14:08.245 --> 00:14:11.680
say this, this absolute section will look for

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.085
the closest relative container, which is our image.

00:14:15.085 --> 00:14:17.410
The top value of will be referenced from the top,

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.365
we have the right, the bottom, and the left.

00:14:20.365 --> 00:14:25.735
As we can see, the 20 pixels from the top will push this 20 pixels down from the image.

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:29.200
We could also work with the left value too to push this into the middle.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.130
But alternatively, we could set the width to be 100 percent.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.935
This will now stretch the title to be full width of our image.

00:14:38.935 --> 00:14:42.985
Then this will allow us to apply the text-align to be in the center,

00:14:42.985 --> 00:14:46.030
placing these exactly where we want them to be.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.730
When we set the position to be absolute,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.530
just like we've done here, this will remove the element from the flow of the document.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.515
Naturally, it won't take up any position on the page,

00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:59.049
it will act as though it's been removed from the documents,

00:14:59.049 --> 00:15:01.330
meaning we need to use the top, right, bottom,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.180
and left to set the exact positioning.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.565
If we remove this relative section,

00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:11.605
say this, this is now placed 20 pixels from the top of the page.

00:15:11.605 --> 00:15:13.825
This is because as mentioned before,

00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:15.400
an absolute element will look for

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.195
the closest relative container and if it doesn't have one,

00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:22.180
it will instead reference the full documents.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.220
Let's place this back in.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.225
The final thing to do is to also apply some space in to both sides

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:32.305
of this middle image as we did with this image just here.

00:15:32.305 --> 00:15:35.620
To do this, back to our index page.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.450
For this middle section,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.770
we can also add a second-class separated by a space.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.780
Let's call this the middle,

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.735
save this file, and over to our style sheet.

00:15:46.735 --> 00:15:49.285
Grab the middle section.

00:15:49.285 --> 00:15:52.645
To apply some space in outside of this div,

00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:55.370
we need to go for the margin.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.480
We already have the spacing on the top and bottom,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.505
so we'll leave this as zero,

00:16:00.505 --> 00:16:04.090
and place 15 pixels on the left and right.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.420
Go on to the browser, we see we have some spacing on the left and right,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.360
but we also now have an issue with our title.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.820
Let's go to the Developer Tools,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.115
right-click "Inspect," click on the "Inspector" and we'll see what's going on.

00:16:18.115 --> 00:16:21.040
This is the level 3 heading, so click on this.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.960
If we hover over the padding section,

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.095
we can see we have a green outline around our title.

00:16:26.095 --> 00:16:29.995
This padding is also adding some excess space in which we don't need.

00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:33.445
To remove this, let's go back to our style sheet,

00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:36.985
and we already have a level 3 heading selector.

00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:39.745
Back up to our h3 section,

00:16:39.745 --> 00:16:42.265
this is the padding just here.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:43.990
We could override this section,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.545
but this will also apply to this section in the header too.

00:16:47.545 --> 00:16:51.340
Instead, we'll go back down to the category title,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.635
which is only going to apply to this section and set the padding to be zero.

00:16:56.635 --> 00:16:59.020
This now solves the problem horizontally,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.095
but we also need to maintain the vertical spacing.

00:17:02.095 --> 00:17:04.930
For this, five pixels on the top and bottom and

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.140
we'll only apply this zero to the left and right.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.205
Good, this is now the styling complete for all main content.

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.765
In the upcoming video,

00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:15.910
we'll get to work with our final section,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.410
which is the Footer area.
