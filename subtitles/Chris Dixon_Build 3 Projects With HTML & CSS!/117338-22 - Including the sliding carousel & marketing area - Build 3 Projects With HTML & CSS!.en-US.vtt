00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.600
Welcome back. In the last video,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.745
we finished the navigation bar.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:10.095
Next, we're going to start working down on our web page and include the slider.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.155
If we go back to the getbootstrap.com,

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:16.140
we need to select the JavaScript section.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.985
In the menu on the right,

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.570
if we just look for the carousel on our text,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.865
down to the carousel example.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:26.640
First, if we copy the code,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.295
and then underneath our closing nav type,

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:36.615
we'll just paste that in and look at our preview.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.050
It does not look much now,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.650
but we'll change the CSS and we'll add some images to make that look better.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.715
Let's start by adding our images.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:48.665
If we go down to the wrapper for slides,

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:51.865
what we need to do is meet in the image source there,

00:00:51.865 --> 00:00:53.760
path to our images.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.215
In the images folder, the two images we're going to use are the entrance and the pool.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:03.540
We select the pool images.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.280
We'll just use the pool image text.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.795
In the second div below,

00:01:12.795 --> 00:01:15.470
in the image source, we'll do exactly the same.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.045
In the images folder,

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.180
this one is going to be the entrance.jpg.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.460
We'll change the alt to entrance image,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.190
which is going to remove the dots,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.070
and then place of text so we can put a caption on the image,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.090
but we don't need that.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.120
Also, we've got free circles on there to indicate free images.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.400
We're only using two images in this example,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.965
so we'll change that with the list items.

00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.580
On the indicator section there,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.140
there's three different list items,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.330
we'll just remove the third one.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.160
That will change that to two indicators there.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.495
It looks like it's working fine.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:01.770
We've clicked on the arrows,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.770
and you can see we can change the image, and that's working fine.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.790
One more thing I want to show you is,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.970
if we shrink down to a mobile view,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.820
you can actually see that the menu drops down to a box.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.510
That makes it look a lot more neater and compact on mobile views.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.720
We need to surround the whole of the slider in a bootstrap container.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.040
We need to give that a div class equal to container, and we'll just close that.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.575
I'm just going to copy the closing div.

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:44.130
We'll put that at the bottom of the page.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.615
There was also a container we use for the navigation section up there.

00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:53.560
We'll start the container again.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.480
All bootstrap content needs to be within that container.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.100
We'll just put some comments in.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.500
This is going to be the carousel,

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.520
and it's going to be the end of the carousel.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.670
This is the closing div for the container.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.865
Let's let our slider to finish. If we go back to the getbootstrap website,

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:40.095
and if we go back into the getting started section.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.695
When at the section below the carousel here,

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:45.690
if we go into the getting started section of

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.335
bootstrap and we scroll down to the examples,

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.035
what we want is the carousel.

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:57.555
If we go into that example and right click and view page source,

00:03:57.555 --> 00:03:59.795
what we need to do is,

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:03.445
below the number is the carousel.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:11.410
Below the carousel, we'll copy the three columns of text below the carousel.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.870
We'll go back into our text editor.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.040
Below the closing carousel div, we'll paste that in.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.540
We'll just take a loot at our preview.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.285
We are just going to remove these three circular images.

00:04:30.285 --> 00:04:34.100
If we look at the image section on

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.915
all three pictures, there we go.

00:04:42.915 --> 00:04:47.260
First, we'll change the three different headings there in the H2 tags.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.910
We'll make them the same as our finished projects.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.980
The first one will be, Never far away.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.300
The second H2 tag is, Frequent visitor.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.220
The third one is, Rooms to suit you.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.640
We'll change the text,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.410
so the first one is, Never far away.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.840
In-between the P tags,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.685
we want to change that paragraph to,

00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:24.130
With over 150 locations worldwide,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.330
you're never far away from us.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.020
The second paragraph is going to be,

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.410
Join my hotel club for fantastic savings and loyalty rewards.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.030
The third paragraph is,

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.570
Packages are available to suit any taste and budget.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.700
Call our friendly team to discuss.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.010
Now, let's check that one in our preview.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.495
Next, we want to change the three buttons at the bottom.

00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:35.200
If you notice on the finished project,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.015
they've got a blue background.

00:06:37.015 --> 00:06:39.535
We head back into the getbootstrap,

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:43.860
back to the CSS section.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.980
If we look for the button section on the right,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.300
you'll notice that we're using the default button.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.120
If we look back into the index page,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.320
we'll look at the class and it's button-default,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.540
which is just at the top there.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.700
What we want is the primary button,

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.415
so we need to change it to button-primary.

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:08.470
We'll change that on all three buttons.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.905
We'll check that on the preview. Okay. Just what we want.

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:30.615
We also need to change the text of the button,

00:07:30.615 --> 00:07:32.270
so we check the finished projects.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.810
We need to change the view details section.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.460
The first one is going to be locations,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.870
second is join our club,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.429
and the third one is going to have the name of view details,

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:59.215
so we'll just keep that as it is and we'll check the changes.

00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:04.610
That's worked fine. All the texts at the minute is floated to the left-hand side.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.095
We want it to be centralized in all three of the divs.

00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:13.070
We do that by [inaudible] class to the row.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.490
We simply type in text-center,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.760
and that makes everything nicely centered.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.970
I just finished with this section.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.820
If you join us on the next video, we'll start looking at

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.190
the featurettes below. See you there.
