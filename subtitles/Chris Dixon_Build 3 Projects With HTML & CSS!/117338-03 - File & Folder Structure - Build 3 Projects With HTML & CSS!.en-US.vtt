00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.920
Welcome back. By now,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.940
from the previous video,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.965
we should have successfully downloaded

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:12.060
Visual Studio Code or a text editor of your choice.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.970
I have mine opened up on the left just here.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.790
I'm going to begin in this video by creating a project folder for our first project.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.420
Now, during this course, we'll be creating three separate projects.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.030
You can save these anywhere on your computer,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.580
can go in a particular drive,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.310
a particular location, such as documents,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.275
which I'm going to save mine onto the desktop.

00:00:35.275 --> 00:00:40.710
These three project folders for our project can even go directly on the desktop,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290
but to keep things nice and organized,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.980
I'm going to create a new folder and rename these projects.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.015
If we open this up, inside here,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:53.090
our first project folder will be for our recipe site.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.050
Let's create a new folder inside here called My Recipes.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.880
Now, when creating a website project folder just like this,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.100
there's no strict structure to exactly how we lay out our files and folders.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.075
We're free to organize these in pretty much any way which we want to.

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:13.610
Generally, we create some subfolders inside

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.190
here to store things like our JavaScript files,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.580
our images, our style sheets.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.480
You can generally group together all of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.435
the related content to keep things nice and organized.

00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:26.840
We're not really going to be dealing with JavaScript during this course,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.810
so I'm not going to create a JavaScript folder.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.370
Also, for this project,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.890
we're only going to have one style sheet.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.440
I'm not going to group these together either,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.160
but we are going to be dealing with multiple images in this project.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.285
Provided with this course is a images folder which you can use,

00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:47.635
or you can also use your own images if you prefer.

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:51.405
I have these images downloaded and saved on the desktop here.

00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:53.035
I'm going to grab this,

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:56.115
and drag this into our project folder.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.500
Inside here, we have all of the images which we are going to be using for this project.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.205
Then, we can open this up in Visual Studio Code.

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:08.195
We do also need some other files which we're going to create in just a moment,

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:11.440
but I'm going to create these inside of the text editor.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.140
What we're going to do is to grab the My Recipes project folder and,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.825
then, drop this inside of Visual Studio Code.

00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:22.700
We can see immediately that, over on the left,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.244
we have a sidebar,

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.120
just making this a little bit bigger.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.405
Then, we'll have all My Recipes project open.

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:33.125
The first thing we're going to do is create a new HTML file,

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.555
which is going to be our index page.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:41.080
The index page is typically the entry point to the main page for our website.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.830
If you hover over the sidebar,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.540
we can click on this "New File" icon or we can also right click a "New File".

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.475
This would be called the Index,

00:02:49.475 --> 00:02:54.940
and this needs the.html extension since this is a HTML page.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.050
The second file is going to be for our style sheets,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.495
and this is so we can apply some styling and layout to our projects.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:04.940
This will be the Styles and, then,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.880
this one has the.css extension.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.690
We can also see these if we open up our project folder on the desktop.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.180
Now, inside here, alongside our images,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.675
we see our Index and our Styles.css.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:22.280
We don't have any content saved inside of our pages just yet,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.235
but we can right click on the file name,

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.310
go to Copy Path.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.680
Then, we can paste this as a new browser tab.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.040
This will open up our project inside the browser.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.520
Of course, we don't have any content to show in this page just yet,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.490
but we'll fix this in the next video where we'll begin to create

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.310
our HTML structure for our first page.
