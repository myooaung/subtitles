00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.500
Moving on to some content,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.315
we're now going to add some HTML,

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.225
and also some style in it to our project.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.300
Beginning from the top with the header section.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.290
Then following after this is section that's just below which is the image,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.765
and also the text overlaid above the image too.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.300
This will also demonstrate

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
some useful techniques such as centering the section over the image,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.340
and also how to make our image responsive.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.850
By responsive, I don't just mean that this is going

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.300
to shrink smaller or larger like this.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.515
It's in fact, also going to use two versions of the same image,

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.075
a small one and also a large one,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.705
and only the appropriate size image will be downloaded.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:49.840
Let's take a look at how to do this starting with the header in the body.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.715
Create the HTML5 header elements as the wrapper.

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:56.810
Then we're just going to create two sections,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.910
which is the title in the top left,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.020
and then over on the right-hand unordered list.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.175
First, the h1, and we can also place in a <a> element to link this to the homepage,

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:11.675
if we want to reuse this header on multiple pages.

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:15.640
Let's go for the index.html,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.910
then I will title text inside.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.430
Next, our links, we can place these inside of

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.980
the <nav> element to keep things semantic, the unordered list.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.275
The first list item is going to be for login.

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:33.110
I wrote mine in an empty <a> element.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.570
You can also create the separate pages to link to each one of these two.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.055
If you wanted to create a "Login Page", a "Register Page",

00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:44.880
and also a "Get in Touch Page" or a little bit of extra practice.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.220
Then link to these pages inside of the href, that's the first one.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.140
The second list item, again,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.890
a link with the text of register.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.815
The third one, this one is get in touch.

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:06.485
Okay. Give this a save and we can check over in the browser if this is working.

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:07.940
Of course, it doesn't look great,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.485
but we will fix this with CSS in just a bit.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.990
After the header section,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.180
this is all now complete.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.055
We can create a new section,

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.540
and this will be the wrapper for the image and also the text overlay.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.510
With the CSS, place in a class of apply.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.265
Then this will contain two separate sections.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:31.490
First of all, we have the image,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.170
which is the background image,

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.490
and then a separate div,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.960
which is going to be this text section just here.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.600
The source in the images folder, let's take a look.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.770
We have two separate images inside of here.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.360
We have the college.jpeg and also the college-small.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.390
We'll take a look at what this is going to do in just a second.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.290
But for now we'll point the image source with the images folder,

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.350
and then into the college-small.jpeg.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.290
Next, the div, and this will have a class of text overlay,

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.635
which we'll use in a moment inside of the style sheet,

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:14.310
and then the two tech sections,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.930
the first one is now taking online applications,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.820
which we're going to wrap in a <p> element.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.680
Notice a button with the text of apply here.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.150
Over to the browser,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.235
we have the image and also the text just below.

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:40.220
As you may expect to place this above the image,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.320
this is going to take some CSS work.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.320
So just placing this below the image is fine for now.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.275
But what we're first going to focus on is switching between our college image.

00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:55.730
We're going to download the college-small on a mobile device or a small screen.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.355
Then, once we reach a certain size,

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:01.085
we're going to switch to the college.jpeg,

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:02.905
which is a larger version.

00:04:02.905 --> 00:04:09.740
If we click on this, we can see the college-small is 1280 pixels wide,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.380
whereas the college.jpeg is larger,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.480
and it has the width 1920 pixels.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.405
Why would we want to include two separate images?

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:23.950
Well, the reason for this is because of the download time,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.360
and also the image quality.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.890
If you think about having a mobile device on visiting this project on a small screen,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.930
if we have a slower mobile network connection,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.940
we don't want to be downloading the large image.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.155
It would instead be a lot faster to download this smaller version.

00:04:42.155 --> 00:04:45.275
From the other side, if we are using a large monitor,

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:48.320
if we were only to include a small image like this,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.570
and then stretches to be a larger size,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.200
it would lose a lot of quality.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.320
To deal with this, we are going to make use of a HTML element called picture.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.875
This is going to allow us to provide multiple image sources,

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:04.325
and then the browser can decide which one is the most appropriate.

00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:09.250
Well, to do this, we're going to include the picture elements.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.840
We first include the picture elements as a wrapper,

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.370
we still need to include the image source,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.380
and then just above this,

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.490
we're going to use the HTML source element.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.415
The source element doesn't include a opening and closing tag.

00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:28.160
Instead, we pass in some attributes.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.955
The first one is going to be a media query.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:35.270
A media query is also something which we're going to use inside of

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.115
our CSS to apply different styles to different screen sizes.

00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:42.335
But when used with the source,

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:44.585
this is going to allow us to provide

00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:48.950
different size images for different media types or devices.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.445
One of the most common use cases for a media query

00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:56.525
is to switch the content at a certain screen width.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:59.375
If we pass inside of the brackets,

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:06.090
a minimum screen width of 1100 pixels.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.785
This particular section will only apply when the browser is over 1100 pixels wide.

00:06:11.785 --> 00:06:14.150
Then once it is over the size,

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.850
we can then use the source set attribute,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.820
it provides this file path to our large image.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.340
There's lots of different media conditions which we can add.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.605
We can include the maximum width.

00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:31.975
We can check for the device orientation to see if it's landscape or portrait.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.445
We can check the pixel ratio of a monitor,

00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:36.790
and lots of other different things.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.710
This is going to apply our larger image if the browser's width is over 1100 pixels.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.455
But if the browser width is below this size,

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:49.595
it's going to fall back to this image element just here,

00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:51.845
which includes the small version.

00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:56.180
If we wanted to, we could insert as many source elements as we wanted to.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.895
We could set up different media conditions,

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:01.870
and also point these to different images too.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.415
Over this, our two image sizes are fine.

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:09.755
Just as a side note, we always need to include this image element.

00:07:09.755 --> 00:07:12.260
This is because this is ultimately

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.905
the element which is always going to be rendered inside the browser.

00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:19.190
All we're doing is switching around the different image sources.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.060
Make sure this is always included.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.980
The way we can test this out, if we say this,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.765
is to refresh the browser and open up the developer tools with right-click,

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:35.880
and inspect, and into the Network tab.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.320
What we need to first do here is to shrink the browser down to

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.995
a small screen size which is below 1100 pixels, then refresh.

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:49.040
From here, we have the small version of our image downloaded,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.355
and this is 361 kilobytes.

00:07:52.355 --> 00:08:00.180
If we make this wider and go over the 1100 pixels, it's a little bit bigger.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:04.580
Reload, and now instead this will download our larger version,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.085
which is the college-jpeg.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:10.730
As you would expect, this is a larger file size,

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:16.410
so it's better to download the smaller image on the smaller mobile devices.
