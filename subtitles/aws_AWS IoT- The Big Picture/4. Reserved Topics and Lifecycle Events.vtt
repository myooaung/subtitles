00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's continue our discussion of topics by taking a look at reserved

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.049
topics and the three categories that they fall into.

3
00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.779
The first one is lifecycle events.

4
00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:11.029
The second one is rules.

5
00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.271
And the third one is shadows.

6
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:16.051
Now let's take a look each of these in more detail.

7
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.632
Let's start with lifecycle events.

8
00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:21.592
Now every single reserved topic, lifecycle events included,

9
00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.868
starts with the prefix of $aws/.

10
00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:27.973
There's usually quite a bit more in these reserved topics,

11
00:00:27.973 --> 00:00:30.524
but that'll be what each of them starts with.

12
00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:31.039
In fact,

13
00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.227
custom topics that start with a dollar sign are not supported by AWS

14
00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:37.856
and will actually terminate your connection if you try and send it to

15
00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:40.323
anything that starts with a dollar sign.

16
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:41.796
So when we're talking about lifecycle events,

17
00:00:41.796 --> 00:00:45.088
what we actually mean is two sets of events,

18
00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:46.940
connection and disconnection events,

19
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.488
which go to the following topics of

20
00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:53.544
$aws/events/presence/connected/ and disconnected,

21
00:00:53.544 --> 00:00:56.744
and then finally the end, /clientId.

22
00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:58.962
Now that will determine whether or not a client Id,

23
00:00:58.962 --> 00:01:01.627
in this case an AWS IoT thing,

24
00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:06.671
is either connecting or disconnecting from the MQTT session.

25
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.484
In addition to connection and disconnection attempts,

26
00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:10.915
there's also subscribe and unsubscribe events.

27
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:13.619
Now these will happen at the topics you see listed below,

28
00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.433
which look remarkably similar,

29
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.001
except instead of presence there's subscriptions

30
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.959
and subscribed and unsubscribed.

31
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:21.857
Now in this case,

32
00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.519
this will indicate whether or not a connection has

33
00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:27.578
subscribed to a particular IoT topic.

34
00:01:27.578 --> 00:01:30.390
Now this will help us keep track of different topics and take

35
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.379
actions on different subscriptions if we want to.

36
00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:35.488
Now in addition to lifecycle events,

37
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:39.069
we can also take a look at the reserved topics for rules and shadows.

38
00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.562
There's actually just one reserved topic for rules,

39
00:01:42.562 --> 00:01:48.615
which is the $aws/rules/ and then the ruleName of the rule in question.

40
00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.562
Other than that,

41
00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:53.478
there's also device shadows topics and there's actually quite a few of these,

42
00:01:53.478 --> 00:01:59.069
but they all follow the same format of $aws/things/thingName,

43
00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.914
in this case indicating whatever IoT thing we're talking about in reference

44
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.831
to the device shadow and then there'll be some other part at the end that

45
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.898
has to do with shadow operations like getting a document or updating a

46
00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:12.954
document related to the device shadow.

47
00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:16.557
Now because there's so many topics related to device shadows,

48
00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:25.000
we won't cover that extensively in this course, but we will discuss in the next video how we can use the Device Shadow service.
