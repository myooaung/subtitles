00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,025
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:05,140
This is Fernando Medina Corey, and in this video,

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,659
we'll be taking a look at how we can enrich and analyze

4
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,846
data that's generated by AWS IoT.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:14,129
So let's go ahead and jump into it now.

6
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,731
In this overview, we'll review the specific services that we'll cover.

7
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,616
We'll start by looking at IoT Analytics.

8
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:23,096
We'll see how we can use it to both prepare and analyze our data,

9
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:25,297
as it flows through IoT Analytics.

10
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:29,683
Then we'll look at IoT Events and see how they can help us take

11
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:33,499
complex input sources and then determine when different things

12
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:37,216
like potential failures and our IoT scenarios might happen and

13
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:39,520
alert on those kinds of events.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,072
After that,

15
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:43,592
we'll look at IoT SiteWise and see how we can use AWS

16
00:00:43,592 --> 00:00:46,532
provided hardware and software to integrate on-premises

17
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,771
environments with the AWS cloud.

18
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:49,955
Finally,

19
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:53,027
we'll take a look at what's next for us and what we should continue

20
00:00:53,027 --> 00:01:00,000
to explore as we work through our IoT journey. So let's go ahead and get to it in the next video.
