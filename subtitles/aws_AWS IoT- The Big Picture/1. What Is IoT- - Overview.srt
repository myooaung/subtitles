00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,633
Hello and welcome to my course AWS IoT: The Big Picture.

2
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:06,083
My name is Fernando Medina Corey,

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:10,982
and in this section we'll be looking at why AWS IoT.

4
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:14,422
Now before we get started, I just want to briefly answer the question,

5
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,747
who is this course for?

6
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:17,985
If you're taking this course,

7
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:23,526
you might want to be either looking for a conceptual overview of the AWS IoT,

8
00:00:23,526 --> 00:00:26,728
or maybe you're just getting started with IoT in general.

9
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:31,751
You also probably have a general understanding of cloud computing and

10
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:35,181
potentially some basic knowledge surrounding Amazon Web Services.

11
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,567
Now a quick side note,

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:40,016
for anybody who's a developer in the audience listening to this course,

13
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:44,102
this is a conceptual overview and reference for many of the materials you'll

14
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:48,061
be working with when you start interacting with AWS IoT.

15
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:48,417
However,

16
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:51,642
there aren't actually any coding demonstrations in this course and

17
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,499
you won't be diving into many of the APIs that are actually used

18
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,816
behind the scenes to use the entire system.

19
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:01,308
So keep that in mind, if you're looking for a more practical application,

20
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:04,932
to take a peek at a few other courses down the line.

21
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,502
Now I also want to be sure to answer the question,

22
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:10,402
what will you be learning from this course if you're not doing

23
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:13,654
things like coding and hands on demonstrations?

24
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:13,938
Well,

25
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:17,177
in this course we'll be going over a bunch of different things

26
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,423
ranging from basic understandings of IoT generally to identifying

27
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:23,971
capabilities of specific AWS IoT services,

28
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,376
and how you can use those to suit your needs when

29
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:28,415
you're developing applications,

30
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:32,558
as well as adding security and functionality to both your

31
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:35,355
applications and your devices themselves.

32
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:36,686
By the end of this course,

33
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:40,860
you should also understand tools outside of the AWS IoT system

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,962
and these include other AWS services that you can integrate with

35
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:48,346
things inside of the AWS IoT suite.

36
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:51,571
So hopefully this clarifies what you'll be learning in this course,

37
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,587
but let's take a specific look at the overview for this module.

38
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:58,527
We'll start by taking a look at what is the Internet of Things?

39
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:01,296
We'll look at some basic surrounding IoT.

40
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:04,720
We'll also look at what the purposes of the Internet of Things are,

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,426
meaning what we'll be doing with them in our organizations

42
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:10,318
and how we might benefit from using IoT.

43
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,103
Then we'll look at risks and responsibilities that we face

44
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:15,458
whenever we're working with the Internet of Things.

45
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:21,466
Before we start looking at how AWS itself fits within our potential IoT needs.

46
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:26,013
We'll look at how AWS provides solutions for device software on our IoT devices.

47
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,783
We'll also look at how it can provide services to help us

48
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:31,303
manage and control and secure our devices,

49
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:35,956
and how we can analyze and enrich the data that's generated by our devices.

50
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:38,685
Now there are a lot of different AWS services that will

51
00:02:38,685 --> 00:02:40,456
fit into each of these components,

52
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:44,771
and we'll take more looks at each of these in depth in future modules as well.

53
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:48,260
But after we've gone over a quick overview of those areas,

54
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,009
we'll start comparing AWS IoT to self- managed IoT.

55
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:56,721
And we'll look at how AWS IoT is serverless and what that means

56
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:59,442
for us when we're working with the platform.

57
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:02,971
We'll also look at security and resilience and how we can

58
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,643
benefit from AWS's focus on security and how resilience is

59
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:09,315
built into the AWS infrastructure already.

60
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:09,890
And finally,

61
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,003
we'll take a look at how we can integrate other things with

62
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,464
AWS IoT to get the most out of using it.

63
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:17,616
Now for each of these different components,

64
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:17,867
again,

65
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,767
there will be more in depth about the specific IoT

66
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,147
services that we might use in later modules.

67
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:30,000
So I'll go ahead and see you in the next video where we'll be talking about what is IoT?
