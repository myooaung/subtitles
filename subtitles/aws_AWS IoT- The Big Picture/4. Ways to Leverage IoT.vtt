00:00:01.384 --> 00:00:03.651
So now that we have a good understanding of the basic

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:05.311
building blocks of the Internet of Things,

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:09.370
why would we actually use it in our organizations?

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.262
Well one of the first reasons we might do this is to actually collect data.

5
00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:16.324
Now you can think of an example of a truck that constantly sends GPS

6
00:00:16.324 --> 00:00:20.031
coordinates out to some home server and stores that data.

7
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:22.106
Now you could eventually build a lot of value with

8
00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:26.389
that data after you've collected it, maybe to optimize truck routes,

9
00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:29.592
or to do other things that would enable you to save money in

10
00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:32.196
your own environment or potentially increase the amount of

11
00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:34.361
products that you could sell or deliver.

12
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.754
There's also the possibility of device interaction.

13
00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:39.773
Now you can think of this, for example, as a light bulb,

14
00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.716
which allows control over the color or the brightness of the light bulb

15
00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.630
using some sort of application on a mobile phone.

16
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.156
Now data collection and device interaction are two generic categories

17
00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:51.441
of what you might do with the Internet of Things.

18
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:52.996
But you could also do both.

19
00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:53.561
For example,

20
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.809
you might have a thermostat that reads the temperature of the room and then

21
00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.664
allows remote changes to the heating and the AC settings.

22
00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:04.306
And this would be both data collection by collecting the information

23
00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:06.483
from the thermostat of the temperature of the room,

24
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.207
and then also device interaction by allowing some user,

25
00:01:09.207 --> 00:01:10.740
maybe with a mobile application,

26
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.649
to change that heating level to a higher temperature if they are too

27
00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.135
cold or a lower temperature if it's a bit hot outside.

28
00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:21.330
Now let's think about this a little bit more by examining what

29
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.409
kinds of data we might actually collect.

30
00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.702
We could think of this in terms of the types of text data that we

31
00:01:27.702 --> 00:01:30.345
might store from sensors giving us information.

32
00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.206
Now this could be things like JSON, JavaScript Object Notation,

33
00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:36.109
it could also be Comma Separated Values,

34
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.809
or CSV, or Pipe Separated Values, or PSV,

35
00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:41.504
or other delimited formats like those.

36
00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.707
And we could also have sensor data that outputs media files,

37
00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:45.410
so not just these text-based formats,

38
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.781
but formats that are going to give us images or audio.

39
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.527
We could also have video information coming from our IoT devices as well.

40
00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:56.515
Now all of these different pieces of data are going to allow us to do

41
00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.833
different things and eventually improve our applications.

42
00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.863
So when it comes to improving the outcomes for our organizations using IoT,

43
00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:07.960
we might see these split up into two general categories of

44
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.218
revenue growth and operational efficiency.

45
00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:12.866
Now there's also things that will probably fall somewhat in the middle,

46
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.878
but this will help us come up with a few examples of how

47
00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:18.055
we might improve our organization.

48
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:21.194
So the first might be improving customer relationships.

49
00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:24.755
Maybe whatever we're doing with IoT would allow us to have better

50
00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:27.495
relationships with customers in a way that would either generate

51
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:31.498
more revenue or keep those customers around longer so they continue

52
00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:34.480
to take advantage of our products and we have an ongoing business

53
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.548
relationship with them.

54
00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:39.074
We might also improve existing products using IoT.

55
00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:42.456
So maybe we develop a new feature on an existing

56
00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:44.314
product or improve an older feature.

57
00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:48.029
We could also do things like creating entirely new products and

58
00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.799
services with IoT and the options that it gives us.

59
00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.206
Now all of these are on the revenue growth side,

60
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:56.376
which would get us more money for our organization.

61
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.625
However, there's also the operational efficiency side,

62
00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:03.222
which would increase the efficiency of the organization or the product itself.

63
00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:07.455
Now this could save us money in the long run so that we don't have to do as

64
00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:11.151
much work or expend as much on particular tasks or resources.

65
00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:13.546
Now also under the operational efficiency side,

66
00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:17.900
we can make more informed business decisions based on the data we collect.

67
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.406
For example,

68
00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:22.843
if we have a bunch of information coming in from a manufacturing site and we

69
00:03:22.843 --> 00:03:25.290
have that coming in from all the manufacturing equipment,

70
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.416
maybe we can have a data analyst look at all that information

71
00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:31.759
and help us make important business decisions that inform

72
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.813
what we're doing in the long run.

73
00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.359
Now these are just generic examples of revenue

74
00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.433
growth and operational efficiency.

75
00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.053
In future videos,

76
00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:47.000
we'll take a closer look at specific examples of how particular companies did this themselves inside their own organizations.
