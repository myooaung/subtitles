00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.541
Hello, and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:04.698
This is Fernando Medina Corey,

3
00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:07.460
and in this module we'll be taking a look at how we can collect,

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.819
store, and process information inside of AWS IoT.

5
00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.450
So let's go ahead and get started by looking at

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.572
what we'll be doing more in depth.

7
00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:18.863
We're going to start by taking a glance at the AWS IoT button and how

8
00:00:18.863 --> 00:00:21.882
we can integrate it with our AWS IoT applications.

9
00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.059
We'll also look at the Message Broker and how it's a

10
00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.704
critical component of all AWS IoT applications.

11
00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:30.371
We'll specifically do a quick overview of the Message Broker so

12
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:32.727
we know how some of the basic components work,

13
00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:35.475
and we'll take a closer look at the topics and lifecycle

14
00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:38.263
events that are related to the Message Broker.

15
00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:39.236
After that,

16
00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:42.012
we'll also take a closer look at the Device Shadow Service and take a

17
00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.289
brief look at how it integrates with the Message Broker and uses some of

18
00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.295
the topics that the Message Broker supports.

19
00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:48.021
After that,

20
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:52.341
we'll take a look at the Rules Engine and see how we can use it to

21
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:54.701
filter and transform information inside of AWS IoT,

22
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:58.191
and also how we can leverage it to integrate with other

23
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:03.328
services inside of the AWS landscape, and also outside of the AWS entirely.

24
00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:05.380
And then we'll finish up by taking a look at the IoT

25
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.371
things graph and see how it could help us to expedite the

26
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.623
development of our applications.

27
00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:16.000
So now that we know what we're looking at in this module, let's go ahead and get started in the next video.
