Whenever you're interacting with AWS IoT,

2
00:00:03,996 --> 00:00:08,156
connections to the AWS services are going to be handled by the Device Gateway.

3
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:12,053
So let's go ahead and take a look at what exactly the Device Gateway is.

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,102
Well the Device Gateway is a fully managed,

5
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:19,068
auto-scaled entry point for IoT devices that are connecting to AWS.

6
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:22,541
Now what this means is that when you have a situation with an IoT device

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:26,112
that is maybe trying to connect over MQTT or Websocket,

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,902
and it's going and sending information through to AWS IoT,

9
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:33,736
that information will go through the auto-scaled,

10
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:36,036
managed Device Gateway.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,507
Now that information might end up getting routed to the Message Broker

12
00:00:38,507 --> 00:00:42,024
or the Shadow service or maybe the Device Defender.

13
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:45,408
And any of those different services are also going to rely on Device

14
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:48,325
Gateway to route the traffic all the way back.

15
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:51,439
But now what happens if we have a case where we have a bunch more devices,

16
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,866
let's say another million devices get added and we have a lot

17
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,497
more traffic that's going to come through?

18
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,967
Well the nice part about the Device Gateway is that

19
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,583
it will auto-scale up for us.

20
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:05,321
This means that when we have one device to one billion devices,

21
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:08,174
the Device Gateway will handle all of that increased

22
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:11,235
throughput for us and we won't have to do a thing.

23
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:14,499
We'll just have to pay more for the amount of traffic and time that we're

24
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,323
actually using with all of these different services.

25
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:17,702
However,

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:21,474
AWS IoT will handle the scaling of infrastructure in the background that

27
00:01:21,474 --> 00:01:24,894
we need to actually process this increased throughput.

28
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:25,377
So really,

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:35,000
think of Device Gateway as an ever expanding door for whatever traffic requirements you have that's completely handled by AWS.
