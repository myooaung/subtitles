00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:05,077
Let's take a really quick look at the AWS IoT button.

2
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:10,170
We'll do this by taking a look at an example workflow using the IoT button.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,483
We'd start with the literal device itself,

4
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,685
which simply would allow you to press a single button

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:17,436
that AWS has shipped to you as a device,

6
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:21,328
and you can configure that button to do different things.

7
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:23,838
Now the button will come with a certificate preinstalled on it,

8
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:29,391
so it can authenticate itself over through Wi-Fi to the AWS IoT Core or

9
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,373
other services that might require that certificate.

10
00:00:31,373 --> 00:00:35,078
And then once it's done that, you'll be able to set up in the background,

11
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,738
whenever that button is pressed,

12
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,504
that something like a lambda function will trigger and

13
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:41,250
then take some customized actions,

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,980
depending on however you configured that button and the lambda function.

15
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,223
For example, you might want to order some tacos or turn a light bulb on or off.

16
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:51,549
Now this is really just a high level overview,

17
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,737
but you can definitely apply the rest of your knowledge about AWS IoT

18
00:00:55,737 --> 00:01:03,000
if you're deciding to go and use the IoT button and create things like lambda functions and IoT applications.
