00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.637
The Internet of Things has a bit of reputation for being insecure.

2
00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.813
Now part of the reason for this is because there's risks and

3
00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:10.892
responsibilities that not every organization acknowledges before

4
00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:14.473
they go into developing applications with IoT.

5
00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:17.826
So I'm going to cover a few of these risks and responsibilities now.

6
00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.215
One of the first risks that you will see is that you might

7
00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:22.588
accidentally expose sensitive user data,

8
00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:26.497
and you do need to be aware of that when you're working with IoT and

9
00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:29.692
take steps to mitigate any risks related to user data.

10
00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:32.773
You also need to keep in mind that you could be subject to

11
00:00:32.773 --> 00:00:36.322
different regulatory fines if you do expose user data or do things

12
00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:39.513
that you're not supposed to with other bits of information or the

13
00:00:39.513 --> 00:00:41.340
technologies that you're using.

14
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.871
Furthermore,

15
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:47.504
your IoT devices themselves are often a pretty common target of attack and for

16
00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:50.212
attackers trying to incorporate devices into their botnets,

17
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:54.634
IoT devices can be very common attack targets.

18
00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:56.116
In addition to attack targets,

19
00:00:56.116 --> 00:00:59.093
you also might have to face ongoing legal changes or

20
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:01.098
requirements when you're working with IoT.

21
00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:03.849
This is because IoT is such a fresh industry,

22
00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:06.694
there's many different countries and municipalities trying

23
00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:10.083
to figure out how to actually regulate and legislate changes

24
00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.302
around the Internet of Things.

25
00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.128
And because these are changing so frequently,

26
00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:16.595
you'll have to be aware of those as you continue to

27
00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:19.153
develop your applications and your devices.

28
00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:20.521
Now in addition to these risks,

29
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.831
there's also responsibilities that you have when you're working with IoT.

30
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:26.702
One of the first ones is medical privacy compliances,

31
00:01:26.702 --> 00:01:30.572
and this kind of relates to potential regulatory fines.

32
00:01:30.572 --> 00:01:32.110
If you're working in the medical industry,

33
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.472
then you have to keep track of all the different laws

34
00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:36.225
that might regulate your IoT devices.

35
00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:40.327
In addition to medical privacy compliance legislation like HIPPA,

36
00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:42.770
there's also legislation like GDPR,

37
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.239
which mandates data privacy and standards around data privacy,

38
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.857
and this applies just as much to IoT as it does to any other applications.

39
00:01:50.857 --> 00:01:52.441
Additionally, if you're in the United States,

40
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.810
you might be subject to different federal regulation,

41
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.838
such as the FTC or FCC rules that govern how different devices

42
00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:03.940
use various frequencies and also how you use different devices

43
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.810
to collect and store information.

44
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.131
All of these different things might come into play depending on

45
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:11.635
the levels of hardware manufacturing and different things that

46
00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.866
you're doing with these IoT devices.

47
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:14.003
Also,

48
00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.492
you're going to have to keep in mind that IoT breaches might

49
00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:18.928
result in some sort of reporting duty.

50
00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:22.495
So if your company is doing something and maybe an

51
00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:24.441
accident happens and some data is breached,

52
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.355
you may end up having to report that or bear some duty to let your

53
00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:30.876
users know so they can take appropriate actions.

54
00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:34.508
Now we're going to talk about how we can mitigate a lot of these risks

55
00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.436
and really uphold these responsibilities later on.

56
00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.781
But it's important to keep in mind that they do exist,

57
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:42.293
so you don't end up like some of the companies that

58
00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.121
we'll talk about in just a second.

59
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:48.345
So let's take a look at two examples of some risks and responsibilities.

60
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:51.291
The first is an example of CloudPets, the second,

61
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.788
we'll be talking about the Mirai Botnet.

62
00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:56.581
Now let's start with the story of CloudPets.

63
00:02:56.581 --> 00:02:59.884
CloudPets sold internet-connected teddy bears.

64
00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:02.459
Now, eventually they accidentally left 800,

65
00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.339
000 user account credentials accessible.

66
00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:10.049
Now, this was not necessarily something that was just related to IoT,

67
00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.181
but it represented kind of a lack of security

68
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:14.559
mindedness in their entire organization.

69
00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.608
But in addition to these credentials that they left accessible,

70
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:21.256
they also left millions of recorded messages from these

71
00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:24.337
internet connected teddy bears accessible as well,

72
00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:27.421
essentially little clips of audio that people could spy on

73
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:29.726
from these internet-connected devices.

74
00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:32.419
And this was kind of the next step in horrible things that

75
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.520
could happen from being insecure with IoT.

76
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.095
Now the result of this was that CloudPets is now defunct

77
00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:40.824
and no longer operates as a company.

78
00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:44.803
But in addition to all of these things that happened when CloudPets was found

79
00:03:44.803 --> 00:03:47.904
to be insecure in leaving those credentials accessible,

80
00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:51.597
hackers also discovered that the teddy bears were hackable microphones.

81
00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:55.173
Essentially you could go in and exploit the teddy bears to record

82
00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:58.327
audio and send it back to the hacking user.

83
00:03:58.327 --> 00:04:01.598
Now this meant that CloudPets not only acted as a pretty

84
00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:03.605
bad custodian of the data that it stored,

85
00:04:03.605 --> 00:04:06.842
but it also didn't take the time to properly secure the

86
00:04:06.842 --> 00:04:10.026
devices that were in other people's homes.

87
00:04:10.026 --> 00:04:12.764
And this becomes a really poignant example of some

88
00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:14.730
responsibilities that were not met here.

89
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.624
Now we'll be trying to avoid situations just like this when

90
00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:21.423
we're going through how to use AWS IoT.

91
00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:25.859
But let's take a look at another story as well, the story of the Mirai Botnet.

92
00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.620
Once upon a time, there was Mirai and Dyn.

93
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.186
Dyn is a DNS provider.

94
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:31.774
Mirai is a virus.

95
00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:36.330
Now the Mirai virus was spread to many different IoT devices because

96
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.637
it was designed to scan for open IoT devices and then to try and

97
00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:44.834
access them with a default username and password that were the

98
00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:46.657
manufactured settings for those devices.

99
00:04:46.657 --> 00:04:50.941
Now because many people did not configure their devices properly or

100
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.024
change the default passwords and login credentials,

101
00:04:53.024 --> 00:04:57.443
Mirai was able to spread to many, many different IoT devices.

102
00:04:57.443 --> 00:05:02.353
And with those IoT devices, a hacker used them to actually attack Dyn.

103
00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:06.982
Now Dyn was a DNS provider for a large chunk of the internet,

104
00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:08.245
and because of this,

105
00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:11.733
when Dyn was attacked by millions of IoT devices at the same time,

106
00:05:11.733 --> 00:05:17.252
users were not able to access popular websites that Dyn controlled the DNS for.

107
00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:20.327
Websites like Twitter went down and users were unable to

108
00:05:20.327 --> 00:05:22.421
actually access them from many locations.

109
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:26.406
So the lack of security within the Internet of Things is not

110
00:05:26.406 --> 00:05:29.317
just a detrimental risk to your organization,

111
00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:33.045
it's also a much larger scale risk of hackers exploiting this to

112
00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:36.458
attack the internet infrastructure at large.

113
00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:39.025
So hopefully this impresses the seriousness of some of the

114
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:40.710
security risks that we're talking about here.

115
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:50.000
And in future videos we'll be looking at how we can actually mitigate all of these risks and take security best practices using AWS IoT.
