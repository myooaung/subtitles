1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:03,140
Now one of the most important features of device software

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,786
that AWS offers is over the air updates,

3
00:00:06,786 --> 00:00:07,918
or OTA.

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,737
Now on a microcontroller running Amazon FreeRTOS,

5
00:00:10,737 --> 00:00:14,986
we might have a piece of software running that suddenly has a

6
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:17,410
security vulnerability introduced to it.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,239
Now when this happens,

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,557
we might actually write a patch for the vulnerability and

9
00:00:21,557 --> 00:00:24,858
want to apply it to the existing software.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,196
So what we would do is we would write an image for the software so that we can

11
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:32,360
overwrite the old version and upload that into the AWS cloud.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,181
Once that was done,

13
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,419
we'd actually be able to send it through over to the

14
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:41,611
microcontroller with Amazon FreeRTOS and essentially schedule an

15
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,634
update for that to replace the existing software.

16
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,023
Now once that process has been scheduled,

17
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:50,295
it will notify something on the device called the OTA agent,

18
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:55,419
or the over the air agent, and that will download the new firmware,

19
00:00:55,419 --> 00:00:57,961
which is this software patch, to the device.

20
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:01,992
But it's going to do this piece by piece over MQTT so that

21
00:01:01,992 --> 00:01:05,880
it can assemble everything and then verify that it is the

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,431
software that it expected.

23
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:11,090
Now importantly, it's going to do a signature verification,

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,275
which essentially means it's going to check to make sure that this software is

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,062
legitimate software and not just a piece of malicious code that some hacker is

26
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:22,216
throwing onto this device and hoping to get updated.

27
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,398
After the software has been verified,

28
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:28,717
the device is actually going to have the over the air agent go

29
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:31,584
ahead and check that it's the latest version.

30
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,874
And it's also going to run a series of other tests to make sure that the

31
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:39,671
application with the new image doesn't have any conflicts or errors that

32
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:41,859
arise in comparison to the old version.

33
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,068
Now once all of those tests are passed,

34
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:46,999
the old version of the software will actually be deleted

35
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,807
and you'll go ahead and have that new image on the device

36
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:52,347
be what is loaded from then on.

37
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,829
Now the final part is that this will all eventually be

38
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,724
reflected inside of the AWS cloud,

39
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:06,000
so you do know that this has happened on each of your devices that require an update, and you can manage and monitor that later on.
