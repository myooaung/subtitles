00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.780
Let's look at our example Spring Data project to see how easy it is to add a

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.800
version to the URI. We'll see behavior before and after setting the basePath

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.210
property and we'll show how the @BasePathAwareController annotation affects

4
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.400
endpoints that are not managed by Spring Data.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.640
Here's our sample application.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.290
Recall that it is a Spring Boot app with an Employee

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.740
entity set up with an EmployeeRepository.

8
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.400
There's also a separate service that returns a schedule.

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.840
If we start up the application,

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.150
we can hit the different endpoints to see that it

11
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.200
defaults to port 8080/employees.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.440
First, we'll see that the database is empty. We can see 0 elements.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.840
Now let's add an employee.

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.740
We'll double check that it got added correctly.

15
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.840
We can see one element and that it has the

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.340
information we added, craig, developer.

17
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.170
We can also hit the schedule endpoint and see that the

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.930
schedule is Monday through Friday, 9‑5.

19
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.380
If you wanted to add a v1 at the base of the URI,

20
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.470
you simply open the application.properties file, then add

21
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.560
in the spring.data.rest.basePath property, then whatever

22
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.540
you want for the basePath.

23
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.650
In this case, we want /v1.

24
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.170
You'll also need to modify the ExampleService with the

25
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.200
@BasePathAwareController annotation.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.500
Recall that other services outside of Spring Data REST aren't

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.890
managed the same, and without this annotation,

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.070
the request mapping would remain /schedule. By adding the

29
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.640
@BasePathAwareController annotation, the RequestMapping changes to /v1/schedule.

30
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.810
No modification is needed to the Employee entity class

31
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.740
or the EmployeeRepository interface.

32
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.170
Spring Data will automatically manage the new spring.data.rest.basePath.

33
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.830
Let's restart the application to pick up the changes.

34
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.840
If we try to hit the old URI, we'll get an error.

35
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.800
Notice how now the /employees path is not found.

36
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.780
Let's add the new base, /v1/employees, and try again.

37
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.580
Now we get a response from the employees endpoint. Recall

38
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.240
that we're using an in‑memory H2 database,

39
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.440
so every time we restart, there's no data.

40
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.740
Let's go ahead and add another employee, then check it out again.

41
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.090
Here we can see the employee was added with the correct

42
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.700
information. For endpoints managed outside of Spring Data,

43
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.600
there's some interesting behavior.

44
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.540
If I hit the plain schedule URI, it still actually works.

45
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.680
We can add the v1 base path, and that works too.

46
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.640
However, if we remove the @BasePathAwareController,

47
00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.740
then restart the app, now if we try to hit the v1 mapping,

48
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.140
we get an error.

49
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.000
So don't forget the @BasePathAwareController on any endpoints that are not managed by Spring Data.
