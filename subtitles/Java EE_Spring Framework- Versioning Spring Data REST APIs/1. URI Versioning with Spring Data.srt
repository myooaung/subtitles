Hi.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,620
This is Craig Golightly, and welcome to Implementing URI Versioning.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,430
We're going to review how Spring makes it very easy to add a

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,840
version to your URI with a single property.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,360
We'll also look at what you need to do to configure any

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,130
endpoints that are not managed by Spring Data,

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,650
so they also get version information in the URI.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,630
Finally,

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,960
we'll review different deployment and management approaches for

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,850
supporting multiple versions and go through a demo of running two

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,280
versions of your API at the same time.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,220
First off,

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,740
let's talk about the one line of code that's going to save you a lot of

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,940
time and headache. The spring.data.rest.basePath property automatically

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,010
adds whatever value you put to the base of the URI path for all of the

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,740
Spring Data‑managed endpoints.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,240
You'll add this in your application.properties file.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,110
For example, if you had an Employee entity, Spring Data maps it to /employees.

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,220
Once you add this property with /v2, then the endpoint automatically

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,070
becomes /v2/employees. Be aware that the base path is only automatically

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:23,510
applied to Spring Data‑managed endpoints. For any other classes or methods

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,360
with a request mapping that you want to have the base path added to their

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,230
URI, you'll need to include the @BasePathAwareController annotation on the

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,040
class, or else the endpoint will only be mapped to whatever is in

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,370
@RequestMapping.

26
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,320
For example,

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,480
the getSchedule method in this class will always map to /schedule unless the

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:02:00,000
@BasePathAwareController annotation is added to the class, then it would map to /v2/schedule if the basePath property is set to /v2.
