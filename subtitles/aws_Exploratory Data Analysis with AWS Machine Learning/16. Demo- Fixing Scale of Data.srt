00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:05,100
As you remember, we mentioned that the machine learning algorithms,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,360
in particular the ones that calculate distance,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,060
are very sensitive to the feature magnitudes.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,620
And, hence, we need to scale our features to an outcome within that.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,240
To do that, we need to import Python preprocessing model first.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,900
I will separate the features from the outcome as we

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,300
only need to scale the features.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,680
Then I will prepare a MinMaxScaler from the preprocessing model.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,290
Python also supports other scalers we discussed previously.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,990
And here in the first line,

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:41,130
I fit the MinMaxScaler in my dataset and create a new

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,070
NumPy array with scaled features.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,890
And in the second line,

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,990
I construct the pandas data frame back from the NumPy features.

15
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,090
Let's examine our features now.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,000
And, as you can see, all our features now have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1.
