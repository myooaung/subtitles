Hi.

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.700
Welcome back to the exploratory data analysis using AWS.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.900
In the last module,

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.250
we understood how can we understand our underlying

5
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.370
data using different visualizations.

6
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.050
Now it's the time to prepare and fix our data to make it what

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.540
the machine learning algorithms expect.

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.170
In this module, we will start by understanding the importance of

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.830
having the right shape of data, and then we will discuss some common

10
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.000
challenges with the data, and then we will, of course, finalize with a demo.
