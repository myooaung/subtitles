00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.450
And now, let's have a look at different domains in the AWS Certified

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.730
Machine Learning ‑ Specialty exam and how the different stages in the

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.240
machine learning pipeline we introduced earlier map to those domains.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.810
On the left is an excerpt from AWS Certified Machine Learning ‑

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.240
Specialty exam guide.

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.040
As of March 2020, with the version number designated below,

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.520
the exam is divided into four domains: data engineering,

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.840
exploratory data analysis, modeling, and machine learning

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.340
implementation and operations.

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.840
While the right part is the machine learning pipeline,

11
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.620
the data engineering part, which accounts for 20% of your score,

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.940
corresponds to the data sourcing part in the machine learning pipeline.

13
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.590
The exploratory data analysis part, which accounts for 24% of your score,

14
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.240
corresponds to the data preparation part in the machine learning pipeline.

15
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.510
Notice how the first two domains,

16
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.750
namely data engineering and exploratory data

17
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.860
analysis, weight 44% of your exam score.

18
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.620
This is understandable since you will be spending 70

19
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.940
to 80% of your effort over here,

20
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.340
as we discussed earlier. The modeling part weighs 36% of the exam score

21
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.270
and corresponds to problem definition, model training, on model

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.890
evaluation parts of the machine learning pipeline.

23
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.880
I understand why Amazon assigned such a high score to this domain,

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.240
since it is where the core machine learning knowledge lies.

25
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.350
The final domain, which is machine learning implementation and operations,

26
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.470
corresponds to 20% of the exam score, and this part corresponds to

27
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.980
model deployment and model monitoring of the machine learning

28
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.140
pipeline. The operationalizational phase.

29
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.630
I need to clearly state that our course focus will be exclusively the

30
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.000
exploratory data analysts part, which corresponds to the data preparation part of the machine learning pipeline, the purple color.
