1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,170
And now we are done with the first module.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,840
Let's recite what we have learned so far.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,170
We went back to the basics and introduced the machine learning pipeline again.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,530
We briefly mentioned AWS services relevant to the

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,850
discussed machine learning pipeline,

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,840
with Amazon SageMaker being the king of them.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,440
Since this course in AWS Certified Machine Learning exam path,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,540
we have put the course into context to the exam objectives.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,770
This makes it easy for you to anticipate what type of knowledge is needed

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,540
in the exploratory data analysis domain of the exam.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,040
Since this is not an absolute beginner course,

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,340
we discussed what things I would expect you to know before proceeding further,

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,720
which is mainly machine learning basics.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,060
And I also shared a previous course I authored here at

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,240
Pluralsight that can help you to get up and running.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,370
We also emphasized the handsâ€‘on nature of the course to learn the most.

17
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,610
Then, we quickly defined data analysis and shared a small story

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,250
showing the power of data analysis if it's done correctly. It is

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,610
meant to be a teaser to your brain to perceive what sort of powerful

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,840
things we can do with stored data.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
Then, we introduced our dataset that we are going

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,080
to play with across the course.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,810
After that,

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,340
we introduced Amazon SageMaker in a more level of detail and its benefits.

25
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,970
Also,

26
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,930
we did a small demo where we set up our environment for

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,790
subsequent steps in the exploratory data analysis.

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,440
That's it all for now.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,000
I hope I see you in the next module, where we will start analyzing our data in Amazon SageMaker.
