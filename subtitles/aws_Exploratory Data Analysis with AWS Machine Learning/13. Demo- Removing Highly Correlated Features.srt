1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,800
Let's now see how we can remove the features with the

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,940
highest variance inflation factor,

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,970
or with the high multicollinearity, as we discussed earlier.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,200
As you might remember,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,400
features with large variance inflation factor than value five are

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,240
candidates to be thrown away since they will be considered highly

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,840
correlated with other features.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,610
I got this function from here.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,140
Let's go through the code together.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,320
In Section 1,

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,790
the code imports variance inflation factor and add constant

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,930
helper function from a stats model package,

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,210
which have useful statistical operations such as

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,270
calculation of variance inflation factors.

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,880
The code also defines a function to calculate the variance inflation factor.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,200
The function takes a pandas data frame and a threshold value.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,000
The threshold value is defaulted to five.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,960
In Section 2,

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,700
the code calculates the variance inflation factor across all features.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,750
In Section 3,

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,670
the code identifies all features that have a variance

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,200
inflation factor larger than five.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,270
And in Section 4,

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,530
we print out all features with a variance inflation index larger than five.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:24,240
And now, let's run the function on our code.

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,020
We will drop the sale price column on only get the

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,270
numerical features since the variance inflation factor is

28
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,050
only defined for numerical values.

29
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,110
And as you can see,

30
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:43,530
the function identified many variables as remover candidates, among them,

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,420
Garage Cars and Garage Area.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,740
We expected them earlier already when we calculated the correlation metrics.

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,350
And we have dropped all the features with variance

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,010
inflation factor larger than five.

35
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's have a look at the shape of our dataset. As you can see, we have now less columns, around 69.
