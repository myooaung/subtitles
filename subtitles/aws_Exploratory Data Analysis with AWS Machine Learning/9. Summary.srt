00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,440
Let's now recap what we have learned in this module.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,600
We started by discussing why we need data visualization.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,870
It is mainly because of the powers of the picture.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,560
Remember, a picture is worth 1000 words. Then, we continued

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,140
discussing the usage of data visualization.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,900
We have seen how it helps on summarizing our data,

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,860
assisting machine learning algorithms performance, and

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,500
finding interesting patterns in the data.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,380
Then we discussed the different categories of the visualizations.

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,410
Comparison visualizations help us to compare features across a specific

11
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,780
dimension, while relationship visualizations help us locate potential

12
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,230
cause and effect relationships. Composition visualizations to compare the

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,540
composite situations. And finally,

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,270
the distribution visualizations that help us to see how our

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,340
dataset is distributed across a range of values.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,440
Then, we proceeded with a demo for Amazon SageMaker to do visualizations.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,100
After that,

18
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,120
we introduced a specialized visualization service called AWS

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,010
QuickSight and discussed its features. And then we concluded

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,440
with a demo for AWS QuickSight.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,970
That's it for this module.

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,000
Now, take a break and come back to learn about preparing and feature engineering our data.
