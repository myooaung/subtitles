Let's now quickly introduce AWS QuickSight.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,070
It's a business‑oriented data visualization tool meant

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,500
for business nontechnical users.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,260
You can think about it as the equivalent of Microsoft Power BI in AWS'

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,900
space. It has the following features: It has affordable pricing, and

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:28,840
it is is scalable across large numbers of users, and the datasets are

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,900
processed using SPICE engine, which is superfast,

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:41,000
parallel, in‑memory calculation engine that makes our data visualization processes high performant.
