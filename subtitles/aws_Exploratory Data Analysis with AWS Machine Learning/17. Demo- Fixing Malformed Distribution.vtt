00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.890
Let's now discuss how we can fix the malformed distribution.

2
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's start first by having a look at the

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.290
distribution of one feature on our dataset,

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.140
namely the SalePrice.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.330
Here, I plot the distribution of the SalePrice against the

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.030
corresponding normal distribution curve.

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.050
And as you can see,

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.030
it is skewed to the left compared to the

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.610
corresponding normal distribution curve.

10
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.690
And here, we apply the log transform from NumPy library, as you

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.700
might remember. The log function will fix the skewness. And

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.560
let's visualize the diagram again.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.240
And now, as you can see,

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:51.000
the distribution of SalePrice follows the corresponding normal distribution. And our distribution has been fixed.
