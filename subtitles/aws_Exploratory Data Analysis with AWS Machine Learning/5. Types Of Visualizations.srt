1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,120
Let's now discuss the major types of visualizations we have.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,040
The first type is the comparison visualizations,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,270
which help us compare values across a certain dimension.

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,870
The second type is the relationship visualizations that help us detect

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,740
potential cause and effect relationships in our dataset.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,820
Composition visualizations consist of multiple graphs of the same

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,840
type with a goal to convey complex information.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,430
Finally,

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,540
the distribution visualizations help us understand

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,620
the underlying data distribution.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,560
We will discuss one type of the comparison graphs, which is the bar chart.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,900
A bar chart consists of different categories on the x‑axis,

13
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,540
say, for example, countries,

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,390
and the corresponding value from the characteristic from that category,

15
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,140
say, population.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,580
Therefore,

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,900
a bar chart serves as a way to compare different

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,040
values over a certain dimension.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,020
In the data analysis context,

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,110
it helps to compare a specific attribute over observations.

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:16,220
Another type of comparison visualizations is the line chart,

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,440
which is usually associated with the progression of time.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,520
For example,

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,530
the following graph shows the progression of sales over a time period.

25
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,200
On the x‑axis, we have the time as a number of days in the week,

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,090
while in the y‑axis, we have the amount of sales.

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,440
Interestingly, we can see a trend that sales tend to increase over the weekend,

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,350
so line charts are essentially trend lines,

29
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,460
and in the context of data analysis,

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,840
they help us identify the impact of time on a specific feature.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,270
The second category of the visualizations is the relationship visualizations,

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,380
which help us identify potential cause and effect

33
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,950
relationship between two or more variables.

34
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,860
One example is the scatter plot.

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,800
For example, we have this graph where the x‑axis contains the first variable,

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,580
which is the temperature in centigrade, while the

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,090
y‑axis contains the second variable,

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,010
which is the amount of sales. Each dot represent the

39
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,540
amount of sales on a specific temperature.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,560
Notice that the general trend is that as the temperature increases, ice cream

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,910
sales increase. This is usually emphasized via a trendline,

42
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,430
showing the direction of the relationship.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,460
So, scatter plots help us understand the relationship between two

44
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,980
variables, and in the context of the data analysis,

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,970
they are used to understand the nature of a linear

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,640
relationship between two features.

47
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,940
Another relationship visualization is the heat map.

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,140
A heat map simply consists of a correlation matrix of two variables.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,000
But rather than putting correlation values in the value field,

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,040
a color is used to designate the strength of correlation.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,600
Generally the darker the color, the stronger the correlation.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,690
Let's take a look of the heat map shown over here of a schedule of a

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,070
clinic. In the x‑axis, we have the hour and the day, while in the

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,640
y‑axis we have a specific day of the week.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,890
We quickly spot that Monday at 10 a.m.

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,660
is one of the busiest times at the clinic, while Saturday,

57
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:40,130
2 p.m. is among the least occupied times. So, a heat map tells us the

58
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,320
strength of relationship between two variables.

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,130
Therefore,

60
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,240
it makes it easy for us to identify correlated features that we

61
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,240
believe are most important for our training purposes.

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,250
The nice thing about the heat map is that it is more readable than

63
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,740
the plain number presented by correlation metrics.

64
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,030
The third type of visualization is the composite

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,120
visualizations that makes it easy for us to combine

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,740
things. A common example is the pie chart.

67
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,320
The pie chart, as the name indicates,

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,140
represent different categories in percentage in a

69
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,610
proportionate size in a pie with different colors,

70
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:24,090
usually, and each color represents a different category.

71
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,070
For example,

72
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,770
we have the following pie chart describing expense distribution across

73
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,120
different sectors in the country budget. We can see that agriculture in the

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,540
orange color takes 8%, while the health in purple takes 19%.

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,510
So, pie charts make it easy to understand percentage distribution and

76
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,470
makes it easy for us to understand how different values for a specific

77
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,470
category is distributed on our dataset.

78
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,740
The last category of visualization is the distribution visualizations,

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,740
which makes it possible for us to understand how our dataset is

80
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,350
distributed across different ranges of values. The most common

81
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,600
example for this is the histogram that tells us the frequency of a

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,040
specific value or range of values.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:27,230
For example, we can see that values between 300 and 10,300 occurred 8 times,

84
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:35,840
while values between 10,300 and 20,300 occurred only 1 time.

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,400
So, the histogram is useful to understand the overall data

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,970
distribution and to find out where most of our values lie. It is

87
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,020
particularly useful to detect outliers. Let's now do a quick

88
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,740
comparison between bar chart and histogram.

89
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,040
Bar charts show different values for different categories,

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,040
while histograms show the frequency of the values.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,590
A bar chart doesn't have to be ordered, while a histogram should be ordered.

92
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,140
As I discussed earlier, there are many types of visualizations.

93
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:20,000
If you are interested to know more, I have attached a link for a PDF summarizing them.
