00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.240
Let's discuss the missing data problem.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.510
We dislike missing values since they are likely to dictate

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.880
the quality of our machine learning model.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.380
Missing data is a very common problem in machine learning, and the

5
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.260
common causes of missing values could be front end systems might

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.610
have certain fields marked as optional,

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.300
and hence no value is entered, or we might have introduced new

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.280
columns that did not have values in the past, but it could be even a

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.210
failure of our input systems, for example,

10
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.110
a remote sensors that sends monitoring information might

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.190
fail to send updates for some time.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.080
So let's see what possible options we can do to handle missing data.

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.850
The first technique to deal with missing data is to drop

14
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.940
them, and the good side of that is simple.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.620
However,

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.170
we will risk losing useful information that could

17
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.840
have made our model learning better.

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.170
I would not recommend this approach unless you are absolutely

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.220
sure that we'll not miss valuable information.

20
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
The second technique would be simply involve ignoring missing values.

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.630
This only works with some machine learning algorithms that

22
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.880
are aware enough to automatically ignore missing values

23
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.240
such as kâ€‘nearest neighbors,

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.120
Some other algorithms will use the missing values as

25
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.260
unique value when building predictive models, such as

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.530
classification and regression trees.

27
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.210
Finally,

28
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.220
it worth noting that this is implementation specific since some

29
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.810
implementations are not robust against missing values.

30
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.680
The manual of your library is your friend.

31
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.670
The third technique would be imputing the missing value and

32
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.740
this can be done using different techniques.

33
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.390
We can replace the missing value using either mean, the median, or the mode

34
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.600
and recall those approaches the unit variant approach. Replacement with mode

35
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.900
is more common with the categorical features.

36
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.180
Another option is to predict the missing values using the

37
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.670
machine learning algorithms. In simple words,

38
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.870
developing a supervised machine learning model from other

39
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.000
features to detect the missing values, and this is called the multivariate approach.
