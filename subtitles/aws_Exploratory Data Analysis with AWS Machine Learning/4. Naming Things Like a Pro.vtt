00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.870
Another important thing in data science is to use the proper

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.600
naming and wording of different data parts when you are

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.080
communicating with other data scientists, and this is important

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.190
to avoid communication confusion.

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.680
Let's take a simple example with a minimal dataset. Let's assume that you have

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.440
the following table that has three rows and four columns.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540
I am not counting the ID column.

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.860
It stores some customer account information such as age,

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.140
gender, bank account number, and salary.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.890
The values on the horizontal axis are called rows or instances or observations.

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.040
These words are used interchangeably.

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.520
We call them instances since each one is a single instance of the

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.150
domain we are describing, and we call them observations since each

14
00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.780
instance is a single observation that we observe. And the values in

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.670
the vertical axis are called columns.

16
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.640
Up to now, this is simple and intuitive.

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.610
However, sometimes when we do our data analysis,

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.250
we find out there are some columns that we need to remove for different reason,

19
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.240
for example if they are highly correlated or just useless.

20
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.770
More on this later. One column that's most likely to be useless is the bank

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
account number since it is just a randomly generated number and doesn't

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740
tell us something special about the customer.

23
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.160
Now we have removed the bank account column.

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
As you can see, it is grayed out.

25
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.740
Let's see how this would affect how we name things.

26
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
As you can see, now age, gender, and salary are called features or

27
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.820
dimensions or attributes. The reason why we removed the account number

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.570
is that the account number doesn't represent something special or a

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.790
specific trait about the client.

30
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.580
In this case,

31
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.350
we say that this dataset has three dimensions or dimensionality of 3.

32
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.000
Why? Because we have three features.
