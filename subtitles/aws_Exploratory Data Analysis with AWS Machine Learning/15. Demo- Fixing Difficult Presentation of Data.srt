1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,550
And now, the next step we perform is one‑hot encoding the categorical

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,340
variables thanks to pandas, which makes it very easy using get_dummies

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,720
function. Get_dummies will check all categorical variables in our dataset and

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,640
expand each categorical future to a certain number of columns equals to the

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,110
number of categories in that feature.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,350
We have already explained one‑hot encoding previously. And

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,240
let's see how our dataset now looks like.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,120
As you can see,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,280
the categorical values has been expanded according to the

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,340
one‑hot encoding technique, for example,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:51,310
the sale type column, which is Sale Type_New, Sale Type_Oth, Sale Type_VWD,

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:01:00,330
Sale Type_WD. And we are done with handling the categorical features.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's see now how many columns we have. As you can see, the number of columns significantly increased.
