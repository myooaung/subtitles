00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.600
Let's now discuss the challenge of data with difficult presentation.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.040
We know that machine learning algorithms operate on mathematical numbers,

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.340
but what about if we have video or audio or even categorical data?

4
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.840
There are certain techniques to deal with video and audio data

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.610
that are outside the scope of our course.

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.010
Let's focus on the categorical data.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.290
Let's see what solutions we can do.

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.060
The first technique to represent categorical data

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.230
is the label encoding technique.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.490
It assigns a unique number to every contributing in the feature column.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.140
For example, let's assume that we have one feature column with countries Japan,

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.240
China, and USA.

13
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.290
Then we can assign one, two, and three to indicate each country respectively.

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.580
However, this approach is not recommended,

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.700
especially for datasets with too many features,

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.570
as some machine learning algorithms tend to reward

17
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.610
numerical values with large numbers. And this will take us

18
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.830
to discuss the second technique,

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.220
which is one‑hot encoding. One‑hot encoding simply converts every

20
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.920
category in our feature column to its separate column. And then it

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.490
assigns 1 to the feature column to indicate its presence and 0 to

22
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.990
the other columns. For example,

23
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.080
we have the following table that shows how we can encode

24
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.570
countries we discussed previously. In the top, we created

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.240
three columns for each category.

26
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
Then we assigned the values in the correct column for the

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.010
respective category and make other category columns 0. Here, we

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.000
would put 1 in Japan column and make China and USA columns as 0 to indicate Japan category.
