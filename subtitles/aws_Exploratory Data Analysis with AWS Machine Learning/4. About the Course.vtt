00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.230
So, let's discuss now what I would expect you to know before watching this

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.040
course. A basic machine learning background would be required.

3
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.880
It will help you easily make sense of many concepts

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.220
and things we are going to discuss.

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.360
Since we will use AWS environment to apply our experiments,

6
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.450
it would be handy to have a basic understanding of AWS.

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.430
I am not expecting a proficient level at all, just simple

8
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.740
things like IAM roles, S3 pockets,, concepts of regions, and so on.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.480
Finally,

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.430
the course will be hands‑on based. That is, we will take a

11
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
dataset and make our hands dirty by playing on it.

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.460
I would highly encourage you to follow along while coding to get

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.410
the maximum out of this course. Sounds a lot? Not at all. Step by

14
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.740
step and with patience, and you will become knowledgeable with

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.040
exploratory data analysis in AWS.

16
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.370
It's important to mention that this course assumes a certain

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.750
level of familiarity of machine learning,

18
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.140
as I mentioned,

19
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.200
which is necessary, of course, to pass the AWS

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Machine Learning ‑ Specialty exam.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.520
If you are completely new to machine learning,

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.380
then I would recommend watching my course, Building Your First

23
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.000
Machine Learning Solution, that goes with you on machine learning from the very beginning, here at Pluralsight.
