Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,540
My name is Mohammed Osman, and welcome to my course, Exploratory

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,350
Data Analysis with AWS Machine Learning. I am a software developer

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,070
and machine learning enthusiast at Smarter Code. Machine learning is

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,440
booming everywhere; however,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,660
machine learning is not much useful without careful data analysis

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,980
where we understand the underlying data trends and patterns and

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,660
data preparation where we fix the issues we found in our data using

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,810
data preparation techniques.

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,760
In this course,

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,660
we are going to follow a hands‑on approach to learn how to do

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,270
exploratory data analysis using AWS, a very important domain of

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,380
the AWS Machine Learning ‑ Specialty exam.

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,600
Some of the major topics that we will cover include what are the available

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,820
exploratory data analysis techniques in AWS, how to analyze your data using

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,040
descriptive statistics and reason behind it, how to use different types of

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,060
visualization techniques to understand your data distribution, what are

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,980
different challenges with the data, and how to fix these challenges using a

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,520
hands‑on approach. By the end of this course,

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,970
you will know how to analyze,

21
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:20,860
visualize, and prepare your data for machine learning tests,

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,960
and you will gain the required skills in the exploratory data

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,310
analysis domain in AWS Certified Machine Learning ‑

24
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,200
Specialty. Before beginning the course,

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,170
you should be familiar with basics of Python, basics of

26
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,480
AWS, on some basics of machine learning.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
From here,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,890
you should feel comfortable diving into machine learning modeling with

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,140
courses on machine learning model training and evaluation.

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,670
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn exploratory

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:02:00,000
data analysis with the Exploratory Data analysis with AWS Machine Learning, here at Pluralsight.
