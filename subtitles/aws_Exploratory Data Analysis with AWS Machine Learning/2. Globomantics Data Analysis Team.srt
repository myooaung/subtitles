1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's see what will happen in the machine learning

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,840
pipeline from an organizational perspective,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,710
which means how does machine learning teams operate and work in practice.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,010
We will explain the AI organization Globomantics Real Estate Company introduced,

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,180
our fictitious company.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,930
The housing sales data resides in many different systems hosted

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,450
in a real estate broker's office in Ames town.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,600
The supplied data has different for months,

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,450
whether it's APIs, files,

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:39,590
or databases since each broker has its own unique system.

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,630
Thanks to our dating engineering team who decided to do all the

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:47,740
heavy lifting on bringing the data from different data sources and

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,940
making them regularly available to us.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,110
At the end of the day,

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,200
they provided us with the finalized and consolidated data from many sources.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,000
And now it is our responsibility, as data analysts,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,430
to understand the underlying data and feature engineering to make

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,540
it good enough for the machine learning team.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,840
You can think about this as the CSV file we uploaded in AWS SageMaker.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,120
The machine learning team will experiment and play with the different

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,920
algorithms until they land a suitable algorithm that works best with the

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,440
business problem they would like to solve,

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,340
which is sale pricing forecasting.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,260
Finally,

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,120
the machine learning team will hand over the model

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,140
to the operationalization team.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,940
That will make sure the model works properly and safely in production.

28
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,100
Note that even though I have divided the machine

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,380
learning setup to different teams,

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,290
your mileage may vary based on the product criticality,

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,710
data volume, and the organization maturity.

32
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,840
Moreover, notice that the directions of the arrows are unidirectional,

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,240
which is over simplification.

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,740
In a realâ€‘life scenario,

35
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,500
the interactions among the teams are usually bidirectional,

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,000
and there is a lot of ongoing communication and discussion across

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,640
the team as they understand the business problem.

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,560
Let's have a quick discussion about the specific

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,090
responsibilities the data analysts at Globomantics have.

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,020
Firstly,

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,270
the team will be responsible for doing data analysis using different

42
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,840
statistical techniques, such as mean, correlation,

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,600
median, quadrilles, and so one.

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,820
The team will be also responsible for doing data

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,710
visualization using different graphs.

46
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,530
This will help us to have an intuitive overview of our

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,600
data without digging into details.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Finally,

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,850
the team will also be responsible for feature engineering the data, which is

50
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,440
making it what the machine learning algorithm expects.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,000
We will be taking these responsibilities throughout the course journey, so stay tuned.
