00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.490
And now,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.910
let's proceed with a demo and see how these visualizations

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.830
can be implemented in AWS QuickSight.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.680
Let's now learn how to do data analysis using AWS QuickSight service.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:27.640
I will now login into AWS Management Console, and I will search for QuickSight.

6
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.400
And I will choose QuickSight.

7
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.840
And now AWS Management Console tells me that I'm not registered for QuickSight.

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.180
I can sign up for an account.

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.160
There are two types of accounts for Amazon QuickSight,

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.140
the Standard and Enterprise accounts.

11
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.940
The Standard account would be enough for our purposes.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.040
The Enterprise account has additional features such as row‑level security,

13
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.150
Active Directory integration, and encryption at rest.

14
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.340
And then I will click Continue.

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.440
I'll be presented with this form to fill in the account details.

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.380
The QuickSight account name, I will fill in HousingSetVisualization.

17
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.940
And then it also asks for an email where I can send the notifications.

18
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.510
The other tick boxes will be helpful if we would like to

19
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.240
integrate AWS QuickSight to other AWS services.

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.580
We don't plan to do that.

21
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.010
So, let's click Finish.

22
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.440
And then I will wait a few seconds until my QuickSight account is created.

23
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.060
And here it has been created.

24
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.540
Click on Go to Amazon QuickSight.

25
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.990
And now we will be presented with Amazon QuickSight portal,

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.590
which is different from AWS Management Console.

27
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.870
The first tip we would like to do is to upload our dataset,

28
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.130
so I will click on Manage data.

29
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.200
And then I will click on New data set.

30
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.270
As you can see,

31
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.240
AWS QuickSight supports many types of datasets such as file sources,

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.540
SQL Server, or even Twitter feeds.

33
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.070
Let's click on Upload a file to upload our dataset as CSV.

34
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.440
And now QuickSight is showing me a peek from my dataset.

35
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.740
Then I will click Next.

36
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.700
Then I will click Visualize to start visualizing my data.

37
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.450
You'll notice that QuickSight provides a nice summary on the

38
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.240
right to show how the process looks like.

39
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.640
And now let's have a high‑level overview of our AWS QuickSight.

40
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.580
On the bottom left, we have a different visualization types section.

41
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.140
And from there we can choose which visualization we would like to do.

42
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.260
On the top,

43
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.840
there are fields on our dataset that we can use for data visualization.

44
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.620
While at the top, there are fields on our dataset which we can use

45
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.740
for visualization in the Field wells section.

46
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.060
While on the far left, we have some options if we would like to

47
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.650
create some filters on our data visualization,

48
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.040
define some parameters, or even create a story for our visual.

49
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.040
Since this is not a QuickSight course, we will not dive there.

50
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.590
While in the bottom‑right section, this is where we will see our visualization.

51
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.790
Let's do something simple and do a scatter plot.

52
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.940
I have chosen a scatter plot.

53
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.100
Notice that the field wells contain the X axis value, Y access, and Size.

54
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.700
Let's create a scatter plot similar to what we created in the previous

55
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.770
demo in the AWS SageMaker which we made through Seaborn,

56
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.640
which was SalePrice and Overall Quality.

57
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.490
On the X axis, I will choose the SalePrice field.

58
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:15.600
I can use the Data set filter here to search for SalePrice.

59
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.990
And I will drop it in the X axis.

60
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:23.830
And then I will search for the Overall Quality field,

61
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.140
and I will drop it in the Y axis.

62
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.840
And in a few seconds we get our scatter plot,

63
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.200
similar with what we did with Python Seaborn in the previous demo.

64
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.380
You can note that the SalePrice range is smaller than what we get in AWS

65
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.820
SageMaker. This can be modified from the settings.

66
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.820
The rest of the visualizations follow the same logic.

67
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.600
However,

68
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:54.000
you need to know that AWS QuickSight as of now is missing some visualization types such as histogram..
