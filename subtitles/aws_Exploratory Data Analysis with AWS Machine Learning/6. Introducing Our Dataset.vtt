00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.640
And now, let's have an overview of the dataset we are going to use

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
across the course to learn exploratory data analysis.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.450
The dataset is a wellâ€‘known dataset in the internet called Ames housing dataset.

4
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.940
You can find it in the exercise files.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.970
It has more than 2900 rows and more than 80 columns.

6
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.460
It is indeed a rich dataset and optimal for data analysis exercises. The

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.840
dataset contains different types of data, such as ordinal and categorical

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.140
data. More on data types in the upcoming modules.

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.090
The dataset is originally used for sale price

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.940
forecasting machine learning problem.

11
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.000
Finally, a metadata file is attached that describes each column in the dataset, if you are interested to know the details.
