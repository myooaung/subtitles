00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,540
This section will be a short introduction to probability.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,240
While we don't need to know lots of probability for our data analysis purposes,

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,440
it would be useful to develop a simple background as to

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,040
set the stage for data distributions,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:22,840
a topic that's inspired by probabilities and which we will discuss soon.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,690
Let's start by understanding why it is essential to

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,840
understand probability in real life.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,800
If you look at things around you,

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,940
you will find that there are many uncertainties out there,

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,520
whether it's something simple like rolling a dice, or the

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,300
number of people coming in a queue in a public service, or

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,640
in more complicated scenarios, they expected rain rate somewhere.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,410
Given the probabilistic nature of many events around us,

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,670
it would be extremely useful to develop knowledge and the

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,570
skills to deal with these uncertainties.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,320
Let's start diving.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,680
A probability simply tells us the likelihood something that will

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,030
happen. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1,

19
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,650
with 0 indicating impossible and 1 indicating

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,340
something that will happen for sure.

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,310
Let's now discuss how we can calculate probability.

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,290
The probability of an event happening is calculated as the

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,640
number of possible ways an event can happen over the

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,410
number of all possible outcomes.

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,840
A bit vague, I know.

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,880
Let's take an example.

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,840
Let's assume that you are playing with your friends and you roll the dice.

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,920
Let's examine few probability examples.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,020
The probability of getting 4, given that its one dice, it is simply 1/6.

30
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,850
Why?

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,610
Because it's only possible to get 4 if we get a 4 facing face; divided by 6,

32
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,980
which is the number of all possible outcomes when rolling a dice from 1 to 6.

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,440
The probability of getting an even number is 3/6 or .5.

34
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,230
Why?

35
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,760
Because there are three ways that we can get an even number when rolling a dice,

36
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,900
either by getting 2, 4, or 6.

37
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,070
The probability of getting a number bigger than 6 is simply 0

38
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,060
since 0/6 is 0. Simply put, it's impossible to get a number

39
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,890
bigger than 6 when rolling a dice.

40
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,090
The probability of getting a number of smaller than 7 is 1 since 6/6 is 0.

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,910
Simply put, we are 100% assured that when we roll the die,

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,540
the number will be smaller than 7.

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,820
Let's go further and introduce an interesting probability

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,800
concept that's called random variable.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,350
A random variable denoted by X is a mathematical variable that

46
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,430
describes the set of possible values of a random function.

47
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,470
Let's take the dice example we discussed earlier.

48
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,540
We can have a variable named X,

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,790
and it will donate the outcomes of rolling a dice. The possible outcomes of

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,610
rolling either a face with one dot, two dots, and so on.

51
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,900
Let's donate each face outcome based on the number of dots it has from 1

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,550
to 6. In probability terminology, we call X a random variable, and that

53
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,150
outcome of the dice face is a random event, and the possible number of

54
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,340
dots in the face as the possible values.

55
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,940
And now, after discussing random variables,

56
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,870
we are at excellent position to discuss probability functions.

57
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,900
Let's now discuss probability functions.

58
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,810
The first concept of probability functions is a probability mass function.

59
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,540
It describes the probability of a discrete variable

60
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,040
happening. If we take the example of rolling dice,

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,690
it can be described by the following equation. The

62
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,930
probability off getting around the value of X,

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,990
for example,

64
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,510
3, is defined as 1/6 if X value is between 1 and 6,

65
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,920
and 0 otherwise. On the other hand,

66
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,000
the probability density function describes the

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,540
probability of a continuous variable happening.

68
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:20,000
It is used as a mathematical modeling tool for some realâ€‘life applications, and it usually has complicated equations.
