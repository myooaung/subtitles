- [Instructor] Before we go any further,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.040
I wanted to introduce you to H+ Sports.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.020
H+ Sports is a fictional company

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.050
that provides products for an active lifestyle.

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.070
We'll be using H+ Sports as an example

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.080
throughout the lessons in this course.

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.050
We will build API definition files

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.030
that detail operations on an H+ Sports API

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.090
that pertain to things like the company's product catalog,

10
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.000
orders, and customers.
