00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] SwaggerHub's templates

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.030
can give us a jumpstart on building API definitions.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.090
In the last lesson, we built a customer API

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.040
the customer API definition to suit the needs of HPlusSport.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:26.070
So to get started, we're going to navigate

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.090
One is the inventory item, and the other's the manufacturer.

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.090
We're not going to use the manufacturer,

8
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.030
and now we're going to customize the inventory item

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.090
to actually be a customer schema.

10
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.040
and then we're going to remove the ID property

11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.000
a customer number to the required field list,

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.070
and then remove the release date.

13
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.050
At this point, we can adjust the properties

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.010
within this object, so we'll add the customer number,

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.070
but remove this UUID format, and then

16
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.090
We can leave the name property,

17
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.090
but we'll switch the example over to an actual

18
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.020
customer name, so we'll just go with John Smith there,

19
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:36.040
and then we're going to switch

20
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.070
and modify the example to a very simple phone number.

21
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.040
Okay, and then at this point,

22
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.030
we can remove the manufacture field.

23
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.080
So we have a customer schema defined

24
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.000
to the top of the API definition

25
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060
to start making some additional changes.

26
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.090
You'll notice that we have the servers object,

27
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.090
which points to SwaggerHub's auto mocking capabilities,

28
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.000
we'll leave that in place for now.

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.080
But we do want to change the description

30
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:24.070
this is an API for HPlusSport customers,

31
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.010
and then we'll change the title of our API

32
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:40.040
to the Customers API, and here within

33
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.040
We can leave the license as the Apache license,

34
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.020
and then moving on to the tags object,

35
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.080
here we're able to specify tags that can be used

36
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.040
to group different operations within our API definitions.

37
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.020
So I'm going to create a customer tag,

38
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.070
and we'll update the description to customer-related calls,

39
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.090
and then we can go ahead and remove this developers tag.

40
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.030
Okay, and now to the important section, the paths object.

41
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:29.080
Within the paths object, we're going to replace

42
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.090
summary and description information we'll just switch over

43
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.030
to indicate it's actually for our customer.

44
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.010
Okay, and we can say that we're able to search

45
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.020
available customers in the system,

46
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.090
and then within this operation, we're not going to use

47
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
any of these parameters specified in the template,

48
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.003
so I'll just go ahead and remove those,

49
00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:55.030
and now we can update the 200 response

50
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.008
and now we can update the 200 response

51
00:03:59.008 --> 00:03:59.080
to return an array of customer objects.

52
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.003
to return an array of customer objects.

53
00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:04.030
So we'll go ahead and reference the customer

54
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.000
So we'll go ahead and reference the customer

55
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.000
within our component section, and then the final thing

56
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.009
within our component section, and then the final thing

57
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.009
that we're going to do is remove

58
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.005
the post-operation because we'll no longer

59
00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:17.050
be performing a post within this API.

60
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.009
be performing a post within this API.

61
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.090
Okay, so now we can see at the bottom of the screen,

62
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.003
Okay, so now we can see at the bottom of the screen,

63
00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:26.030
it indicates that our API definition is valid,

64
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.000
it indicates that our API definition is valid,

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.002
so let's actually go ahead and save our API definition

66
00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:42.003
at this point, and we can hop out of the API definition

67
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:42.030
by going back to MYhub, which is kind of

68
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.007
by going back to MYhub, which is kind of

69
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:45.070
your home screen in SwaggerHub.

70
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.004
your home screen in SwaggerHub.

71
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:48.040
You'll notice on the left-hand side of SwaggerHub,

72
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.006
You'll notice on the left-hand side of SwaggerHub,

73
00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:51.060
we have this sidebar navigation.

74
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.009
we have this sidebar navigation.

75
00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:53.090
Here you'll see our organization,

76
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.001
Here you'll see our organization,

77
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:56.010
and then here in the main content area,

78
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.009
and then here in the main content area,

79
00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.000
we're able to see all of the APIs that we have access to,

80
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.009
so there sits our customer API.

81
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
We can navigate back into that API,

82
00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:08.090
and here we see the interactive API documentation

83
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.002
and here we see the interactive API documentation

84
00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:13.020
for our newly formed customer API definition,

85
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.002
for our newly formed customer API definition,

86
00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:17.020
which we were able to build from a simple template.

87
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.007
which we were able to build from a simple template.

88
00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:21.070
You saw how quickly the template

89
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.006
You saw how quickly the template

90
00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:23.060
allowed us to springboard into API development.

91
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.000
allowed us to springboard into API development.
