00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] Before we dive into the course material,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.070
let's talk a little bit about who this course is for,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.080
and what information you should know ahead of time.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.040
This course will benefit developers

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.020
who would like to build or are building solutions

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.020
centered around APIs.

7
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.050
Developers will learn a design-first API approach

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.070
to API development using Swagger.

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.070
Swagger helps us design, build, and document APIs

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.050
that are easier for clients to adopt and consume.

11
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.070
It also helps us build APIs faster.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.090
In addition to API developers,

13
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.060
consumers of APIs can benefit from the information provided

14
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.050
regarding API documentation.

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.060
This information found in the course

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.060
makes it easier for API consumers to integrate with APIs

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.080
documented using Swagger.

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.050
In general, this course will provide insights

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.080
into how APIs are designed, built and documented.

20
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.050
Additionally, you'll get a peek

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.030
at some emerging technologies in the API space.

22
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.090
By the end of the course, you'll be better prepared

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.070
to build systems architected with APIs.

24
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.060
Finally, let's discuss what you should know in advance

25
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.000
to get the most out of this course.

26
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.050
The course will teach you how to work with Swagger

27
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.090
and the open API specification

28
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.080
along with some other tools in the API space.

29
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.010
The course should not be mistaken for an exhaustive course

30
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.010
on every technology involved such as REST, YAML and JSON.

31
00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.020
You will be expected to understand these technologies

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.050
prior to starting the course.

33
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.080
The course project covers a lot of ground,

34
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.030
and it's pretty advanced,

35
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.010
so you can choose to follow along in the final chapter,

36
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.020
or just observe

37
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.030
as I walk you through the various technologies.

38
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.060
Either way, you will take a lot of valuable information

39
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.020
regarding APIs and tools in the API space

40
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.080
away from the course.

41
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080
In the project, we build sample applications

42
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.050
created with Angular and Spring.

43
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.090
So if you choose to code along with me,

44
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.090
understanding Java and Node.js is also helpful.

45
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.090
If you understand these concepts,

46
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.080
you'll do fine throughout the course,

47
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.000
and I'll be there to guide you through every step.
