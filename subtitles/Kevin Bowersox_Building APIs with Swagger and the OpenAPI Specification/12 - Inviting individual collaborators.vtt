00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] Within SwaggerHub,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.090
we can also manage access to API definitions

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.070
at a more granular level.

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.080
So I'm going to navigate into the organizational settings

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.020
for hplussport's and we're going to remove the

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.050
swaggercourse2 user from the organization.

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.060
And at this point,

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.070
I'm going to go back into MYhub

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.050
and I'm going to invite this individual

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.040
only to collaborate on the catalog API.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.090
To do this, we just click on the share

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.030
and collaborate button,

13
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.090
in the upper right hand corner,

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.050
and within this dialogue we are able to invite

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.070
individuals to collaborate on a specific API,

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.050
as opposed to our organizations entire catalog.

17
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.080
So here we can just specify the username swaggercourse2

18
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.070
and once we find our user

19
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.090
and identify them,

20
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.030
we can then confirm that we would like this individual

21
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.020
to collaborate on this API

22
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.050
and at this point,

23
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.000
they would now have access to the catalog API definition.

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.070
We can navigate over to the swaggercourse2 user.

25
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.000
Once we refresh their Myhub,

26
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.030
you'll notice that access to the other API's,

27
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.050
within the H Plus sports catalog,

28
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.030
are no longer available.

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.080
They only have access to the catalog API definition.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.040
So using this more granular approach,

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.070
we can invite individuals to collaborate on a single API,

32
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.000
as opposed to our organizations catalog.
