00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:51.006
it's Microsoft's cloud platform that allows us

2
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.003
to provision a new virtual machine we just click

3
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.005
on the virtual machine icon.

4
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:56.050
And from there we can go ahead and add the virtual machine.

5
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.002
And from there we can go ahead and add the virtual machine.

6
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:02.020
And this will take us into a form where

7
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.005
And this will take us into a form where

8
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:09.001
we can specify the details of our virtual machine

9
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.005
that we'd like to provision.

10
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.006
The first thing we'll need to do is create

11
00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:17.003
a resource group by clicking on the create new link.

12
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.002
I'm going to name this resource group H Sports

13
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:26.001
dash resources and then go ahead and click okay.

14
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.007
We'll then scroll down where we can provide

15
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.000
a name for our virtual machine.

16
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's name this machine the H Sports dash API dash server.

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.003
Let's name this machine the H Sports dash API dash server.

18
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:37.030
Next, we'll select the OS image that we would

19
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.002
Next, we'll select the OS image that we would

20
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.008
like installed on the machine.

21
00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:43.080
In this case we're going to use an Ubuntu image,

22
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.001
In this case we're going to use an Ubuntu image,

23
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:47.010
version 16.04.

24
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.007
version 16.04.

25
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:49.070
So we'll have a Linux distro.

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.004
So we'll have a Linux distro.

27
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:52.040
Scrolling down, you'll see that we can specify

28
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.003
Scrolling down, you'll see that we can specify

29
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.007
the authentication type for our administrator account.

30
00:01:59.007 --> 00:01:59.070
I'm going to go ahead and set this to password

31
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.003
I'm going to go ahead and set this to password

32
00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:02.030
and then for the username of the admin account

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.003
and then for the username of the admin account

34
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.007
I'm going to specify the H Sports admin.

35
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:15.005
And then from here we'll need to enter

36
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:15.050
the password for this new admin account.

37
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.005
the password for this new admin account.

38
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:21.050
With the admin password in place, the next thing

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.002
With the admin password in place, the next thing

40
00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:24.020
we'll do is open up the ports available

41
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.001
we'll do is open up the ports available

42
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.009
on the server that are exposed externally.

43
00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:36.000
So click on the allow selected ports radio button.

44
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then we're going to specify that we'd like

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.001
And then we're going to specify that we'd like

46
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.010
to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.

47
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.009
to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.

48
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.090
At this point, we've provided enough details

49
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.001
At this point, we've provided enough details

50
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.009
for Azure to create our new Linux VM.

51
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:57.003
So let's just click on review and create.

52
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.007
It appears that our virtual machine has passed

53
00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:04.001
validation so we just need to click create

54
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.001
one more time.

55
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll now see that Azure has begun to deploy

56
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.007
our new Linux VM.

57
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.000
And it's that easy with Azure.

58
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.002
In just a few minutes we can build out a Linux VM

59
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:23.000
that we can use to host our API implementation.
