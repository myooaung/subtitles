00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] Query parameters are another object

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.050
that can be reused in API definition files.

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.090
If we take a look at our API definition,

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.030
we'll see, within our product endpoint,

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.010
that we have the paging parameters

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.040
that we established for the get operation.

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
These parameters could easily be reused

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.060
for other endpoints that require paging.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.050
So let's go ahead and copy these,

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.000
because we're going to move them

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.010
within the component section to make them reusable.

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.010
To do that, we simply add the parameters object

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.080
to the component section,

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.060
and then we need to provide a name

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.040
for each of the parameters that we want to define.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.050
So, in this case, I'm going to

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.060
supply a parameter named pageNumber,

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.010
and then we're going to grab the YAML

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.060
that defines these parameters and paste it in,

20
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.090
and then we simply adjust the indentation

21
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.050
to conform to YAML standards.

22
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.060
And then we'll need to build out our second parameter,

23
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.000
which is going to be the pageSize,

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.040
and here we'll, once again, need to do some indentation.

25
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.080
And once that's in place,

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.010
we'll have a valid API definition.

27
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.080
And we can now take our two parameters

28
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.010
and put them within the get operation

29
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.050
for our product endpoint.

30
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.030
So to do that, we need to structure our definition

31
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.080
a little bit differently.

32
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.060
So instead of explicitly defining these parameters here,

33
00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.080
we're going to remove the definition,

34
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.070
and then we're going to add an array of references.

35
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.000
And, in this case, we're going to point to the page number,

36
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.080
and then we're going to add another reference,

37
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:22.030
within that array, to our page size component.

38
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.080
Okay, now if we take a look at our product endpoint

39
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.000
in the get operation,

40
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.050
we can see the pageNumber and pageSize parameters,

41
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.050
which are supplied by the parameters

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.000
defined in our component section.
