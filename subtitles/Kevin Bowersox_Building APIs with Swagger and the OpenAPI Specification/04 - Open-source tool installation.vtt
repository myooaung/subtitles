00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.070
Let's go ahead and click in this link

2
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.070
We're going to place the source code

3
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:50.010
within a new directory on our desktop,

4
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.010
and then save the zip file there.

5
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.040
We're then going to head back to the Swagger API page,

6
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.050
and into the Swagger Editor repository.

7
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.060
At this point, we can go to the releases section

8
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.010
and just like Swagger UI,

9
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.070
we can download that source code.

10
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.040
So we'll put both of those

11
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:27.000
And then let's navigate to that directory

12
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090
Okay, and then if we take a peek in these

13
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.030
extracted directories, you'll notice that

14
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.080
Swagger nests the folders within each other.

15
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.060
So let's just go ahead and we'll rename the

16
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:55.060
directory swagger-editor in this case

17
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.007
So we'll cut that,

18
00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:05.003
and then we can clean up these two empty directories.

19
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.001
And now if we take a look,

20
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:07.010
you'll see the source code for Swagger Editor

21
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.007
you'll see the source code for Swagger Editor

22
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:09.070
as well as the source code for Swagger UI.

23
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.009
as well as the source code for Swagger UI.

24
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.000
In order to run these tools,

25
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.009
we're going to need a web server to host them.

26
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:24.005
We can quickly install a web server using nodejs,

27
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.009
so make sure node is on your machine.

28
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.001
If you don't have it, just go to nodejs.org

29
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.003
and download the appropriate distribution

30
00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:34.009
for your workstation.

31
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.001
Once you've downloaded nodejs,

32
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:37.010
we need to install the http server.

33
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.008
we need to install the http server.

34
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:44.001
It's really simple with node packagemanager.

35
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:48.000
You just issue the npm and say install,

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and then the -g flag for globally,

37
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and then the http server.

38
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.004
This will cause the node package manager

39
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:59.006
to install the http server and then we just run

40
00:02:59.006 --> 00:02:59.060
an npm install, and once that completes,

41
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.001
an npm install, and once that completes,

42
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:05.007
we now have an http server

43
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:09.008
that we can use to host our Swagger tools locally.

44
00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:13.006
The first tool that will stand up is the Swagger editor.

45
00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:15.009
So we're just going to navigate

46
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.008
into our course workspace directory,

47
00:03:18.008 --> 00:03:22.006
and then from here, we're going to use the http

48
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:22.060
server command that we just installed,

49
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.000
server command that we just installed,

50
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and we point to our Swagger Editor directory

51
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.001
and we point to our Swagger Editor directory

52
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.007
and then we're going to provide two flags.

53
00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:35.001
The first is the -a flag,

54
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:35.010
and just provide our local IP,

55
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.004
and just provide our local IP,

56
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:40.006
and this will restrict the tool to only being hosted

57
00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:40.060
on our workstation.

58
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.009
on our workstation.

59
00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.090
And then we're going to specify a port of 8080.

60
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.006
And then we're going to specify a port of 8080.

61
00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:46.060
So now we see the http server's up.

62
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.005
So now we see the http server's up.

63
00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:54.001
We can then go to local host 8080 on our machine,

64
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:54.010
and here we see the Swagger Editor is now available

65
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.000
and here we see the Swagger Editor is now available

66
00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.000
for us locally as a tool.

67
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.009
for us locally as a tool.

68
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.090
We're going to now head into another command prompt

69
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.005
We're going to now head into another command prompt

70
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:04.050
and into the course workspace directory

71
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.008
and into the course workspace directory

72
00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:06.080
where we're going to stand up Swagger UI.

73
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.002
where we're going to stand up Swagger UI.

74
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:11.020
So much like Swagger Editor,

75
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.009
So much like Swagger Editor,

76
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.000
we use the http server command,

77
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and then we're going to point to Swagger UI.

78
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.004
and then we're going to point to Swagger UI.

79
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:24.002
We're going to specify our local IP,

80
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:24.020
and then we're going to run this tool on port 8081

81
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.000
and then we're going to run this tool on port 8081

82
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.004
to avoid any port conflicts.

83
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.007
There we see that it's now stood up.

84
00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:39.000
So let's open up our browser to 8081

85
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and then we need to navigate into the disc directory

86
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.009
and then we need to navigate into the disc directory

87
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.002
and here we see Swagger UI running locally

88
00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:47.020
on our workstation.

89
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.007
on our workstation.

90
00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:48.070
So with these tools up and running,

91
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.006
So with these tools up and running,

92
00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:54.004
we now have some local tools that we can use

93
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.000
throughout the course to build API definition files.
