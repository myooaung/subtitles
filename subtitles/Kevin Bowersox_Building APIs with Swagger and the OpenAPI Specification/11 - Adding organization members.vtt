1
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.040
for teams and collaborators to work together

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.080
to build API definitions.

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.000
We can add a collaborator to and organization's API catalog

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.040
by clicking on the organization in the sidebar

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.040
to access the organizational settings.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.010
Within the organizational settings section,

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.070
we see the members tab.

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.050
In order to invite a collaborator, all we need to know

9
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.050
In this case we're going to invite the swaggercourse2 user

10
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.010
to collaborate on the API definitions

11
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.050
So we'll go ahead and select that SwaggerHub member

12
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.040
and invite them, and you'll notice here in a second

13
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.000
that we will have this individual added

14
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.070
to the members of our organization.

15
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.040
Let's go ahead and make this individual an owner.

16
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.060
So we're going to give them

17
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.000
some pretty high level permissions.

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.070
Now, you'll notice that it's indicating

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
an invitation has been sent to this user.

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That invitation is sent via email

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.050
and this individual will need to accept our invitation

22
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.050
once they receive the email inviting them.

23
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.030
I'm going to refresh the page,

24
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.020
so that we can see, the member's status will update

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.040
once they've accepted the invitation.

26
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.050
There we see that the individual

27
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.070
with the username swaggercourse2

28
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.070
has joined our H Plus Sports organization.

29
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.020
Now at this point I'm going to go to a separate browser,

30
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.070
and here I'm logged in as the swaggercourse2 collaborator.

31
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.000
And that individual is actually an owner

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.050
of our API definitions and you'll see

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.070
that when I refresh my hub for this user,

34
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.060
we now have access to API's and domains

35
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.020
within the H Plus Sports catalog.

36
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.090
So if I navigate into the catalog API,

37
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.010
here this individual is able to make updates

38
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.010
to the API in order to collaborate

39
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.030
on their development within the organization.

40
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.070
Now, another neat feature in SwaggerHub

41
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.003
is we get the ability to make comments on an API definition.

42
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:43.030
So I just click this little plus button

43
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.006
So I just click this little plus button

44
00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:45.060
to the left of a line number

45
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.008
to the left of a line number

46
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:47.080
and then I can describe some change

47
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.009
and then I can describe some change

48
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.090
I would like to see made to the API.

49
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.008
I would like to see made to the API.

50
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:54.080
And this capability is able to facilitate collaboration

51
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.004
And this capability is able to facilitate collaboration

52
00:02:59.004 --> 00:02:59.040
amongst the team members of the organization.

53
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.009
amongst the team members of the organization.

54
00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.006
So in this lesson, we saw

55
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:04.060
how to add a collaborator at the organization level

56
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.008
how to add a collaborator at the organization level

57
00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:08.080
and this allows us to team up to build API definitions

58
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.004
and this allows us to team up to build API definitions

59
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:15.000
for an organization.
