00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
- [Instructor] In this lesson, we'll use Google Apigee

2
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.070
an API Management Platform, like Google Apigee,

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.090
can help centralize management of common API functions,

4
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.040
such as security, throttling, monetization,

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.020
monitoring and air handling.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.090
For those of you following along,

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.070
Apigee provides a free developer account

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.030
that you must register for before beginning

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.040
this section of the course.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.090
All you need to do is click on the Free Trial button

11
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.040
in the upper right-hand corner on the Apigee Home Page.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.050
I have an account, so I'm going to go ahead and sign in.

13
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.000
The first thing that we'll want to do

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.090
You'll notice it's referencing an OpenAPI specification.

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.080
Once we click on that option,

16
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.050
we're going to add the spec by clicking on this blue button

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.030
in the upper right-hand corner.

18
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.060
Now, you'll notice we have three options.

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.080
We can create a New Spec, we can Import a spec

20
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.020
from a URL, or we can Import a file.

21
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.030
We're going to use the Import URL option.

22
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.010
And you'll remember that our API definitions

23
00:01:26.010 --> 00:02:35.080
are sitting in SwaggerHub,

24
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.030
And then let's put it in a new tab.

25
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.000
And then we're going to suffix this URL with swagger.yaml.

26
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.030
Just go ahead and hit Enter.

27
00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:07.001
So, copy this URL.

28
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.010
we get a new specification within Apigee.

29
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.008
we get a new specification within Apigee.

30
00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:10.080
We can click on it.

31
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.000
We can click on it.

32
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And when we open it, you'll notice it opens in Swagger.

33
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.003
And when we open it, you'll notice it opens in Swagger.

34
00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:20.003
So, within Apigee they're using Swagger to modify

35
00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.007
OAS API definitions.

36
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:24.008
Now, we don't need to make any modifications,

37
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:29.002
except we want to copy the URL

38
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:29.020
for our production implementation.

39
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.006
for our production implementation.

40
00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.060
We're going to need that in a second.

41
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.006
We're going to need that in a second.

42
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:33.060
So, just go ahead and copy the URL to Azure

43
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.004
So, just go ahead and copy the URL to Azure

44
00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:44.003
for our API implementation and then hit Cancel.

45
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:44.030
The next thing we're going to do is setup a proxy

46
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.007
The next thing we're going to do is setup a proxy

47
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:52.002
to our API implementation running on Azure.

48
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.007
So, over in the left-hand sidebar, click on API Proxies.

49
00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:56.070
This is simply going to pass traffic

50
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.006
This is simply going to pass traffic

51
00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:06.007
from Apigee back to our API implementation running on Azure.

52
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:06.070
So, to create the new proxy,

53
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.006
So, to create the new proxy,

54
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:08.060
just click on the blue boxy button,

55
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.008
just click on the blue boxy button,

56
00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.003
and then we're presented with the list

57
00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:13.030
of different proxy types that Apigee provides.

58
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.007
of different proxy types that Apigee provides.

59
00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:19.008
In our case, we just want a reverse proxy.

60
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:24.003
We want Apigee to pass the traffic back to Azure.

61
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:24.030
So, leave that option selected,

62
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.001
So, leave that option selected,

63
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:27.010
and then click on Next.

64
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.001
and then click on Next.

65
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:29.010
Next, we need to provide a proxy name.

66
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.004
Next, we need to provide a proxy name.

67
00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:33.040
So, let's name this proxy hsports-catalog.

68
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.004
So, let's name this proxy hsports-catalog.

69
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:40.040
The next field we'll need to complete is the URL

70
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.007
The next field we'll need to complete is the URL

71
00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:46.001
of the existing API at Azure.

72
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:46.010
And that's where we're going to paste

73
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.000
And that's where we're going to paste

74
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the configuration we copied from our API definition.

75
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.009
the configuration we copied from our API definition.

76
00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:52.090
So, now that we've configured the API proxy,

77
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.002
So, now that we've configured the API proxy,

78
00:04:56.002 --> 00:04:58.000
go ahead and hit Next.

79
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And we need to specify some security.

80
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.007
And we need to specify some security.

81
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:00.070
So first, we want it to be a Pass through,

82
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.004
So first, we want it to be a Pass through,

83
00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:03.040
and then we also want to check this option

84
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.006
and then we also want to check this option

85
00:05:05.006 --> 00:05:05.060
to Add CORS headers.

86
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.002
to Add CORS headers.

87
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:08.020
With those options checked, we can go ahead

88
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.008
With those options checked, we can go ahead

89
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:10.080
and keep the production and test environments,

90
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.005
and keep the production and test environments,

91
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:15.050
so just hit Next.

92
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.001
so just hit Next.

93
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:21.004
And then we can check the prod environment

94
00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:21.040
when we're specifying our builds.

95
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.009
when we're specifying our builds.

96
00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.090
Go ahead and hit Build and Deploy at this point,

97
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.008
Go ahead and hit Build and Deploy at this point,

98
00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:26.080
and Apigee will start building out our API Proxies.

99
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.005
and Apigee will start building out our API Proxies.

100
00:05:31.005 --> 00:05:34.004
You'll notice that the Proxy's now ready,

101
00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:34.040
so we can go back to the API Proxies section.

102
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.007
so we can go back to the API Proxies section.

103
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:38.070
And if we inspect the hsports-catalog proxy,

104
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.003
And if we inspect the hsports-catalog proxy,

105
00:05:43.003 --> 00:05:49.002
you'll see that we are presented with the URLs

106
00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:49.020
for our API proxies.

107
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.007
for our API proxies.

108
00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:51.070
So, let's just copy this link.

109
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.000
So, let's just copy this link.

110
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.005
And then we'll go to a browser

111
00:05:56.005 --> 00:06:02.009
and paste it in order to access the API running on Azure.

112
00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.002
So, I can hit the Product endpoint on our API implementation

113
00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:11.002
and there we see a response that's running

114
00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:13.005
through the Apigee proxy

115
00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:13.050
to our API implementation on Azure.

116
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.000
to our API implementation on Azure.
