00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] In this chapter, we will shift

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.006
our focus to SwaggerHub.

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.002
SwaggerHub is a cloud-based development platform

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.009
for API design and documentation with open API.

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.006
Inside the platform, you will find advanced capabilities

6
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.009
that surround the open-source tools we discussed

7
00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.006
in the last chapter.

8
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.008
If you're familiar with the open-source tools

9
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:27.004
you will easily transition to using SwaggerHub.

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:31.002
The capabilities within SwaggerHub extend or complement

11
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.000
those provided by the open-source tooling.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.006
Many of these capabilities support how teams collaborate

13
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.008
to build and consume APIs.

14
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:44.009
This is more challenging than building APIs in isolation

15
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.004
because concerns such as reuse and standardization

16
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.005
become more difficult.

17
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.005
SwaggerHub has a feature called domains.

18
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:57.002
This feature allows object definitions to be reused

19
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.009
across API definitions.

20
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.006
Additionally, SwaggerHub provides a number

21
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.000
of management features surrounding API definitions

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.009
such as access restrictions, versioning, and integration

23
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.002
with source control like Git.

24
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.008
These capabilities allow organizations and teams

25
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:20.000
to secure their API projects and share them selectively

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.001
with other collaborators.

27
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.004
SwaggerHub also contains features that speed up development,

28
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:30.003
such as mocking and virtualization, allowing APIs

29
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.005
to be consumed before an implementation is completed.

30
00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:38.008
Finally, the editor within SwaggerHub provides rich features

31
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:40.009
such as better auto-completion,

32
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.000
customizations, and validation.

33
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.003
For organizations with large API catalogs, the features

34
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.007
provided by SwaggerHub are extremely beneficial.

35
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:56.000
The platform increases consistency across APIs

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.005
by delivering reusable components and validation,

37
00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:03.003
making API adoption easier for developers.

38
00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.007
Similar to version control, it provides

39
00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:09.004
an organized approach to building and releasing APIs

40
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.007
across their life cycle, removing the barriers

41
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:15.008
that prohibit teams from collaborating.

42
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:19.008
Finally, API-based development can occur more rapidly

43
00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.004
because of the capabilities in SwaggerHub.

44
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.009
The ability to quickly define an API and mock it

45
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.007
allows API developers and consumers to work in parallel.

46
00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:33.005
After finishing this chapter, you will understand

47
00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.003
how to leverage these SwaggerHub features to take

48
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:39.000
your API development to the next level.
