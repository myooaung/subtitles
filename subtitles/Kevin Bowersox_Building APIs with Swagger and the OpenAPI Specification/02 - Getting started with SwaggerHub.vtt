00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] In this lesson, we're going

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.040
to sign up for a SwaggerHub account,

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:20.070
so that we can start building API definitions

4
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.060
or you can create a new user account.

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.040
That's the route I'm going to go,

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.020
so let's create the H plus

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.070
sport

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.080
user, and then I'm going

9
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.070
to use a gmail address that I have,

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.050
and then specify a password for the account.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.070
Once we've provided all those details,

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.050
go ahead and hit sign up.

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:01:10.060
Then it's going to ask us

14
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.020
to invite collaborators.

15
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.050
So if you had team members that were going

16
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.030
now's the point where you would invite them.

17
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060
so I'm just going to continue to my account.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.080
And then it's going to build out our account,

19
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.040
and you'll notice we are prompted

20
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.040
to either create or import a new API.

21
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.010
We're going to actually create an API,

22
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.080
and this is going to open a dialogue box

23
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.030
where we can provide some high-level metadata

24
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.070
about the API definition we'd like to create.

25
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.040
Now one thing that's very important

26
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.010
is make sure you're always choosing

27
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.020
open API version three point O

28
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.080
throughout the course.

29
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.070
The next option we have is to specify a template,

30
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.030
so this is kind of a kick starter

31
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.000
for us to get started building our API definitions,

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.020
and we're going to use the simple API template.

33
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.040
And the

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040
next

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.080
item is the name of the API definition

36
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
which we're going to specify as customer.

37
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.060
You'll notice that our H Plus Sport Organization

38
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.070
is specified as the owning organization

39
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.060
of this API definition,

40
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.000
and the visibility's set to private,

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.000
as well as the auto-mocking feature's enabled.

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.006
as well as the auto-mocking feature's enabled.

43
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:29.060
So with these configuration options selected,

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.007
So with these configuration options selected,

45
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.006
let's go ahead and create the API,

46
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.001
and then Swagger's going to start building it

47
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.005
and it launches us right into

48
00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:44.000
this editor section of SwaggerHub.

49
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.004
So on the left hand side, you'll see that we can

50
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:50.000
navigate through the different operations

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.007
within our API definition file.

52
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:56.001
And then in the center, we have the editor

53
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.006
which actually has the API definition.

54
00:02:58.006 --> 00:02:59.006
And then on the right,

55
00:02:59.006 --> 00:02:59.060
we have the interactive API documentation.

56
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.007
we have the interactive API documentation.

57
00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:03.070
Now, in SwaggerHub we are also able to customize

58
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, in SwaggerHub we are also able to customize

59
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.000
some of the settings in the editor.

60
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.001
some of the settings in the editor.

61
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:10.010
So I'm going to switch this over to the light mode

62
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.004
So I'm going to switch this over to the light mode

63
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:12.040
and then increase the font size.

64
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.004
and then increase the font size.

65
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:17.007
On the left hand side, you'll notice

66
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:17.070
that we can hide or show different areas of the screen.

67
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.003
that we can hide or show different areas of the screen.

68
00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:22.030
So for example, if I wanted to hide the navigation,

69
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.002
So for example, if I wanted to hide the navigation,

70
00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:25.020
I can click on this little compass here,

71
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.003
I can click on this little compass here,

72
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:28.030
and now we have a wider editor.

73
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.003
and now we have a wider editor.

74
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:31.030
So this is how I'm going to leave the editor set up

75
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.000
So this is how I'm going to leave the editor set up

76
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.000
throughout the course, so you have a better view

77
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.008
throughout the course, so you have a better view

78
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:37.080
of the work we're doing.

79
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.006
of the work we're doing.

80
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:39.060
At this point, we've configured our Swagger editor

81
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.005
At this point, we've configured our Swagger editor

82
00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:43.050
within SwaggerHub platform, and we're ready

83
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.002
within SwaggerHub platform, and we're ready

84
00:03:46.002 --> 00:03:46.020
to get started building out our APIs.

85
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.000
to get started building out our APIs.
