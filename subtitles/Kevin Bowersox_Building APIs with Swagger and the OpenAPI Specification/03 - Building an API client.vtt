00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.090
- [Male Instructor] In this lesson, we'll build

2
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.080
a small Angular application that uses

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
the client SDK that we generated from SwaggerHub.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.020
If you would like to follow along, you must have

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.020
Node.js, Angular and Visual Studio Code installed

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.080
on your workstation.

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.050
To get started, I'm going to navigate to the course

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
workspace where I've positioned several zip files.

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.090
The first zip file is the hsports client app zip file.

10
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.030
It contains a small Angular application that's provided

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.070
within the exercise files for this lesson.

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.010
Let's go ahead and extract this Angular app into

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
the root of our course workspace.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.080
Once that's extracted, we're going to extract

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.000
the hsports catalog client zip file.

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.050
If you remember, this is the client SDK that we generated

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.030
from SwaggerHub in the last lesson.

18
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.060
Just go ahead and extract this right into

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.000
our course workspace directory and then what we need to do

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.060
is navigate into the hsports catalog client directory.

21
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.040
This directory contains all of the code

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.000
for our client SDK.

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.080
We're going to copy that code and then we're going to navigate

24
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.030
over to the hsports client app,

25
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.030
this is the Angular application,

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.060
and within the source app res directory we're going

27
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.070
to pace the client SDK.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.020
Okay, at this point we can navigate

29
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.060
to Visual Studio Code and we're going

30
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.000
to open that folder.

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.090
So click on open folder, navigate to the course workspace

32
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.000
directory, and then open the hsports client app directory.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.030
At this point the hsports client app is loaded

34
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.040
within Visual Studio Code and we can go ahead

35
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.010
and open a new terminal.

36
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.050
Within the terminal, I'm just going to clear it

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.020
in order to save some space.

38
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.030
Now we can use the Node package manager to install

39
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.040
the packages within our Angular application.

40
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.020
To do this, we issue the NPM install command.

41
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.090
Okay, it looks like all of our NPM packages have loaded,

42
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.000
let's clear the console and now

43
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.060
we can serve our application.

44
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.070
It looks like the app's up and running, so let's navigate

45
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.040
to a browser where we can access the application

46
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.050
on our local host at port 4200.

47
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.050
Here we see the basic Angular app in action.

48
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.010
It was able to send an API call back to the virtual server

49
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.070
running on SwaggerHub and here we see the results.

50
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.010
The one thing you'll notice, we're unable to load

51
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.070
an image from the virtual server.

52
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.050
That's because it doesn't have the image files

53
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.000
for the API, we'll get to that later.
