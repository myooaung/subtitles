00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Kevin] Today's most successful digital platforms

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.000
are architected with APIs

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.080
that expose core business capabilities

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.000
for internal and external developers

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.020
that build new applications at scale.

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.060
Well-crafted APIs are more widely adopted

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.050
by the developer community,

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.070
giving their creators a competitive advantage

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.050
in terms of innovation and new products.

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.080
The key to developing successful APIs is using tools

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040
like Swagger to create better designs

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.070
and documentation so that it is effortless

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.080
for developers to use the API.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.040
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.010
I've been a full stack developer

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.050
for over 10 years,

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.010
and I have seen how Swagger can build higher-quality APIs

18
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.020
that gain adoption.

19
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.000
Swagger helps you design, build,

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.060
and document your APIs using a design-first approach

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.050
so that web, mobile,

22
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.030
and third-party applications can quickly integrate

23
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.000
and consume their core capabilities and data.

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.080
In this course, I'll show you how to build API definitions

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.050
with the OpenAPI Specification

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.050
that accelerate delivery of APIs

27
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.050
through generated documentation, client SDKs,

28
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.000
server stubs, and API server virtualization.

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.070
We'll use Swagger's open source tools

30
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.030
to master key sections of the OpenAPI Specification.

31
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.010
Then we will advance to SwaggerHub

32
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.000
and learn how its team collaboration tools streamline

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.050
the API development lifecycle.

34
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.000
To cap off the course,

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.020
we'll complete a project that uses an API definition file

36
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.000
to rapidly establish an API-based solution

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090
that spans multiple languages, frameworks,

38
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.010
and cloud-based services.

39
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.070
So if you are ready to build better APIs

40
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.000
with higher adoption, then let's get started.
