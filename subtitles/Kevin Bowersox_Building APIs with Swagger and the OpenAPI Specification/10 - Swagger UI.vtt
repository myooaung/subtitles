00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.010
- [Instructor] Once we've built an API definition file,

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.080
we can automatically generate interactive documentation

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.070
from the file using Swagger UI.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.080
To get started, we just need to save our API definition

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.050
from Swagger Editor.

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.070
To do this, we click on the file option within the menu

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.000
and then click on Save as YAML.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.060
This is going to open a dialog where we can then save

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.090
our API definition file.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080
In this case, we're going to save the file

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.010
within our course workspace directory on the desktop.

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.090
I'm going to go ahead and name the file hsports-api.yaml.

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.080
Once the file has downloaded, we can navigate

14
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.010
to the directory containing the file

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.080
and we're going to copy our API definition.

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.090
From there, we're going to navigate

17
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090
into the swagger-ui directory,

18
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.000
where we find the Swagger installation.

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.010
In this directory, you'll see the dist directory.

20
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.050
Let's navigate into that directory

21
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.060
and then paste our API definition file.

22
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.080
Now if we hop up a directory,

23
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.040
we can copy dist and then we can paste dist

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.050
within the course workspace directory.

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.050
At this point, I'm going to go ahead and change the name

26
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.070
of that directory to api-docs.

27
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.050
Then there's one final change that we need to make

28
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.020
Inside the API docs directory,

29
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.040
you'll see the index.html file.

30
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.010
Within this file, if we open it in a text editor,

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.000
you're going to see that it points to an API definition.

32
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.030
So here we see that it's pointing

33
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.000
to the pet store API definition

34
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.060
that's hosted on Swagger's website.

35
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.000
We simply need to change this line

36
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to point at our own API definition file

37
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that sits within our API docs directory.

38
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.060
So just go ahead and change that to hsports-api.yaml

39
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.070
and then save the file and we can close it.

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.010
At this point, we just need to start our http server

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.020
to serve our API docs directory.

42
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.090
So I'm going to open this command line,

43
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.080
and within the command line

44
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.010
I can use the http-server command,

45
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.030
and then I point to the API docs directory to serve it,

46
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.090
and then I'll provide our local IP followed by the port.

47
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.030
In this case, it'll be 8081.

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.070
And if we issue that command, we see the http server

49
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.070
start up Swagger UI, and now we can navigate

50
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.040
to a browser and access our Swagger UI installation

51
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.040
on port 8081 on the local host.

52
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.020
And there we see our first API definition file

53
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.080
hosted within Swagger UI.

54
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.070
You'll notice that we get the interactive documentation

55
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.040
provided by Swagger UI

56
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.060
and we're able to see these descriptions

57
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.050
of our rest API operations,

58
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.080
and this is extremely valuable for any API client

59
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.000
looking to use our API implementation.
