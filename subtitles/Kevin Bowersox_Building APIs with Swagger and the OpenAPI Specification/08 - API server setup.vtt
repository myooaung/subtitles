00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.080
- [Instructor] Once we've provisioned a new VM

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.010
we'll need to stand up our API implementation.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.040
To do that, we'll need to run the jar file

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.000
on the server using Java and set up DNS resolution.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.060
So the first thing we'll do is FTP

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.080
the jar file over to our new VM.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.070
So if we navigate into the VM that we provisioned,

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.030
you can find the IP address for the server.

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:38.060
Go ahead and copy that and use that IP

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.070
You'll notice on the left hand side,

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:50.030
I am logged in on the local workstation

12
00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.000
then our hsports-catalog-server project

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:11.050
packaged in a jar file.

14
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.070
Within Azure, we can scroll down

15
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.090
on the sidebar of the VM console

16
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.070
and you'll see that we can open

17
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:28.080
up a shell using the serial console.

18
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
to make a little bit easier for you to see.

19
00:01:33.060 --> 00:02:05.080
Okay, it's going to prompt us to login,

20
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.080
named api in the root of the server

21
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.030
and then we're going to navigate into that directory

22
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.080
and at this point, we can copy

23
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.005
the jar file

24
00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:21.050
from the temp directory into our api directory.

25
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.007
from the temp directory into our api directory.

26
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.001
Now we need to make sure

27
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.005
that Java's installed on the server.

28
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.007
So to do that, you can use apt.

29
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:37.005
Just apt install default dash jre

30
00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:39.009
and this will make sure we have Java.

31
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.003
Looks like it's already installed

32
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.002
on this machine so go ahead and clear

33
00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:48.007
and then what we're going to do is use the nohup command

34
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:54.000
and we can use that to execute Java's jar command

35
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.004
and then we can provide some arguments

36
00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.009
to the JVM when it starts.

37
00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.007
So we do that with a dash D flag

38
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:02.070
and we're just going to say that we want

39
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.008
and we're just going to say that we want

40
00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:04.080
the server to run on port 80,

41
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.009
the server to run on port 80,

42
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:11.007
using Dserver dot port argument.

43
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:15.006
Okay, so we set that to 80 and then we point

44
00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.000
to our jar file that we'd like to run

45
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.005
and then just add the ampersand after that.

46
00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:23.002
Go ahead and hit enter.

47
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:27.009
That's going to fire up our API implementation.

48
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.090
Now, in order to see this in action,

49
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.005
Now, in order to see this in action,

50
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:30.050
we can go to the Overview tab, copy the IP address

51
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.007
we can go to the Overview tab, copy the IP address

52
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.006
and then within a browser, you can see

53
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:38.060
that I'm sitting on the local

54
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.004
that I'm sitting on the local

55
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:41.040
instance of our API implementation

56
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.001
instance of our API implementation

57
00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:44.010
and you can see that because we're on localhost port 8080.

58
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.006
and you can see that because we're on localhost port 8080.

59
00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:48.060
So if we just replace localhost port 8080

60
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.002
So if we just replace localhost port 8080

61
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:53.020
with the IP of our new server,

62
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.007
with the IP of our new server,

63
00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:56.070
you'll see that we can actually hit our API endpoints.

64
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.003
you'll see that we can actually hit our API endpoints.

65
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:02.030
So that's great but we don't really

66
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.001
So that's great but we don't really

67
00:04:05.001 --> 00:04:07.001
want to have to use the IP address

68
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:11.002
so let's set up DNS using Azure.

69
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:16.009
So to do that, you can access the DNS name configuration

70
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.090
on the overview for the VM,

71
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.002
on the overview for the VM,

72
00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:21.000
you'll see this configure hyperlink,

73
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.008
click on it and then you just need to provide a DNS label.

74
00:04:25.008 --> 00:04:30.000
So let's set up our DNS as hplus

75
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.009
and then you'll notice we get

76
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:31.090
the region added for Azure here.

77
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.009
the region added for Azure here.

78
00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:34.090
So with that in place, we'll just go ahead and hit save

79
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.008
So with that in place, we'll just go ahead and hit save

80
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:42.001
and that's going to start building

81
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:45.004
out our DNS resolution for the server.

82
00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:49.007
We can navigate back and in a second here,

83
00:04:49.007 --> 00:04:56.001
we will see that our DNS should take place,

84
00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:00.006
there it is, so let's copy that domain name,

85
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:03.008
go back to the browser and we're going

86
00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:08.007
to replace the server's IP with the domain name.

87
00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:11.008
And there you go, we have DNS setup

88
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:16.000
for our API implementation running on Azure.
