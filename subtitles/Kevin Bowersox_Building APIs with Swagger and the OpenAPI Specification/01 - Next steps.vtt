- [Kevin] Before we wrap up the course,

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.050
let's take a moment to reflect on the power of Swagger

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.090
and the OpenAPI Specification.

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.010
The OAS API definition file that we built with Swagger

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.040
delivered a lot of benefits for us.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.010
Using the definition file we created several components

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.010
that built out our API-driven solution.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.000
This included documentation, a client SDK,

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.030
a server-side stub, a mock API server,

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.010
and it supported integration

11
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.020
with a cloud-based API management platform.

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.080
With these new API-related skills in your toolbox,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.050
you will be able to build API-driven solutions

14
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.030
using a design-first approach powered by Swagger.

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.000
I hope this course allows you to build something amazing,

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.090
and would love to hear about your work,

17
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.030
so stay in touch with me.

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020
You can find my blog at tothought.com,

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.080
and I go by the handle of kevin-bowersox on Stack Overflow,

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.060
where I can help with any challenges you may face.

21
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.090
If you like this course,

22
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.010
and are looking for other skills to learn,

23
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.020
I would recommend browsing the LinkedIn library

24
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.010
for my other course, Git for Teams.

25
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.020
Congratulations on finishing the course,

26
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.090
and thank you for taking it.

27
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.000
Now it's time to go build better APIs with Swagger.
