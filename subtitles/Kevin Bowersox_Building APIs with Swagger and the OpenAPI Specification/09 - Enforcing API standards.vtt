1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.020
we can encourage the adoption of best practices

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.030
for an organization's API definitions

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.020
by establishing standards at the organization level.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.020
To do this, we just click on the organization name

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:27.080
and then we navigate up to this gear

6
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.010
about the organization.

7
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.080
and then what we're interested in

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:46.010
is the Standardizations tab.

9
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.010
organization's API definitions.

10
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.006
that certain properties within the info object be required

11
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:57.060
for our API definitions.

12
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.008
for our API definitions.

13
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:03.005
We're also able to require that certain information

14
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:03.050
be provided for our operations,

15
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.008
be provided for our operations,

16
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.005
and then we can set standards for models as well.

17
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:09.050
For our purposes, we're just going to apply one standard,

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.002
For our purposes, we're just going to apply one standard,

19
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:18.005
and that's that operations must have one and only one tag.

20
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:21.004
So let's go ahead, and check the checkbox

21
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:24.007
next to the standard, and then hit Save.

22
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.007
At this point, we can navigate back to MY hub,

23
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.008
and you can see that our catalog API definition

24
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.002
does not conform to this standard.

25
00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:34.020
Let's go ahead and correct this.

26
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.006
Let's go ahead and correct this.

27
00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:42.002
It appears that the order path and its post operation

28
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:46.003
are in violation of the standard, so let's fix that.

29
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:50.000
The first thing we'll do is create a new tag

30
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.006
that is named order, and we'll provide a description,

31
00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:53.060
we'll say, "This is an order related operation."

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.004
we'll say, "This is an order related operation."

33
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:05.005
And then we can navigate within the post object

34
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.008
and add a tags property.

35
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:14.002
Inside of the tags property, we can specify an array of tags

36
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.003
that apply to this operation.

37
00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:16.030
In this case, we want to specify our order tag.

38
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.003
In this case, we want to specify our order tag.

39
00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.005
So with that in place,

40
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:22.050
we can go ahead and save the API definition.

41
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.002
we can go ahead and save the API definition.

42
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.008
You'll notice that the error disappears

43
00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:33.006
because we now conform to the organization's standards.

44
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:33.060
And if we return to the MY hub view,

45
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.005
And if we return to the MY hub view,

46
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.006
we no longer have the warning

47
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.009
regarding our API's noncompliance.

48
00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:47.008
So using the standards within SwaggerHub,

49
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.001
you're able to enforce quality

50
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:56.000
within your organization's catalog of APIs.
