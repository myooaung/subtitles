00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] I'm excited to bring you this update,

2
00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.005
which adds three challenges

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.007
and their solutions to the course.

4
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.005
Over the course of these challenges,

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.005
you'll build an API definition that describes operations

6
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.005
on the H Plus Sports company blog

7
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.002
using the OpenAPI specification.

8
00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:22.005
The exercise files for each challenge

9
00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.004
will build upon the work completed

10
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.001
in the previous challenge.

11
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.002
However, the exercise files will be separate

12
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.001
from those in other lessons.

13
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.004
In the first challenge,

14
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.004
you'll create an API definition from scratch

15
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.007
that retrieves blog posts from the API.

16
00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.009
In the next challenge, you'll define another operation

17
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.008
that allows blog posts to be created on the API.

18
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:49.004
Finally, we'll see how to publish the API on SwaggerHub

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:53.007
and apply security to sensitive operations that it exposes.

20
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:56.009
Hands on experience is one of the best ways to learn,

21
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.004
so I'm thrilled to bring you these challenges

22
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.002
so you can hone your skills

23
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.000
with Swagger and the OpenAPI specification.
