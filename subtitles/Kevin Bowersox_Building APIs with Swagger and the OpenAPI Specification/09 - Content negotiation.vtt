00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.040
- [Instructor] In this lesson,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.030
we'll learn how to use content negotiation

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.090
to define different response formats for API operations.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.010
Currently, we've defined all of our API responses

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.070
in a JSON format.

6
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.090
Sometimes you'll need to use other formats like xml.

7
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.060
With the introduction of content negotiation

8
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.040
in OAS 3.0, we have the ability to accept or provide

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.020
multiple media types for our API operations.

10
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.030
Let's leverage this new feature

11
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.040
by providing an xml response from our product endpoint

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.040
that uses a template parameter.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.000
You'll see how extremely simple this is

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.010
once we work through our example.

15
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.020
You'll notice that we have our product endpoint

16
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.010
using the template parameter,

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.050
and within this operation,

18
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.040
we have defined our JSON response.

19
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.060
All we need to do is specify a second media type,

20
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.020
right in line with the first,

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.020
and in this case, it's going to be application/xml.

22
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.000
And then we just specify the schema object

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and we point to our reusable product component.

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.020
And at this point if we take a look at

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.010
our API documentation, here we see

26
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.030
the product/template parameter product ID endpoint,

27
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.070
and within this Get operation, we can inspect the responses.

28
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.070
You'll notice there's dropdown

29
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.010
and the first option in the dropdown

30
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.000
is the JSON media type but we can now switch

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.050
to the xml media type and we're able to see

32
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.060
a response in xml format.

33
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.080
So the addition of content negotiation

34
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.070
allows us to easily describe other response formats

35
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.010
within our API documentation.

36
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.060
This can be very handy when dealing with legacy services

37
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.040
that may provide xml responses.

38
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.050
Now we're not going to be using xml

39
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.020
throughout the remainder of the course.

40
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.080
So I am going to go ahead

41
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.080
and remove this definition before proceeding.

42
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080
But if your API requires it,

43
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.000
you now know how to use xml

44
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
through the content negotiation feature.
