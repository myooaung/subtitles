00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.004
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.007
- [Instructor] It's time for another challenge.

3
00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.008
Let's pick up where we left off in the last challenge

4
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:16.003
and add some new capabilities to the blog API definition.

5
00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:19.006
The new capability will expose an operation

6
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:24.003
on the article path that allows a new article to be created.

7
00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.008
To complete the challenge,

8
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.002
expand the API definition file

9
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.006
to include the appropriate HTTP operation

10
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.003
for the capability.

11
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.001
Within the operation,

12
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.004
you should define a JSON-based request body

13
00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.009
that is used to create the article.

14
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.008
Additionally, the operation should return a simple response

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.005
that contains the appropriate HTTP status code

16
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.002
for creating a resource on a REST API.

17
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.006
If you want to make this challenge a little easier,

18
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.001
think about how you could reuse some of the existing YAML

19
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.008
in your API definition.

20
00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:05.004
This challenge should take you about 10 minutes to complete.

21
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.006
In the next video, I'll show you how I solved it.

22
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.000
Good luck.
