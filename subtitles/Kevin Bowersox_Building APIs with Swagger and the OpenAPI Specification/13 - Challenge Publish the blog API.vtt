00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.004
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.008
- [Instructor] It's time for the last challenge.

3
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.000
In this challenge,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.009
you will get some practice working in SwaggerHub

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.002
and defining secure API operations.

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.006
To complete the challenge,

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.007
you'll need to import the blog API definition

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.002
into SwaggerHub and publish it.

9
00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:27.002
Next, create a new version of the API definition

10
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.006
that secures the POST operation

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.001
that allows new articles to be created.

12
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.008
Since this capability allows articles

13
00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.005
to be created and published,

14
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.005
it should be protected.

15
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.001
When defining the security,

16
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.003
use an API key-based security scheme.

17
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:47.002
Once the new version has the security scheme applied,

18
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.009
publish the new definition.

19
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:54.006
This challenge should take you about 10 minutes to complete.

20
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.003
In the next video, you will see my solution.

21
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:58.000
Good luck.
