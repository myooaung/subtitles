00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:06.004
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.002
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at one way

3
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.004
to complete the last challenge.

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:15.002
To get started, I'm going to import the blog API definition

5
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.007
into SwaggerHub.

6
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.000
To do that, I just click on Create New,

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.008
and then I can go to Import and Document API.

8
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:26.009
Within the Import API dialogue, we can click on Browse.

9
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.002
And from here, we can navigate into the Exercise Files

10
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.005
to find our API definition.

11
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:39.005
You'll notice the 03_14_begin file

12
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.009
within the exercise files.

13
00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.005
If we click on that,

14
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.008
we can then leave all of the defaults in place on the dialog

15
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.004
and click on Upload File.

16
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.007
The next dialog is going to ask us

17
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.007
to provide a name for this API.

18
00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:03.007
I'm going to name this API h-plus-blog-api.

19
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.000
With that name in place,

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'll go ahead and click on the Import OpenAPI definition,

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.004
and that's going to upload our YAML file into SwaggerHub.

22
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.009
Once the API definition file has been imported,

23
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.009
I'm just going to go ahead and resize a few of these windows

24
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.007
so that I can see the YAML better.

25
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.008
Okay, now let's go ahead

26
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:30.002
and publish the first version of this API definition.

27
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.005
You'll notice this dropdown at the top

28
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:36.005
that has the version of our API definition.

29
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:37.009
If we click on that,

30
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.002
there is an option to publish the API.

31
00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:42.008
Let's click on that option,

32
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.005
and it's going to ask us if we would like this API

33
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.000
to be published privately or publicly.

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.007
I'm just going to leave it as private,

35
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:51.007
and then click on Publish Version.

36
00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:55.002
Okay, now that we have published the API,

37
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.009
let's go ahead and make some changes to it

38
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.002
by adding a security scheme.

39
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.000
In order to make any changes,

40
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.008
we'll need to create a new version,

41
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:07.006
since this API definition has been published.

42
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:11.000
To do that, once again, we click on the dropdown

43
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
associated with the current version,

44
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.009
and then we click on Add New version.

45
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:20.007
Here, I'm just going to make the new version 1.1.0.

46
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.007
Once I have that version in place,

47
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.001
I can click on Create New Version.

48
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.006
And now we're able to make changes to our API definition.

49
00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:31.001
The changes we're going to make

50
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.009
are going to secure the post operation

51
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.002
on the article endpoint.

52
00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.004
In order to do that,

53
00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:41.007
we'll need to build a new security scheme

54
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.000
into the API definition.

55
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.008
We do that within the Component section

56
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.000
of the API definition file.

57
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.007
So underneath the securitySchemes field that we've added,

58
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:58.009
we just specify the name of our new security scheme,

59
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.007
and then nested within that, we can specify its type,

60
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:05.008
which in this case is going to be apiKey.

61
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:08.001
And you want to make sure that you've capitalized it,

62
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.004
as I've specified.

63
00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:14.005
Then we'll provide a name of api-key.

64
00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:18.005
And then finally, we're going to specify the in field,

65
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.006
and this is going to say where we expect

66
00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:26.004
to find the API key in this security scheme.

67
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:29.008
Okay, so the security scheme is defined.

68
00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:34.001
Now let's go ahead and add it to our post operation.

69
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.004
So underneath the post operation,

70
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:40.004
I'm just going to add the security field

71
00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:42.004
and here, I can go ahead

72
00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:47.009
and reference our new apiKey security scheme.

73
00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.004
Having made these changes,

74
00:03:49.004 --> 00:03:53.002
let's go ahead and save our API definition.

75
00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:54.006
And once it's saved,

76
00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:58.007
we can then publish the new version of the API

77
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.000
by clicking on the Publish button

78
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.007
and then within the dialog, clicking Publish Version.

79
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:08.006
Okay, if we'd like to take a look at these changes,

80
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:12.002
we can click on the View Documentation button

81
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.001
in the upper right hand corner.

82
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:19.002
So you'll notice that our post operation

83
00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:23.002
on the article endpoint is now secure,

84
00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:26.009
and that's indicated by this lock on the right hand side.

85
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.007
If we click on it, it will give us some information

86
00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:33.000
about the security scheme and what is expected

87
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.009
in order to use this endpoint on the API.

88
00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.007
Okay, with the API definition secured,

89
00:04:39.007 --> 00:04:42.002
we've completed our work for this challenge.

90
00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:43.000
Great work!
