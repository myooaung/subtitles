00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.004
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.004
- [Instructor] It's time for the first challenge

3
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.003
where you will build a definition file

4
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:16.005
for the API that powers the H Plus Sport Company's blog.

5
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.000
To complete the challenge,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.002
you must create a new API definition file

7
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.005
that exposes a single path used to access

8
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.004
an array of articles.

9
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.001
The array returned by the end point is used to populate

10
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:35.002
the list of articles found on the front page of the blog.

11
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.000
Before you dive in, let me give you a hint.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.003
Start out by inspecting the H Plus Sport blog

13
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.004
to determine the properties required

14
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.008
for an article schema object.

15
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.002
At a quick glance,

16
00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.007
I would recommend adding properties for the created date,

17
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:57.004
tagline, content, category, and tags.

18
00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.008
This challenge should take you about 10 minutes to complete.

19
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.003
In the next video, I'll show you how I solved the challenge.

20
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:05.000
Good luck.
