00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.070
- [Instructor] If we take a look at the code for the app,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.080
we can see how our client SDK called back to the API.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.070
So the first thing we'll take a look at,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.080
is the app.component.ts file.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.040
This is the typescript file

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.060
that's associated with our app component.

7
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.030
You'll notice that it uses a productService.

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.010
This productService is provided from the client SDK

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.020
that we generated with Swagger Hub.

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.060
We can navigate into the rest directory,

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.070
and then into the API directory

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.040
in order to see the product service.

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.010
I'm going to go ahead and hide our sidebar

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.000
in order to get a better view of this code.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.030
Okay, if we scroll down into this file,

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
you'll notice that the product service

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.020
has a URL to the Swagger Hub virtual server

18
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.070
where it's making the API calls.

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.010
All of the code in order to perform the calls to our API

20
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.070
is contained within this service.

21
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.020
So here we see our operations

22
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.020
and the corresponding typescript that we need

23
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
to make the calls from the client SDK.

24
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.000
All of this code was generated for us by Swagger Hub.
