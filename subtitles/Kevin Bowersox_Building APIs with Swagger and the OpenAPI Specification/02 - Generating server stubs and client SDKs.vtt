00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] To kick off our course project,

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.060
we're going to generate a server stub

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.040
and client SDK

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.020
for our H Sports catalog API.

5
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.000
To do that,

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.040
we just navigate to the API definition within SwaggerHub,

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.030
and then using the Export option,

8
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.080
we're able to export a client SDK,

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.010
as well as a server stub

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.030
in various languages and frameworks.

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.030
Let's first build out our server stub.

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.060
We're going to be using the spring framework,

13
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.050
so we just click on spring,

14
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.010
and then SwaggerHub's going to prompt us

15
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.070
for where to save the generated code.

16
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.080
We're going to put this code within

17
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.030
the course_workspace folder of our desktop.

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.090
Let's go ahead and name this downloaded artifact

19
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.040
the hsports-catalog-server file,

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.030
and we'll go ahead and download that.

21
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.070
Now we can build out our client SDK.

22
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.050
For our client SDK

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.040
we're going to be using TypeScript and Angular,

24
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.070
so go ahead and select that option.

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.040
We're going to be prompted for another download.

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.030
This time,

27
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.030
we're going to go ahead and name this downloaded artifact

28
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.050
hsports-catalog-client.

29
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.070
With the code generated

30
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.020
for our server stub and our client SDK,

31
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.030
we're able to continue with our project.

32
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.030
You'll notice how much time we saved

33
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.060
by not having to code the actual server stub

34
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.050
or client SDK.

35
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.010
This increases our time to delivery

36
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.000
thanks to SwaggerHub's Codegen feature.
