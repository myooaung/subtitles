OK so in this video we're going to look at how we can change columns data type so you can see here.

00:11.370 --> 00:15.720
I've already written out DSU over how we can change columns data type.

00:16.080 --> 00:23.640
So we need to type out a table followed by the table name followed by the word modify and then the column

00:23.640 --> 00:29.940
names the name of the column which we want to modify followed by that data type which we want to change

00:29.940 --> 00:31.410
that column to.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.980
So let's look at a few examples of changing columns data type.

00:36.360 --> 00:43.740
So you can see here I run describe addresses and then down here I have the results so you can see the

00:43.740 --> 00:48.340
four columns in the addresses table Id house number City and postcode.

00:48.360 --> 00:55.520
And you can see that data type here so is in Vauxhall and Vachel.

00:55.550 --> 01:04.400
So let's say we wanted to change the city's data type from Vallejo 20 to 40 or 30 say someone's from

01:04.400 --> 01:08.600
a city with a really long name long within 20 letters.

01:08.750 --> 01:13.740
So we need to change the data type to 40 or 30 to do that.

01:13.760 --> 01:23.150
We can come in here and we can type out a table followed by the table name so address is followed by

01:23.330 --> 01:33.590
modify followed by the column name so City followed by the new data type which is vulture phatty and

01:33.590 --> 01:35.300
then end with a semi-colon.

01:35.300 --> 01:45.140
And we can run the query and you can see off we run describe addresses again that are new data type

01:45.140 --> 01:48.730
for this city column is full of 30.

01:48.760 --> 01:55.750
Now that's changed the city column from one Vaugirard data type to another Vaugirard data type but we

01:55.750 --> 01:58.540
can actually change it to any data type we like.

01:58.750 --> 02:09.170
We can come in here and we can change it to chart data type of length 25 and run this statement again.

02:10.020 --> 02:17.230
And then when we describe addresses again you can see that now our city column is a data type job.

02:17.250 --> 02:25.630
So a completely different data type to Vauxhall and we were able to do this using this command table

02:26.140 --> 02:34.590
addresses modify city chala 25 and we can even change the city column to an in state type.

02:34.780 --> 02:44.500
So we can go from a string data type to a number data type by just typing city in and then running that

02:44.500 --> 02:51.280
query and if we run describe addresses again you can see that now the city called in is of data type

02:51.440 --> 02:55.120
IMs but that doesn't really make sense.

02:55.120 --> 03:02.220
So let's change it back to what it originally was Baulch all 20 run query.

03:02.260 --> 03:07.880
And describe addresses.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.220
And now you can see it's back to March or 20.

03:11.250 --> 03:15.080
So this is how we change McCollum's data type in my school.

03:15.300 --> 03:22.080
We use alter table followed by the table name will apply modify a name column name and then the new

03:22.080 --> 03:23.740
data type.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.610
But you do have to be careful when changing a column's data type.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.330
We were able to change columns data type to anything we liked.

03:31.330 --> 03:38.040
In this example because the addresses table has no rows of data in it it's an empty table.

03:38.360 --> 03:44.040
But let's say we already had some data entered into our addresses table let's say in the city column

03:44.050 --> 03:49.550
we already had some data entered like London Manchester or Liverpool.

03:49.630 --> 03:56.920
Then if we try to modify the city's data type from Vaugirard 20 to INS It wouldn't allow us to do this

03:57.250 --> 04:02.380
because the data that's already been entered is not compatible with the data type.

04:02.380 --> 04:06.680
London is not an end so we can't change the city data type to an end.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.610
Simply we wouldn't be able to change it to a char because London Manchester Liverpool have different

04:12.640 --> 04:21.230
lengths so we could have no Chaar with that fixed length to satisfy London Manchester and Liverpool.

04:21.610 --> 04:29.560
But we were able to change the data type from Vallejo 20 to 40 or 30 because London Manchester and Liverpool

04:30.150 --> 04:36.690
are all compatible with Lavarch of 20 and Lavarch or 30 data type.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.550
So something to bear in mind when you're thinking about modifying a column's data type.
