00:05.480 --> 00:08.080
So now let's look at the one to many relationship.

00:08.240 --> 00:14.140
And this is probably the most common relationship you'll see between two tables in the database.

00:14.240 --> 00:16.440
So what is a one to many relationship.

00:16.660 --> 00:23.090
Well a one to many relationship is where our primary care of one table can be in multiple rows of data

00:23.480 --> 00:26.500
as a foreign key in another table.

00:26.510 --> 00:29.030
So let's take a look at an example here.

00:29.030 --> 00:36.290
So from our coffee store database we had our customers table on an Orders table and obviously a customer

00:36.740 --> 00:44.510
can place many orders over many days as they like so they can come into the store multiple days order

00:44.510 --> 00:46.070
multiple orders.

00:46.120 --> 00:50.860
But one particular order can only relate to one customer.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.510
So this is known as one to many relationship.

00:54.830 --> 01:03.130
So the customer can place many orders by a particular order can only be related to one customer.

01:03.410 --> 01:09.950
So the customers and orders table share are one to many relationship and you can see that represented

01:09.950 --> 01:12.470
in the diagram between the two tables.

01:12.500 --> 01:23.280
So saying one customer can place many orders by a particular order ID can only be associated to one

01:23.280 --> 01:24.240
customer.

01:24.600 --> 01:32.070
So if you like the ID field in the Customers table would show up many times in the Orders table was

01:32.070 --> 01:40.530
a customer id foreign key but the primary key in the Orders table will only relate to one customer.

01:40.530 --> 01:47.580
And we know this because each new row in the Orders table will have a unique order ID.

01:47.580 --> 01:52.800
So this is what we mean by one to many relationships and databases and it's the most common type of

01:52.800 --> 01:54.940
relationship between tables.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.000
But you will come across.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.300
So now let's move on to the many to many relationship.
