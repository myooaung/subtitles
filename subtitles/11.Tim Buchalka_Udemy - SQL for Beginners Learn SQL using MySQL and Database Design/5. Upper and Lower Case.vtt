00:05.130 --> 00:11.620
A case in this video we're going to be looking at the upper and lower string function and what the upper

00:11.620 --> 00:13.400
and lower string functions do.

00:13.600 --> 00:20.340
You state in your column data either into all uppercase or all lowercase.

00:20.350 --> 00:29.080
So the upper function tends to call them deep data into uppercase and the lower function turns your

00:29.080 --> 00:33.500
data or returns your data in lowercase.

00:33.790 --> 00:39.460
And if we look at the example Escudo queries here you can see that to apply the upper and lower the

00:39.460 --> 00:40.870
string function.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.300
We need to be selecting data from a table.

00:43.300 --> 00:51.340
So we type select and then we type either upper or lower open a pair of brackets have a column within

00:51.340 --> 00:52.720
the brackets.

00:52.840 --> 01:00.160
So this will apply the upper function to column 1 and this would apply the lower function to Column

01:00.160 --> 01:00.800
1.

01:01.150 --> 01:03.740
We set our column name alias here.

01:04.450 --> 01:06.470
And then we're selecting from a table.

01:06.790 --> 01:11.800
So select upper column on as new column name from a table.

01:12.450 --> 01:17.630
So now let's look at an example from our cinema booking system.

01:18.010 --> 01:21.730
So let's select data from the Reames table.

01:21.740 --> 01:33.250
Let's select name from rooms and we can see this if we just do it without the upper and lower first

01:34.120 --> 01:39.910
you can see that we have all rooms so we have our free rooms Chamblin Kubrick and Capella.

01:40.330 --> 01:46.050
Now let's apply the upper string function to the name column.

01:46.060 --> 01:58.230
So let's type selects upper name from rooms and let's compare the results.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.180
Let's compare the output.

02:01.150 --> 02:04.700
So you see now that the three names are all in capitals.

02:04.810 --> 02:10.390
So we have chapping Kubrick Cappello like befool But now every single character in the string is an

02:10.390 --> 02:11.910
upper case character.

02:12.700 --> 02:18.790
And you can see here that I forgot to apply the column name alias so said she would turn the column

02:18.790 --> 02:23.620
name as upper and bracket name close bracket.

02:23.860 --> 02:32.920
So let's just apply a alias so we can actually say name so we can give it the same name as the original

02:32.920 --> 02:36.630
column had.

02:37.410 --> 02:43.880
And you can see now we have the column name and all three rooms all in uppercase.

02:43.900 --> 02:49.960
So now let's look at an example of lowa the lever function.

02:49.960 --> 03:02.290
So let selects low name as name from Reems.

03:02.290 --> 03:08.480
So it's the same select query but instead of applying the upper function we're applying the lower function.

03:08.530 --> 03:15.460
So let's run that and you can see now that we have the name column and it's return the results all in

03:15.460 --> 03:16.240
lower.

03:16.270 --> 03:20.830
So lower case first letter and every other letter is lower case as well.

03:21.550 --> 03:29.020
And if we go back to our original query you can see that the first letter was actually uppercase.

03:29.030 --> 03:34.000
I always turn this to a lower case and that's it for the upper and lower function.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.010
There are fairly simple functions.

03:36.310 --> 03:43.510
The upper function just changes your column data into uppercase and the lower function changes your

03:43.510 --> 03:45.250
colon data into lowercase.
