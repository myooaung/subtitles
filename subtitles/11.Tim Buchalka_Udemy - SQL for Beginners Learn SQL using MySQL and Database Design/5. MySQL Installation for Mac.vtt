WEBVTT

00:05.260 --> 00:10.130
Get this video I can go ahead and start a sequel database server for a Mac.

00:10.520 --> 00:14.180
Now if you're running Windows refer to the previous video with this course.

00:14.330 --> 00:16.470
We're actually at I would have to do this on Windows.

00:16.550 --> 00:21.630
And if you're running Linux refer to the next video work through that form and then expect form.

00:21.670 --> 00:24.750
And that's because the steps are different depending on your platform.

00:25.070 --> 00:30.220
All right so we're going to start out by going to stick with dot com

00:34.130 --> 00:39.030
once we get them going to click on My sequel downloads.

00:39.150 --> 00:43.220
They're going to click on this my Sakal community service G.P.O. up here.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.840
The Texas to the download must include community service page.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.340
And if you scroll down and have a look you should find that if you're on a Mac the platform is selected

00:53.400 --> 00:57.240
for you automatically if not just selected from the list of options there.

00:57.550 --> 01:01.710
And then we want to come over here and we're going to choose the biggest download this mac our 6 ten

01:01.710 --> 01:09.780
point twelve deemed geog are we going to use that to install more siecle on a Mac screen that pops up

01:09.780 --> 01:14.880
after doing that and in case you're wondering Oracle actually owned Marsico now which is the reason

01:14.880 --> 01:17.730
that they want you to create an oracle web account.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.200
However that is optional.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.600
So just click on things to start my download.

01:21.600 --> 01:30.750
We don't need to create the account to get the software I going to that am going to post the video on

01:30.740 --> 01:35.480
that stand lighting will come back once its finished enlighting to go through the installation process.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.580
Case I can see the installation now completed some kind of opened the file that was delighted which

01:43.580 --> 01:53.640
is a dmg file which can be used to install double click on the package that'll start the package installer.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.830
We're just going to go through the install the like we would any other software continue continue to

01:58.830 --> 02:08.570
accept the license agreement and agree Constellation into your normal use and I'm Passement I should

02:08.570 --> 02:14.960
say for the user account and then we'll go ahead and actually install my Seacole on this computer.

02:18.350 --> 02:23.480
Right now this will Pop-Pop with his passport as he can see here and we're going to need that in a minute

02:23.510 --> 02:25.360
because we're going to actually change the password.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.850
So take a copy of this password.

02:28.250 --> 02:33.280
It's a tempy one that I have created because it's a bit of an ordeal to actually reset the password

02:33.650 --> 02:37.340
so we don't want to do that without having the password we want to go through and just change it which

02:37.340 --> 02:44.240
will do it temporarily So take a copy of that as I've done click on OK click on close that I can close

02:44.240 --> 02:47.840
down the installer because I've actually completed the installation.

02:47.840 --> 02:53.980
So once you've done that next step is to go into your system preferences and down the bottom you should

02:53.980 --> 02:55.250
have a more Seacole option.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.130
And Dan Heath.

02:56.150 --> 03:01.560
I click on that and this is where you'll start and stop the more Serba.

03:01.660 --> 03:06.670
So I'm going to click on Start Mussey whosever into my password again.

03:07.660 --> 03:14.340
This is the password just to make the user account on the Mac and you can say that it's running now.

03:14.610 --> 03:18.990
So you want to select here whether you want to seek with server to start automatically every time you

03:19.200 --> 03:22.540
start depending on the amount of resources you have.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.710
It might be wise to actually turn that off.

03:24.800 --> 03:31.230
But unchecking says that not to having this database running all the time is purely optional.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.540
It doesn't use a lot of resources so it's entirely up to you.

03:34.590 --> 03:39.330
You just have to remember if you're leading it off you need to come in the system preferences and click

03:39.330 --> 03:44.390
on the START option to start Thomasine called every time that you want to do some development.

03:44.490 --> 03:49.020
In my case I'm going to leave the checkbox on because I'm happy to have that running running automatically

03:49.040 --> 03:51.000
I should say when I retired.

03:51.270 --> 03:54.780
Right I close it down and we know that my sick server is now running.

03:55.140 --> 03:58.180
So the next thing we need now is some more software.

03:58.380 --> 04:01.040
We need the Marsico workbench.

04:01.130 --> 04:05.540
This is a tool that enables us to do a bit of configuration with Marsico.

04:05.550 --> 04:07.840
So you should still be on the screen down here.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.380
That was used to date where we downloaded where we clicked on.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.850
I think it's kind of a hearing select Marsico workbench.

04:13.950 --> 04:18.820
If not you just need to go back to the download section and the different music would come again.

04:19.020 --> 04:25.750
But in my case of body type in some kind of click on that scroll down and it can't it should automatically

04:25.750 --> 04:27.010
select Makower 6.

04:27.040 --> 04:27.970
If you're on a Mac.

04:28.090 --> 04:29.660
If not select it.

04:29.890 --> 04:34.750
And we just want to come over here and download this and say I'm up so we're going to click on No thanks

04:34.750 --> 04:36.320
but I want to create an account.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.740
It's a smaller download such shouldn't take too long.

04:38.770 --> 04:39.480
I'll say that

04:44.850 --> 04:46.470
all I can say is finish downloading.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.040
Same thing we got to open it and we're going to install this

04:53.600 --> 04:55.570
and the process is slightly different.

04:55.610 --> 05:02.500
We've got this Marsico workbench we just kind of drag it into applications and release the mouse copy

05:02.620 --> 05:04.430
itself into applications.

05:07.010 --> 05:14.160
OK and that's done in which he closes down now and we can do our command spites and just talk more as

05:14.340 --> 05:14.990
well.

05:16.990 --> 05:18.430
All right good boy.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.640
As you.

05:20.710 --> 05:27.160
For some reason you can't find it we just need to open up a tap enough that I put up a window rather

05:27.160 --> 05:35.350
a guide to applications music or warpage that's the that we want to type in the application.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.760
Next time you open it it will verify click on Open to say that we're happy to use.

05:40.930 --> 05:46.390
You can say it's available or it was downloaded officially from debit at my school dot com can open

05:49.620 --> 05:52.820
we're now actually running the sequel what pitch.

05:52.840 --> 05:56.650
So the first thing we're going to do now that table we're in here is we're going to actually test out

05:57.460 --> 06:01.970
to see him make sure that I must seek work bench can actually communicate with the sequel Serba.

06:02.230 --> 06:06.790
So we want to make sure that you have started the sequel server like you saw me do earlier in the video

06:07.600 --> 06:09.380
in problem system preferences.

06:09.380 --> 06:12.490
So going to click on this like instance is wanting the password.

06:12.490 --> 06:18.410
So we're going to paste in that password that we copied earlier even the installation sequel.

06:18.850 --> 06:19.780
OK.

06:20.350 --> 06:22.960
And notice when we do that it's come up and said that has expired.

06:22.980 --> 06:25.460
This is where we actually change the password.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.730
I'm going to paste in the old password again and for the new password I'm going to come up with something

06:30.730 --> 06:35.570
that I can remember if I'm really going to be using that as we go through the course

06:40.170 --> 06:45.990
placenta and then we went to enter that new password this time just to make sure we've entered it correctly.

06:49.020 --> 06:53.100
And you option or you can choose to sign the password in the key chain if you like.

06:53.120 --> 06:57.440
I'm not going to do that for security reasons I'm going to talk that each time but it's purely up to

06:57.440 --> 06:58.780
you as to which way you want to go.

06:59.130 --> 07:05.990
Chi-Chi at this point we now actually in the musical workbench and just kind of close down some of these

07:05.990 --> 07:07.410
other windows just too.

07:07.820 --> 07:14.290
So we can actually see things that are a bit clearer and this is the musical webpage.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.530
We can expand that out and make that a bit bigger if we want.

07:17.690 --> 07:20.180
So I can come here and click on server status.

07:20.570 --> 07:24.450
And again I don't have a passport and it'll keep asking for the past but unless you're prepared to sign

07:24.450 --> 07:24.750
with.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.750
So it's up to you as to whether you want to do it.

07:29.810 --> 07:30.700
OK.

07:31.190 --> 07:35.030
And you can say some information about the service and the fact that it's running.

07:35.330 --> 07:41.570
We come over here to use his privileges because what we want to do is create a new user and the idea

07:41.570 --> 07:45.490
is that we are creating a new user that we're going to be using Marsico with.

07:45.490 --> 07:50.610
Because in general it's not a good idea to use that root password for anything.

07:50.620 --> 07:55.090
It's good to keep that sort of play any sort of super administrative tasks that you want.

07:55.260 --> 08:00.050
So they can say in my case see if we just expand this out a little bit we've got the most Secord user

08:00.590 --> 08:03.410
and the route have been defined and created.

08:03.520 --> 08:11.640
Just click on Add an account and we're going to call this one type of user into cash and top.

08:11.690 --> 08:17.530
We've got to password and Standard believe that on the yacht as the default options for an apartment

08:17.600 --> 08:22.920
you need a password for this account and we're going to be using this card in this course so it is a

08:22.990 --> 08:25.580
use and I'm in a possible that you want to remember the passwords Tony

08:29.370 --> 08:31.430
and that is to say it's a weak password.

08:31.430 --> 08:35.630
If you want to avoid that and into a more secure one but try something a bit more secure.

08:43.230 --> 08:48.300
And you want to make sure that the password you are choosing is the same as the user just for security

08:48.300 --> 08:53.160
reasons and you have these other options here for account limits and so on and so forth you generally

08:53.160 --> 08:54.590
don't need to change any of those.

08:54.780 --> 08:59.060
Particularly given that on this machine it's really any development machine.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.670
You know it's no need to worry about too many of these other things.

09:01.680 --> 09:07.440
The main thing is that you've got to use and I can apply and you can say that time with what I use and

09:07.440 --> 09:09.820
I'm you know created what we could do.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.880
There might be a good idea to actually do that limit to host matching.

09:13.910 --> 09:16.680
It would be a good idea to make that local homicidally.

09:17.040 --> 09:23.070
What that means is that the username and password can only be used on this machine that is running like

09:23.070 --> 09:23.330
Ohio.

09:23.340 --> 09:28.420
So if for some reason there was a way for a hacker to get access to the database remotely they wouldn't

09:28.420 --> 09:33.360
be able to use this username and password to access anything remotely that has to actually be on your

09:33.360 --> 09:33.790
machine.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.230
So let's do that.

09:35.270 --> 09:37.550
So I'm trying to like O'Hare's and I've clicked on a there.

09:37.580 --> 09:44.020
You can say near-side that is another time that can click on View and go back to the home.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.970
That brings us back to this select section here.

09:47.130 --> 09:52.710
And you can go into this little mini out and he manage to connections and you can see if we click on

09:52.710 --> 09:58.110
like for instance it gives us some information about the installation and about a fault.

09:58.110 --> 10:02.180
It's given us the port number of three three or six when we've installed the call.

10:02.310 --> 10:07.390
That is the standard port that is used by more cynical and generally for most machines you want need

10:07.430 --> 10:08.680
to change that.

10:08.770 --> 10:13.000
If for some reason you had some sort of a conflict this would be where you change it.

10:13.320 --> 10:17.130
So what we'll do now is we're click on test connection and into my password

10:21.780 --> 10:26.520
and we get this thing he Pallis Darla and I pop up the I successfully made the connection.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.020
We know that Tyreke is looking good.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.000
I click on OK.

10:29.140 --> 10:34.530
McCloy's the last thing we're going to do now is click on this little button to add a new connection

10:35.040 --> 10:38.930
and that's going to be for you a key a new account that we set up in this video.

10:39.100 --> 10:43.470
That connection I'm just kind of called it development use and I won't be rude.

10:43.470 --> 10:50.730
In fact it's going to be Devaney's and her time is when we get into even the default 1:27 dog $0.08

10:50.730 --> 10:56.130
one which essentially is the Likewise hires local machine not the port number has automatically come

10:56.130 --> 11:01.870
across you would change that if for some reason that you'd had the standard port didn't work for you.

11:02.270 --> 11:06.310
You're going to have other options for SSL in advance but I wouldn't need any of those.

11:06.420 --> 11:11.130
We're just going to click on OK and actually what I should have done to get back in there again when

11:11.130 --> 11:15.570
we should have actually tested the connection so I can get into my password.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.430
And you can see we're actually in there now.

11:21.820 --> 11:26.030
So we go back home again like can you get a view when going home.

11:26.260 --> 11:32.050
You can click on there and we can click on Connect that takes us back to the same screen.

11:32.260 --> 11:37.390
Similar options in terms of service status and so so forth because I don't get my password right.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.300
The indication is working correctly when I've got an error.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.950
So in other words we're done the equivalent of testing to make sure that everything sort of working

11:44.950 --> 11:46.520
as it should be working.

11:46.870 --> 11:51.700
So consequently never got back to home again and that from the view menu we've now got two more secret

11:51.700 --> 11:54.850
connections we've got this development on with us.

11:55.180 --> 11:59.230
And now that account is the one that we're going to be using in future videos as we go through this

11:59.230 --> 12:00.770
course.

12:00.770 --> 12:04.830
All right so that's the installation of my Sakal on the Mac in the next video.

12:04.850 --> 12:07.460
We're going to do the installation on a Linux machine.

12:07.670 --> 12:12.740
So if you haven't got a Linux machine and all you don't want to install it you can bypass that video

12:12.740 --> 12:14.480
and go to the one after that.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.130
So I'll see you in the next video.
