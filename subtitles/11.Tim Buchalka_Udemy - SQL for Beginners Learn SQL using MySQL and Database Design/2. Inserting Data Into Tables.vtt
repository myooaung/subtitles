A in this video we're going to learn how to insert data into tables and we're going to be doing that

00:11.700 --> 00:14.850
by inserting some data into our products table.

00:15.210 --> 00:21.510
So I'm in my coffee store database I've selected stuff from products and you can see down here we have

00:21.570 --> 00:22.910
the products table.

00:23.220 --> 00:29.620
So you have the ID field the name field the price field and the coffee origin field.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.330
So to insert data into a table we need to use this syntax here.

00:34.620 --> 00:41.250
So we type insert into followed by the table name and then we open a pair of brackets.

00:41.250 --> 00:49.690
And we then we have our column names comma separated we follow that by the values keyword and then open

00:49.710 --> 00:55.620
another pair of brackets and have our values comma separated as well.

00:56.040 --> 01:00.060
So let's since our first row of data into our products table.

01:00.270 --> 01:10.290
So we need to type insert into pro-tax open a pair of brackets me to enter in all our columns apart

01:10.290 --> 01:11.880
from our ID column.

01:12.150 --> 01:17.800
And this is because we made this ID column primary key and we made it autoincrement.

01:17.970 --> 01:24.040
So this is going to be automatically filled as we enter in every row of data in our table.

01:24.120 --> 01:34.970
So we need to start with the name column and for that with a comma and then price Colma coffee origin

01:38.580 --> 01:44.340
and then on the next line we need to type values

01:46.870 --> 01:51.890
open a pair of brackets and we need to finish with those I mean carried on.

01:51.900 --> 01:58.890
So in the brackets we need to type or first we're going to sell and it's going to be espresso coffee.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.990
So we get to go in and type espresso

02:07.050 --> 02:16.600
and for what sort of strings we need to have the value in single quotes but for numbers we don't need

02:16.600 --> 02:17.560
the single quotes.

02:17.580 --> 02:25.320
So for our price column we can simply type 2.5 0 without a single case.

02:25.680 --> 02:31.650
And then for the coffee origin column we need the single quotes again because it's a string and we need

02:31.650 --> 02:34.380
to type Brazil.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.660
And then if we run this statement

02:39.720 --> 02:46.800
and select stuff from Puddock again we can see we have our first row of data entered into our products

02:46.800 --> 02:47.880
table.

02:48.480 --> 02:54.400
Now you can enter more than one row of table in one as Schiro stateman.

02:54.420 --> 02:58.430
So if we just copy this line

03:01.920 --> 03:11.030
and if we change this data to our next product that we're going to sell which is going to be more catchier

03:13.970 --> 03:20.120
priced three pounds or three dollars and that's all going to be from Brazil.

03:20.970 --> 03:24.530
But let's enter another row of dates and the same is statement.

03:24.800 --> 03:30.350
So let's put a comb my hair open a pair of brackets and enter another free values.

03:30.350 --> 03:32.620
So the next product is going to be a cappuccino

03:36.920 --> 03:37.950
and it's got two piece

03:40.860 --> 03:44.480
which is going to be priced at three point five zero.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.070
And this is going to be from Costa Rica

03:52.740 --> 03:57.810
So let's run this statement and select stuff from products again.

03:58.490 --> 04:03.260
And you can see entered both rows of data in one escrow statement.

04:03.710 --> 04:12.170
So to enter four rows of data in one insert into statement we need to have of value brackets comma separated

04:12.320 --> 04:17.390
and you can keep doing this as many times as you want to start another comma here for another pair of

04:17.390 --> 04:17.900
brackets.

04:17.920 --> 04:25.350
Enter another row of data so we have free rows of data entered into our products table.

04:25.640 --> 04:30.290
But now I want you to enter the next four rows of data.

04:30.290 --> 04:37.310
So I want and I want you to end the four rows which have ID 4 5 6 and 7 here.

04:37.460 --> 04:40.420
So the latte American A-flat y filter.

04:40.820 --> 04:49.280
So right the insert into statement to enter these last four rows of data and I'll be back with the solution

04:49.340 --> 04:50.330
in a second

04:56.400 --> 04:56.850
case.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.250
Here is the solution.

04:58.260 --> 05:06.870
We have insight into products named Price coffee origin and then we have values latte Americano flat

05:06.870 --> 05:10.550
white and filter or comma separated.

05:10.710 --> 05:15.070
So I hope you are able to do this and then we just need to run that statement

05:18.510 --> 05:25.740
and we can select stuff from products again and I can see we have all seven products entered into our

05:25.740 --> 05:27.710
products table.

05:27.870 --> 05:31.410
So that's it for inserting data into tables.

05:31.410 --> 05:36.740
Now let's move on to how we can update data that's already been entered into a table.
