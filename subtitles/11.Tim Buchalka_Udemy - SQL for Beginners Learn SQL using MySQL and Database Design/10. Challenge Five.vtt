00:05.190 --> 00:12.480
So the first challenge is to work out which film was shown in the Chaplin room most often in October

00:12.480 --> 00:14.270
2017.

00:14.310 --> 00:17.370
So remember we have free rooms in our cinema.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.530
One of them is called Chaplin.

00:19.530 --> 00:24.660
So we need to write and ask who are queery which overturned the film which was shown in the Chaplin

00:24.660 --> 00:29.050
room most often in October 2017.

00:29.250 --> 00:34.590
So have a go at writing an Eskimo query which will return this film and I'll see you in the next video

00:34.590 --> 00:35.650
for the solution.
