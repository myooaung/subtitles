A case they say far and select statements we've only looked at where a column is called to a certain

00:11.910 --> 00:14.280
value so equal to one value.

00:14.350 --> 00:23.770
So for example we look at where a coffee or region of coffee was equal to Columbia but we didn't look

00:23.890 --> 00:28.060
at where a column can be equal to two or more values.

00:28.060 --> 00:31.440
So in this video we're going to be looking at that.

00:31.510 --> 00:38.620
So here I've selected stuff from my customers table again and you can see Rita and all the other customers

00:38.620 --> 00:40.200
in our customer table.

00:40.630 --> 00:48.970
But actually I want to return the customers who have a last name of Taylor Bluth or Armstrong.

00:49.120 --> 00:56.350
So how can I do this I can do this by using the in key word rather than an equal sign.

00:56.350 --> 01:03.040
So I can come up here and I can write select stuff from customers where my column name which in this

01:03.040 --> 01:11.060
case is last name and instead of writing it to a certain Vadi I can write in.

01:11.260 --> 01:18.750
I can then open a pair of brackets and within that pair of brackets I can combine to separate each value.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.480
I want to select.

01:21.640 --> 01:26.290
So like I said I wanted to select tailor Bluefin Armstrong.

01:26.800 --> 01:33.980
So because these characters I need to put in single quotes and I can type Teyla and then I need to call

01:33.990 --> 01:39.590
a separate to open another pair of quotes and right place.

01:40.930 --> 01:46.600
And then I need to come up separate again from my last pair of brackets and type Armstrong

01:50.450 --> 01:53.170
and I could have had as many values as I wanted.

01:53.170 --> 02:01.540
So two or more values I need to use the in statement rather than equal sign.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.910
So let's run this and you can see.

02:03.910 --> 02:10.110
Now we just have the results where that last name was Eva Armstrong blue 48.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.670
Katie Armstrong.

02:11.890 --> 02:19.840
Then I have quite a lot of beliefs Mike busted in Z and then I have John Taylor and then more beliefs.

02:20.050 --> 02:27.480
And like I said if you want to add more names you just need to keep Colma separating each Friday and

02:27.490 --> 02:29.860
you can type in as many as you like

02:33.400 --> 02:37.330
and we can also exclude multiple values from our results.

02:37.690 --> 02:42.150
So let's say we wanted to select all our customers in our customer table.

02:42.460 --> 02:48.210
Apart from if they have the first name Katie Joel or George.

02:48.220 --> 02:55.490
So to do that we need to select stuff from our customer table and then we need to say where or call

02:55.480 --> 02:56.680
a name.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.300
So in this case his first name

03:01.810 --> 03:07.400
is not seen Katie John or George.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.570
So rather than typing in we just type not in.

03:11.590 --> 03:14.280
And then we type in our free values.

03:14.910 --> 03:27.970
So Katie Jaun and then George and then we just run this statement and we can see it's returned all our

03:27.970 --> 03:28.770
customers.

03:28.810 --> 03:34.780
Apart from any customer that has a first name of Katie Jones George.

03:35.260 --> 03:41.930
So we use that in the not in key words when we won a column to be equal to more than one value.
