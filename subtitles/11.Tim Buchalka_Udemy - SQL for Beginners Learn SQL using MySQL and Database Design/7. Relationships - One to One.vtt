A case of the first relationship we're going to look at is a one to one relationship and this is actually

00:10.520 --> 00:15.220
the least common type of relationship that you'll see in a database.

00:15.260 --> 00:22.670
So what is one to one relationship is where a key to one table appears no more than once as the key

00:22.730 --> 00:25.370
in another table and vice versa.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.420
So what does that actually mean.

00:27.770 --> 00:33.830
Well if you think about our school database where we had student tables and teachers tables where you

00:33.830 --> 00:41.420
could have a department table and you could have a head of department table and for each department

00:41.600 --> 00:49.410
you can only have one head of department and the head of a department can only be the head of one department.

00:49.730 --> 00:57.500
So these two tables would have a one to one relationship one department one head of department and the

00:57.500 --> 01:03.550
head of the department cannot be the head of another department of more than one department.

01:03.830 --> 01:08.030
So that would be an example of a one to one relationship.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.330
And if we think about our coffee store database we had our products table.

01:13.520 --> 01:20.570
So we had filled espresso cappuccino cetera but we could have also created a second table or we could

01:20.570 --> 01:27.220
have created a product details table and this would include all the data about that product.

01:27.350 --> 01:31.280
So maybe it would have included the price and the coffee origin.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.780
And these two tables would have had a one to one relationship.

01:34.820 --> 01:42.910
So one entry in the products table would have one entry in the product details table and one row in

01:42.920 --> 01:48.090
the products Details table could only relate to one product in the products table.

01:48.350 --> 01:54.910
So this would be another example of a one to one relationship and if you are creating a database schema

01:55.340 --> 02:01.180
you can present a one to one relationship between two tables using these lines.

02:01.220 --> 02:08.120
So we have a line between the two tables and then we have two vertical lines on each side and then we

02:08.120 --> 02:11.960
have the numbers one and numbers 0 to 1.

02:11.960 --> 02:20.290
So this means one entry in the products table would have zero to a maximum of one entry in the products

02:20.300 --> 02:21.680
details table.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.650
So this is what we mean by a one to one relationship.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.700
But like I said these are the least common types of relationships you'll see in a database.
