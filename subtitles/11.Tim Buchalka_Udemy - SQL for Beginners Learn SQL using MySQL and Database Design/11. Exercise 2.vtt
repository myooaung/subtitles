A case so walk to exercise to this section this exercise is going to test your knowledge of the date

00:12.810 --> 00:15.000
month and year functions.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.170
Now in our system or booking system database we only have data for Oct 2017.

00:21.630 --> 00:29.010
But when you are answering these three questions I'm going to ask you to pretend that we have multiple

00:29.010 --> 00:30.450
years of data.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.420
So the first exercise is to select the film ID and start time from the screenings table for the dates

00:37.440 --> 00:40.540
of 20th of October 2017.

00:40.890 --> 00:47.730
The second exercise is to select the data from the screenings table for the start time between the 6th

00:47.820 --> 00:56.070
and 13th of October 2017 and then the final exercise is to select all the data from the screenings table

00:56.100 --> 00:58.690
for October 2017.

00:58.980 --> 00:59.880
So have a go.

00:59.940 --> 01:04.850
Each of these exercises and I'll see you in the next video for the solutions to each one.
