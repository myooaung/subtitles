00:05.380 --> 00:09.920
A case in this video we're going to learn about max and min aggregate functions.

00:10.020 --> 00:15.990
So here I've selected stuff from films table and you can see we have the name and length in minutes

00:15.990 --> 00:17.410
of each of our films.

00:17.560 --> 00:24.650
But let's say we wanted to just select the maximum length so our longest film that was sharing in our

00:24.660 --> 00:37.840
cinema where we can select max lengths men so we're applying the max aggregate function to our length

00:37.900 --> 00:41.510
and column from films.

00:43.730 --> 00:50.720
And if we run now you can see it just returns one value of 153 which was the highest number in this

00:50.720 --> 00:51.640
column.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.810
So our longest film length is 153 minutes.

00:56.270 --> 01:00.880
But what if we wanted to show you the name of the film as well as the max length.

01:01.460 --> 01:10.430
Well we might come in here and we might say let's select the name called him and the max length from

01:10.430 --> 01:11.180
films.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.850
So let's run this.

01:13.190 --> 01:17.990
But you can see this returns an error and he's mentioning grouped by expression here.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.600
And basically we're getting an error because if we select stuff from film again

01:26.740 --> 01:34.840
because the name when we select name is trying to return 12 values is trying to return all the names

01:35.290 --> 01:36.740
in our films table.

01:37.030 --> 01:41.090
But the max length man is only trying to return one value.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.400
So when we run this statement just as it is it doesn't know whether to return 12 values or whether it's

01:47.650 --> 01:49.030
return 1 value.

01:49.270 --> 01:55.270
So we get an error but we can get round this by using group by statements which we're going to learn

01:55.270 --> 01:57.770
later in the section.

01:57.790 --> 02:01.390
So that's how we return the maximum value in a given column.

02:01.390 --> 02:04.390
Now let's look at how we can determine the minimum value.

02:04.390 --> 02:10.420
So let's select the film with the shortest length with the shortest running time.

02:10.720 --> 02:18.190
So to do that we can just come in here and we can apply the mean aggregate function to our length in

02:18.190 --> 02:23.090
column and run that statement and you can see it returns 88.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.630
So all shortest film is 88 minutes.

02:25.630 --> 02:28.400
So just to just under 1 and half hours.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.910
So that's how we return the minimum value in a given column.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.030
OK so that's it for MIN and MAX functions.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.910
Let's move on to the next video.
