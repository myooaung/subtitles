A case you know that's create the Customers table so the customers table has a primary key ID which

00:12.260 --> 00:18.140
isn't and is too incriminating then it has the first name and the last name of the customer and say

00:18.140 --> 00:19.360
the email.

00:19.530 --> 00:23.270
See you can see the first name doesn't have the not no constraint.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.590
And this is showing by the empty diamond next to the first name called him.

00:27.840 --> 00:33.830
But the last name does have the not no constrain and the e-mail also has not no constraint.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.790
And it also has a unique constraint.

00:37.330 --> 00:42.540
So now this I put in my obscure work bench and create the custom table

00:46.400 --> 00:55.000
case to create the customer table we need to type create table customers then we need to open a pair

00:55.000 --> 00:56.700
of records with the same code on.

00:56.740 --> 01:00.250
And then within brackets we need to type columns.

01:00.310 --> 01:13.840
So the first one again is ID in it's our primary key and it auto increments or to increment comma and

01:13.840 --> 01:16.330
then the next column was our first name.

01:16.570 --> 01:21.280
So the first name of our customer and this was a vulture.

01:22.350 --> 01:28.420
If length with the maximum length of 45 we didn't have any constraints on this column so we can just

01:28.420 --> 01:30.070
leave it like this.

01:30.070 --> 01:38.940
And then the next column was last name which was also a all chaw of Lang 45.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.590
But we did have a constraint on this call and we had the note no constraint.

01:43.780 --> 01:45.650
So we need to type not no.

01:46.060 --> 01:50.880
So we always type all constrains off to the data type for that particular column.

01:51.520 --> 01:59.460
And then finally we have the email column which was also if all chaw o maximum length 45.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.680
This also had not no constraint.

02:03.190 --> 02:10.780
And we all say one email to be unique so we can type unique and then that's it for our customer table.

02:10.780 --> 02:20.760
So let's run that statement and then let's run show tables and we should now have two tables.

02:20.780 --> 02:28.420
You can see we have our customer we have our film and we can run describe customers

02:32.670 --> 02:34.770
and you can see we have all four columns.

02:34.770 --> 02:39.280
We have our data types whether it's not no and no.

02:39.360 --> 02:47.130
We have our key primary key and unique and any default values and then the autoincrement for our ID

02:47.130 --> 02:48.110
field.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.200
OK so that's it for this video.
