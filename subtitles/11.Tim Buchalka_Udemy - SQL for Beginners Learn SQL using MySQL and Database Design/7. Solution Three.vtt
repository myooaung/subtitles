So challenge was to see how many bookings the film jigsaw had in October 2017 and remember all our data

00:14.400 --> 00:17.120
is only from October 2017.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.420
So I hope you're able to have this challenge.

00:21.420 --> 00:24.030
And in this video we're going to have a look at the solution.

00:24.450 --> 00:25.560
So for this challenge.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.340
I actually did a query.

00:27.480 --> 00:33.270
So first I'm going to type out the intersection of the subquery so I select

00:37.260 --> 00:42.240
ID from the screenings table

00:45.270 --> 00:56.600
where film ID is equal to 5 so film Id equal to five is the film id for.

00:56.650 --> 01:06.890
So say basically this query is going to give me the ID or the screenings ID for the film jigsaw.

01:06.900 --> 01:13.240
So if I run that this is every screening ID for the screenings of jigsaw.

01:13.620 --> 01:16.550
So thats the inner part of my soccer theory.

01:16.590 --> 01:25.740
So now Im going to write the outer part so lets put that in brackets and then the outer part I'm going

01:25.740 --> 01:35.860
to I'm going to do a count star from bookings where the screening ID is in the select query.

01:36.150 --> 01:46.830
So let's type that out now so I can type select count style from bookings

01:49.620 --> 01:54.800
where screening by day.

01:54.900 --> 02:02.660
So the screening ID column in the bookings table is in this select query.

02:02.700 --> 02:12.930
So basically saying select counts from bookings where screening ID is in the list so this list of values

02:12.930 --> 02:13.900
here.

02:14.010 --> 02:15.270
So if I run this

02:18.380 --> 02:20.370
you can see we have 59.

02:20.660 --> 02:26.890
So this is the number of bookings where screening ID was in that list there.

02:26.900 --> 02:32.020
So this is the number of bookings that jigsaw got in October 2017.

02:32.300 --> 02:43.170
And I suppose I could do as number of bookings something like this just to make it clearer.

02:45.660 --> 02:51.030
So you can see jigsaw had 59 bookings in October 2017.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.970
So this is my solution for this challenge.

02:53.970 --> 03:00.930
I'm sure there is another solution especially using a join rather than a sub query seeing as we have

03:00.930 --> 03:08.870
this relationship between screening ID column and the bookings table and the ID column in the screenings

03:08.880 --> 03:09.600
table.

03:09.870 --> 03:15.610
So if you are able to get a solution using a join then please post it in the Q&amp;A section.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.210
Now take a look.

03:17.370 --> 03:23.960
If you are able to get the number of bookings for cheek's So as 59 then that's fantastic.

03:25.510 --> 03:27.840
So now let's move on to the next challenge.
