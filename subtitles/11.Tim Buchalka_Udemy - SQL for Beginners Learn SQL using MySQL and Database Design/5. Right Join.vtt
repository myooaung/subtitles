00:05.630 --> 00:11.850
A case in this video let's look out right Joines see if you remember right joins will return all the

00:11.850 --> 00:13.870
data from Table 2.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.780
And no only retrieve matching data from table 1.

00:18.830 --> 00:25.010
So they're the opposite of left joins basically and you can see here I have the same select statement

00:25.460 --> 00:26.510
from The Last Lecture.

00:26.510 --> 00:31.890
So the LEFT JOIN where customers is Table 1 and orders is Table 2.

00:32.210 --> 00:41.220
So let's run this again and you can see returns order IDs from 2 to 11.

00:41.240 --> 00:49.310
So let's run the same select statement but let's change the left join to a RIGHT JOIN.

00:49.520 --> 00:55.710
So use the same select statement but now it's going to retrieve all the data from Table 2.

00:55.730 --> 01:01.070
So the orders and only the matching data from table 1 which is customers.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.800
So let's run that now.

01:03.230 --> 01:06.990
So you can see that the first row of data is now Order ID 1.

01:07.460 --> 01:14.720
And that's because it's now retrieving all the rows from the Orders table and only matching data from

01:14.720 --> 01:16.150
the Customers table.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.480
So let's switch the tables around again.

01:19.490 --> 01:23.670
So let's make customers table 2 and orders table 1.

01:24.260 --> 01:27.900
So to do that we're going to say from orders.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.890
Right joining.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.290
Customers see

01:36.310 --> 01:45.170
and then again in the all and we need to change this around so we need say all customer ID is the crew

01:45.170 --> 01:46.850
to see Id

01:50.890 --> 01:54.480
leave the order and limit the same.

01:55.270 --> 02:00.190
And you can see now that we have order IDs from 2 to 11.

02:00.190 --> 02:03.580
So this is equivalent to the first left join statement.

02:03.610 --> 02:12.950
We ran in this video so you can see that Royte joins on left joins all the same but opposite.

02:12.950 --> 02:22.030
So switching tables round's from table one table to and table to table 1 is exactly the same as switching

02:22.030 --> 02:24.880
left join to right join.

02:24.880 --> 02:30.070
So again just make sure you know which ones table won and which ones table too when you're using write

02:30.160 --> 02:31.920
joins.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.080
So that sums it up for left joins on right joins again.

02:36.550 --> 02:39.370
The most common join you use is the inner join.

02:39.490 --> 02:45.080
But just in case you need to use left and right joins now you know how to do it.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.160
And just to complete this video.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.540
Let's run this update Stakman.

02:51.640 --> 03:00.760
So update the orders again and set customer id equal to one where ID is equal to 1 and then select store

03:00.760 --> 03:04.120
from orders to make sure that's happened.

03:04.740 --> 03:10.350
And now we have the same data we had before we were dealing with left and right joins.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.010
So that's it for this video.
