00:05.260 --> 00:06.950
My case you know let's take a look.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.440
None correlated queries come off to the From.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.820
So here I selected stuff from reserved seats.

00:13.840 --> 00:20.110
And you see we have the ID booking ID and seat ID fields from the reserved seat table and now I want

00:20.110 --> 00:29.080
to write select statement which only grabs the booking ID and counts the number of seat ID and then

00:29.080 --> 00:30.920
group by the booking ID.

00:31.120 --> 00:39.110
So basically you get the number of seats reserved for each booking ID so let's right now Syllis type

00:39.110 --> 00:45.580
select booking ID and then count on see tidy

00:48.600 --> 00:56.700
frome reserved seats and then we need to group by the booking ID because we haven't got an aggregate

00:56.700 --> 01:01.180
function on the booking ID.

01:01.740 --> 01:11.340
And then we can run this statement so you can see for every booking ID we have the number of seats reserved

01:11.340 --> 01:12.460
for that booking.

01:12.630 --> 01:18.430
Speaking ID one was free seats booking ID to two seats etc etc..

01:18.810 --> 01:23.890
So what if we wanted to select the maximum value in this county seat ID column.

01:23.910 --> 01:31.260
So basically the maximum number of seats that were reserved by one booking where we could select statement

01:31.260 --> 01:36.810
here and in a query it could come off to the From.

01:36.810 --> 01:40.060
So let's do that now to show you what I mean.

01:40.080 --> 01:50.130
So the first thing I want to do actually is I want to say Count see ID as number of seats and I underscore

01:50.130 --> 01:50.790
seats.

01:50.790 --> 01:53.320
So basically this is the column name alias.

01:53.910 --> 01:58.160
And then I want to put this select statement in brackets.

01:58.170 --> 02:06.340
So in a query and I actually want to be here and I'll explain later.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.140
And then I want to write out a query.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.370
So this is going to be all in a query.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.400
So now let's write out query.

02:14.670 --> 02:20.040
So I want to select the maximum value in this count see tidy right.

02:20.310 --> 02:23.250
Select selects Max

02:26.010 --> 02:34.460
now I've put a column name alias on this count see Id write counts the tidy column as number of seats.

02:34.500 --> 02:39.990
So now I can say max number of seats.

02:42.680 --> 02:46.240
From this in a query.

02:46.370 --> 02:52.580
So I select the max number of seats from which is our outer query and then I have all in a query that's

02:52.580 --> 02:53.870
coming off to the From.

02:53.870 --> 03:01.160
So any queries now selects booking Id count SEE ID as number of seats from reserved seats and we're

03:01.160 --> 03:02.890
grouping by the booking ID.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.890
And we've called this b.

03:05.000 --> 03:13.520
So now let's run this statement and you can see it returned Max number of seats 6 which was the maximum

03:13.520 --> 03:15.500
value in our account.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.510
So Id call them.

03:18.510 --> 03:20.960
So let's see what exactly happened here.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.440
So normally when you selects a column from you're selecting from a table.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.810
So you can see here we're selecting stuff from a table reserved seats.

03:31.130 --> 03:39.950
So when you use so queries off of the from basically you're creating a table with the sub query.

03:39.950 --> 03:53.090
So this select booking Id count Seitel ID is actually creating a table service creating a table with

03:53.090 --> 03:57.330
booking ID and number of seats and these values within the table.

03:57.740 --> 04:01.810
And this is known as a derived table so you can see here.

04:01.880 --> 04:07.490
We actually had to call out derived table B when we were running this whole sub query.

04:07.730 --> 04:13.920
So the query is creating a derived table which the OutServe query is then selecting from.

04:13.940 --> 04:20.400
So we're selecting max number of seeds from the derived table created by or in a query.

04:20.480 --> 04:27.950
So the maximum value in this number of seats table will be six and we're selecting now around to query

04:29.570 --> 04:33.690
whenever you're creating a derived table in a query.

04:33.770 --> 04:37.300
You have to refer to that table with a name so it can be any name.

04:37.330 --> 04:41.180
So here I just it be but I could have kuda anything.

04:41.480 --> 04:46.850
So this table is being created and is called a derived table.

04:46.850 --> 04:52.760
So it's not a permanent table in the database is just derived and used just for this query.

04:53.150 --> 05:00.080
But we have to give it a name so we're calling it be in this case and we can also select other columns

05:00.080 --> 05:01.010
from this.

05:01.010 --> 05:06.190
So let's say we wanted to select the average number of seats reserved per booking.

05:06.620 --> 05:12.350
We can type average number of seats.

05:12.650 --> 05:20.390
Average number of seats call a maximum of seats on this run this query and it returns the average Friday

05:20.390 --> 05:26.360
for the number of seats column from all derived table and it returns the maximum number of seats as

05:26.360 --> 05:27.050
well.

05:27.410 --> 05:31.010
So this is how we use up queries off of the from Stakman.

05:31.010 --> 05:38.000
Basically in a query creates derive table which we then have to cool which we then have to give a name

05:38.880 --> 05:43.680
and the outer query then selects values from that derive table.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.070
So that's it for this video.
