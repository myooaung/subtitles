OK welcome back.

00:06.240 --> 00:12.250
So hopefully you are able to complete those free questions so we're able to make an attempt.

00:12.420 --> 00:17.750
The three questions in this video we're going to go through the solution to each one.

00:18.240 --> 00:24.240
So the first question was to select the film ID and start time from the screenings table for the date

00:24.330 --> 00:27.200
of 25th of October 2017.

00:27.510 --> 00:35.670
So to do that we need to select fill my day and start times to fill my day and the start time column

00:36.300 --> 00:38.610
from screenings.

00:39.450 --> 00:46.530
So from the screenings table and then on the next line we can type where date start time.

00:46.530 --> 00:54.400
So we're using the Date function on the start time column is equal to the 25th of October 2017.

00:54.660 --> 01:04.880
So 2017 10 20 and then send me a single quote and with a semi-colon and we can run this query

01:07.780 --> 01:16.690
and you can see it's return the film ID and the start time for all the screenings on 25 October 2017.

01:16.690 --> 01:22.460
Now the second question was asking us to select all the data from the screenings table for the sought

01:22.510 --> 01:27.210
time between the 6th and 13th of October 2017.

01:27.400 --> 01:36.430
So to select all the data we need to select store from screenings and then we need a WHERE clause and

01:36.550 --> 01:38.300
we need a between statement.

01:38.320 --> 01:46.920
So wet day start time is between 2017.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.500
So we won the sixth and the 13th.

01:49.560 --> 02:02.610
So 2017 10 6 and 2017 10 13 and with a semi-colon.

02:02.950 --> 02:10.990
And if we run this you can see as we're turned off the road all the columns with a start time from the

02:10.990 --> 02:18.120
6th of October all the way to the 13th so we have to keep going down.

02:18.460 --> 02:25.720
And you can see we have the 13th of October here and then the final challenge was to select all the

02:25.720 --> 02:31.000
dates from the screenings table for October 2017.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.660
Now we only have data in our screenings table for October 2017.

02:35.980 --> 02:43.210
So to answer this question we could have just type select star from screenings and just run that query

02:43.210 --> 02:48.330
and it would have returned all the data for October 2017.

02:48.610 --> 02:52.740
But I asked you to pretend that we had multiple years of data.

02:53.020 --> 02:59.370
So we're actually going to need to wear clothes and we're going to need to say where the month or the

02:59.380 --> 03:05.460
start time is we can talk Toboso is equal to 10.

03:06.730 --> 03:17.350
And we're also going to say whether a year of start dates is equal to two thousand and 17.

03:17.680 --> 03:28.150
So if we had data from 2016 2015 from April May then we can only extract the data from October 2017

03:28.510 --> 03:35.160
by saying where the months start time is equal to 10 and the years start time is equal to 2017.

03:35.470 --> 03:46.330
So I actually need to change that to start time start dates and then run that query and it returns all

03:46.330 --> 03:50.730
the data for October 2017.

03:51.490 --> 03:54.410
Okay so that's the solutions for the three questions.

03:54.520 --> 04:00.610
If you got a different solution then please post it in the Q&amp;A section or if you have any questions

04:00.610 --> 04:06.140
about this exercise then please post it in a Q&amp;A section and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
