WEBVTT

00:04.670 --> 00:09.370
In this video we're going to go ahead and install my sequel to Linux.

00:09.420 --> 00:15.750
So if you're running Windows or Mac refer to the last two videos in this section of the course because

00:15.750 --> 00:19.750
I've got separate videos showing how to install Marsico on these operating systems.

00:19.910 --> 00:22.220
But we're going to do this one point in the next.

00:22.260 --> 00:29.670
The first thing we need to do is open a web browser and we need to add the Marsico IPTA repository to

00:29.670 --> 00:31.450
our system software puzzle trialist.

00:31.670 --> 00:36.480
So let's cut through and do that and we're going to go to the website site.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.490
Marsico dot com.

00:38.540 --> 00:48.680
It was on it I want to go to work so much downloads slash repo slash IPTA and the link will be in the

00:48.680 --> 00:50.810
resources section and this video.

00:50.810 --> 00:51.410
Click on to

00:57.860 --> 00:59.170
misquote onto the part of the page.

00:59.170 --> 01:02.630
This is more siecle IAPT config file.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.840
Click on download for that

01:06.710 --> 01:11.000
this option to create an oracle account or log in Arcola.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.650
Now the owners of more cynical better are going to click on No thanks to start my download because you

01:15.650 --> 01:21.860
don't really need to and can't click that Kemeny to site that tough all I'll summarize and click on

01:21.910 --> 01:27.160
Tai-Chi Saulteaux I actually do now is actually closed the browser because we're actually talking about

01:27.160 --> 01:33.250
that because it was a slow fall and the fall has been added as we can see here in the Marsico.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.780
Sorry in the deadline.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.140
So I can open a terminal window now.

01:37.690 --> 01:43.630
Select terminal or just pretty terminal window the way you normally open and what we can do then is

01:43.840 --> 01:47.970
execute the command to actually execute is going to top sudo.

01:48.140 --> 01:51.720
Spice JPK K-J spice dash II.

01:52.170 --> 01:59.160
We're going to do to slash down lights and then it's going to be the more sequel for we downloaded just

01:59.160 --> 02:05.910
on m y and press tab enter into the regular passport to get into this account.

02:07.970 --> 02:10.150
And I just close it down.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.380
Try that again because it should.

02:11.390 --> 02:16.200
Anything else using this of I know what I'm trying to do.

02:16.200 --> 02:20.040
I just pause the video and I'll just close or look at it look back into it and that should fix the problem

02:21.040 --> 02:23.730
or that's what turns out I actually rebooted my computer.

02:23.730 --> 02:29.760
I'm not too sure why that was actually locked but will try again now that Tom is ok.

02:29.760 --> 02:40.940
Hopefully so pseudo spiced T.P. K.G. dash II 3:58 slash downloads and it's fine to the my Saeco app

02:40.970 --> 02:46.070
config file that we downloaded and even the video that we need to enter your regular password

02:49.700 --> 02:51.470
is Thomas actually working.

02:51.820 --> 02:56.300
So let that finish.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.420
Now it's finished.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.170
You can see here that we've got some options on the screen.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.090
The first thing it's asking is what's Marsico product do you wish to save.

03:04.290 --> 03:11.260
We consider it selected on Marsico 7 that's fine and not going down the Marsico tools and connectors

03:11.350 --> 03:17.410
currently selected is enabled so we can click into that option to change it.

03:17.410 --> 03:23.710
We're just going to leave it on the default Marsico 5:07 next option is Marsico tools and connectors

03:23.830 --> 03:25.150
can go in there.

03:25.260 --> 03:28.840
You really just got the option to me and I wouldn't discipled so I'm going to leave it on the default

03:29.170 --> 03:35.050
which is enabled and my preview packages we can leave as disabled we don't want to use any previous

03:35.070 --> 03:37.850
halfway through tunnel that we click on OK.

03:39.290 --> 03:43.910
And it actually takes a few things as you can see they and then will be ready to go through and continue

03:43.910 --> 03:45.950
to update Well the installation.

03:45.950 --> 03:51.760
I should say of music in so you can say it took a little while but that's no finished.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.750
We've got it all ready to go and it manage to download the K and this is an automatic process.

03:57.020 --> 04:02.740
It's like you know top sudo apt get or C space apt get update.

04:03.670 --> 04:08.230
It's wrapped in package information from the Marsico IPT repository.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.330
And then we're going to actually go ahead and do the installation of the most exclusive

04:15.330 --> 04:17.100
kind that's now finished.

04:17.140 --> 04:20.010
You can ignore that message there a bit upstream that's fine.

04:20.010 --> 04:20.320
All right.

04:20.320 --> 04:28.720
Next we're going to install Secret Service called pseudo spice app apt get spice install spice Marsico

04:28.960 --> 04:29.830
dash.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.200
And press enter there to accept the default.

04:35.230 --> 04:44.140
Yes and it's no kind of installed Siku on this and it's instillation.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.640
We need to set a strong password for the root password.

04:47.670 --> 04:54.180
So this is not root on the unix machine this is root for the musical installation because Mustique workwise

04:54.300 --> 05:02.820
usernames and passwords set into a password here that is secure and that you remember you can say you've

05:02.820 --> 05:07.770
got the option to leave it blank when I have a password less logon but to recommend that I think it's

05:07.770 --> 05:10.070
better to have a password for security reasons.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.500
So I wanted my password president to confirm the password

05:16.160 --> 05:17.470
and not finish.

05:20.520 --> 05:20.830
OK.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.860
It's now finished.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.800
So should have our server now installed.

05:24.820 --> 05:32.650
Recontest that in talking pseudo Space Service spies MEU siecle voice you know that is spy status.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.870
And then we can actually try actually stopping this.

05:38.870 --> 05:45.760
So instead of having status at the top stop to stop the Marsico installation then we can all start again

05:46.450 --> 05:47.950
to start.

05:47.990 --> 05:51.950
So that should now be running OK we'll be testing the saliva in the video.

05:51.990 --> 05:57.940
After the install DiMasi a workbench to make sure to sort of restarting and it's not working correctly.

05:57.960 --> 06:02.310
So speaking of that Marsico workbench that's what we want to install next.

06:02.310 --> 06:11.730
So what are the top pseudo spies IP to use dush get spies install spies and Marsico Desch workbench

06:12.900 --> 06:14.050
dash community

06:17.140 --> 06:24.370
presented to select the default out of us to allow to install the one that install it.

06:24.390 --> 06:28.710
I'm going to put a couple of links in the resources section if you want to actually install additional

06:28.710 --> 06:32.710
components for workbench or find out more about it in general with a menu.

06:32.750 --> 06:37.120
I'll put those links in the resources section of this video and you can never refer to that later.

06:37.140 --> 06:41.040
We just kind of Geiser under the basic install because that's all we really need for this cause.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.650
But you've got that option if needed

06:46.670 --> 06:48.940
I case I can see that's now installed as well.

06:49.260 --> 06:56.070
So at this point we can top exit we finished with the terminal session and close it down and we can

06:56.070 --> 06:59.070
go back now to our inventory.

06:59.090 --> 07:10.040
We got a moment to cash in close click on either and if you Toppin work you should see the Marsico workbench

07:10.070 --> 07:14.570
has been histones the product I want to click on that want to actually run that.

07:14.870 --> 07:20.470
And that's a good application that we can use to test Marsico installation like that amendment to start

07:22.010 --> 07:26.510
sites now started up and we can see down here we've got this like Winston's three three or six.

07:26.690 --> 07:27.410
So we click on that

07:30.440 --> 07:36.170
that's going to ask for your password the first time and this is the root password for the Marsico installation

07:36.500 --> 07:38.470
not the password for your machine.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.630
So I'm going to type in the past that I saw and

07:44.720 --> 07:46.300
you can say that it's open foreign.

07:46.400 --> 07:53.560
So why I pulled that out a bit more we can click on of status and we get some information about my Seacole

07:53.560 --> 07:55.540
and the fact that it's running etc..

07:56.110 --> 08:01.870
What we do want to do is create another user and the user that we create is going to be used when we're

08:01.870 --> 08:04.240
running applications in this course.

08:04.240 --> 08:10.520
So I get to click over here to users and privileges and this to use is that a credit part of foppery

08:10.520 --> 08:16.890
we want to click on an account and for the actual night the log in name we're not going to call it usable

08:16.930 --> 08:24.240
call it user into cash on top of lÃ©vis the default limits to host matching.

08:24.310 --> 08:29.970
We're going to change that to local Herst and what that means is that this username and password can

08:29.970 --> 08:36.450
only be used to connect to Marsico if the process or the person using it is actually logged onto this

08:36.450 --> 08:37.230
machine.

08:37.230 --> 08:42.690
So it's just like an additional security mechanism to make sure that if by chance someone was able to

08:42.690 --> 08:49.380
access Marsico remotely that it wouldn't work because the use of a passport has to be part of a process

08:49.380 --> 08:50.990
running on your computer.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.110
Next we need a password

08:59.350 --> 09:01.050
and this is the password we're going to be using.

09:01.080 --> 09:06.100
You know applications so it's something that you obviously want to remember anyway and it should be

09:06.100 --> 09:09.180
different to the past month that we saw earlier in the year video.

09:09.400 --> 09:14.650
I'm going to click on apply and we've now got the dead user created as well.

09:14.950 --> 09:20.260
So let's now get back to the main page are putting on view and clicking on home and what we're going

09:20.260 --> 09:26.260
to do now is this I'm going to click on this little wrench and we just get the ability to actually see

09:26.260 --> 09:28.620
a connection and you can see there's an option there.

09:28.630 --> 09:35.870
We can then click on test connection and this is a way of connecting and making sure that the username

09:35.930 --> 09:38.270
is connecting to the database successfully.

09:38.270 --> 09:42.970
So we tried the route on first topic and the root password.

09:43.950 --> 09:48.180
We get a pop up to say we successfully made the cable connection.

09:48.230 --> 09:53.600
That means subparts to siecle database is running correctly on this machine and that we've got the correct

09:53.600 --> 09:57.500
use and even password on click close to that.

09:57.500 --> 10:02.920
But then what we'll do is we'll finish up the video by creating another connection and we're going to

10:02.930 --> 10:04.930
do that for you where username.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.950
Some call this collection in development for the root password for the use and I'm going to try and

10:10.940 --> 10:12.250
up to date.

10:13.490 --> 10:19.070
And who's going to click on test connection when I see that it asks for the password.

10:19.140 --> 10:25.720
This time we want the password for the dev user and I suggest you save the password.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.590
It's up to you whether you want to do that or not but I won't be signing it.

10:28.820 --> 10:29.430
OK.

10:29.780 --> 10:34.970
And we've got a pop up to say we've successfully made this my connection which again tells us that the

10:34.970 --> 10:38.100
Marsico database is working OK on this machine.

10:38.180 --> 10:43.650
Plus it also tells us that this used an amber password the one that we used is correct.

10:43.670 --> 10:44.880
It's going to click OK.

10:45.020 --> 10:51.350
And that adds a connection to the list of connections we've got to there now at this point we can now

10:51.410 --> 10:51.910
finish off.

10:51.910 --> 10:56.470
We can close off workbench we can exit out of that.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.440
And in fact I'm going to finish the video here.

10:58.440 --> 11:03.400
Now in this video now that we've got this installed we'll have a bit more of a play around with the

11:03.400 --> 11:04.710
Marsico webpage.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.150
So see you in the next video.
