00:04.650 --> 00:07.950
A case and let's create the seats table.

00:08.450 --> 00:14.820
OK so the seats table has the ID column like every other table which is our primary key and that will

00:14.830 --> 00:16.090
turn commence.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.970
And then we have to row and the number columns.

00:18.970 --> 00:24.580
So this contains the data for the right number of the C and the number of the C.

00:24.820 --> 00:33.770
So when you go to the cinema you see it normally has a row in a number like a 5 or G 11.

00:33.850 --> 00:40.080
So this is going to contain that data and then the final column is going to contain the room ID.

00:40.150 --> 00:45.880
So it's going to say which room the seat is in and that's going to be a foreign key to the ID field

00:45.910 --> 00:47.000
in the room table.

00:47.320 --> 00:52.870
And you can see in the second picture here that there's is one to many relationship between the rooms

00:52.960 --> 00:54.570
and seats.

00:54.580 --> 01:02.170
So one room can have many seats a particular seat can only be situated in one room.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.650
So they have a one to many relationship and as a foreign key between Ramadi and the Sikh's table and

01:08.650 --> 01:11.390
the ID column in the rooms table.

01:11.980 --> 01:16.540
OK so now they say put in my school work bench and create the seats table

01:20.700 --> 01:28.610
case and they were in my school work bench we can create the seats table Sit tight create table seats

01:29.520 --> 01:32.440
open our brackets like normal finish with a semi-colon.

01:33.160 --> 01:40.380
And then within brackets we need to type all columns are data types and all constraints.

01:40.400 --> 01:50.600
So the first column was ID which is our primary key which auto increments like normal.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.430
And then the next column was for the seat.

01:54.440 --> 01:54.980
Right.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.680
So we need to type right.

01:56.750 --> 02:00.700
And this was chaw data type of length 1.

02:00.740 --> 02:07.550
So each row is going to be either a B C D etc. and you're going to have one letter in it.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.640
And this is not no.

02:09.980 --> 02:19.090
So the not no constraint and then the next column was all numbers column so the number for the C.

02:19.670 --> 02:20.700
This is an.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.260
And it's also not no.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.190
And then the final column was all room ID.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.680
And this is the foreign key you remember.

02:29.990 --> 02:33.080
So this is it's and it's also no.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.080
And now we need to define our foreign key.

02:36.080 --> 02:47.860
So we need to tie foreign key apron and pair brackets and tie Brumidi then we need to tie preferences.

02:48.690 --> 02:55.460
And we're referencing the Reames table open up of rockets and we're referencing the ID column in the

02:55.460 --> 02:56.760
rooms table.

02:57.350 --> 02:59.370
So we type it just like that.

02:59.450 --> 03:01.850
We don't need to end it with anything.

03:01.850 --> 03:10.430
And then if we run that statement it creates the seats table and we can type show tables in our database

03:10.760 --> 03:13.550
tables.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.650
We now have our seats table here.

03:15.650 --> 03:20.570
So we have five tables now and then just like before we can type describe

03:23.050 --> 03:23.650
seats

03:26.410 --> 03:27.950
run that statement.

03:28.160 --> 03:34.670
And you can see we have our seats table has four columns ID ready number Ramadi the data types for each

03:34.670 --> 03:35.790
column.

03:35.930 --> 03:39.050
None of them allow no values.

03:39.050 --> 03:42.890
We have our primary key we have our foreign key.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.470
None of them have a default value sat on our prime.

03:45.470 --> 03:48.070
Key is her incrementing.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.370
OK so that's it for the seats table.
