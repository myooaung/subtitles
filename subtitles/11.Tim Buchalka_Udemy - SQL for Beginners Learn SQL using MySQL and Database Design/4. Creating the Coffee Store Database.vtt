00:05.360 --> 00:11.560
A case now we know about data types and primary and foreign keys that start creating our coffee store

00:11.560 --> 00:13.010
database.

00:13.090 --> 00:21.640
So I opened up my school work bench and go to the view's connection and then first thing we want to

00:21.640 --> 00:24.550
do is we want to show database's

00:29.680 --> 00:35.950
and you can see we just have four databases at my school so workbenches installed with.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.480
So we need to create our database.

00:38.770 --> 00:50.110
So we need to create a database and then we're going to cool it coffee on the school stool and then

00:50.110 --> 01:00.520
run up and then run show databases again and we see we have our coffee store database we can then type

01:00.640 --> 01:04.900
use coffee store

01:10.290 --> 01:12.870
case so know it in our coffee store.

01:12.870 --> 01:20.820
We need to create all three tables so we can create products customer and Orders table.

01:20.970 --> 01:29.930
So to create a table in my house you know we need to tie creates table followed by the table name.

01:29.940 --> 01:39.270
So let's first create the products table and then we need to open a pair of brackets and we're going

01:39.270 --> 01:42.630
to type more Escudo code within the brackets.

01:42.690 --> 01:44.900
And we always end with a semi-colon.

01:45.450 --> 01:54.060
So let's open the brackets and in here we're going to define our column names and data types.

01:54.120 --> 01:59.640
So the first column name is going to be an ID column and this is going to be the primary key.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.920
So we're going to caller ID and it's going to be a number.

02:02.940 --> 02:08.830
So it's going to be one two three four five etc. with each new entry in the table.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.360
So we want to use the data type.

02:12.360 --> 02:20.150
And then because it's the primary key and we want it to be unique we're going to type auto increment.

02:21.730 --> 02:28.930
And this means that when we insert data into our table it's going to auto increment this ID column so

02:28.930 --> 02:35.360
is the first row will be id one second will be ID to free for 5 five.

02:35.910 --> 02:40.890
And then because this is the primary key column we need to type primary key.

02:41.520 --> 02:48.840
So that's how we define primary keys in the table we just type primary key after the data type and then

02:48.900 --> 02:50.240
end with a comma.

02:50.700 --> 02:55.600
So the second column that we want to have in our products table is the name column.

02:55.630 --> 02:59.350
So this will contain the name of the product sold in our coffee store.

02:59.770 --> 03:07.630
And this is going to be a data type Pocho and we need to define the maximum length.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.500
So let's say 30.

03:09.720 --> 03:16.860
So this will take any string up to 30 characters long and then the final column we want in our products

03:16.860 --> 03:18.900
table is a price.

03:18.900 --> 03:22.710
So this is the price codes for each product.

03:22.990 --> 03:29.620
And this is going to be a Decimal data type and because we're just selling coffee.

03:29.820 --> 03:35.560
The maximum price of a product is not going to be more than 9 9 9.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.600
So we can just type 3 2.

03:39.810 --> 03:46.920
So this will take five used like four point five zero but it won't take values like fifteen point twenty

03:46.920 --> 03:47.990
five.

03:48.630 --> 03:52.640
So that's what we need for our price caught him and then that's it.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.260
That saw table created.

03:55.260 --> 04:01.130
So let's run this statement now and you can see it created the table.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.480
So now let's show the tables

04:09.470 --> 04:11.440
and you can see tables in coffee store.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.770
We have our products table here.

04:14.330 --> 04:19.550
So that's how we create tables in my school we type create table followed by the table name and then

04:19.550 --> 04:24.130
we define all columns and data types and primary keys.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.910
So now we've created our products table.

04:27.080 --> 04:30.490
I want you to create the customers table

04:34.450 --> 04:39.160
so the customers table should have an ID column which will be the primary key as well.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.890
And then will have a first name last name and phone number columns.

04:43.910 --> 04:48.390
So think about which data type each column should have and created that table.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.860
And I'll be along with this solution in a couple of seconds.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.220
OK so hopefully you're able to create the customers table.

05:00.510 --> 05:01.830
And it should have looked like this.

05:01.830 --> 05:07.240
So we should have our ID field as that water increments and is the primary key.

05:07.410 --> 05:13.170
We have a first and last name called home which are both for Charles within the gender column which

05:13.170 --> 05:17.820
is an income which can take male or female so Amorth.

05:18.090 --> 05:24.710
And then finally we have a phone number column which reviews the data type for chawl rather than in

05:24.720 --> 05:30.400
it because although it's made up of numbers it's not really a number in the usual sense.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.040
So we use a cha wave length 11.

05:34.110 --> 05:40.210
So let's run that.

05:40.790 --> 05:45.260
And now we have four tables the customer on the product table.

05:45.260 --> 05:49.660
So finally we need to create orders table orders table.

05:49.670 --> 05:54.430
It's just going to have an ID column and then it's going to have two foreign keys.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.600
So it's going to have a product ID column and a customer id call him and then he's going to have an

05:59.660 --> 06:00.610
order day.

06:01.100 --> 06:10.440
So let's create table orders open our brackets like normal.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.560
So the first column is going to be our ID column is going to be in and it's going to auto increment

06:16.620 --> 06:18.770
and it's going to be our primary key.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.340
So just like for the other tables

06:23.670 --> 06:30.510
and then finished with the comma and then the next column is going to be a product ID column.

06:30.510 --> 06:37.440
So product underscore ID is going to be an event and it's also going to be a foreign key.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.110
So we look at how we can set foreign keys in a minute.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.560
The next column is going to be customer id call them.

06:45.750 --> 06:49.370
And that's also going to be an int and it's also going to be a foreign key.

06:49.740 --> 06:56.480
And then the final column is just going to be in order time for them.

06:56.580 --> 07:00.430
So it's going to hold the time that the order was placed.

07:00.750 --> 07:10.390
And this is going to be a date time data type in case of all our columns for our orders table.

07:10.410 --> 07:14.250
Now we just need to look at how we can set our two foreign keys.

07:14.280 --> 07:22.720
So on the next line we need to type foreign key and then we need to type in a pair of brackets.

07:22.740 --> 07:27.340
We need to type the column name which is going to be a foreign key.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.430
So the first one is going to be our productivity column.

07:30.540 --> 07:34.970
So we need to type products by day.

07:35.940 --> 07:39.080
And then we need to type references.

07:39.300 --> 07:44.400
So this product ID column is going to be referencing another column in another table.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.130
So we need to type the table name.

07:47.250 --> 07:53.720
So it's going to be referencing the products table and then open a pair of brackets within the brackets.

07:53.730 --> 07:59.570
We need to type the column in the products table that this part of the column is going to be referencing.

07:59.610 --> 08:03.070
So it's going to be the ID column in the products table.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.410
So that's how we set foreign keys.

08:05.760 --> 08:12.420
And then let's set the second one so we need to type foreign key again open a pair of brackets.

08:12.930 --> 08:16.310
And this time we need to type customer ID.

08:16.700 --> 08:23.460
So we're going to be the customer I.D. and the orders table and that's going to be referencing the customers

08:23.460 --> 08:28.740
table and the ID column.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.300
So that's how we set phone case.

08:30.300 --> 08:35.800
And now we can run this statement.

08:36.140 --> 08:44.760
We can show the table again and we now have our free tables in our coffee store database.

08:44.870 --> 08:51.230
So we've learned how to create tables in a database and we've finished creating our coffee store database.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.970
So let's move on to the next video.
