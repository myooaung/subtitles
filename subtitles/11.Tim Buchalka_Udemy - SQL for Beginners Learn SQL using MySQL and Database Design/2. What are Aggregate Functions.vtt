00:05.330 --> 00:14.310
So what are actually functions functions before my calculation all and data within a column and it returns

00:14.340 --> 00:16.300
just one result right.

00:16.620 --> 00:22.980
So you can see on the right hand side we have a customer first and last name from our customers table

00:23.310 --> 00:29.090
and you can see when we select staw from the Customers table it returns multiple ways.

00:29.110 --> 00:31.860
So it returns all the customers within our table.

00:32.200 --> 00:38.850
But if we were to perform an aggregate function on this table it would perform a calculation on these

00:38.850 --> 00:41.310
columns and just return one row.

00:41.670 --> 00:50.040
So for example let's say we were to perform the count aggregate function on this column.

00:50.040 --> 00:56.760
This last name column then is going to count the number of rows within the last name column the number

00:56.760 --> 01:00.500
of entries in that last name column and it's going to return one result.

01:00.540 --> 01:03.510
So the number of rows in this table.

01:03.780 --> 01:09.750
So that's for an aggregate function does it performs a calculation on a column and it which returns

01:09.810 --> 01:11.790
just one value.

01:11.790 --> 01:17.010
So you can also use GROUP BY clauses to group the results by one or more columns.

01:17.100 --> 01:20.690
So let's say we wanted to count the number of customers in our customers table.

01:20.850 --> 01:26.940
But we wanted to keep this data by their last name then we use a group by close on the last name column

01:27.330 --> 01:32.130
and for every unique last name is going to tell us how many customers we have.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.720
With that last name.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.710
So you can see in the right hand side the screen shot we have John Smith and Mark Smith.

01:38.860 --> 01:46.350
So if we were to group by last name is going to return Smith with a value of two and any other repeated

01:46.350 --> 01:50.000
last names are going to have a value of more than one.

01:50.220 --> 01:53.940
If there's only one person we that last name then it was just returned 1.

01:54.060 --> 01:59.480
But basically we're to return a value for every unique last name that we have in our customers table.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.290
I mean we're grouping data by column.

02:02.310 --> 02:08.700
We can use the having close in a similar way to how we use the wackos in a select statement.

02:08.700 --> 02:16.790
So having And where are quite similar we say grouped by a caller and having this set some value.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.050
So we're learning more about the having closed later on in this section but that's basically what they

02:21.050 --> 02:26.820
are having closed doors and they aggregate functions that we're going to learn about count some men

02:26.820 --> 02:28.260
Max an average.
