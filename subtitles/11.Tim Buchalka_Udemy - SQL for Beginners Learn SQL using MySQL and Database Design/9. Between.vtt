00:05.580 --> 00:12.130
So in this video we're going to be looking at selecting data from tables where certain data is between

00:12.160 --> 00:13.870
two values.

00:13.870 --> 00:20.370
So here I've selected stuff from the Orders table and you can see we have this all the time column.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.240
So it displays the order time for each order in the table.

00:26.570 --> 00:34.350
But let's say we only wanted it for all the times for the first week of January 2017.

00:34.390 --> 00:40.040
So to do that we could add a WHERE clause and use the between key word.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.200
So let's do that now.

00:42.310 --> 00:49.360
So I've already written selects a product ID customer ID order time from orders and I can add a WHERE

00:49.360 --> 00:52.590
clause here which will have a between statement.

00:52.930 --> 00:58.340
So I can say where all the time is between two values.

00:58.360 --> 01:05.820
So I have to write between now because I want the first week of January I opened single quotes and inside

01:05.850 --> 01:13.650
single quotes I typed 2017 I won I won for the first of January and then I have to have a second value.

01:13.660 --> 01:21.160
So I type and 2017 I won again for January and then 07.

01:21.160 --> 01:29.740
So just the first week of January and I can run that statement on its return some values and you can

01:29.740 --> 01:35.630
see that it's return values whether it would Timon's first generally second third fourth fifth.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.860
And there were no orders on the 7th of January so it didn't return any for that.

01:40.180 --> 01:45.580
But it's just returned values where the all the time is between the first and 7th of January.

01:45.940 --> 01:51.090
And it also includes where the all the time is the first of January.

01:51.090 --> 01:59.970
So we use between Stayman when dealing with Date column but we can also use it for a number of column.

02:00.010 --> 02:05.760
So let's change this order Time column to customer ID.

02:06.640 --> 02:20.030
So still in the Orders table a list type customer id between and let's say between 5 and 10.

02:20.250 --> 02:24.510
So we don't need single quotes because we're dealing with numbers now with let's say where a customer

02:24.510 --> 02:27.660
ID is between 5 and 10.

02:28.080 --> 02:35.880
Let's run this statement and you can see it's only going to return values where the customer ID is between

02:35.880 --> 02:39.120
5 and 10 but it's going to include five and 10.

02:39.120 --> 02:44.640
So always include five and 10 and you can see the others are 6 7 8 and 9.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.940
But there's no other customer IDs returned.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.690
And you can also do it with strings.

02:51.900 --> 02:59.190
So we don't have any strings in order table but I select store from our customer table and you can see

02:59.190 --> 03:03.890
we have first and last name which are strings of words.

03:03.930 --> 03:12.480
So let's say we wanted to select where the last name was between a and L and we can simply add a WHERE

03:12.480 --> 03:15.510
clause to select stuff from customer.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.610
Well last name

03:21.160 --> 03:26.760
is between a and now.

03:26.830 --> 03:34.530
So we have to put it in single quotes and we can run now and you can see it's returned Armstrong blue.

03:34.560 --> 03:40.740
JOHNSON So anyone with a last name that's between NL has been returned.

03:40.960 --> 03:50.040
So this is how we use the between statement in escrow and you can use it for dates numbers or strings.

03:50.050 --> 03:52.910
But it's particularly useful when you're dealing with dates.

03:52.930 --> 04:00.280
You want to get some data between certain dates for a certain month for a certain week or just any two

04:00.280 --> 04:01.620
days.

04:01.690 --> 04:03.220
So that's it for this video.
