A case welcome to this exercise video on the ALTER TABLE statement.

00:11.790 --> 00:17.790
So in this video I have six challenges for you to complete which will cover everything we've learned

00:17.790 --> 00:21.240
so far on the altar table statement.

00:21.510 --> 00:26.760
And then in the next video I'll show you the solutions to each challenge.

00:26.790 --> 00:33.150
So the first challenge I want you to add a primary key to the ID fields in the past and people tables

00:33.930 --> 00:40.920
and then for the second challenge I want you to add a foreign key to the owner ID field in the table

00:41.190 --> 00:44.790
referencing the ID field in the People table.

00:45.120 --> 00:50.130
And then I want you to add a column named email to the People table.

00:50.130 --> 00:55.920
So in this section we didn't actually go through adding columns to a table but in this course we have

00:55.920 --> 00:57.080
been through that before.

00:57.270 --> 01:03.040
So think back further in the course to how you can add a column to a table.

01:03.090 --> 01:07.710
Then I want you to add a unique constraint to the email column in the people's table.

01:09.330 --> 01:16.950
Then I want you to rename the Name column in the pence table to first name and then for the final challenge

01:17.040 --> 01:24.800
I want you to change the post code data type to char 7 in the addresses table so have a go at answering

01:24.800 --> 01:29.730
those six challenges and I'll see you in the next video for the solution to each one.
