A case or in this video we're going to take a look at Joines.

00:08.780 --> 00:10.070
So what is a join.

00:10.100 --> 00:15.270
So Joines allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single select statement.

00:15.500 --> 00:21.800
So so far in our select statements we've just looked at single tables but we're going to be using Joines

00:21.800 --> 00:29.420
to retrieve data from multiple tables and to use a join between two tables that needs to be a related

00:29.420 --> 00:31.950
column between the two tables.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.730
So we sit in our coffee store database in the Orders table we have two foreign keys and these foreign

00:37.730 --> 00:43.010
keys are related to columns in the products and the Customers table.

00:43.250 --> 00:51.770
So we can use these columns to join the Order table with the customer and the products table and there

00:51.770 --> 00:54.540
are many different kinds of joins in my school.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.650
And next we're going to take a look at the most common joins.

00:58.690 --> 01:04.670
So the most common joy in your use though you come across is the inner join and the in a join will retrieve

01:04.670 --> 01:09.930
data from the two tables only when there's matching values in both tables.

01:10.040 --> 01:13.450
So you can see in that diagram here we have Table 1 and Table 2.

01:13.780 --> 01:19.700
And it's only going to retrieve the matching values between both tables which is represented by the

01:19.700 --> 01:22.070
blue circle in the middle here.

01:22.100 --> 01:27.950
So if you have data in table 1 and you're joining the table and is missing values it's not going to

01:27.950 --> 01:31.520
retrieve that data from the table and vice versa.

01:31.540 --> 01:38.510
There's data in table 2 but missing values in Table 1 and in a join will not retrieve that data either.

01:38.870 --> 01:45.680
So when you write your escrow queries for Joins the first table that you select from is Table 1 and

01:45.680 --> 01:48.920
then the second table is Table 2.

01:49.520 --> 01:55.320
So the next type of join is a left join and this will retrieve all the data from table 1.

01:55.370 --> 02:00.240
So the left table and only matching rows from the right table.

02:00.460 --> 02:03.860
So you can see here is represented by this blue square.

02:03.950 --> 02:11.710
So it's going to retrieve all that data from table 1 but only matching data from Table 2.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.670
And then the next type of join is a RIGHT JOIN.

02:14.690 --> 02:20.260
Now this is exactly the same as a left join but the tables are switched.

02:20.270 --> 02:26.090
So right join will retrieve all that data from table to the second table you're joining from in your

02:26.090 --> 02:31.040
escrow query and only matching rows from the left table.

02:31.040 --> 02:37.850
So Table 1 and you can see that's represented by the blue circle in the diagram here.

02:37.850 --> 02:45.680
Now in other databases There's also a full join or an outer join which will retrieve all the data from

02:45.680 --> 02:47.520
table 1 and Table 2.

02:47.520 --> 02:50.220
It doesn't matter if there's missing rows in the table.

02:50.350 --> 02:54.650
It would just retrieve all the data from day one and able to put in my.

02:54.660 --> 02:58.390
Well there's no such thing as a full join.

02:58.820 --> 03:05.450
So now that we know about inner joins and left and right joins let's look at writing escrowed queries

03:05.450 --> 03:07.830
for each one in the next videos.
