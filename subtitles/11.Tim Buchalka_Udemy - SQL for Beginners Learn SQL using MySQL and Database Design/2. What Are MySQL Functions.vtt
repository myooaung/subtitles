In this video we're going to look at what my school functions actually are all so what all my school

00:11.920 --> 00:20.080
functions in my school function is a stored program which you can pass a parameter or multiple parameters

00:20.410 --> 00:22.330
and it's going to return a value.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.900
We have already seen some functions in my school when we looked at aggregate functions and these aggregate

00:29.900 --> 00:33.170
functions acted on numerical data.

00:33.200 --> 00:41.990
So for example we use the max function which took in a colon as a parameter and it returns the largest

00:41.990 --> 00:44.590
value within that column data.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.560
So this is what we mean when we talk about my school functions.

00:48.860 --> 00:56.390
Now string functions are functions that take in string parameters such as cha or Vaugirard data types

00:57.080 --> 01:02.150
and there are many different string functions as you can see from this picture.

01:02.450 --> 01:06.670
And that's only half the number of string functions in my school.

01:06.860 --> 01:11.760
So you can see there's lots and lots of string functions in this section.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.930
We're only going to look at the most important and the most widely used string functions in my school

01:18.710 --> 01:25.200
and date functions taken date time or date time parameters and return a value.

01:25.460 --> 01:31.370
So again you can see there were many date functions in my school and again from this picture.

01:31.380 --> 01:36.440
That's only about half the number of date functions in my school.

01:36.830 --> 01:41.040
But we're only going to look at the most useful ones in this section.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.060
So let's get started with string functions in the next video.
