00:04.730 --> 00:10.250
OK so doing this video we're going to be learning about data types somewhat different sort of data.

00:10.250 --> 00:17.850
You can hold in databases so databases can hold lots of different data types and when you create your

00:17.870 --> 00:21.970
tables in your database you're going to have to define which data type.

00:22.010 --> 00:24.570
Each column within that table can hold.

00:25.190 --> 00:28.490
And there's lots of different data types in my to.

00:28.610 --> 00:32.640
Most of them you will never ever use or come across.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.370
So we're not going to look through all of them.

00:34.370 --> 00:39.560
We're just going to look at the most common data types and the most important data types.

00:39.560 --> 00:45.690
So first let's look at numeric data types and the first data type we look at is it's or integer.

00:46.070 --> 00:49.340
And this is for when you need to store Whole numbers.

00:49.370 --> 00:53.230
So 1 2 3 4 0 negative phone numbers as well.

00:53.570 --> 00:58.430
So a good example of a column which would hold whole numbers is in each column.

00:58.460 --> 01:05.630
So for an age column you'd use the in states type and the next data type is the float data type.

01:05.930 --> 01:08.330
And this is when you need decimal numbers.

01:08.330 --> 01:15.410
So for example if you're storing Height's you'll need to use 1.7 meters for example.

01:15.620 --> 01:22.550
So you have to use float data type and you have to define how and how long that number is.

01:22.550 --> 01:28.070
So if you want to store one point seven eight then it's going to be length 3.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.550
So your end here will be three.

01:31.940 --> 01:37.560
And then you also need to define how many numbers go off of the decimal point.

01:37.670 --> 01:40.810
So for 1.70 you need to.

01:41.130 --> 01:50.030
So for 1.70 you can use the data type Flow 3 to and then the Decimal data type.

01:50.030 --> 01:57.340
Now this is almost exactly the same as a float except you can see it for precise decimal numbers whereas

01:57.350 --> 02:00.290
flow is approximate decimal numbers.

02:00.290 --> 02:04.550
So for a flow it will include rounding.

02:04.880 --> 02:13.790
So to for example if you only allow two decimal places in a float but you a number but you try to get

02:13.810 --> 02:19.970
to a number like six to five then it's going around that last number up two or three.

02:19.970 --> 02:24.910
So 6 3 whereas a Decimal data type will not allow rounding.

02:24.910 --> 02:30.960
So you have to tie only two numbers after the decimal place if that's what you've defined.

02:31.430 --> 02:35.180
So decimal one take types are good for like Price columns.

02:35.180 --> 02:41.180
So something is going to be 10 dollars and 25 cents.

02:41.180 --> 02:49.730
You can use decimal for two for the next let's look at the non-numeric data types so we can also store

02:49.730 --> 02:53.540
words or characters in database tables.

02:53.930 --> 03:01.300
So the first data type we look at is chawl and this is for fixed length characters.

03:01.430 --> 03:09.590
So you use the chart data type followed by a number and any value you try and enter into that column

03:09.590 --> 03:11.560
will have to be that length.

03:11.570 --> 03:18.750
So if you had chaw three every single value in that column would have to have a length of three.

03:19.040 --> 03:30.090
So for example would be a currency column where you could have char three followed by USD GBP JPY etc..

03:30.800 --> 03:33.100
And then the next data type is a vulture.

03:33.260 --> 03:35.750
Now this is for varying length characters.

03:36.020 --> 03:43.520
So again you define the value of the data type followed by a number and it would be out to hold any

03:43.520 --> 03:46.820
string length up to that number.

03:46.820 --> 03:55.030
So if you said for chart 10 it could hold any string with a length up to a maximum 10 characters.

03:55.250 --> 04:02.660
So this is good for names first names and last names for for example next data type is that enough data

04:02.690 --> 04:03.330
type.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.370
And this is for holding values from a defined list.

04:07.370 --> 04:09.850
So you can see in the example here we've got enough.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.540
And then f.

04:11.630 --> 04:21.020
So this is for a gender column say male or female and you'll only be out with two per ever and or aneath

04:21.200 --> 04:24.740
in that column it won't accept any of her values.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.150
So you have to define which values this column can hold.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.300
So yeah it's good for GEND columns always good for yes or no columns as well.

04:34.520 --> 04:41.990
And then last no numeric data type we look at is the Boullion and this is for true or false values.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.900
So how true or false and this is good.

04:44.900 --> 04:51.050
For example if you have a product table you can have an in-stock column and that can be set to True

04:51.050 --> 04:54.550
or false based on whether the product is in stock or not.

04:54.730 --> 04:57.720
Now let's look at data and time data types.

04:57.740 --> 05:01.240
So this is for storing dates and time values.

05:01.250 --> 05:06.750
So the first data type is the date and this holds just yeah yeah yeah yeah.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.260
Month month day day.

05:08.330 --> 05:10.130
So this is good for a date of birth.

05:10.130 --> 05:11.360
Columns.

05:11.360 --> 05:16.580
And then the next date type holds the date plus the time so it holds.

05:16.880 --> 05:17.830
Yay yay yay.

05:17.890 --> 05:23.260
Of day day but also holds our hour and minute minute second second.

05:23.390 --> 05:28.890
So this is good if you have an Orders table and you have all the time.

05:29.030 --> 05:30.930
So the time someone placed an order.

05:31.130 --> 05:31.850
You can have.

05:31.910 --> 05:37.770
You can hold this in a date time data type and next time data type.

05:37.940 --> 05:46.220
So this holds hour hour minute minute second second so it's slightly different from timing the date

05:46.220 --> 05:48.410
time data type.

05:48.410 --> 05:55.840
Because this can hold a value which is more than 20 which is more than ninety nine point nine nine hours.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.620
So not just use four times a day.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.110
It can be used for the time between two events.

06:03.230 --> 06:10.780
So if two events took place more than 100 hours between then you can use the time data type.

06:11.570 --> 06:15.480
And then finally we have the year data type.

06:15.890 --> 06:18.550
And this just holds year so year.

06:18.590 --> 06:19.440
Yeah yeah.

06:19.910 --> 06:28.140
And this is good for things like a film release date so the film released in 1985 for example.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.860
So that's it for data types.

06:30.860 --> 06:33.960
Let's move on to primary and foreign keys.
