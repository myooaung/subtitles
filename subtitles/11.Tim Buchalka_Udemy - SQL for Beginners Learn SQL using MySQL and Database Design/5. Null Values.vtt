A case or in this video we're going to be looking at no values and how we can do with no values in our

00:10.900 --> 00:12.320
table.

00:12.340 --> 00:19.040
So here I have selected stuff from customers and you can see in this phone number called them here.

00:19.150 --> 00:23.950
We have phone numbers into it but we also have missing data.

00:24.010 --> 00:31.390
So for Daniel Williams for example with I.D. for in phone number call home he has no value.

00:31.870 --> 00:37.270
And this could be because he didn't want to provide us with his phone number when he was signing up

00:37.270 --> 00:40.020
to become a customer in the store.

00:40.480 --> 00:48.400
And there can be lots of reasons like this for having missing data in tables but we can make use of

00:48.400 --> 00:52.290
these no values when we are writing or select statements.

00:52.300 --> 01:01.960
So for instance we can select all the columns in our table where a column is equal to no or is not equal

01:01.960 --> 01:03.080
to now.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.650
So let's have a look at how we do this.

01:05.650 --> 01:13.010
So first the let's select staw from our customer table where a phone number is equal to no.

01:13.240 --> 01:19.240
So we're going to retrieve a list of customers which haven't provided us with their phone number and

01:19.240 --> 01:23.550
today that we write select stuff from customers just like here.

01:24.070 --> 01:30.620
And then on the next line we want to type where our column name is equal to no.

01:30.970 --> 01:33.270
So in this case the column name is phone number

01:37.080 --> 01:45.360
and instead of writing a phone number called to know we type where a phone number is no.

01:46.090 --> 01:53.580
So rather than any calls we type is and let's run this and you can see it is written for customers who

01:53.590 --> 02:03.400
can provide us with their phone number and we can also exclude these entries in our results by selecting

02:03.400 --> 02:08.570
from the Customers table where a phone number is not a call to know.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.440
So let's write that statement out.

02:10.450 --> 02:11.050
That's right.

02:11.050 --> 02:14.890
Select store from customers

02:17.170 --> 02:24.460
where the phone number caller is not.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.490
No.

02:25.930 --> 02:30.650
So that's what you have to remember when you're selecting from no values.

02:30.700 --> 02:35.760
You write where the column name is null or whether the column name is not.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.410
No.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.140
Rather than using the calls only calls signs.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.970
So let's run this statement and you can see now in our results.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.870
We no longer have the customers who didn't provide us with a phone number.

02:50.140 --> 02:56.340
So all our customers and the results have phone numbers and that's because we've said where a phone

02:56.350 --> 02:57.990
number is not no.

02:58.390 --> 03:06.520
So this is how we filter with no values in the WHERE clause we write where column name is now or where

03:06.520 --> 03:08.410
column name is not no.
