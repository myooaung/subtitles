A case in this video we're going to be creating screenings table screenings table has a them which is

00:13.000 --> 00:18.580
all prime Mikie which is altering fermenting and then it is the first table we're creating that has

00:18.580 --> 00:19.690
foreign keys.

00:19.930 --> 00:27.100
So the film ID which is an event and the room ID which is in and of by foreign keys and then the final

00:27.110 --> 00:35.980
column is start time which is the starting time of the film and the data type is a date time so each

00:35.980 --> 00:41.800
screening has a certain date and a certain time so we can use the date time data type.

00:42.280 --> 00:47.590
So you can see in the bottom picture that the screenings table has a one to many relationship with the

00:47.620 --> 00:53.870
films table so film can have many screenings but a screening can only show one film.

00:54.310 --> 00:58.310
And theres also a one to many relationship with the rooms table.

00:58.720 --> 01:06.010
So a room can show you many screenings but the screening is obviously only being shown in one room.

01:06.010 --> 01:13.630
So we have a film ID which is a foreign key to the ID field in the films table and we have a room ID

01:13.630 --> 01:17.350
which is a foreign key to the ID field in the rooms table.

01:17.920 --> 01:22.470
So now that I put in my escrow work bench and create the screenings table

01:26.980 --> 01:34.960
each type creates table screenings need to open a pair of brackets finished with a semi-colon and then

01:34.960 --> 01:37.810
within the brackets all columns like usual.

01:37.810 --> 01:48.850
So the first one again is an ID which is an index its primary key and it also increments and finish

01:48.850 --> 01:59.150
out with a comma and then the next column is off film ID which is an index and its not no constraint.

01:59.170 --> 02:01.330
So this needs to be two words.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.610
And then the next column is all remedy.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.480
So this is also an end and it has no constraint.

02:11.110 --> 02:14.930
And then the final column is all start time.

02:15.040 --> 02:23.260
So this is a date time data type and this is also not no constraint.

02:23.380 --> 02:28.780
We need a column comma there because we are going to now add all two foreign keys.

02:28.840 --> 02:35.890
So if you remember two out of four and key on the next line we need to tie foreign key open a pair of

02:35.890 --> 02:38.290
brackets in the pair of brackets.

02:38.290 --> 02:39.790
Enter all column.

02:39.790 --> 02:47.960
So the first foreign key is the film ID and then we want to type references.

02:48.130 --> 02:51.340
So this is the table that we were referencing with the foreign key.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.260
So we were referencing the films table.

02:54.730 --> 02:57.610
And then we need to open a pair of brackets again.

02:57.630 --> 03:03.200
I don't need to type the column in the films table that we were referencing which is the ID field.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.480
So thats all first for OK.

03:05.740 --> 03:13.200
And now we need to get the foreign key for our room ID so to do that again we type for N.K. open a pair

03:13.200 --> 03:18.940
of brackets type my day type references again.

03:19.440 --> 03:27.290
And now were referencing the rooms table and were also referencing the ID field within the Bream's table.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.280
OK so that said for those screening table.

03:30.290 --> 03:33.330
So let's run this escrow statement.

03:33.520 --> 03:45.240
And again we can type show two tables run a query and you can see we now have our fourth table was screenings

03:45.240 --> 03:46.080
table.

03:46.590 --> 03:49.830
And again let's describe this table.

03:50.700 --> 03:54.300
So lets type describe screenings

03:58.020 --> 04:04.920
and run and we can see we have our ID column or film Id ruin my day and I start talking columns we have

04:04.920 --> 04:12.110
the data types they all have to have an entry so none of them can have no values and then we have our

04:12.300 --> 04:18.240
So we have our primary key which all right we feel it and then we have our two foreign keys which is

04:18.410 --> 04:25.440
a film Id call them a room Id call them and basically in my school all this you know in the Keys column

04:25.590 --> 04:33.380
is stands for multiple is not the most clear meaning but basically it means this film ID in this room

04:33.380 --> 04:38.740
Id of foreign keys to columns in different tables.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.130
OK so that's it for the screenings table.

04:41.130 --> 04:43.140
So let's move on to the next video.
