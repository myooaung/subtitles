00:04.890 --> 00:10.320
OK so let's take a look at a third normal form which is going to be the highest level of normalization

00:10.320 --> 00:11.420
that we're going to look up.

00:11.670 --> 00:18.740
And 90 percent of the time this will be the level of normalization that your database will follow.

00:18.750 --> 00:27.330
So for tables to be in third normal form they must conform to second normal form and also every column

00:27.420 --> 00:34.190
that is not a primary key must only be dependent on the whole of the primary key.

00:34.200 --> 00:41.880
So this sounds a little bit like second normal form but every column that's not a primary key must only

00:41.970 --> 00:44.760
be dependent on the whole of the primary key.

00:44.940 --> 00:52.680
So any column which is not a primary key cannot depend on any other column which is not a primary key.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.620
So this sounds pretty complicated.

00:54.660 --> 00:57.840
So let's look at this with an example.

00:58.170 --> 01:06.210
Say we have a table which is storing data on store people for every subject and every year so every

01:06.210 --> 01:12.300
year the school runs a competition to see who the star people with for each subject.

01:12.690 --> 01:18.470
So we have two subjects we have the year we have the student which was the stop people.

01:18.750 --> 01:22.490
And we also have to stop people's date of birth.

01:22.710 --> 01:28.500
So let's check if this is in third normal form both to do that we have to check that it's in second

01:28.500 --> 01:33.290
normal form and to do that we have to check whether it's in first normal form.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.060
So is this table and first normal form.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.190
Well we can see we have no Jupiter rows of data.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.080
Every row here is unique.

01:43.080 --> 01:51.860
We have only one entry for each column so each column only has one value for each row.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.400
And we also have a primary key.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.790
So our primary key is subjects plus year.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.030
So we can't just have subjects because if you see here we have math 2015 math 2016 and we have a different

02:09.030 --> 02:10.920
star people for each year.

02:11.340 --> 02:18.810
And similarly we can't just use year because we can see we have 2015 and two three times 2016 and twice

02:18.900 --> 02:20.810
this year is not unique.

02:20.820 --> 02:27.060
We need the subjects plus the year to be able to uniquely identify each row within this table.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.690
So yes this table is in first normal form.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.160
So let's check if it's in second normal form.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.220
So now we need to check whether every column which is not a primary key.

02:37.260 --> 02:44.040
So this stop people column the stop people date of birth is dependent on the whole of the primary key.

02:44.040 --> 02:49.890
So first let's check stop people and see whether that depends on the hold of the primary key and you

02:49.890 --> 02:51.340
can see that it does.

02:51.420 --> 02:58.070
We can't just say Subject math stop people Muffie tell you to because you can see the full for a down

02:58.080 --> 03:01.390
we have math again again we have a different style people.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.470
We need to say math.

03:03.600 --> 03:08.300
Plus 2015 to get Matthew Taylor and me.

03:08.370 --> 03:11.610
And similarly we can't just say the year we come to say 2015.

03:11.610 --> 03:14.810
Matthew Taylor because we also have 2015.

03:14.820 --> 03:23.430
William Edwards 2015 Georgina's SIMON So we need the subjects plus the year to be able to say who the

03:23.430 --> 03:24.780
star people is.

03:24.870 --> 03:32.370
So they star people call them does depend on the whole of the primary key and not just on separate columns

03:32.370 --> 03:37.760
that make up the primary key and it's the same for the star people date of birth.

03:38.070 --> 03:44.220
We can't say what the date of birth is if we only have the subject so we only have the year we need

03:44.220 --> 03:45.590
to hold up the primary.

03:45.630 --> 03:51.930
We need the subject plus the year to be able to say what the stop people date of birth is.

03:51.930 --> 03:58.730
So both of these columns which are not primary keys do depend on the whole of the primary key.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.940
So we can say that this table is in second normal form.

04:03.120 --> 04:06.600
So now we need to check whether this table was in third normal form.

04:06.660 --> 04:13.770
So to be in third normal form it needs to be in second normal form plus any non primary key column must

04:13.770 --> 04:18.510
be dependent on only the whole of the primary key.

04:18.510 --> 04:25.530
So first let's check out all people mean can see yes this only depends on the primary key subject plus

04:25.530 --> 04:26.490
year.

04:26.670 --> 04:30.550
So it doesn't matter about any other column in this table.

04:30.780 --> 04:36.390
The star people just depends on which subject some which year it was.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.100
So now let's check stop people.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.320
Date of Birth.

04:39.570 --> 04:42.980
Well we know that this does depend on subject plus years.

04:42.980 --> 04:45.170
So the whole of the primary key.

04:45.870 --> 04:50.180
But really it also depends on the style of people.

04:50.190 --> 04:55.400
So the date of birth of the star people obviously depends on who the star people is.

04:55.650 --> 05:04.140
So you have this two step dependency between the whole of the primary key subject plus here and people

05:04.140 --> 05:05.310
date of birth.

05:05.520 --> 05:12.210
So the star pupil is dependent on the whole of the primary key and then the star pupil date of birth

05:12.450 --> 05:14.950
is dependent on the star people.

05:15.360 --> 05:23.100
So we can say that this table is in third normal form because the star people date of birth also depends

05:23.310 --> 05:28.680
on a column which is a known primary key column the star people.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.660
So this table is not in third normal form.

05:32.820 --> 05:38.070
So now the question is how do we make this table follow a third normal form and to do that we need to

05:38.070 --> 05:41.550
split this table into two separate tables.

05:41.670 --> 05:43.470
So the first table was going to look like this.

05:43.470 --> 05:47.550
We have the subject on the year and then we just have to stop people.

05:48.030 --> 05:51.390
So let's check whether this is in first normal form.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.550
So is it in first normal form.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.470
Well yes.

05:54.660 --> 05:58.580
We have no repeated rows of data.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.960
Are all unique.

06:00.090 --> 06:04.340
We have no column which has more than one value for each row.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.030
And we also have a primary K which is subject plus year.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.270
So this table is in first form.

06:11.490 --> 06:14.250
So now we need to check whether it's in second normal form.

06:14.670 --> 06:20.970
So does any known primary key column depend on the whole of the primary key.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.760
So does this stop people column depend on the whole of the primary key.

06:24.960 --> 06:30.950
Well yes it does because we can't just tell by the subject the star people is.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.800
We can't just tell by the year who the star people is.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.290
We need subject plus year so we need physics.

06:37.290 --> 06:44.850
Plus 2015 to be able to tell that it was WM-I puts And we need math plus 2016 to tell that the star

06:44.850 --> 06:46.630
people was Benjamin long.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.180
So this table was in second normal form.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.900
So now we need to check whether it's inferred normal form.

06:53.010 --> 07:01.780
So does any column which is a known primary key column depend on only the whole of the primary key.

07:01.890 --> 07:08.640
So the obvious answer is yes because we only have one column which is non-primary K the star pupil.

07:08.910 --> 07:11.760
So it can only depend on the whole of the primary key.

07:11.760 --> 07:16.480
There's no other non-primary key columns for this column to depend on.

07:16.740 --> 07:20.100
So yes this table is in third normal form.

07:20.370 --> 07:25.540
So now we need to check on a table which is containing the star people's date of birth.

07:25.560 --> 07:30.400
So here we have a table containing stop people and stop people date of birth.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.420
So let's check whether this is in third normal form.

07:33.510 --> 07:40.290
So is it in first normal form where you say is we have no repeated rows of data and every column only

07:40.290 --> 07:42.450
has one value assigned to it.

07:43.020 --> 07:48.900
And we you have a primary key and our primary key is to stop people of color.

07:49.140 --> 07:52.870
So this uniquely identifies each role within table.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.410
So this table was in first of all.

07:55.700 --> 08:03.090
So in second normal form so is the style people date of birth related to the whole of the primary key

08:03.660 --> 08:07.350
while the whole of the primary key is just one column stop people.

08:07.650 --> 08:14.730
And yes the saw people date of birth is dependent on the style people is say yes this table is in third

08:14.730 --> 08:16.000
normal form.

08:16.140 --> 08:19.030
So now we need to check whether it's in normal form.

08:19.170 --> 08:26.910
So third normal form means that any non-primary key is dependent only on the whole of the primary key.

08:27.270 --> 08:30.910
And that's there's only one column which is non-primary key.

08:31.140 --> 08:38.660
Yes the star pupil date of birth only depends on the primary key which is the star.

08:38.670 --> 08:39.700
People call him.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.960
So this table is also in third normal form.

08:43.080 --> 08:48.290
So now our database is in third normal form.

08:48.660 --> 08:54.540
Now as an example of a third normal form I showed you this table with stop people and stop people date

08:54.540 --> 09:01.110
of birth but in reality you wouldn't actually even need this table because any school would already

09:01.110 --> 09:05.170
have a student table we every single student in it.

09:05.280 --> 09:11.900
So you could get the stop date of birth from their students table but for an example of showing you

09:11.910 --> 09:12.940
third normal form.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.390
I included this table as well.

09:15.690 --> 09:19.020
So that's it for the levels of normalization.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.480
Obviously this was a lot of information to take in.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.530
So if you need to re watch these videos then do so.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.640
But for now that's it for normalization.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.000
And we can move on to the next subject.
