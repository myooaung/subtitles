A case to in this video we're going to be looking up the Month function and what the Month function

00:10.680 --> 00:16.550
does is it extracts the month from a date or date time data type.

00:16.740 --> 00:25.110
So you can see here we've got a escrowed query which was similar to that date query in our last video.

00:25.350 --> 00:29.010
So we're just going to select the month from this date.

00:29.520 --> 00:34.270
So if we run this you can see just returned 6.

00:34.290 --> 00:43.570
So this is 2018 June of 0 5 0 6 0 5 and it's just returned the month which is 6.

00:43.710 --> 00:54.700
So June and we can also add a time to this day set aside a 745 32 so it's now a date time data type

00:56.010 --> 01:01.690
and if we run this again you can see it just returned 6 so it just returns the month of June.

01:02.620 --> 01:06.340
So now we've seen what the Month function does on a string.

01:06.340 --> 01:12.160
Let's start using some of our data from those cinema booking system database.

01:12.700 --> 01:24.370
So again less selects start time from screenings start time column in the screenings column is all Wrone

01:25.210 --> 01:28.810
dates in the whole database so we're going to have to use it again.

01:29.230 --> 01:34.980
And you can see returns dates and time as is the date time data type.

01:35.440 --> 01:47.560
But if we were to copy this query and paste it and then apply the function to the start time column.

01:47.610 --> 01:56.550
So I select month from start time from the screenings table.

01:56.970 --> 02:03.880
You can see it just returns the month of October so the month for each entry in the screenings table.

02:04.320 --> 02:13.170
And if we scroll down you can see that all 10 because we only actually have entries for October 2017

02:13.380 --> 02:15.460
in our screenings table.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.340
And we can also use the Month function in the WHERE clause.

02:19.350 --> 02:27.480
So for instance if we needed to know all the screenings from October we can actually write a query where

02:27.480 --> 02:32.760
we can select store from screenings

02:35.070 --> 02:39.720
where month start time

02:43.190 --> 02:47.020
is equal to 10.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.660
So this is where months start time is equal to 10.

02:50.780 --> 02:58.540
So equal to October and you can see it's returned all the screenings data for the month of October.

02:58.550 --> 03:06.110
Now if we had a Pfui years data in our screenings table or in our database we could start using our

03:06.110 --> 03:06.450
money.

03:06.450 --> 03:14.390
So if we wanted to date from April we could change this 10 to a 4 if we wanted it for August we could

03:14.390 --> 03:15.640
change it to an A.

03:15.830 --> 03:23.030
And that's how we can select data by month from tables but we only have data from August from October

03:23.540 --> 03:29.900
so we can only select from screenings where months start time is equal to 10.

03:30.740 --> 03:34.780
And this is a lot simpler than what we were doing before.

03:34.820 --> 03:43.250
I remember I asked you to select some data for the month of October and we would have had to done an

03:43.250 --> 03:50.720
escrow query which contains start time it's between the first of October and the thirty first of October

03:51.350 --> 03:58.100
which is a very long query and you can see here we just need to say where month start time is equal

03:58.100 --> 04:03.080
to 10 and that's going to return all the data from October.

04:03.080 --> 04:11.580
Now imagine if we had years and years of data in our database this month function without she returned

04:12.230 --> 04:19.850
all the data from October not just 2017 but if we had it for the last 10 years it would return it for

04:19.850 --> 04:24.850
2016 2015 2014 cetera et cetera.

04:24.920 --> 04:31.200
Any date that has the month as 10 is going to return that data.

04:31.220 --> 04:34.520
So in the next video we're going to be looking at dealing with the year.
