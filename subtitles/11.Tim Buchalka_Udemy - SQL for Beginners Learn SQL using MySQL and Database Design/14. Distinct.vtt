00:05.300 --> 00:11.180
A case to this video we're going to look at how we can select distinct values from our table so you

00:11.180 --> 00:12.120
can see here.

00:12.140 --> 00:19.080
I selected coffee origin from products and you can see it returned seven values.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.230
So the coffee origin for each of our products.

00:22.620 --> 00:28.090
So you can see we have Colombia Colombia Costa Rica Indonesia FERPA Indonesia for Lanka.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.990
So there's some repeated data here.

00:29.990 --> 00:33.290
We have Colombia twice we have Indonesia twice.

00:33.290 --> 00:41.080
So what if you just wanted to find out how many different types of coffee you're stocking in your store.

00:41.450 --> 00:43.970
So from how many different countries of origin.

00:44.300 --> 00:52.640
Well to do that you can add the distinct keyword in your select statement so you can select this thing.

00:52.670 --> 00:56.010
It's coffee origin from products.

00:56.120 --> 01:04.610
So it's going to select any only distinct values from you from your column name from coffee origin.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.480
So let's run that now.

01:06.590 --> 01:09.770
And you can see it's just returned five values this time.

01:09.770 --> 01:14.600
So it's removed one of the Columbia's and it's removed one of the Indonesians.

01:14.620 --> 01:22.220
So now we just have distinct countries of origin and we can see we stop coffee from five different countries

01:23.420 --> 01:29.060
so we can all see distinct statements and combine it with a where clause.

01:29.210 --> 01:36.290
So you can see here I've selected customer ID from orders where all the time is between the first and

01:36.290 --> 01:39.080
the 28 for February 2017.

01:39.470 --> 01:48.640
So if I select that is going to return each customer ID every time they ordered in February 2017.

01:48.800 --> 01:57.080
So you can see the first order was by custom of 14 and then 10 Xandra and you can see 14 has turned

01:57.080 --> 01:57.560
up again.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.400
So he's come in on a different day and he's ordered another coffee.

02:01.820 --> 02:06.910
So you can see we've got two date in this result as well.

02:07.340 --> 02:14.120
But what if you just wanted to know how many distinct customers bought from your store in February.

02:14.430 --> 02:14.900
Wow.

02:14.900 --> 02:24.500
To do that you can select distinct customer I.D. from orders where order time is between the first and

02:24.500 --> 02:27.500
the 28 for February 2017.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.090
So let's run that now and you can see we still have 14 first and then we have 10 but there's no going

02:35.090 --> 02:40.440
to be no repeated customer IDs in this in this result.

02:40.490 --> 02:47.600
So you can see 14 hasn't turned up again so we've just got distinct customer IDs and we can see who's

02:47.600 --> 02:52.570
ordered in February actually the first order was from customer id one.

02:52.670 --> 03:01.400
So here you see I've only had one one call him but we can also add a second column to our select statement.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.240
Select select distinct customer id Colma Product ID.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.240
So we're going to see which which coffee they ordered and let's see if that changes the result.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.740
So here we have no repeated customer ID.

03:15.790 --> 03:24.170
Now let's select distinct custom ID product ID from orders in February 2017 and you can see here that

03:24.170 --> 03:26.660
we now have.

03:26.670 --> 03:35.810
So the first one is 1 1 and then we have 14 and then 10 20 in the customer ID field but we can see we

03:35.810 --> 03:37.430
have 14 again.

03:37.430 --> 03:44.840
So we have some good customer IDs even though we selected stink customer ID and that's because they've

03:44.870 --> 03:46.860
ordered different products.

03:47.060 --> 03:53.540
So you can see here we selected product idea as well and you can see this is 14:3 and the first one

03:53.540 --> 03:55.400
was 14 2.

03:55.550 --> 03:58.640
So 14:2 and 14:3 are different.

03:58.790 --> 04:08.540
So they're distinct series return both values you know select statement and you can see another example

04:08.540 --> 04:14.790
of this is 8 so we have customer ideate and customer id 8.

04:14.840 --> 04:18.290
But because the product ID is different.

04:18.290 --> 04:21.110
So a 1 and a free.

04:21.120 --> 04:28.880
They've both been returned but let's say Customer ID came in one day and ordered product ID 3.

04:29.360 --> 04:33.710
And then the next day he came and again placed another order for part of 23.

04:34.280 --> 04:40.640
So we have two orders for customer id 8 and 23.

04:40.940 --> 04:47.310
They would not both show up in this statement because they are not distinct.

04:47.480 --> 04:56.240
And similarly here you can see we have repeated product ID so we have put a tidy one here and we have

04:56.240 --> 05:02.570
product ID one here as well but because the customer ID is distinct or different they both show up in

05:02.570 --> 05:09.900
the results this is how we select distinct values from columns in select statements.
