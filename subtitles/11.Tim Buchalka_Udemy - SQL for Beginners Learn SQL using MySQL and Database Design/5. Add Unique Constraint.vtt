A case or in this video we're going to look at how we can add a unique constraint to a column within

00:10.510 --> 00:15.690
a table and how we can then remove a unique constraint from a column.

00:15.700 --> 00:22.630
So if you remember a column with a unique constraint applied to it means that it won't accept any duplicate

00:22.630 --> 00:25.710
values of data within that column.

00:25.780 --> 00:32.990
So you can at the same value twice into that column so you can see here I've typed out vs you over how

00:32.990 --> 00:38.720
to add a unique constraint to a column we type alter table followed by the table name.

00:39.110 --> 00:44.230
And then we type I constrain followed by the name we give to this unique constraint.

00:44.660 --> 00:51.560
Then we type unique followed by the column which we actually want to give the unique constraint in brackets

00:52.400 --> 00:57.800
and then to remove a unique constraint from a column we type out a table again followed by the table

00:57.800 --> 00:58.460
name.

00:58.580 --> 01:05.830
And then we type drop index followed by the constraint name and here I've just run the query select

01:05.840 --> 01:13.310
store from pads and basically what this selects from a table does it returns all the columns and all

01:13.310 --> 01:15.170
the rows of data we have in that table.

01:15.200 --> 01:21.500
So you can see down here we have the ID name species and Onur ID columns from the table.

01:21.860 --> 01:28.970
So just type out select stuff from PEPs and run the and when we created our parts table we didn't add

01:29.000 --> 01:31.500
any unique constraints to any of the columns.

01:31.730 --> 01:33.120
So let's do that now.

01:33.330 --> 01:36.760
It's not a unique constraint to the species table.

01:37.340 --> 01:46.490
So to do that we need to come in here and we need to type out table paths and then on the next line

01:46.490 --> 01:52.050
we can add constraints and just come up with a constraint name.

01:52.060 --> 02:01.760
So let's say you underscore species for unique species then type unique and then type the column name

02:01.760 --> 02:02.680
in brackets.

02:02.690 --> 02:07.900
So it's going to be the species column and then we can end with a semi-colon.

02:08.260 --> 02:10.920
So let's run the query now.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.090
And we now have a unique constraint on the species column within the past table.

02:18.080 --> 02:25.580
So if we try to add repeating rows of data in a species column let's say we wanted to add Dawk twice

02:25.580 --> 02:29.730
or twice it wouldn't actually let us do this.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.900
We can only have unique values now.

02:33.060 --> 02:37.520
And since it doesn't really make sense to have a unique constraint on the species column within the

02:37.530 --> 02:41.380
past table let's now remove that unique constraint.

02:41.750 --> 02:50.780
So we need to type 0 to table followed by the table name so pass and then we need to type drop in index

02:51.650 --> 02:58.440
followed by the constraint name which is you underscore species and then we can just run this query

03:00.720 --> 03:05.180
and we've now got rid of the unique constraint from this column.

03:05.230 --> 03:10.780
So that's it for adding unique constraints to a column and removing any constraints to a column.

03:10.810 --> 03:15.670
The only difficult thing to remember is that when you're removing a unique constraint you type drop

03:15.790 --> 03:20.630
index rather then drop unique or drop constrain.

03:20.630 --> 03:22.970
So now let's move on to the next video.
