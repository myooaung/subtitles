A case or in this video we're going to look at how we can delete all data from a table.

00:11.750 --> 00:16.660
So here we created the test table again with the ID name and age column.

00:16.750 --> 00:23.290
I've inserted some data I've been searching three rows so you can see here we have Ben Simon and Claire

00:23.330 --> 00:25.360
and their ages.

00:25.760 --> 00:32.280
So we just have three rows of data in our test table and now we're going to delete these free rows.

00:32.510 --> 00:41.770
So to delete all rows of data from a table we need to type truncate table followed by the table name.

00:41.770 --> 00:50.990
So in this case is test and that's run now and then select staw from test.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.260
And you can see the returns the table.

00:53.270 --> 01:00.040
So we haven't deleted the table from that database but we have none of the data in the table so I deleted

01:00.040 --> 01:02.760
those 3 rows of data that we had.

01:02.920 --> 01:09.770
And basically what the truncate table statement is doing is dropping the table from the database or

01:09.880 --> 01:16.750
deleting the test table from the example database and then creating a table again.

01:16.750 --> 01:23.950
So it's running a drop table test and then it's running a create table test with the free columns and

01:23.950 --> 01:28.780
the data types and the primary key but there's no inserting the data back in.

01:28.780 --> 01:35.150
So that's how we delete all the data from a table using truncate table statement.
