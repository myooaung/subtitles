WEBVTT

00:05.290 --> 00:11.030
In this video we're going to go ahead and install the Marsico database server on a Windows machine.

00:11.030 --> 00:16.070
So if you're not running Windows move onto the next video or the one after that where I show you how

00:16.070 --> 00:17.170
to do the same thing.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.230
But for Mac or Linux machine.

00:19.310 --> 00:23.050
But if you're using Windows you're in the right place so let's continue.

00:23.490 --> 00:31.640
So the first thing we want to do is go to the Web site Dave Marsico dot com.

00:31.850 --> 00:32.060
Tim

00:36.790 --> 00:43.270
once we get there when you click on My sequel downloads you want to come here and click on my Sakal

00:43.270 --> 00:51.650
on Windows and then we want to click on my Seacole install and that's keeping the option here that if

00:51.650 --> 00:56.150
you've got an online connection while running the bicycle installer to choose a version of the web version

00:56.150 --> 01:00.800
which is much smaller or if you don't have an online connection to use the installer which is the full

01:00.800 --> 01:06.350
product I suggest you just grab the full product because it makes it a little bit easier and you can

01:06.350 --> 01:07.500
just install it.

01:07.620 --> 01:13.160
But depending on which option you want to choose select that in my case I'm going to choose the second

01:13.160 --> 01:13.890
one.

01:14.170 --> 01:17.490
I just going to stop that and I'm just going to talk about something else.

01:17.510 --> 01:23.810
And by the by asking whether we want to set up an oracle web account because our own mighty Marsico

01:23.810 --> 01:27.490
product or log in we can click on I think to start my download.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.460
So just stop that downloading.

01:30.580 --> 01:34.670
It starts when I actually go back a few times.

01:34.690 --> 01:40.510
I just want to show you how to click on the Marsico installer option here it actually said my second

01:40.510 --> 01:47.210
install is 32 bit but will install by 32 and 64 bit boundaries and intimate and I'm going to show you

01:47.450 --> 01:50.690
when we get to the installation prices had to select that.

01:50.750 --> 01:57.440
So what you will need to know is whether your Windows machine is running a 32 or 64 bit version of Windows

01:58.250 --> 02:03.350
and you can generally find that in about in the control panel to see whether you're actually running.

02:03.350 --> 02:05.970
So let's quickly do that while we're waiting for this to download.

02:05.970 --> 02:12.110
They're going to go into the control panel and you can normally go into the back by searching for about

02:12.500 --> 02:18.530
and ordinarily depending on your version of Windows it'll tell you system top 64 bit operating system.

02:18.530 --> 02:24.230
So not so much concerned about the processor because it is possible to have a 32 bit version of Windows

02:24.260 --> 02:29.780
running the operating system with a 64 bit version with a 64 bit processor.

02:29.780 --> 02:34.180
So we actually want to tie this Bihi the 64 bit operating system so you only tonight whether you're

02:34.190 --> 02:37.790
running the 32 or 64 bit version.

02:37.820 --> 02:40.590
So you saw how I checked that information on Windows 10.

02:40.760 --> 02:45.710
If you're running an old version of Windows you can generally find that in the system part of control

02:45.710 --> 02:51.200
panel there'll be a screen similar to this one you can find out which version of Windows you're running

02:51.200 --> 02:53.390
a 32 or 64 bit edition.

02:53.450 --> 03:00.000
And again Onate that we get to the stage of installing Marsico We're also going to pause the video and

03:00.220 --> 03:03.420
come back once it's fully downloaded and continue the installation.

03:04.870 --> 03:07.700
OK so we can we can say that the installation has completed.

03:07.870 --> 03:12.740
So no we need to open the file that we've downloaded so I'm just going to select Open and he obviously

03:12.740 --> 03:13.940
you never get to the folder.

03:13.990 --> 03:18.000
If your browser doesn't give you the option to open it from there like I've just done and that's going

03:18.010 --> 03:23.920
to stop the install I'll give that a moment click on yes and it pops up to set to say that to allow

03:23.920 --> 03:26.660
this app to make changes to your machine.

03:26.710 --> 03:32.060
The installation will then proceed and may pop up again and ask you to allow this app to make changes.

03:32.120 --> 03:37.000
In my case it did pop that twice and then you get to the license agreement.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.550
So when I click on it I accept the license terms and click on next and then we get this option or we

03:42.550 --> 03:44.890
can choose the set up top.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.050
No other is ready.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.930
Buttons here to the left and to the right it gives you a description of what it's actually going to

03:49.930 --> 03:50.670
install.

03:50.860 --> 03:56.140
So you can see the first option that installs is Marsico sever the toes required for application development

03:56.510 --> 04:04.180
because server idli does just that installs only the SQL Server Client option going to full option but

04:04.180 --> 04:08.940
to the option we kind of select is the custom option so that we're installing the things that we need

04:08.950 --> 04:09.610
for this cause.

04:09.610 --> 04:14.240
I'm going to click on custom and I'm going to click on next.

04:14.260 --> 04:17.710
Once we've done that we get this screen here where you can see to the left hand side there's a list

04:17.710 --> 04:22.930
of available products and the right hand side has a list of the products that are to be installed.

04:22.930 --> 04:26.130
Currently that's empty because we haven't selected anything yet.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.180
We're going to come out here first and then click on the plus four to the left of music with services

04:31.270 --> 04:34.020
and clicking on the plus click on again.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.460
And eventually we get the option.

04:35.710 --> 04:42.080
And I mentioned on the previous screen that the installable installed by 32 and 64 bit versions.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.820
And in fact you can see there that it does say that.

04:43.820 --> 04:46.350
So you can say that both versions are available.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.320
So I got back to my second again.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.040
You want to install only the version that's appropriate for your operating system.

04:53.080 --> 04:58.000
And again if you recall we went through to determine which top of operating system whether it's a 62

04:58.000 --> 05:00.550
or 34 version for your computer.

05:00.700 --> 05:06.100
In my case mine is 64 bit so I'm going to select the x 6 4 and click on the arrow to make it cross to

05:06.100 --> 05:07.090
the right hand side.

05:07.270 --> 05:09.060
So that's now going to be installed.

05:09.190 --> 05:14.530
The next thing we want to do is come out of the two applications on the plus again we want to select

05:14.590 --> 05:21.990
Marsico workbench click on the plus and click on the plus again to type in the version and we can see

05:22.000 --> 05:29.170
there is also a 64 bit on the 32 bit version so I'm going to select the 64 bit again and move that either.

05:29.350 --> 05:33.370
And by the way the version numbers might change depending on when you're watching this video or it might

05:33.370 --> 05:38.360
be a lighter version but the principle is still the same to select the relevant version and deselect

05:38.430 --> 05:41.800
of the 64 bit or 32 bit version.

05:42.010 --> 05:45.070
What's at this point now we've selected the only two products we need.

05:45.310 --> 05:51.740
So I'm going to click on next week and click on execute and that's going to start the installation of

05:51.740 --> 05:54.200
by products onto this computer.

05:54.400 --> 06:00.160
And once that's finished we need to get real configuration step to set up usernames and so on and so

06:00.160 --> 06:00.500
forth.

06:00.510 --> 06:01.680
So I'll post the video.

06:01.840 --> 06:07.610
We'll come back once this is complete OK so it's not finished installation I'm going to click on next

06:08.710 --> 06:09.340
the next.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.270
It's telling us that it needs to go through and configure the product.

06:12.330 --> 06:18.670
So when I click on next and that will bring up the configuration options and configuration top he will

06:18.680 --> 06:22.720
we can select various different options but we're going to leave that default up development machine

06:22.720 --> 06:26.040
since that's exactly what we're doing here we're using it as developers.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.850
Now in terms of the port I'm going to leave it on the default number.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.720
It needs to be a unique port number that's not used anywhere else.

06:34.020 --> 06:37.110
It's not used for another application on this computer.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.540
So three three or six will be fine for a remote computer so normally that will work for your computer

06:41.540 --> 06:42.730
as well.

06:42.730 --> 06:46.820
Most of the defaults or I call you don't need to change anything or say click on next.

06:47.230 --> 06:53.500
Next it's asking is for what the root password is now the root account is created automatically by my

06:53.500 --> 06:59.530
Seacole and is a lock on that is the most powerful user in the system and generally speaking it's good

06:59.530 --> 07:04.480
to use that username and password very sparingly when you know you know when you really need to do some

07:04.480 --> 07:06.640
sort of super administrative tasks.

07:06.910 --> 07:10.810
So what we've got to do is a sort of password for which we need to do.

07:10.990 --> 07:15.460
But then we're going to create a new user that we're going to be using for our database of my cynical.

07:15.790 --> 07:19.840
So you want to enter a password that is hard to guess and is quite secure.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.250
So I'm going to put in a password

07:27.370 --> 07:32.070
and tells me that the strength is medium so you might want to work on that and create a longer password.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.590
So it is very secure and a strong password but to medium is probably a reasonable choice.

07:37.970 --> 07:40.740
But so the next thing we need to do is click on use.

07:41.400 --> 07:46.740
We're going to create a user as I mentioned that we're going to be using and we're use in this course

07:47.380 --> 07:55.070
top in the name of the user are going to call this one Divx user but you can call it literally whatever

07:55.070 --> 07:57.600
you lock in terms of the host.

07:57.670 --> 08:03.320
We're going to change that to Likewise most importantly so that ensures that Lenni can only be used

08:03.320 --> 08:04.520
locally which is appropriate.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.010
We only want to be using this username locally.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.990
We don't want access from any external source.

08:10.130 --> 08:13.520
We leave the role as TB or admin and that's generally the default.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.700
There's other options you can choose here but I'm not going to change any of that I'm going to leave

08:16.700 --> 08:17.910
it on admin for now.

08:18.260 --> 08:23.390
And we also need to enter a password for this or do you suggest should make it different to the user

08:23.900 --> 08:26.870
and we need to remember that because we are going to be using that in this course.

08:26.980 --> 08:27.640
So I'm going to interrupt

08:36.390 --> 08:40.140
this case you can say I've got a strong password so probably I should have done that the other way round

08:40.140 --> 08:42.410
and made the past with the really strong one.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.610
But in any event you can change that later if need be.

08:44.610 --> 08:46.720
But I'm going to accept that as the default.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.960
And you can see down the bottom now that we've got a single use and I'm set up as well.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.320
So no it doesn't happen.

08:52.320 --> 08:58.440
Click on next and it's now wanting to know what some configuration and whether we want to set this up

08:58.440 --> 09:00.420
as a service to run on Windows.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.640
So we're going to accept all the defaults to that and click on next.

09:04.690 --> 09:11.010
You know the plugins and extensions us screens popped up as you can see he says is related to a no sequel

09:11.010 --> 09:15.630
based development which we're not working on using in this course so I'm going to accept all the defaults

09:15.630 --> 09:22.890
and click on next and I'm going to click on execute and start the process of configuring my sequel on

09:22.890 --> 09:23.750
this computer.

09:24.800 --> 09:29.410
Southpaws Now last year was very deports but you can see it's already finished that it was pretty quick.

09:29.410 --> 09:31.750
So we're going to click on finished now.

09:31.760 --> 09:38.300
Our next and he can say we know time and leave the checkbox on start Mustique workbench I have to set

09:38.300 --> 09:39.040
up.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.690
That's because we want to run that just to confirm the installations.

09:41.690 --> 09:47.890
OK so you can finish replace the browser down.

09:48.050 --> 09:53.750
Now what we want to do is before we actually check that is we want to go into services on this computer

09:53.750 --> 09:56.870
just to make sure the service has been installed successfully.

09:56.990 --> 10:02.940
I click on the stop button and click on settings and I'm going to just do a search for services.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.500
So you just go to where your normally configured services now.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.680
Sometimes depending on the version of Windows to get to where you've got to you might actually have

10:09.680 --> 10:10.970
to do it a different way.

10:10.970 --> 10:15.180
You might have to go into a control panel administrative tools and services.

10:15.300 --> 10:20.840
In any event you want to get there and once you've done that one to school on down here and to get to

10:20.840 --> 10:26.240
my Seacole and it's usually in alphabetical order there's more sequel and you can see in this case it's

10:26.240 --> 10:28.160
actually running automatic.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.450
That's a good sign the fact that it's running tells us that the my secret service has been successfully

10:32.450 --> 10:36.870
installed and it's actually running and what to do now just quickly show you you can actually write

10:36.950 --> 10:41.140
this if your computer is low on resources you haven't got a lot of memory.

10:41.300 --> 10:46.340
You can change it so instead of it starting automatically every time the computer starts you can right

10:46.350 --> 10:52.210
click that and going into properties and you could for example make that menu click on OK.

10:52.390 --> 10:56.960
And what that would mean is that they won't start automatically each time you turn the computer on so

10:56.960 --> 10:58.510
you could actually stop the computer.

10:58.620 --> 11:02.680
And if you just saw you doing some development in this course you could just come over to here.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.980
Go into services and click on start.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.070
And that would start for that particular session.

11:07.370 --> 11:10.340
But in my case I'm happy to have this run automatically.

11:10.340 --> 11:11.340
I've got enough resources.

11:11.340 --> 11:15.770
I'm going to click on automatic so that every time I report the computer my sickle was available for

11:15.770 --> 11:16.730
me or not.

11:16.730 --> 11:22.040
So if confirmed that's running I case I closed that down and I could just quickly came back into services

11:22.040 --> 11:22.380
again

11:26.790 --> 11:30.800
the other thing was it for some reason probably everyone figured this out anyway.

11:30.930 --> 11:35.590
But for some reason that wasn't running you could just click on start to make sure that it was started

11:35.590 --> 11:38.450
or stopped at the start or it is a restart option as well.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.570
You could try one of those if you had some difficulty starting it up for whatever reason.

11:41.580 --> 11:45.000
But generally the installation should work for most people.

11:45.450 --> 11:45.760
All right.

11:45.780 --> 11:50.970
Getting back now to the Marsico weapons that started automatically once Marsico was installed.

11:50.990 --> 11:56.220
I want to stop clicking on this like Winston so click on that and that brings up this screen that's

11:56.220 --> 12:00.840
asking for the root use and I'm going to Tarpeian that reason I'm that I signed earlier in the video

12:03.360 --> 12:04.880
and I'm going to choose not to cite it.

12:04.920 --> 12:09.380
You could choose site the password if you like but for security reasons I prefer not to do that kind

12:09.400 --> 12:10.110
of OK.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.990
And this is I picked up which is a good sign that we got the password correct.

12:15.010 --> 12:21.450
Come over here and click on service status that gives us a bit of an of you the fact that it's actually

12:21.450 --> 12:26.320
running as you can see the number of connections but all of this is we have actually got some connections

12:26.400 --> 12:31.730
because of the installation and a bit of traffic and all these efficiency things and bits and pieces.

12:31.900 --> 12:36.420
But obviously that won't be a lot happening at the moment and that's because we haven't really started

12:36.420 --> 12:37.460
using it yet.

12:37.880 --> 12:42.300
But bearing in mind that we are actually wiping the database because we've used more sequel to actually

12:42.300 --> 12:43.110
do that.

12:43.170 --> 12:46.050
Case you're wondering where the connections are actually coming from.

12:46.050 --> 12:50.940
You can come over here and click on users and privileges and that will confirm the list of users so

12:50.940 --> 12:55.730
you can see that we had the root account which was sort of automatically created for us.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.120
And those are the user account that we created.

12:59.160 --> 13:03.810
Right I click on the view you know from the view menu and select time we'll get back to where we were

13:04.560 --> 13:08.880
never going to come over here and click on this little wrench to the right of the Pusong which is managing

13:08.880 --> 13:13.590
connections that should open up to some little screen here so you can say to the left there we've got

13:13.660 --> 13:16.410
to manage sever connections.

13:16.710 --> 13:23.160
So I'm going to click on this like instant spot 657 I'm going to click on test connection and it's been

13:23.290 --> 13:28.890
a password that Republicans are going to top that in.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.880
And you can see they have successfully made the musical connections.

13:31.880 --> 13:37.100
That tells us that Marcy was working correctly and were able to connect to the database and that obviously

13:37.100 --> 13:41.010
is going to serve us well in a future video when we start using my school.

13:41.240 --> 13:41.910
So that's.

13:42.010 --> 13:48.710
We're going to click on close robot and let's click on the pluses Tony are going to add a new connection.

13:48.710 --> 13:51.480
We're going to add on the connection for what we're going to be using in this course.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.550
Complex and the connection fine.

13:54.830 --> 13:57.810
I'm just going to call it development but you can call it whatever you like.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.180
And we're going to change the user name instead of root.

14:01.230 --> 14:05.230
We're going to change that to the user name we created between dev user.

14:05.560 --> 14:10.820
So I'm going to click on test connection then I'm going to enter they use the password rather for this

14:10.820 --> 14:12.780
particular use name that we've set up.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.250
Remembering that this isn't the right use that this is the other user of

14:19.010 --> 14:20.220
I click on i.

14:21.140 --> 14:25.920
And you could say we made a successful connection that tells us that the username and password are valid

14:26.370 --> 14:31.210
and we could do that and click on Tai-Chi then importantly click on OK to edit user.

14:31.290 --> 14:35.580
We've now got a second connection configured under the Marsico connections we're going to be able to

14:35.580 --> 14:40.680
use that in the course so I'm going to finish the video here and now we're actually done in the next

14:40.680 --> 14:42.020
video as I mentioned at the start.

14:42.030 --> 14:44.670
It's actually a video for Mac users.

14:44.730 --> 14:49.770
So if you just install this on Windows and you haven't got a Mac and or a Linux machine you can skip

14:49.770 --> 14:55.440
the next one or two videos and move onto the video after that where we actually start working with this

14:55.440 --> 14:57.460
database that we've just installed and configured.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.070
So I'll see you in that next video.
