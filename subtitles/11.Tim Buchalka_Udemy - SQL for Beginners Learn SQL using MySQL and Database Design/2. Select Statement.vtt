00:05.300 --> 00:10.560
My case too in this video we're going to learn how to write a simple select statement to retrieve some

00:10.560 --> 00:14.000
data from a coffee store database.

00:14.040 --> 00:20.140
So we've already said that we can select store from a table and it will retrieve all the rows from the

00:20.190 --> 00:27.780
table so that Sadak store from customers just to show you that again and run that statement and we've

00:27.780 --> 00:35.100
retrieved all the data in our customer table but we can also select just one column if we want.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.870
So we can type select an end instead of staw.

00:38.910 --> 00:45.640
We can name the column select select last name from customers

00:51.960 --> 00:59.040
and just return just the last name call them from our customer table and we can also select as many

00:59.040 --> 01:01.690
columns as we will in one statement.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.410
So let's do that now.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.480
So we type selects and then we type paw.

01:07.710 --> 01:15.400
Call them names again and we just have to call my separate them select select last name and phone number

01:19.050 --> 01:20.360
from customers.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.880
And you can see we've retrieved both columns from our customer table.

01:31.060 --> 01:37.520
So all you have to do is call a separate each call and you can select as many as you want.

01:37.540 --> 01:42.120
So we've learned how to write simple select statements to retrieve data from a table.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.260
Let's move on to the next video.
