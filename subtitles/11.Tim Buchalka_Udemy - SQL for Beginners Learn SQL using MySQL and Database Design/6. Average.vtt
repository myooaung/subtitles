00:05.400 --> 00:10.960
So the final aggregate function that we're going to look at is the average aggregate function and this

00:10.960 --> 00:14.630
returns the average value in a given column.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.570
So it's going to sum up all the values in that column and then it's going to divide that value by the

00:19.570 --> 00:24.100
number of entries in that column to return the average value.

00:24.100 --> 00:30.820
So let's say we wanted to find the average length of all the films that we're showing we can use the

00:30.820 --> 00:34.270
average aggregate function on the length from one column.

00:34.300 --> 00:45.490
So let's write that now we can write select a Viji for average length on the school main for the column

00:46.240 --> 00:47.340
from films

00:50.660 --> 00:52.120
and then run that query.

00:52.360 --> 01:00.340
And you can see our average length for our films in our database is 115 minutes point zero or a free

01:00.340 --> 01:00.860
free.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.660
So basically just under two hours for the average length of the films the cinema is showing.

01:07.120 --> 01:12.960
So this is where you return the average length of the average value for a column.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.810
We can also add where clauses when my using average aggregate functions.

01:17.980 --> 01:26.500
So let's say we wanted to any slack the average length of films if all films are over two hours long.

01:26.500 --> 01:35.740
So let's select average length men from films and let's add a WHERE clause let's say where length men

01:36.850 --> 01:39.570
is greater than one hundred and twenty minutes.

01:39.580 --> 01:47.050
So greater than two hours we can run up and we now have an average value of a hundred and thirty four

01:47.050 --> 01:48.130
minutes.

01:48.130 --> 01:52.850
So is any taking into account films which are over in 20 minutes.

01:52.900 --> 01:59.740
It seems that length's up and divided by the number of films and has returned to value an average value

02:00.100 --> 02:02.730
of 134 minutes.

02:02.770 --> 02:06.660
So this is how we use average aggregate functions.

02:06.670 --> 02:08.740
Now let's move on to the next video.
