00:05.330 --> 00:12.420
OK so hopefully you are able to have an attempt at the six challenges in lost video.

00:12.420 --> 00:16.230
Now let's take a look at the solutions to each challenge.

00:17.820 --> 00:25.730
So the first question was asking us to other primary key to the ID fields in the pets and people tables.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.310
So to add a primary key we want to type out a table followed by the table name.

00:31.320 --> 00:41.340
So let's first do the table and then on the next line we want to type as the primary key followed by

00:41.460 --> 00:42.180
the column.

00:42.180 --> 00:46.950
So in this case is the ID column and I'm finished with the semi-colon.

00:46.950 --> 00:48.540
We can run this stateman

00:52.010 --> 01:03.260
and then we can describe the pets table and if we run that as well we can now see that the ID field

01:03.350 --> 01:04.640
is a primary key.

01:05.820 --> 01:13.500
And to add a primary key to all ID field in the people's table we simply just need to come in here and

01:13.500 --> 01:21.930
instead of typing past the table name type people run the statement and add our primary key to the ID

01:21.930 --> 01:23.880
field in the People table.

01:23.880 --> 01:30.630
I'm not going to run the statement now because I've actually already got my ID field as a primary key

01:30.630 --> 01:32.400
in the People table.

01:32.550 --> 01:39.470
If we describe people you can see that the ID field is already a primary key.

01:39.510 --> 01:45.630
But if you haven't set your ID field in the People table to be a primary key please run this escrow

01:45.670 --> 01:45.990
same.

01:45.990 --> 01:48.900
Now because we're going to need it in the next challenge.

01:49.350 --> 01:56.280
OK so the second question was asking us to add a foreign key to the ID field in the table.

01:56.520 --> 02:00.420
That's referencing the ID field in the People table.

02:00.780 --> 02:07.920
So we can come in here and we can type out to a table and we want to be altering the table so outer

02:07.970 --> 02:12.660
table pass and then on the next line we can add the constraint name.

02:12.720 --> 02:24.120
So a foreign key constraint name and let's call it f k underscore path's owner and then on the next

02:24.120 --> 02:33.990
line we need to type for and K and end in brackets the column which we want to set for N K.

02:33.990 --> 02:41.220
So in this case is the ID from the stable and we want to type references.

02:41.220 --> 02:48.960
So this IRNA ID column is going to be referencing the people table and it's going to be referencing

02:48.960 --> 02:51.370
the ID column in The People table.

02:51.390 --> 03:03.640
So we need to type people in brackets ID we need to run that statement now and then if we describe pets

03:03.790 --> 03:04.470
again

03:07.160 --> 03:12.440
we can see now the only ID field is indeed a foreign key.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.520
So this is how we add foreign keys on the table by the table name.

03:16.520 --> 03:24.800
I constrain followed by the constraint name foreign key the foreign key column references table name

03:24.800 --> 03:32.920
column name and then the third challenge was to add a column named email to the people table so we can

03:32.920 --> 03:42.070
come in here and we can type out table people and then on the next line to add a column we simply need

03:42.070 --> 03:45.860
to type add column followed by the column name.

03:45.910 --> 03:49.770
So email followed by the data type of this new column.

03:49.780 --> 03:53.480
So for an email column is going to be a vulture.

03:53.890 --> 03:56.720
And then let's set that to length 20.

03:56.780 --> 03:58.830
So maximum length of 20.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.220
So let's run that statement.

04:04.220 --> 04:10.220
And let's describe people who again so you can see that it's made to change and you can see now we have

04:10.220 --> 04:13.520
an email column with fotch or 20.

04:13.700 --> 04:22.380
Now it doesn't matter if you had vulture 30 or 10 as long as you set the email data type to avouch or

04:22.730 --> 04:23.710
that's all that matters.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.220
If you set it to chaw.

04:25.580 --> 04:30.860
And that's not really correct because an email can obviously be any length.

04:30.860 --> 04:40.130
So we really need the email data type to be of our char and then the fourth challenge was to add a unique

04:40.130 --> 04:45.740
constraint to the email column in the people's table in the people table.

04:45.850 --> 04:51.050
So to add a unique constraint we need to type alter table we're again followed by the table name so

04:51.080 --> 04:52.050
people.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.820
And then on the next line we need to type add constraints followed by the constraint name.

04:58.850 --> 05:06.250
So for unique constraints we like to type you underscore followed by a name.

05:06.520 --> 05:14.090
So let's call it you underscore email and then we need to type unique and then in brackets we need to

05:14.090 --> 05:15.700
type the column name.

05:15.740 --> 05:27.110
So it's the email column and then we can run this statement and then if we describe it to describe people

05:27.110 --> 05:27.610
again

05:31.930 --> 05:35.080
you can see the email column is now unique.

05:35.440 --> 05:41.830
So the challenge was to rename the name column in the table to first name.

05:41.830 --> 05:49.210
So to do that we need to come in here and type o to table follow up by the table names so pass and then

05:49.210 --> 05:54.190
we need to change and then back.

05:54.210 --> 05:59.880
So not single quotes impact ticks we need to type the original name of the column.

05:59.890 --> 06:06.950
So in this case it was name and then a space and then in takes the new name of the column.

06:07.090 --> 06:13.920
So the new name is going to be first name and then we need to type the data type.

06:14.170 --> 06:17.480
So for a name we can make it a vulture.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.730
And then let's just say Volle Cha with a maximum length of 20.

06:22.180 --> 06:24.950
So let's run this query

06:27.930 --> 06:38.790
and then let's descry pass and you can see the name column is now first name followed by the data type

06:38.790 --> 06:40.440
which was Varco 20.

06:40.950 --> 06:48.240
And then the final challenge in this section on altering tables was to change the post code data type

06:48.630 --> 06:53.000
to char 7 in the addresses table.

06:53.100 --> 06:59.850
So to change a column's data type we need to type out a table followed by the table name.

06:59.850 --> 07:07.620
So in this case it's addresses first time using the addresses table in this China-U.S. and then we need

07:07.620 --> 07:13.290
to type modify and we need to type the column.

07:13.290 --> 07:20.020
So in this case we want to be changing the postcode column and then the new data type.

07:20.070 --> 07:35.940
So char 7 finished it with a semi-colon run this statement and then if we describe the addresses table

07:39.260 --> 07:47.680
so run describe it dresses we can see the post code column now has a data type of char 7.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.940
Originally it was 47.

07:51.160 --> 07:54.920
So that's it for this challenge section on altering tables.

07:55.030 --> 08:00.970
If you were able to get each challenge correct the first time then fantastic.

08:01.060 --> 08:08.260
That's really good if you didn't then don't worry just go through this solution video.

08:08.290 --> 08:15.910
Again if you need to make sure you understand and are able to answer each question now and if you have

08:15.910 --> 08:22.900
any questions on this China-U.S. please ask in the Q and A section and I'll be out to respond to you

08:22.900 --> 08:23.500
there.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.030
So now let's move on to the next section.
