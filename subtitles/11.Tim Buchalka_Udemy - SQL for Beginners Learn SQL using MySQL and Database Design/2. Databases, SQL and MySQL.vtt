00:05.290 --> 00:09.850
So in this video we're going to learn about databases as you go on my ask.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.180
You know so what is a database.

00:13.210 --> 00:19.570
A database is defined as an organized collection of information or data.

00:19.630 --> 00:26.960
So an example of a database could be a book like the yellow pages or even just the index of a book.

00:27.280 --> 00:35.050
So here you can see a snapshot of example index of a book and you can see it has information and has

00:35.050 --> 00:36.010
data.

00:36.010 --> 00:42.640
So we have the topics covered by the book and we have the page number that those topics are on and we

00:42.640 --> 00:47.670
can see is organized because it's organized alphabetically it is.

00:47.950 --> 00:55.120
So if we wanted to find out about binding we know we can go to the index we can look under B we can

00:55.120 --> 00:59.390
find binding and then we can go to page 20.

00:59.500 --> 01:04.350
So an index works well as an example of organized collection of data.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.860
But what if we want to interact with the data held in a database.

01:08.950 --> 01:16.510
Well that's where you go and database management systems come in and a database should also allow us

01:16.510 --> 01:19.870
to access and interact with the data as well.

01:19.900 --> 01:27.100
And this is where database management system or mess concept comes in and also where Escudo comes in.

01:27.160 --> 01:34.170
So users query a database using Esky Well the DNS then takes this as well.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.630
And then the DNS interacts with the database.

01:37.630 --> 01:38.330
So what is this.

01:38.380 --> 01:44.410
Well as you know stands for structure quavery language and it is a standard language used to communicate

01:44.470 --> 01:46.420
with databases.

01:46.540 --> 01:52.600
So there are many different types of databases but the majority of them use Escudo as a language to

01:52.600 --> 01:54.110
communicate with them.

01:54.220 --> 01:57.300
You always use to perform tasks on the database.

01:57.300 --> 02:05.470
So such as creating objects updating the database or even retrieving data from the database and an example

02:05.470 --> 02:08.520
ask your old query is stated here.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.040
Select store.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.370
From customers.

02:11.590 --> 02:17.920
And basically what this query will do is it will select all the data we have from our customers table

02:18.100 --> 02:19.630
within the database.

02:19.630 --> 02:24.910
So we'll learn more about escrow queries later on in the course.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.640
So what is my school.

02:26.680 --> 02:33.130
My school is a database management system and actually it's relational database management system and

02:33.130 --> 02:38.830
it provides a user interface for us to access and interact with the database.

02:38.830 --> 02:46.780
So we type of escrow queries in my school and then that interacts with the database and we perform tasks

02:47.050 --> 02:50.370
on the database using my skew well.

02:50.980 --> 02:58.080
So other forms of relational database management system systems so RDBMS is postscripts bureau Eskew

02:58.120 --> 02:59.900
our server and Oracle.

03:00.240 --> 03:06.790
And actually there are many more examples of RDBMS is but they always as secure as the standard language

03:06.880 --> 03:08.770
to query databases.
