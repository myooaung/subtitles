00:05.170 --> 00:08.980
Hopefully you're able to make an attempt this challenge.

00:08.980 --> 00:11.540
So now let's take a look at the situation.

00:11.620 --> 00:18.610
So we want to find out the film which was shown in the Chaplin room most often in October 2017.

00:18.910 --> 00:22.270
So obviously we have two tables which spring to mind here.

00:22.480 --> 00:30.310
We have the films table and we have the rooms table so let's select store from films first

00:32.920 --> 00:41.350
and run that and you can see it returns three columns ID name and length men so ideally we run the film's

00:41.350 --> 00:42.980
name from this table.

00:43.550 --> 00:49.640
And now let's select store from Reims.

00:50.160 --> 00:57.420
And here we have free columns as well we have ID the room name and then the number of seats.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.710
So ideally we want this chaplain Name column here.

01:03.150 --> 01:06.880
So we want to be selecting chaplain from the range table.

01:07.290 --> 01:13.310
But notice there's no foreign key and primary key between films and rooms table.

01:13.500 --> 01:20.310
So we can actually do a join between these two tables to get the columns we want what we need to do

01:20.840 --> 01:26.460
is we're actually going to need to also select from the screenings table.

01:26.610 --> 01:34.120
So if we look in the screenings table you can see we have a film ID and a room ID.

01:34.530 --> 01:41.550
So these are foreign keys which are referencing primary keys in the films table and the rooms table.

01:42.380 --> 01:48.950
So basically what we can do is we can use these two foreign keys and do a join between these free tables

01:49.640 --> 01:56.930
so we can join films table and screenings table by using this film ID column and the ID column in the

01:56.930 --> 02:02.590
films table and then we can do a join between the screenings table and the rooms table.

02:02.810 --> 02:09.540
Using this room Id foreign key column which is referencing the ID column in the rooms table.

02:10.350 --> 02:13.650
So we need to do a join between the free tables.

02:13.950 --> 02:19.500
So lets type select and we want to select the film name so the films table.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.400
So thats just like if dont name.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.340
And we will say also want the name of the room.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.620
So we want to say oh don't name.

02:27.690 --> 02:36.240
So this is the name and this is the film name and we want to select from films

02:39.330 --> 02:44.930
and then we went from films F and then we want to do a join with the screenings table.

02:45.150 --> 03:00.630
So let's join in screenings pass on after IDEI is a cool 2 x film ID and then we want to do a join with

03:00.630 --> 03:02.410
the Bream's table.

03:02.760 --> 03:11.920
So let's join Remes all on all ID is cool too.

03:11.940 --> 03:21.690
As though room Id say you can see we've done a join between the films and the screenings table on EFTA

03:21.690 --> 03:29.880
ID is equal to estop film ID and then we done a join with the Remes table on Remes to ID is equal to

03:29.880 --> 03:35.550
screenings that rings ID room Id So if we run this query now

03:38.760 --> 03:48.630
you can see we get the film names and the names so we got Bladerunner 2049 Payne and Chaplin and Dunkirk

03:48.630 --> 03:52.030
and Chaplin Joe Stillman Chaplin et cetera et cetera.

03:52.110 --> 03:58.980
But if we go down far enough we should also see the other rooms where we got the Kubrick room and then

03:59.010 --> 04:04.350
we've also got the other room which is a capella.

04:04.350 --> 04:07.250
So we were only interested in Chaplin.

04:07.500 --> 04:21.190
So we can do a WHERE clause we can say where our door name is equal to Chaplin or we can say where our

04:21.330 --> 04:22.950
idea ideas equal to one

04:25.680 --> 04:28.540
because if we select star from Marines or

04:32.550 --> 04:38.090
we can see that Chaplin has an idea of one side or the idea to one.

04:38.190 --> 04:47.180
And now if we Slax run this query only returns the film screenings for Chaplin.

04:47.250 --> 04:52.960
So if we go all the way to the end you can see we know we no longer have Kubrick or capella

04:59.140 --> 05:02.410
So now we have our selects and wear clothes in place.

05:02.470 --> 05:08.910
We now need to find out which film out of all these films was shown most often in Chaplin.

05:09.220 --> 05:20.970
So to do that let's do a count on our top name and say as number of screenings.

05:21.070 --> 05:33.190
So we're going to rename the color number of screenings and then we also need to group by f dot name.

05:33.640 --> 05:43.500
And if we run this you can now see there's one Ryrie returned for each film name so you can see Blade

05:43.500 --> 05:44.090
Runner.

05:44.190 --> 05:51.410
2049 had nine screenings in Joplin Dunkirk at 12 years film at 13 excentric cetera.

05:51.420 --> 06:02.850
So just to finish off this solution we can order our data so we can order a by number of screenings.

06:03.510 --> 06:09.410
Remember a number of screenings is all a column alias name for this counts on the room.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.880
Rooms don't name column.

06:12.180 --> 06:21.210
So if we order by this and run the query you can see it actually returns it from lowest the highest.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.760
What we want is highest.

06:22.900 --> 06:28.590
So don't forget to put a desk for descending.

06:28.590 --> 06:33.110
So now I can see the films in order of number of screenings from highs to lowest.

06:33.240 --> 06:38.330
So we know Geo storm was the film that was shown most often in Joplin.

06:38.600 --> 06:46.430
And just to complete this query we can limit the number of results returned to one.

06:46.840 --> 06:53.220
And now if we run this query you can see just Geo storm returned and it had 13 screenings in the Chaplin

06:53.220 --> 06:53.670
room.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.750
So the answer is Geo storm.

06:56.890 --> 06:59.850
So if you got the answer Geo storm then that's fantastic.

06:59.850 --> 07:03.800
If you found a different solution please post it in the Q and A section.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.790
If you weren't able to get the answer.

07:05.830 --> 07:09.240
Don't worry as long as you are able to understand.

07:09.490 --> 07:12.700
As I went through the solution and that's great as well.

07:12.770 --> 07:18.110
And if you have any more questions on this solution or this challenge then please ask in the queue.

07:18.130 --> 07:18.750
A.S..
