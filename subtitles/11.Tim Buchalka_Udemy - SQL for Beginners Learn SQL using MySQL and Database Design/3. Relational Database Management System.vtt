00:05.410 --> 00:12.190
So I mentioned in the last video that my school was relational database management system or RDBMS and

00:12.190 --> 00:19.420
in this video we're going to learn what an RDBMS actually is our national database is a collection of

00:19.420 --> 00:22.060
data organized into multiple tables.

00:22.210 --> 00:30.220
Now tables contain columns of data categories and then rows with particular instances of that data category.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.150
So if we look at an example table here we have a screen grab from a customers table.

00:36.490 --> 00:42.700
Now this might be customers table for a shop and it contains all the data they have on their customers

00:42.730 --> 00:44.180
who shop there.

00:44.290 --> 00:46.280
So it has already failed.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.760
It has their first and last name of the customers.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.460
And it also has that agenda.

00:50.890 --> 00:59.260
So the data categories are ID first name last name and gender and then each row has an instance of that

00:59.260 --> 01:00.120
data.

01:00.130 --> 01:04.240
So the first name contains Chris and Mark Daniel Sarah.

01:04.240 --> 01:10.960
So the first names of all their customers and simply last name contains all the instances of their last

01:10.960 --> 01:12.460
name.

01:12.460 --> 01:16.810
So this is an example of what a table looks like in a relational database.

01:16.810 --> 01:23.470
Now the whole point of relational databases is that the tables within the database can be linked together

01:23.920 --> 01:26.070
or they share a relation.

01:26.230 --> 01:28.230
So you can see we have two tables here.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.760
We have the customers table from before.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.990
And we also have an Orders table so we can see in the Orders table.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.240
We have an order of time.

01:36.280 --> 01:44.560
So the time order was placed but we also have a customer ID and this is linked to the ID field in the

01:44.560 --> 01:45.810
Customers table.

01:46.120 --> 01:52.360
So you can see this Customers table and this Orders table within the same database Shavar link and this

01:52.360 --> 01:56.150
link can be used in many different ways.

01:56.170 --> 02:00.200
So tables within a relational database can be linked like this.

02:00.250 --> 02:07.680
So they share common columns and this is what we mean by relationships within the database.

02:07.750 --> 02:14.920
So an RDBMS like my ask you will is a program which we use to access and interact with a relational

02:14.920 --> 02:15.980
database.
