00:04.930 --> 00:08.750
So the next table we're going to create the teams table.

00:09.060 --> 00:16.140
So the rooms table has an ID which is an it and it's also our primary key which is auto incrementing.

00:16.140 --> 00:19.390
Then the next column is our name so the name of the room.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.840
And this is a vulture.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.740
And this also has not no constraint.

00:24.240 --> 00:29.010
And then the final column is the number of seats that the room contains.

00:29.010 --> 00:38.330
So this is an end and it's also not no say whether the room contains 64 C so 32 C S set your etc..

00:38.790 --> 00:42.690
So now that I put in my school workbench and create the rooms table

00:45.400 --> 00:54.610
OK so we need to type create table rooms opened up higher brackets with the semi-colon and then within

00:54.610 --> 00:58.700
the brackets we need to enter all columns just like before.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.500
So the first one again is ID and isn't in it.

01:02.730 --> 01:15.560
It's a primary key and it auto increments comma and then the next column is on name column.

01:15.820 --> 01:20.060
And this is a vulture all of maximum length 45.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.140
And it's not.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.750
No.

01:24.160 --> 01:29.690
And then the final call him in rooms table is the number of seats.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.050
And I see.

01:32.370 --> 01:36.700
And this is an integer and it's also not no.

01:37.940 --> 01:40.960
And that's it for the rooms table really simple.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.350
So now we need to run that statement.

01:44.710 --> 01:55.240
We can show tables in our database and we see the rooms table has been added and then we can describe

01:57.490 --> 01:58.120
rooms

02:01.450 --> 02:08.260
and you can see we have free columns ID name number of seats the data type whether then not know or

02:08.310 --> 02:14.740
not the keys primary key anti-vote value and extras just like before.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.360
OK so that's it for this video.
