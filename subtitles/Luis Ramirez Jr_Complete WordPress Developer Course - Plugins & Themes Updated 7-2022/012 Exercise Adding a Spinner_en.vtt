00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.710
In this lecture, we are going to add a spinner to the image.

2
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:09.330
After uploading an image, the user doesn't know that the image is uploading in their eyes.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.190
The image has already been uploaded.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.910
The moment it appears in the block, we should add a spinner to indicate the image is uploading.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.860
Try adding a spinner as an exercise.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
If the URL to the image is a blob, the spinner should appear.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.520
Otherwise the spinner can be hidden.

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.820
This means the spinner must be conditionally rendered.

9
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.920
Pause the video and give it a try.

10
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.850
Good luck.

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.950
Welcome back.

12
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.610
Hopefully you were able to add the spinner.

13
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.180
If not, that's fine.

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.830
Let's go through the solution together in your editor, open the index JS file for the team member block.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.190
First we must import the spinner component.

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370
This component can be imported from the WordPress Flash Components package.

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.340
Next, let's scroll to the image tag.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.280
This tag is responsible for displaying the profile image of a team member.

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.840
Below this tag add an expression.

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.220
Let's add the following expression is blob your URL.

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.070
IMG URL and Spinner.

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.450
The condition is the blog URL function.

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.560
If this function returns true, the image is being uploaded.

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.270
Therefore, we are going to render the spinner component.

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.190
That's it.

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.380
We've added a spinner.

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.600
Let's try testing our code.

28
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.910
In your editor, try uploading a new image after adding the team members group block to the page.

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.190
As the image is uploading, the spinner component will appear before disappearing.

30
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.200
Once it's gone, the image has been uploaded.

31
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.590
The spinner may appear briefly.

32
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.450
If you're on a fast internet connection, it can be difficult to view the spinner.

33
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
Before ending this lecture, I want to quickly show you the CSS for the spinner.

34
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.690
The spinner component generates an SVG tag.

35
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.000
This tag has the component spinner class applied to it by default.

36
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.030
The spinner does not use absolute positioning.

37
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.850
If you were to add the spinner component next to an image, the spinner would not appear above it.

38
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.320
We must apply absolute positioning to achieve this effect.

39
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.030
I wanted to mention this in case you want to apply the same effect to your custom blocks.

40
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.520
With that out of the way.

41
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.040
Let's keep working on our blocks.
