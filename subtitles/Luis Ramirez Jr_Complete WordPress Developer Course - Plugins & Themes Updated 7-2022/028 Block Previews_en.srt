00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,460
In this lecture, we are going to add one more feature to the team members group block.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,390
WordPress has a feature for generating previews of our blocks.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,130
Let's look at an example.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,079
If we were to view the list of blocks, we can hover our mouse over any block.

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,830
As we do so, a preview is displayed to the right.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,080
This preview is not a screenshot.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
WordPress is generating a preview of the block in real time.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,440
Previews can be a great way to quickly view a block before adding it to your page.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,310
I think it would be beneficial to add a preview to our block.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,640
Despite not configuring our block for a preview, WordPress will create a preview anyway.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,810
For example, let's search for the team members group block.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,960
We can hover our mouse over the block for preview.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,090
The block looks very empty.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,170
We have the option of modifying their preview with custom values.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,690
Let's give that a try in your editor.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,450
Open the block dot JSON file.

17
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,730
At the bottom of the object at an object called example.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,030
The example object can contain configuration settings for the block preview.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,770
For example, we can modify the attributes by adding a property called attributes.

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,130
For this example, let's set the column's property to two.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,230
By default, the column's attribute is set to three.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,070
The preview is very small.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,280
I don't think three columns will fit within the preview for the best results possible.

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,210
We are reducing the columns to the bare minimum.

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,930
The size of the preview will probably affect the design.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,610
I think less is more.

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,980
Moving on, let's modify the attributes for the inner blocks.

28
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,150
We can configure the inner blocks of a block by adding the inner blocks array.

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,620
Inside this array, we can add blocks to the current block.

30
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,979
As long as the block has an inner block's component, WordPress will be able to render the blocks in

31
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,410
the correct location.

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,160
Let's add two blocks.

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,690
Since we have two columns, a block is represented by an object.

34
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,850
We can configure the name of the block by adding the name property.

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,620
Let's set both objects to Udemy plus slash team member.

36
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,380
In the first object.

37
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,990
Let's set the name to John Doe.

38
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,740
Next set the title attribute to CEO of Udemy.

39
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,120
Afterward set the bio attribute to the following text.

40
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,130
This is a short description of the team member.

41
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,580
Lastly, let's configure the image of their preview by setting the image URL attributes.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,890
For previews.

43
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,280
We should not select an image from the media library as users will not always have the same images.

44
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,090
I recommend using an image available online in the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link

45
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,100
to a site called Pick Some.

46
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,590
Pick some is a free tool for grabbing random images for development.

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,090
The dimensions of an image can be generated in real time.

48
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,960
Feel free to look through the site for more info.

49
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,020
I've already grabbed an image I liked.

50
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,880
I'm going to copy the URL next.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,820
I'll head back to the editor to paste in the URL for the image URL attributes.

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,300
Let's make a copy of this object.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,900
The settings are going to be exactly the same with the exception of the name.

54
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,930
After copying the object, set the name to Jane Doe.

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,470
The preview is ready.

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,800
Let's test our code by refreshing the Gutenberg editor in the page.

57
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,790
Let's search for our block from the sidebar.

58
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,899
This time, the preview uses the settings from the block file.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,590
By configuring the preview, we can give users a better idea of what a block will look like.

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,840
Keep in mind this is a preview.

61
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,450
If we were to add the block to the page, the block on the page looks nothing like the preview.

62
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,810
The settings are only applicable to the preview.

63
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,020
We're finally finished the block.

64
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,160
We have spent a lot of time configuring the block, but the effort was well worth it.

65
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:52,040
I know block development can be tricky, but hopefully you're starting to get the flow of things in

66
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,810
the next set of sections.

67
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,880
We will work on a few more blocks before considering our plugin and theme complete when you're ready.

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,970
I'll see you in the next lecture.
