00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.200
In this lecture, we're going to begin our journey by creating a theme.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.800
The question is, where do we start with creating a theme?

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.520
The first step is to register a theme with WordPress.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.220
WordPress has a few requirements for registering a theme.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.810
Before getting started, I want to make one point clear.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.150
This course is not focused on the HTML and CSS code.

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.780
We're primarily going to be focusing on PHP and JavaScript.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.280
Be sure you're confident with your HTML and CSS skills before proceeding in the resource section of

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.770
this lecture, you will find a zip file.

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.190
It contains the template will be using for this course.

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010
I want you to download it.

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.830
I've done nothing to this template that makes it WordPress ready.

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.770
I will walk you through every step to convert it from a static template into a WordPress theme.

14
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.980
The template will be using is built with tailwind.

15
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.220
WordPress is ultimately frontend agnostic.

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
We're not required to use a specific framework.

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.380
We have complete freedom over which libraries are incorporated into our theme.

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.410
With that being said, Tailwind is one of the simplest libraries to use in a WordPress theme.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
The template I've provided is very basic.

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.100
We'll learn about the template as the course progresses.

21
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.990
Let's do one of the pages.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.620
Currently I have a home page opened in my browser.

23
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.180
If you were to view the other templates, they would look similar to this page.

24
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.740
By the end of this course, every feature on this page will be functional.

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.970
Most importantly, users will be able to customize our theme.

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.900
For example, the links in the header will be customizable.

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.980
Users will be able to swap our links with their links.

28
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.070
The overall structure of the page is simple.

29
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.100
We have a header, footer, sidebar and an area for the main contents of the page.

30
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.850
The main content area will be different from page to page.

31
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.030
It's a simple design, but don't let that fool you.

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.530
We're going to be performing a lot of work to get this theme fully functional.

33
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.790
My main goal is to help you understand how themes are built.

34
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.890
Now that we have an idea of what we're going to create, it's time to start coding.

35
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.410
Open the text editor of Your Choice.

36
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.150
It should be pointed to our WordPress project.

37
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.010
If you haven't already start the server for the rest of this course, you should always have the server

38
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.780
running in our editors.

39
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.620
Open the WP content slash themes directory.

40
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.430
By default, every WordPress installation will come with a couple of themes.

41
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.330
In every case, one theme must be present and active.

42
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.660
WordPress will always search for your themes in the themes directory.

43
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.560
Our themes must live in this directory.

44
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.520
Otherwise, WordPress will not be able to detect our theme.

45
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.210
For organization reasons, we should separate our theme from other themes by creating a folder in this

46
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.000
directory.

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.480
Create a folder called Udemy.

48
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.150
The name of our folder should be unique.

49
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.410
We don't want our theme to conflict with other themes.

50
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.730
Inside this folder.

51
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.130
We're going to create two files.

52
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.870
They'll be called Style CSS and Index PHP.

53
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.380
WordPress has three requirements for registering a new theme.

54
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.120
Let's talk about those requirements.

55
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.970
The first two requirements are to create a set of two files called Style CSS and index PHP.

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.080
These files must always be defined inside a theme folder, otherwise WordPress will not be able to register

57
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.900
your theme.

58
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.300
The file names are very important.

59
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.490
Our themes must always have these files.

60
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.900
We've accomplished two out of three requirements.

61
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.560
The third requirement is a file header.

62
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.160
File headers are pieces of additional information for describing your theme.

63
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.850
WordPress doesn't know the name of our theme.

64
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.010
It doesn't know who the author is.

65
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.140
This information is not just important for WordPress but to our clients as well.

66
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.600
We can provide this information by adding a file header.

67
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.050
Let's try creating a file header.

68
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.550
File headers must be defined in the style CSS file.

69
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.140
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the main stylesheet documentation page.

70
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.710
This page documents what the style CSS file is for.

71
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.350
If we scroll down, we will come across a code snippet of what we can insert into this file.

72
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.160
At the top of the file, we must insert a block comment.

73
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.310
This block comment is what's called a file header.

74
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.370
It's a block comments or information about our theme.

75
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
Every piece of information follows a key value format.

76
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.530
The format is the name of the property, followed by the value.

77
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.630
They're separated with a colon.

78
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.330
Below this code snippets we'll come across a description of every property available.

79
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.640
A lot of this information is optional.

80
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.920
You don't have to include every piece.

81
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.610
The most important property is the name of the theme.

82
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.790
Let's copy the example from the documentation.

83
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.780
Next.

84
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.130
Paste it into the style CSS file.

85
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.670
Let's run down the list of settings.

86
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.410
A file header can be created by adding a block comment in CSS.

87
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.620
The block comment must be created at the top of each style CSS file.

88
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.220
WordPress will scan this file for the comment block.

89
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.850
The first piece of information we should provide is the name of the theme.

90
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.850
The name can be added by adding the theme name property.

91
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.300
Let's set the name to Udemy.

92
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.530
Believe it or not, we've created our first theme.

93
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.730
The name is the only thing that WordPress needs.

94
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.380
Everything else is optional.

95
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.630
Let's test if this is true.

96
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.350
I'm going to remove the other properties in this comment.

97
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.210
Next, let's switch over to the admin dashboard.

98
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:30.830
In our browsers, we can view the list of themes uploaded to our site by navigating to appearance themes.

99
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.480
An empty block with the name of our theme will appear.

100
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.060
We can click on this block to view more information since we only provided the themes name WordPress

101
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.020
will not be able to give the user more information.

102
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.060
Despite that, our theme is considered valid.

103
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.190
We can even activate our theme.

104
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.580
Let's give that a try after a few moments.

105
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.990
Our theme is active.

106
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.110
WordPress has not thrown an error at us.

107
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.900
We can even view the theme on the front end.

108
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.510
Let's switch over to the main site.

109
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.870
The page is going to be empty.

110
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.630
It's not because of an error.

111
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.550
It's because we haven't created a template.

112
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.960
We'll talk about how to create a template in another lecture.

113
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.280
We've successfully created our first theme.

114
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.900
These are the three minimum requirements for creating an official theme.

115
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.470
We need to create two files called style CSS and indexed PHP.

116
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.420
The style CSS file must contain a file header with the themes name.

117
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.690
After completing those steps, WordPress will recognize our theme.

118
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.190
It will not ask for anything else.

119
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.230
The information stored in the file header is extracted and presented to the user on the dashboard.

120
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.610
As you can see, we didn't need to write additional code to get this feature.

121
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.040
WordPress helps us a lot with theme development.

122
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.610
This allows us to focus on our theme.

123
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.180
Our theme is ready.

124
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.240
It's not much, but it's a start.

125
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.620
In the next lecture, let's explore the other file headers.
