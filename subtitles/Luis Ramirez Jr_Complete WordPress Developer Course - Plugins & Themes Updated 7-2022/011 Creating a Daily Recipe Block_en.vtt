00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.040
In this lecture, we are going to create a block for displaying the recipe of the day.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.720
Every day we're going to randomly select a recipe from the current site.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.380
This recipe will be displayed to our visitors like the other blocks.

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.180
I prepared this block for us in the resource section of this lecture.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.130
I provide a link to the starter files in our plugin.

6
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:31.020
Create a directory called Daily Recipe inside this directory and these files pause the video and good

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.620
luck.

8
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.300
Welcome back.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.020
I've created the starter files in my plugin.

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.250
Let's go through the files together.

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.090
Starting with the block JSON file.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.720
We have a basic configuration file.

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.470
This block is going to have a single attribute, which is an attribute for storing the title of the

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.070
block.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.790
Next, let's move over to the JavaScript file.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.960
Inside this file we have a basic block registration.

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.319
Inside the template, we're rendering a rich text component for modifying the blocks title.

18
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.330
Below this component, we are rendering a post image and title.

19
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.450
As you can imagine, we are going to be sending a request for a random post from the rest API.

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.300
There's not much else to say about the files.

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.270
Let's go ahead with registering this block.

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.100
Open the register block.

23
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.870
Start PHP file.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.140
Inside the blocks array at another array for the daily recipe block.

25
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.570
Let's add the name option.

26
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.040
Next, add the options key.

27
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.010
Querying the database for a random recipe is going to require server side rendering.

28
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.890
Let's set the render callback option to up daily recipe CB.

29
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.210
Next.

30
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.910
Create a file called daily recipe dot php inside the include slash block's directory.

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.759
Define the up daily recipe CB function.

32
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.460
Lastly, insert the output buffer snippet.

33
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.000
We're ready to start developing the block.

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.320
In the next lecture, we will write the query for a random recipe.
