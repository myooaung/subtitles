00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.550
In this lecture, we are going to explore a useful feature for helping site builders.

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.870
Blocks can have variations.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.670
Let me show you an example.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.660
Currently, I'm viewing the Gutenberg editor.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.040
If I were to add a new block, there's a category called Embed.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
You may scroll down the list of blocks to find this category.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.430
WordPress supports various platforms for embedding content into the page.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.520
At first glance, these may seem like different blocks.

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.040
However, these blocks are variations of the embed block.

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.580
It's the same block, but with different names and icons.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.190
The behavior of the block is still the same.

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.830
Variations were introduced to showcase the different appearances a block can have.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.870
Let's try adding a variation for our block.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.230
To get started, check out the resource section of this lecture for a link to a gist.

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.650
For this demonstration, I will be providing different icons one icon for the original version of the

16
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.310
block.

17
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.800
Another icon for the variation.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.490
The variation will be called accented.

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.320
Let's copy this code to our clipboard.

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.170
Next.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
Head on over to your editor inside the source directory.

22
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.280
Create a file called Icons JS.

23
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.830
Paste the code into this file.

24
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.540
Next update the block file.

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
The icon's property can be removed from the file.

26
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.600
We can start importing the icons into our block in your editor.

27
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.240
Open the index JS file.

28
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.890
At the top of the file.

29
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.990
Import the icons file.

30
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
Next, add the icon option to the object.

31
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.440
Set the icon to the icons dot default property.

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.580
After adding the icon, we can begin adding the variation.

33
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.580
Variations can be defined by adding the variations array to the configuration object.

34
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.940
Inside this array, we can add objects for each variation of our block.

35
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.330
For this example, let's add one object.

36
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.650
Inside this object, we must provide a name for our variation.

37
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.660
The name must be unique.

38
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.510
It cannot conflict with other block names.

39
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.010
I prefer to use the original name with an additional word attached to it.

40
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.220
For example, let's set the name to the following.

41
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.450
UE plus slash alert box accented.

42
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.420
The variation is called accented.

43
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.220
You'll see why in a moment.

44
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.520
Next, let's add a property called title.

45
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.770
This property will have the following value alert box accented.

46
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.540
The title will be presented on the front end to the user.

47
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.480
Afterward lets set the icon property to the icons dot x sensitive property.

48
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.930
The properties for the variation are exactly the same as the properties for a block file.

49
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.210
The main difference is that we do not need to include the edit or save functions.

50
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.620
The variation will inherit the functions from the parent configuration.

51
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.250
The question is how can we make our variation different?

52
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.610
It's common practice to modify the default values of the attributes.

53
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.660
Let's add an object called attributes.

54
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.080
Next change the text colour attribute to the following colour hash 111827.

55
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.860
Lastly, let's change the name of the class by setting the class name to is style accented?

56
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.200
Technically the class name attribute is not a valid attribute on our block.

57
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.130
However, WordPress treats this value as an attribute.

58
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.470
We can modify it through the attributes object.

59
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.010
This is where the true power of variations comes in.

60
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.820
If a variation is added to the page, WordPress will allow us to insert a class for completely changing

61
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.410
the appearance of the block.

62
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.050
It's common practice to use the name is style, followed by the name of the variation.

63
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.900
I've already prepared styles for this class.

64
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.680
You can refer to the style file for the styles.

65
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.780
Let's try testing our code in the browser.

66
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.300
Refresh the page.

67
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.200
Next.

68
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.230
Try searching for the alert box block.

69
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.910
As you can see, the results will display two blocks.

70
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.220
They are the same block, but with different classes.

71
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.140
We can click on the alert box accented block to add it to the page.

72
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.940
The block has an entirely different appearance than before.

73
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.470
However, it's still the same block.

74
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.030
If you look at the sidebar, WordPress does not use the modified name.

75
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.260
According to WordPress, we're working with the alert box block.

76
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.240
Variations can be a great way to change the initial appearance of a block.

77
00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.240
Providing different block presentations can make it easier for designers to work with your blocks.

78
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.370
In the next lecture, let's add an option for switching between variations.
