00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,180
In this lecture, we are going to apply the colors from our attributes to the template of the block.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,310
Performing this step is nothing new.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,920
Therefore, I want you to try tackling this step as an exercise, as a hint.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,440
Applying styles is as easy as modifying the styles of our elements.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,030
The background and text colours should be affected.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,150
Pause the video and give it a try.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,080
Good luck.

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,460
Welcome back.

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,240
Hopefully you are able to apply colors to the block.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,590
Don't worry, we are going to go through the solution together first.

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,230
Open the index JS file.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:47,490
Scroll to the edit function, we are going to update the use block props function by passing in an object.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:52,950
Previously we did not apply styles to the root element for the previous block.

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,300
This was because the root element was the rich text component.

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,900
It does not support custom styles from the edit function.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,910
However, things are different.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,400
The root element is a div tag.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,430
We can freely apply styles to this element.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,570
For this example, we are going to use the use block props function to add styles to the element inside

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,410
this object.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,210
Add the style property.

22
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,460
The value of this property will be an object.

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,810
Each property will modify a CSS property.

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,210
We are going to change to CSS properties called background color and color.

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,300
Their values will be the BG color and text color attributes respectively.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,300
After making those changes.

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,810
Let's refresh the experimental page in the browser.

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,820
Next, let's have the search form block to the page.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm going to attempt to modify the colors of our block.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,900
Both options should work on your end.

31
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,850
As I'm changing the colors, the blocks template will reflect those changes.

32
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,560
However, there's one problem the color of the button never changes.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,780
I think it should update along with the other elements.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,450
Head back to your editor.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,840
In the template search for the button element, we can bind the style attribute to an object to dynamically

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,110
apply styles.

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,980
Let's set this attribute to an object.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,100
Inside this object, we can dynamically add properties.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,550
The properties are the same as before.

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,760
For that reason, I'm going to copy and paste the properties from the use block props function to the

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,140
buttons styles.

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,070
After making those changes.

43
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,200
Let's try adding the block again.

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,350
Next, let's try modifying the blocks colors.

45
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,490
This time the button should update along with the other elements.

46
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,280
Perfect.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,420
We've successfully finished the lock before moving on to the next lecture.

48
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,620
I'm going to save the post without the other blocks.

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,820
The only block that should be on the page is the search form block.

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,700
Once you save the post, let's start working on the block for the front end.
