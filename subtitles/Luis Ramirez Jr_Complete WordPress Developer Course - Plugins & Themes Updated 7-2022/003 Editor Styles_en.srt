1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,160
In this lecture, we are going to quickly discuss a file called Ed Success.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,480
You can find this file within the source directory.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,230
This file contains styles for the Gutenberg editor.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:22,050
The Scripts package will search for a file called Editor that asks if this file exists within our project.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,640
The compiled CSS file will not be bundled with the other files.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,640
The package will extract this file into a separate file in the build directory.

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,780
A file with a similar name cannot be found behind the scenes.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,860
The builder has renamed the file to indexed CSS.

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:47,520
If you look inside this file, you'll find the same styles from the editor SKS file.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,620
It's a simple feature for separating editor styles from the main styles of a block.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,640
There isn't a reason to load styles for the editor on the front end.

12
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,390
They take up an unnecessary amount of disk space.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,840
For this plugin, we do not need editor styles.

14
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,880
Let's remove this file from our project in the source directory.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,190
Delete the editor dot access file.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,110
Next.

17
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,720
Open the block, Jason File.

18
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,570
Towards the bottom of the file.

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,000
Remove the editor style option.

20
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,380
The editor's style option will load a CSS file in the editor.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,960
The scripts package will add this option for loading the indexed CSV file.

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,440
Since we do not need editor styles, this option can be safely removed.

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:45,730
The last step is to remove the import statement for this file from the edit js file.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,230
Inside this file.

25
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,300
Remove the import statement.

26
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,390
After making those changes, your project should be fully functional.

27
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,950
You can check the command line for errors.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,310
If you spot errors, you may need to restart the NPM run start command.

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,980
After restarting, the error should go away.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,440
In the next lecture, let's start modifying the styles of our block.
