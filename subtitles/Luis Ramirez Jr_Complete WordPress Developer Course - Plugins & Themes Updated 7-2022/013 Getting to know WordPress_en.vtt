00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.020
In this lecture, let's take a moment to explore the various resources at our disposal for WordPress

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:07.950
development.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.930
Throughout this course, I have been throwing links at you for various functions.

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.200
In my opinion, WordPress is very well documented, however it is very large.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.750
Being able to navigate the documentation will help you with your journey as a developer.

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.420
You can follow along with me by checking out the links in the resource section of this lecture.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.710
First things first we should make a distinction between the two sites.

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.340
If we were to search for WordPress, two results would appear which are WordPress.com and WordPress

9
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.300
dot org.

10
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.190
They have similar domain names, but there's one huge distinction between them.

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.420
The dot com domain is a hosting platform for WordPress.

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.660
After we're finished developing a WordPress site, the next step is to upload our code to a hosting

13
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.440
provider.

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.840
There are dozens of providers available that exclusively deal with WordPress sites.

15
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.120
The WordPress hosting platform is just one of the many hosts available.

16
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.290
It's completely optional to upload your code to this platform.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.210
Let's keep moving forward.

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.330
The dot org domain does not host sites.

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
Instead it'll host the original source code of WordPress.

20
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.530
It's the same code you'll find in the app slash public directory of our local installation.

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
WordPress is 100% open source.

22
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.580
There are no fees associated with downloading WordPress.

23
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.810
We can download WordPress, read the code and modify it.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.380
If you're interested in downloading the source code of WordPress, you can do so at the dot org domain.

25
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.300
Throughout this course, we're going to be spending most of our time on this site.

26
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.910
Let's keep exploring under support.

27
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.650
Click Documentation.

28
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.840
This part of the site will provide documentation on WordPress features.

29
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.380
This documentation will go over the basics of WordPress such as installation and configuration.

30
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.520
It seemed that individuals who don't know how to code the technical details of WordPress are not documented

31
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.230
on this part of the site.

32
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.370
WordPress documents the technical details.

33
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.370
Elsewhere, scroll to the bottom of the page on the footer.

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
There's a link for developers.

35
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.520
Let's click on it.

36
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.800
The developer site is aimed at programmers.

37
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.650
It's going to be your most valuable resource as a developer.

38
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.030
Before digging deeper, there's another resource worth mentioning.

39
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.740
It's called Codex.

40
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.940
The Codex was the original place for a WordPress documentation.

41
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.780
Back in the early days, WordPress used the codex resource for everything from code examples to simple

42
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.060
explanations about the user system.

43
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.670
However, as WordPress grew, the documentation became bloated with information.

44
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.560
It was difficult to navigate for technical and non technical users.

45
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.080
As a result, they separated the developer and user friendly documentation.

46
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.200
The codex resource is no longer supported.

47
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.550
In a few years it'll be completely removed from time to time.

48
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.640
The Codex resource contains code examples.

49
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.330
The WordPress team has not completed the transition from the Codex resource to the developer resource.

50
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.290
It's a work in progress in almost all instances.

51
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.060
You'll want to refer to the documentation on the developer resource.

52
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.480
The codex resource will eventually be retired.

53
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.790
The available resource is kept up to date with the latest changes in WordPress.

54
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.090
Let's learn how to take advantage of this resource.

55
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.060
The main page of the developer resource will contain links to different topics of WordPress.

56
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.030
For example, if we want to learn about themes, we can click on the Themes section.

57
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.660
We'll be exploring these topics throughout this course.

58
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.120
Most sections will take you to a handbook to learn the basics of each feature.

59
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.230
The most important section is the code reference section.

60
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.700
Let's check it out.

61
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.870
The Code Reference section allows us to search through WordPress code base below the search form.

62
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.110
There is a quick overview of the changes made to the WordPress core.

63
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.340
This is a really great way to check out what functions have been added.

64
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.970
On the right, there's a list of APIs available in WordPress.

65
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.980
We'll be exploring most of these functions throughout the course.

66
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.770
Let's take a look at how to search for code.

67
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.350
You don't need to follow along for this part.

68
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.570
You can sit back and relax in the search form.

69
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.480
Let's try searching for the blog info function.

70
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.370
This is one of the functions we've learned about.

71
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.250
The reference will return a few results.

72
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.460
Let's check out the first results.

73
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.750
WordPress does an incredible job of documenting its functions.

74
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.040
If we're interested in learning about a specific piece of code, we'll be able to search for it through

75
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.420
the code reference.

76
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.380
This page will document everything you'd like to know about the function.

77
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.390
Let's run through it together.

78
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:35.810
We've already reviewed the description parameters and more information sections.

79
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.600
These sections are self explanatory.

80
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.910
The next section of this page is called Source.

81
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.430
The Source section documents the original function definition.

82
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.390
WordPress is completely transparent with its code base.

83
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.060
You can study WordPress functions for a better understanding of its behavior.

84
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.100
WordPress will even give you the file name down further.

85
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.630
There's another section called related.

86
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.170
WordPress functions are not just used by us but by other WordPress functions.

87
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.270
Sometimes the documentation may not give enough information in those cases.

88
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.690
Seeing how WordPress uses its functions may provide clarity.

89
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.740
You'll find some great examples by reading through the WordPress code.

90
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.300
Next is the change log section.

91
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.940
This section will document the changes made to a function.

92
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.780
As you can see, this function definition has been around since version 0.71.

93
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.340
As I stated previously, WordPress is a popular choice because most code you write will be comparable

94
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.870
with earlier versions.

95
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.510
Not as early as this version, but you shouldn't have any problems with a few versions back.

96
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.010
The last section is the user contributed notes section.

97
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.350
This section allows for other developers to share additional tips about this function.

98
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.190
It's a great way to see how other developers tackle problems in WordPress.

99
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.620
As you can see, the developer resource is incredibly handy.

100
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.290
Be warned, not all pages are like this.

101
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:15.210
Some pages are not as documented as well as the blog info function.

102
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.950
Luckily, the most commonly used features are well documented.

103
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.550
I know this lecture is introducing a lot of resources.

104
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:30.240
As time goes on, we will get a lot of practice with how we can use these resources for developing plugins

105
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.090
and themes.

106
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.680
To reiterate, the developer resource provides information pertaining to the code of WordPress.

107
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.170
A lot of this information is technical and aimed at developers.

108
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.900
Before we're ending this lecture.

109
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.470
Let's explore a site called Automatic.

110
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.690
Automatic is a company that makes huge contributions to the WordPress software.

111
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.180
They own plugins such as Jetpack and WooCommerce.

112
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.110
They don't own WordPress.

113
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.190
However, they have significant influence over the open source project.

114
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:08.400
Automattic owns the dot com domain of WordPress, but they do not own WordPress itself.

115
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.710
It is very important to make that distinction.

116
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.620
Anyway, that's about it.

117
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.860
Let's continue our journey in the next lecture.
