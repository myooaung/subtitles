00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.830
In this lecture, we are going to finish the main content area by adding the sidebar to our templates.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.830
Currently, the sidebar is completely empty.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.120
Visitors will see an empty white space on every page.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.980
Typically, sidebars will contain various blocks to display links to other pages of our site.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
Before adding blocks, we should create a template part.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.550
After we're finished with the index template.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.740
Additional templates will be explored.

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.830
The sidebar will appear in multiple templates.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.330
I think it would be a good idea to separate this section of the template into a template part for reusability.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.700
Let's try creating a template part.

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.260
Switch over to your text editor inside the parts folder, create a file called sidebar HTML.

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.730
Next, let's begin creating the blocks that will occupy this file.

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.500
Switch back to the browser.

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
On our site we have three UI elements in the sidebar.

15
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.349
The sidebar has a section for tags, categories and a list of highly rated posts.

16
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.090
WordPress has blocks for generating a list of tags and categories.

17
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.570
And as for the highly rated post section, a block does not exist for generating this UI element.

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
Therefore, we're going to resort to an HTML block.

19
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.230
A custom block will be developed in a future section.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.310
Now that we have an overview of what we need, let's create the blocks.

21
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.740
Switch over to the full site editor.

22
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
We are going to focus our attention on the sign bar template part.

23
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.820
Initially the template will be empty.

24
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.720
Let's add two blocks called heading and tag cloud.

25
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.070
We're starting with the tag section.

26
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.080
Typically, we would use a single block to create a section.

27
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.840
However, the tag cloud block does not add a heading.

28
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.820
It has to be added separately.

29
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.650
In the index html file.

30
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.130
The static HTML for the tags section can be found under a comment that says popular tags.

31
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.210
The markup is straightforward.

32
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.390
The heading has a modified font size, weight and margin.

33
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.820
As for the links.

34
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.910
WordPress does not offer settings for modifying their appearance.

35
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.580
I provided a class for quickly styling the tags.

36
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
Starting with the heading, let's modify the stylings first.

37
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.890
Let's set the font size to 1.25 REM.

38
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.110
The appearance option should be set to medium.

39
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630
Lastly, let's add the margin options to the block.

40
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.890
The bottom margin should be set to 1.25 REM.

41
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.290
Additional styles are not required.

42
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.060
We can skip applying the classes since the block settings can handle the rest.

43
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.680
The heading is almost ready.

44
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.760
We almost forgot to add the text for the heading.

45
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.940
Add the following text blog tags.

46
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.780
Let's work on modifying the tag cloud.

47
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.420
The tag cloud block will generate over 40 tags for our theme.

48
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.310
We won't need this many tags.

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.030
Let's tone it down by modifying the settings under the settings.

50
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.810
Sidebar Set the number of tags to 15.

51
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.780
Lastly, let's apply a class to modify the appearance.

52
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.380
The look we're going for can't be modified through the block's settings.

53
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.280
A custom class will suffice inside the class field.

54
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.010
Add a class called sidebar tags.

55
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.540
This class is defined in our theme.

56
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.350
After applying this class, your template should look like mine.

57
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.200
Next.

58
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.240
Let's move on to the highly rated posts.

59
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.910
As I said before, this UI element can't be easily created with a core block.

60
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.160
Let's replicate this element with a custom HTML block.

61
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.970
Open the indexed HTML file in your editor.

62
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.820
Search for a comment that says highly rated posts.

63
00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.610
Below this comment there's a div tag with a class called NB eight.

64
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.740
Let's copy it from the template.

65
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.960
Next, insert the html block below the tag cloud block with the HTML.

66
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.970
Awesome.

67
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.180
We're almost finished.

68
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.430
The last UI element is the categories similar to the tags section.

69
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.270
The category section can be created with two blocks.

70
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.480
We need a heading followed by a list of categories.

71
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.400
Luckily we can duplicate the heading block since the styles are the same.

72
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.020
After the duplicated heading block.

73
00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.510
Add a new block called Categories.

74
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.070
Let's examine the structure of the original template of the categories.

75
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.370
The HTML for the categories is simple.

76
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.480
We have a list of links similar to the tags block.

77
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.000
The categories block does not have settings for modifying the appearance of the categories.

78
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.680
Classes will have to do.

79
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.630
Configuring the categories block will be fast on the sidebar.

80
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.750
Let's enable the show only top level categories option.

81
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.290
Categories can have a hierarchy.

82
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.320
We may not always want to display subcategories to keep the block simple.

83
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.590
We're going to restrict the list to top level categories.

84
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.460
Next, under the advanced panel, add a class called Sidebar Categories.

85
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.570
We're finished.

86
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.260
The last step is to update our HTML templates.

87
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.870
The current template is a copy stored in the database.

88
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.410
Rather than copying and pasting each block, we can select all blocks by holding down the shift key

89
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.090
and clicking on the blocks.

90
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.590
Once you selected the blocks, copy the locks into your clipboard.

91
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.270
Next switch over to the sidebar.

92
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.880
HTML file.

93
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.160
Paste the blocks into the file.

94
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.030
We can safely refresh the Gutenberg editor to reset the templates.

95
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.520
After resetting the template, it should look exactly the same as before.

96
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.410
Let's save the templates.

97
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.260
While we're updating our template, let's update the index template.

98
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.170
Switch over to this template in the editor.

99
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.820
We're going to load the template part in the second column of the main content area inside the second

100
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.480
column block at a new block called Template Part.

101
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.110
Next we can choose the sidebar template part from the list.

102
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.410
Below the columns.

103
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.750
BLOCK We saved a copy of the main content area as an HTML block.

104
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.480
Keeping this block around isn't necessary.

105
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.480
Delete the HTML walk from the templates.

106
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.530
Time to update the index template file.

107
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.240
The entire list of blocks can be copied from the list view.

108
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.430
Let's do that.

109
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:40.040
We are going to completely overwrite the index template with these blocks in your text editor, open

110
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.440
the index HTML file.

111
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.880
Replace the current contents with the latest copy.

112
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:57.040
Lastly, we can reset the templates in the Gutenberg Editor, refresh the page so that the editor has

113
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.740
the latest copy of the HTML file.

114
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:05.410
Once the editor has loaded completely, you can safely reset the index template.

115
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.520
This process may take a while.

116
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:13.000
WordPress has to perform several checks before rendering the completed templates.

117
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.060
If everything works, the template should have loaded on the editor.

118
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.120
Save the template to finalize the templates.

119
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.820
Great.

120
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.370
We're finished with the main content area.

121
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.170
There's one more test that we should perform.

122
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.930
Let's check out the home page on the front end.

123
00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.789
The sidebar is complete.

124
00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:40.470
We can finally move on to the last area of the template, which is the footer.

125
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.820
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
