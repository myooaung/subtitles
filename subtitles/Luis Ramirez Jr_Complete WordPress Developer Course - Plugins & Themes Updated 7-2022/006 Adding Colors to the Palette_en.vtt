00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture, we are going to add colors to the palette.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
Currently, the user will not receive color recommendations.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.150
They are completely on their own.

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.550
For the best editing experience possible, we should recommend colors that match our theme.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.860
Additional colors can be added through the theme JSON file in your editor.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.000
Open this file.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.790
As you can probably guess, we can add colors through the settings color property inside the color object.

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.470
Add a property called palette with an initial value of an empty array.

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.760
Inside this array, we can insert objects for each color that we'd like to add.

10
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.590
Let's try adding white.

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.450
Each object will need three properties.

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.410
The first property will be called slug.

13
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.190
The slug is an ID for our color.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.930
As we've learned, WordPress will add colours to our theme which we've disabled.

15
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.000
Plug ins are also capable of adding colours.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.560
We can help WordPress identify a colour by assigning it an ID.

17
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
This is to prevent clashing colours from other plugins.

18
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.000
For this example, let's set the slug to you white.

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.340
We are pre fixing our ID with the letter u, which is short for you.

20
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.380
To me that's the name of our theme.

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.130
Whenever possible, we should avoid duplicating ID names.

22
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.610
If our ID was called white, it's likely there may be another color with the same name to prevent naming

23
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.420
conflicts.

24
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.630
It's recommended to prefix your ID names.

25
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.710
For the rest of this course we are going to apply prefixes.

26
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.930
Let's move on to adding the color.

27
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.270
The next property is called color.

28
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.520
WordPress allows us to use various values for the color.

29
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.080
The following values are supported.

30
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:04.570
Hex RS GB Are GB a colour names keywords hsl hsl.

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.550
A For this course we are going to stick with hex codes and GB.

32
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.890
Back in our code.

33
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.470
Let's set the color to the following value.

34
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.880
Our GB to 55 to 50 5 to 55.

35
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.630
This value will set the color to white.

36
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.910
We're almost finished.

37
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.160
The last required property is called name.

38
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.380
The name property will be a human readable name of our colour.

39
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.180
Unlike the slug, this value will be presented to the user on the editor.

40
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.940
Let's set the name to Udemy White.

41
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.820
We've successfully added our first colour.

42
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.940
Let's try viewing the colour palette in the browser.

43
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.760
Awesome.

44
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.700
Our color is available as a choice in the palette.

45
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.170
You can hover your mouse over the color to view the name.

46
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.670
A tooltip should appear with the value from the name property.

47
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.490
It's time to add the rest of the colors.

48
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.950
We're going to have over 15 colors to prevent the course from becoming repetitive.

49
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.830
Check out the resource section of this lecture.

50
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.790
You will find a link to a complete list of colors for our theme.

51
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.430
Copy the entire list of colors.

52
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.990
Next, head back to your editor after the first color paste in the list of colours.

53
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.520
Make sure you add the comma after the first object.

54
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.290
Feel free to play around with the colors.

55
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.110
Each object is very similar to one another.

56
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.200
Colors must have a slug, color and name before testing our code.

57
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.610
Let's add one more color similar to the default palette property.

58
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.940
We can add custom colors to a specific block.

59
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.220
Let's expand on our example of the site title block inside the color object.

60
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.050
Add the palette property.

61
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.560
The format is the same as before.

62
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.300
Let's quickly add the primary colour to the palette inside the array.

63
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.690
Add an object with a property called Slug.

64
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.910
The slug will be set to you primary.

65
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.440
Next, add the color property.

66
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.530
Let's try using a hex code.

67
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.080
The value for this color will be the following hash.

68
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.360
ef444, four.

69
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.290
Lastly, the name property will be sent to Utomi primary.

70
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.210
If our assumptions are correct, this color should only be available to the site title block.

71
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.790
Let's try viewing the color palettes on the global style sidebar.

72
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.580
If you can view the complete list of colors, you've successfully added a custom palette for your theme.

73
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.690
To verify the colors, you can hover your mouse over the colors for the tooltip.

74
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.700
The names should reflect the names in the theme dot JSON file.

75
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.690
Let's try viewing the color palette for the site title block.

76
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.460
The color palette from this block will completely override the global palette.

77
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.230
This behavior is important to understand.

78
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.420
WordPress will prioritize block specific settings over global settings by adding a custom color palette

79
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.380
for a block.

80
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.460
The global palette will not be provided or merged, so that's how colors are added to a theme in the

81
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.440
next lecture.

82
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.360
Let's continue our discussion of colors.
