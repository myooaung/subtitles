00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,280
In this lecture we will begin our discussion of WordPress typography settings for themes.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,730
To begin, we're going to start with font families.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,590
Unfortunately, we won't be able to fully verify the font family settings for our theme.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,830
The theme JSON file does not provide an option for loading fonts.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,880
This operation must be performed with PHP.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,870
However, we can add font family settings in the next section we are going to load the font family for

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,350
now.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,120
As long as the option is available.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,150
In the editor, we can consider the mission complete.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,500
Our theme will support two fonts called Pacifico and Rubik.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,020
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to both fonts.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,190
They are completely free and available on Google Fonts.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,380
For this demonstration, the Rubik font will be available as an option on a global level.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,150
As for the specific font, this font will only be available for the site title.

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,730
BLOCK Let's begin.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,130
Open the theme dot JSON file.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:06,730
First let's add the font to the style sidebar inside the settings object.

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,220
Add a new object called typography.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,420
New font families can be configured under the typography object.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,140
Next we must add an array called font families.

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,320
Inside this array, we can add our custom fonts.

22
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,910
Each font is represented by an object.

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Let's add the Arabic font.

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,490
Each object must have three properties.

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,300
The first property is called Font Family.

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,700
The value for this property must be a valid CSS value.

27
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,510
It's recommended to provide alternative font families if a font can't be loaded.

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,640
Let's set the font to the following rubric sans serif.

29
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,760
Next, let's add a property called Slug.

30
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,700
As we learn thus far, the SLUG property will act as a unique identifier for our theme.

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,150
This is to help WordPress identify a font family.

32
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,020
Like most slugs, you should prefix a slug to avoid naming collisions.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,740
Let's set the slug to you Rubik.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,160
The last property is called name.

35
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,810
The value for this property should be a human readable name.

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,800
It will be displayed on the dropdown options for font families.

37
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,530
The name of our font family will be called Udemy Rubik.

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,620
We've successfully added our first font family.

39
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,750
Let's add another.

40
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:40,490
This time the font family will be exclusive to the site title block.

41
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,550
The settings are exactly the same.

42
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,720
In fact, let's make a copy of the typography object.

43
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,850
Afterward open the Blox object inside the settings property.

44
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,050
Not to be confused with the blocks object from the styles object.

45
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,690
We're going to modify the site title block inside this object paste in the typography object.

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,760
The topography object should be sitting side by side with the colored object.

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,740
The final step is to convert the values to the second font, which is Pacifico.

48
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,460
Change the font family from Rubik to Pacifico.

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,770
Change the slug from you, Rubik to you, Pacifico.

50
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,910
Lastly, change the name from Udemy Rubik to Udemy Pacifico.

51
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,270
If we did everything right, these options should be available in our theme in your browser.

52
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,710
Refresh the editor.

53
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,560
First, let's check the global style's sidebar.

54
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,580
Under the typography section, we can modify the settings for text and links.

55
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,330
Either section will have an option for changing the font family.

56
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,400
Looking closely at the font family option, our font family has been added.

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,120
Awesome.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,150
Let's review the settings for the site title block.

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,990
You may or may not be able to find the settings for the font family.

60
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:16,440
If that's the case, you can toggle the font family option by clicking on the three dots from the typography

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,040
panel.

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,010
The font family may be hidden if you were to click on this option.

63
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,370
The font family option should appear.

64
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,790
As you can see, our font family has been added.

65
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,250
The option for selecting the Rubik font will disappear.

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,100
This is important to remember.

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,130
Changing the font families for a specific block will override the options for the global fonts.

68
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,670
You can select the font family to apply it to our title.

69
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,520
However, the font will not be accurate.

70
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,140
The browser has fallen back to the other font specified in our value.

71
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,400
It does change.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,110
It's just not the right font.

73
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,650
This is because we haven't loaded the font into our theme.

74
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,590
Unfortunately, we will not be able to thoroughly test this option until the next section.

75
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,130
Don't worry, we'll definitely learn how to load custom fonts into a theme for now, as long as the

76
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,520
option is available within the editor, we're good to go.

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,650
So that's how you can add font families to the editor in the following lecture.

78
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,770
Let's continue our discussion of typography.
