00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,290
In this lecture, we are going to work on saving the block in the database.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,150
Unlike previous blocks, this block can be saved with client side rendering.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,850
We don't need access to the server for this block.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,410
In that case, we can safely save the blocks content in the database.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,660
Let's get started in the editor.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,060
Open the saved JS file.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,260
I've done most of the work for us.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,900
The name, title and bio are saved in the block.

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:35,380
Our job is to finish the rest of the block by saving the team members images and social media links.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,120
Let's start with the image.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,390
First, let's create the classes for the image.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,040
As a reminder, we applied classes to the image to change the shape.

13
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,390
Create a variable called image class with the following value.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,890
WP Image.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,400
Image.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,870
ID Image.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,540
The name of the shape must be added after the second class.

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,610
Here's where things become tricky.

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,560
The shape of the image comes from the parent block.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,350
This information is accessible via the blocks context.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,860
However, the block context is not available from the save function.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,420
It's only available to the edit function without the block context.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,820
We can't set the images shape.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,800
The solution to our problem is to store the images shape as an attribute.

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,740
The team member block will not be able to change the shape.

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,350
The parent block will continue to be responsible for setting this information.

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,510
We're storing a copy of the shape.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,100
For the sake of the save function, let's add the attribute to the block.

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,920
Open the block JSON file.

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,570
At the bottom of the attributes object.

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,180
Add an attribute called image shape.

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,470
The type for this attribute will be string.

33
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,260
The default value for the attribute will be hexagon.

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,900
The attribute is ready.

35
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,760
The next step is to update this attribute.

36
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,410
Open the edit file.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,420
Before returning the templates.

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:19,900
Let's call the set attributes function to set the image shape attribute to the context utility plus

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,210
slash image shape value.

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,690
Whenever the attributes change from the parent block, this information will be sent to children blocks.

41
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,870
The attributes stored locally in the block will always receive the latest updates from the parent block.

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,840
We can safely head back to the save function.

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,680
To use this attribute, the save function will have access to the latest value of an attribute.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,770
First, lets D structure the image shape attribute from the attributes object.

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,790
Next, let's update the image class variable by inserting the image shape variable into the string.

46
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,700
Lastly, we can update the block's template by adding the image at the top of the div tag with the author

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,720
meta class.

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,860
Add an expression.

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,810
Write the following expression.

50
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,910
Image your URL and.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Before rendering the image, we should check for an image.

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:33,260
If an image is not available for a team member, we shouldn't bother rendering an image after the and

53
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,940
operator add the image tag.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,260
Set the source attribute to the image URL attribute.

55
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,860
Next set the alt attribute to the image alt attributes.

56
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,270
Lastly, set the class name attribute to the image class attributes.

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,040
Great.

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,200
The image is ready.

59
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:07,010
The next step is to render the social media links search for the div tag with a class called Social

60
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,180
Links inside this tag.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,390
Let's begin looping through the social handles attribute with the map function.

62
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,800
The solution is going to be similar to the loop in the edit function with the exception of the input

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,000
field for modifying the attributes links inside the map function pass in an arrow function while accepting

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,820
the element as an argument called handle.

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,570
From within the function, return and anchor element.

66
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,420
Set the h ref attribute to the handle dot url property.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,900
Next, add an AI element with a class attribute.

68
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,730
The attributes value will be the following byebye handle dot icon.

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,900
After making those changes, the save function is complete.

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,530
We've successfully saved the image and the social media links and the next lecture.

71
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,690
We're going to optimize our solution by modifying the attributes sources.
