00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,970
In this lecture we are going to look at the pagination block in our template.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,800
We overlooked this block previously during the development of the query loop block.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,340
WordPress sneakily inserted this block into our template.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,470
However, we were going to insert this block anyway, so no harm, no foul.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,290
The pagination block functions as a child block of the query loop block.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:32,220
If it detects the query loop block, it will render links for the next and previous list of posts.

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,490
Visitors will be able to visit specific pages.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,970
I think the current location of this block is perfect.

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,030
All that's left is to modify the styles.

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,320
The HTML for the template can be found under a comment that says pagination.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:56,400
The links are wrapped with a parent element that will apply flex properties to properly spaced the links.

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,250
Our links will have a hover effect that will change the background color to a darker color.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,080
Unfortunately, not a single block offers custom hover options.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,740
We must apply hover effects with plain CSS.

15
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,240
Let's take a closer look at the pagination block.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,840
By default, the pagination block will act as a wrapper around the links with flex properties.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,490
We have the option of modifying these properties on the sidebar.

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:32,680
We can adjust the spacing by setting the justification to space between.

19
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:41,530
Next, we're going to disable the rap option to prevent the links from appearing on new lines.

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,530
Afterward, change the link color to you.

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,250
To me, Gray 500.

22
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,750
This color should make them lighter than the default color.

23
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,290
Up next, we can add arrows to the next and previous links.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,960
I think the arrows are a nice addition for this example.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,840
Let's set the arrows option to Chevron.

26
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,930
Additional classes don't need to be applied.

27
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,350
We can move on to the children blocks.

28
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:13,760
Next, we should remove the page numbers block.

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,700
There's nothing wrong with this block.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,860
If you'd like to keep it around, feel free to do so.

31
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,980
I'm removing it for the sake of consistency.

32
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,530
The static design did not have pagination numbers, therefore our theme won't either.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,980
This will leave us with the next and previous links.

34
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,300
Like I said before, we won't be able to modify the links to get the desired behavior.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,540
Let's apply the classes from the static design to the blocks in your text.

36
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,170
Editor Open the dot html file.

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,340
Search for a comment that says pagination.

38
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,450
Let's copy the classes from the anchor tag.

39
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,410
Either one works there exactly the same.

40
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,030
After copying these classes, head back to the browser.

41
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,050
We will apply both classes to the previous page and next page blocks.

42
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,190
After applying those classes.

43
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,600
Save your templates.

44
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,950
These classes will add a hover effect as well as add padding.

45
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,580
Unfortunately, the links don't support padding either.

46
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,020
Our pagination links are complete.

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,680
We can start moving on to the other sections of our site.

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,030
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
