00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.590
In this lecture, we're going to explore the files and folders from WordPress.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.190
After doing so, it will become clear where we can begin.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.230
This lecture is meant to give a general overview of WordPress structure.

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.800
We're going to start with the files in the root directory.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.210
The files in the root directory contain code for preparing WordPress.

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.410
WordPress needs to go through a few phases before delivering a page to the user.

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.160
These files are responsible for delivering the pages on the front side of WordPress.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.790
There's not much else to say about these files.

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.930
We'll never have to worry about them.

10
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.020
Next, let's explore the three directories in our project.

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.940
There are three folders called WP Admin, WP content and WP includes.

12
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.030
Let's start with the WP includes folder.

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.670
WordPress defines hundreds of functions.

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.220
You can find most of them inside this folder.

15
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.310
We should distinguish between the files inside this folder and the files in the root directory of the

16
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.150
project.

17
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.180
The files in the root directory are responsible for loading a page on the browser, whereas the files

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.380
inside the WP includes folder contains function definitions that WordPress uses to process data.

19
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.900
Many of the files inside this folder can't do anything by themselves.

20
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.840
They do not render pages.

21
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.890
If you attempt to view these files in the browser, it's likely you won't see anything moving on.

22
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.220
The next directory is called WP Admin.

23
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.560
This folder contains code for the WordPress admin dashboard.

24
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.900
WordPress will separate the code for loading a landing page and the admin dashboard.

25
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.800
There isn't a reason for every user to load the same code as an administrator.

26
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.510
The last folder is the WP content folder.

27
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.700
Plugins, themes and media files can be found inside this directory.

28
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.980
We'll be working inside this directory for the majority of the course.

29
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.699
If you search through this directory, you will find a few plug ins and themes.

30
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.440
Feel free to check them out.

31
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.300
They're a great way of learning how other developers tackle themes and plug ins.

32
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.710
I highly don't recommend editing files outside this directory.

33
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.480
WordPress may override your changes.

34
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.940
The exception to this rule is the WP config PHP file.

35
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.970
As you can imagine, we're going to be working inside this directory to develop a WordPress theme and

36
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.630
plug in.

37
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.090
In the next lecture we're going to begin developing a theme in the Themes Directory.
