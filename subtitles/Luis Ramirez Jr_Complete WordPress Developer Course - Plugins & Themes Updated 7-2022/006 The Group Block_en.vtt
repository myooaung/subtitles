00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.110
In this lecture, we are going to add the group block for centering our blocks.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.920
On the home page, you may have noticed that our content is completely centered from the header to the

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.430
footer.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.110
Naturally, WordPress blocks do not allow you to center your content.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.290
We must apply classes to achieve this effect.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
Before we do, we need to ask ourselves if the centering should be applied to the row.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.710
BLOCK The answer is no.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.270
To understand why, I'm going to quickly modify the top bar element with the developer tools, I will

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.730
add a fixed width to the element.

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.990
The content for our page is going to have a fixed width.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.350
If we were to apply a fixed width to the row block, the background color wouldn't be able to fully

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.060
stretch across the page.

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.450
As you can see in my example, the bar looks awkward.

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.940
Therefore we need to add a child div tag that focuses on censoring the content.

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.160
Here's an overview of the static templates.

16
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.270
The outer div tag represents the row block.

17
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.980
The inner div tag is responsible for censoring the blocks inserted into it.

18
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.320
To achieve this effect, we're applying five classes called Container MKs Auto Flex Items Center and

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
justify between these classes are defined by our themes CSS.

20
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.200
The question becomes which block will help us achieve this effect?

21
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.570
Unfortunately, WordPress does not have a block with settings for censoring content.

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.330
This means we must use our classes.

23
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.080
Luckily, WordPress offers a generic block called the group block.

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.550
If you have heavy experience with HTML, I would say that the group block is the equivalent of a div

25
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.180
tag.

26
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.390
It's a very generic tag for a grouping content.

27
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.090
If you don't know what block to use, the group block may be suitable for the job.

28
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.700
Let's try adding the group block to the row block as a child in the full site editor, add it to the

29
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.480
template.

30
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.570
Afterward.

31
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.830
Let's apply the classes to the group.

32
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.630
Underneath our top bar, we can grab the classes from the HTML block.

33
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.110
You can find it on the second div tag.

34
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.600
Copy the classes to your clipboard.

35
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.260
Next, switch back to the group lock under the advanced panel.

36
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.200
Paste the classes into the class field.

37
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.940
We won't be able to see the effects until blocks have been added for testing purposes.

38
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.600
Let's add a paragraph block with dummy text inside the group block.

39
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.780
The techs won't be visible since the default color is dark.

40
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.500
There's not enough contrast.

41
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.670
Let's modify the text color of the paragraph block for this example, I'm going to set the color to

42
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.850
you.

43
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.530
To me, Gray 200.

44
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.770
Lastly, save the templates.

45
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.800
On the front end.

46
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.390
Refresh the home page.

47
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.270
Perfect.

48
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.800
The paragraph block is centered on the page.

49
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.800
It aligns perfectly with the rest of our content.

50
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.330
If we add more blocks, they should never leak outside the group block.
