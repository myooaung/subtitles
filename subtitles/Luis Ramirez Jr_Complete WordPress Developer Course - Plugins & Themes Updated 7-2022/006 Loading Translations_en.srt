00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,950
In this lecture we will prepare our plugin to load the translations from the languages folder.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,520
At the moment, WordPress does not automatically load translations.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,380
We must instruct WordPress where to find our translations.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,480
Like most situations, there's a hook for loading translations.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,900
Let's get started by opening the main plugin file.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,780
At the bottom of the hook section at an action hook called in it.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,890
WordPress recommends the init hook as the most appropriate hook for loading translations.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,180
The name of our function will be called upload PHP translations.

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,820
As the name suggests, we are going to load translations for our PHP code.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,500
Loading translations for the front end is a different process.

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,930
For now we are going to focus on loading translations for the server.

12
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,250
Let's create a file called load translations.

13
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,400
PHP inside the includes folder.

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,390
Nix.

15
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,110
Define the upload php translations function.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,320
Inside this function, run a function called load plugin text domain.

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,960
This function will load the translations for our plugin.

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,850
There are three arguments.

19
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,610
The first argument is the text domain.

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,100
Let's pass in the utility plus text domain.

21
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,680
The second argument is deprecated.

22
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,830
WordPress does not recommend providing a value for this argument other than false.

23
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:51,020
The third argument is the path to the languages folder relative to the plugins directory for our plugin.

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,480
The path is the following Udemy plus slash languages.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,650
We're finished with registering our translations.

26
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,330
However, we don't have translations for any language.

27
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,860
The file in the languages directory is a template.

28
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,410
The purpose of this file is to be a starting point for translations in other languages.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,220
In the next lecture, let's begin adding a new language.
