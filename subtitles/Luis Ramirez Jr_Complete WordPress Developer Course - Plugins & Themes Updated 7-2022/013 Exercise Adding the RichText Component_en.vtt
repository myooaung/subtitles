00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.689
In this lecture, we are going to add the rich text component for modifying the content inside the page

2
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:07.220
header.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.620
Adding this component to our block is nothing new to us.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.320
Therefore, I think it's a great opportunity.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.570
As an exercise, I want you to add the rich text component to our block.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.600
The client should be able to save the content in the block, pause the video and give it a try.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.530
Good luck.

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.310
Welcome back.

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.250
Were you able to add the component?

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.700
Congrats if you did.

11
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.890
Otherwise, let's go through the solution together.

12
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.120
To begin, we are going to add an attribute for storing the content from the rich text components.

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.760
Open the block JSON file.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.610
Inside the attributes object at a property called content.

15
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.990
Next set the property type to string.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.690
Normally we would change the source.

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.680
However, our block will be rendered on the server.

18
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.340
WordPress will not be able to retrieve an attributes value from a non existent source.

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.380
For this reason we are going to store the content inside the HTML comments.

20
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.230
Let's open the index js file.

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.490
The next step is to add the rich text component to the edit component at the top of the file.

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.100
Import the rich text component from the WordPress slash block editor package.

23
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.390
Next, we can add this component to our block.

24
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.680
However, the template is not ready.

25
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.010
We should grab the template before adding the rich text component.

26
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.460
Head on over to the full site editor.

27
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.290
We are going to view the category template.

28
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.150
This template contains the static copy of the page header under the header.

29
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.650
Copy the code from the html block without the html comment.

30
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.509
Next.

31
00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.580
Head back to the index file.

32
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.430
Inside the fragment elements.

33
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.520
Let's replace the div tag with our templates.

34
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.130
On the root element.

35
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.810
We should replace the class attribute with the block props variable.

36
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.780
Make sure to include the spread operator.

37
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.710
Next, let's modify the class attributes for the remaining elements with the class name attribute.

38
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.520
Great.

39
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.940
The template is ready.

40
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.280
We can proceed to add the rich text component.

41
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.920
The portion of the template that should be replaced with this component is the H1 tag.

42
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.610
Next, let's add the tag name property to add the H one tag as the container.

43
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.800
Moving on, add the placeholder property.

44
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.310
The value for the placeholder should be translatable.

45
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.390
Let's import the double underscore function for translating text at the top of the function.

46
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.310
Import this function from the wordpress slash ie 18 end package.

47
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.770
Head back to the placeholder property.

48
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.990
Let's translate the following text heading.

49
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.500
After adding the placeholder, we can begin to add the attributes to the component inside the argument

50
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.010
list.

51
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.930
Let's structure the attributes object and set attributes function.

52
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.990
For readability, we should de structure the attributes, object for the content attribute.

53
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.350
Next, let's set the value property on the rich text component to the content attribute.

54
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.900
To update the attribute, we must add the on change event with an arrow function.

55
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.920
The aero function will be provided the new value as an argument.

56
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.070
Let's use this value to update the content attribute with the set attributes function.

57
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.930
We've performed this action a few times.

58
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.780
I think this would be a good opportunity to introduce a cool trick of JavaScript.

59
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.100
So far we've been updating a property called Content.

60
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.190
The value for this property is the new value argument.

61
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.750
There is a shorter syntax for writing the same line of code.

62
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.260
Let's update the argument to be called content.

63
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.960
Next, let's remove the new value argument.

64
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.770
If we were to omit the value for a property, JavaScript would search for a variable called contents.

65
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.970
The value for this property will be the variable.

66
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.350
It's the equivalent of writing content contents.

67
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.400
If the name of the property matches a variable name.

68
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.870
We can shorten the syntax to the name of the property.

69
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.280
I prefer to use the shorthand syntax for the rest of this course.

70
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.740
I'm going to be using the shorthand syntax for updating attributes.

71
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.730
If this is too confusing, that's perfectly fine.

72
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.290
You can continue to stick with the longer syntax.

73
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.040
Readability is always preferred over clever syntax.

74
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.130
After making those changes, we can test our block, navigate to the experimental page.

75
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.480
Insert the page header block into the page.

76
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.290
We can freely type inside the block to edit the content.

77
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.150
Perfect.

78
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.620
I know I went through the solution very quickly.

79
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.740
However, it's nothing we haven't dealt with before.

80
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.640
Hopefully you understood every step in the next lecture.

81
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.680
Let's begin adding options to the sidebar to toggle the editable content.
