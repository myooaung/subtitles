1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,680
In this lecture, we are going to add a template to the inner blocks component.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,670
At the moment, the team members group block is always empty.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,230
Users must manually add blocks.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,600
We can safely assume that users may want to add blocks upon inserting this block.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,960
WordPress makes the same assumption for its own blocks.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,030
For example, let's try adding the buttons block to the page.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,890
After adding this block, the parents block will have a single child lock.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,040
Upon insertion, we can force WordPress to add blocks to the inner blocks component by specifying a

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,730
template.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,340
Let's give that a try in your editor.

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,930
Open the index js file for the team members group block.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,880
Scroll to the edit function, let's modify the properties of the inner blocks component on this component

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,040
at a property called Template.

14
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:03,810
The value for this property will be an array of blocks to add to the inner blocks component.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,240
In this array we can specify a block by adding another array.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,040
Let's try adding the team member block.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,000
The first item in the array must be the full name of the block, passing the following Udemy plus slash

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
team member.

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,990
The second item in the array can be an object of attributes to override from the block.

20
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,170
This value is completely optional.

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,720
If you don't provide values for a block's attributes, WordPress will use the default values.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,480
For this example, let's add an object.

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,570
Set the name attribute to John Doe.

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,300
The title attribute will have a value of CEO of Udemy.

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,750
Lastly, the bio attribute will be set to the following value.

26
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,020
This is an example of a bio.

27
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,620
Just so that our block isn't alone.

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,110
Let's add two more copies of the team member block without attribute values.

29
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,730
Well for testing our code.

30
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,970
There's another property worth looking at for this block.

31
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,880
We aren't going to need it, but it's still nice to know.

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,210
I'm referring to a property called Template Lock.

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,800
We may want users to change the templates by adding or moving blocks.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,600
By default, users will be able to remove the blocks or add new ones.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,390
We can set this property to all to completely prevent blocks from being removed or added.

36
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,430
Alternatively, we can set this property to insert to prevent removal.

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,630
Users will still be able to add new blocks for this block.

38
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,460
This option won't be necessary.

39
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,820
We are going to give users complete freedom over the blocks.

40
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,640
Let's try refreshing the page in the browser.

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,620
Insert the team members group block.

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,300
After doing so, three blocks have been added to the inner blocks component.

43
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,880
The first block will have the attribute values from the templates, whereas the other blocks will fall

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,770
back to their default values.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,150
Adding a template is a great way to push your users in the right direction.

46
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,050
Let's continue working on the block in the next set of lectures.
