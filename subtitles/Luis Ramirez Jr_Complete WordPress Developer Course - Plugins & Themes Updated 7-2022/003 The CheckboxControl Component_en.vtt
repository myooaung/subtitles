00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.030
In this lecture, we are going to explore another component for our toggling values.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.630
WordPress has a component for rendering a checkbox.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.090
Luckily, this component will not give us the same problems as the select control component.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.010
It's very simple to use.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.050
Let's try using this component for updating these show off attributes.

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.010
It's redundant, but this is a great opportunity for exploring additional components inside your editor.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.650
Open the index dot js file.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.720
At the top of the file, we are going to import the checkbox control component from the components package.

9
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.760
We've got everything we need.

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.490
Let's begin using the checkbox control component.

11
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.480
We are going to insert this component below the select control component.

12
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.740
There are four properties that were going to add.

13
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.390
The first property is called label.

14
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.660
WordPress will render a text next to the checkbox.

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.690
Let's set this property to the double underscore function with the following translated text show log

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.760
in slash register link.

17
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.150
Next, let's add a property called Help.

18
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.170
This property will display text below the checkbox.

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.420
We should use this option to tell the client if the link is displayed.

20
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.700
Let's use a ternary operator.

21
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.640
The condition will check if the show off attribute is true.

22
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.100
If it is, we will output the following translated text showing link.

23
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.690
Otherwise we will output the following text hiding link.

24
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.540
This property is optional.

25
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.220
However, I like to use this property to tell the client what will happen.

26
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.100
The next property is called checked.

27
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.460
This property will tell Guttenberg if the checkbox should be ticked.

28
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.199
It's the equivalent of the value property for other control components.

29
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.890
Let's set this property to the show off attributes.

30
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.100
The last property is called on change as usual.

31
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.690
We are going to pass in a function that accepts the new value.

32
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.970
Inside the body of the function.

33
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.090
We are going to update these show off property.

34
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.040
I'll be using these shorthand syntax for adding a property to an object.

35
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.170
We don't have to worry about type conversion by default.

36
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.880
The checkbox control component will emit a boolean.

37
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.500
You're more than welcome to check the data type.

38
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.680
We're finished with the checkbox.

39
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.770
Let's try giving it a test in the browser.

40
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.500
Refresh the experimental page.

41
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.490
We can select the block to view its settings on the sidebar, toggle the checkbox.

42
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.140
As we do so, the Help text will update to reflect the changes.

43
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.690
The checkbox control component is very similar to the toggle control component.

44
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.230
It's capable of toggling values for our attributes.

45
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.650
There isn't a difference between them besides their appearance.

46
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.470
We're finished with adding options to the block.

47
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.840
The next step is to toggle their appearance from within the editor and on the front end.

48
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.310
In the next lecture, let's tackle toggling the links from the block.
