00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.910
In this lecture, we are going to quickly address the editing experience for the templates.

2
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:12.120
You may have noticed it during the creation of the navigation menu for the top bar section.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.900
The headers appearance does not match the header on the front end.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.540
For example, the menu items do not have a faint border in the search field.

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.210
The icon is not aligned to the right.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.660
In addition, the label and button should be hidden.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.990
These problems don't persist on the front end.

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.720
Therefore, we are giving mixed results.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.730
So what's the big idea?

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
Generally blocks have different templates for the front end and editor.

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.360
In a way this makes sense.

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.210
Blocks must provide a UI for editing the content, whereas the front end does not.

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.650
Therefore, we're bound to have a different set of classes and tags.

14
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.950
Here's a quick example of a link.

15
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.240
The HTML has been simplified for readability.

16
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.410
In a nutshell, this is the HTML generated by WordPress.

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.470
As you can see, they are completely different.

18
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.980
The front end version uses an unordered list.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.330
On the other hand, the editor uses a series of div tags.

20
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.670
The classes will be different too.

21
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
There are too many differences between both versions.

22
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.100
No wonder our CSS doesn't work.

23
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.760
This problem is mostly unavoidable.

24
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.780
The solution is to write additional CSS for the editor.

25
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.360
Luckily, this code can be separate from our themes.

26
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.460
CSS.

27
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.760
The process of fixing the editors styles can be tedious.

28
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.770
We must manually experiment with CSS styles to achieve the desired design.

29
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.300
For your convenience.

30
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.270
I'm going to provide the completed CSS in the resource section of this lecture.

31
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360
I provide a link to the completed CSS.

32
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.060
Copy the code into your clipboard.

33
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.390
Next, let's create a file for storing this CCIS back in your text editor create a file called Editor

34
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.720
CCIS Inside the assets directory.

35
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.690
Paste the CSIS into this file.

36
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.050
We're going to keep the CSIS in a separate file.

37
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.910
It won't be necessary to load this file on the front end.

38
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.610
The next step is to load this file.

39
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.320
Open the setup file.

40
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.660
Let's update the array passed into the add editor style function by including our file.

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.790
After making those changes.

42
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.680
Let's refresh the ED.

43
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.160
Our themes, design issues have been alleviated.

44
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.810
This type of problem is going to occur for your themes, especially if they are complex.

45
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.220
Overall, the solution is simple.

46
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.720
You must create a separate file for handling the editors markup.

47
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.060
The access code I provided will handle future scenarios.

48
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.900
If you're curious about how I could figure out the styles, it mainly was experimentation.

49
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.760
First, I had to manually inspect the document for the various elements and classes.

50
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.370
Afterward, I experimented with different styles until I got the desired results.

51
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.970
Let's jump into the next lecture to finish the header.
