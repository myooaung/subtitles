00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,230
In this lecture, we are going to add a component called toggle control.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,630
I'm viewing an example from WordPress Storybook.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,070
The toggle control component will render a slider for turning an option on or off.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,450
Next to the slider, there's a label.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,700
Overall, it's a simple design.

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,660
Our goal is to ask the client if they're interested in displaying the category.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,750
This option will be presented with the toggle control component.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,800
If they enable this option, the page header will display the current category.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,760
Otherwise, clients will be able to write custom content.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,060
Let's get started in your editor.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,680
Open the block JSON file.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,090
As usual, we should create an attribute for storing the options value.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,570
Create an attribute called show category.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,730
The type property will be set to boolean.

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,540
A Boolean is a perfect data type for our attribute.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:08,830
I always recommend using booleans for inputs like the toggle control component or a checkbox.

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,380
Next, lets set the default value to false.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,790
By default, the page header block should not show the category.

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,800
It should allow clients to write custom content after adding our attribute.

20
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,280
Let's switch over to the index JS file.

21
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,510
First let's import the contents we will need for our block from the block editor package.

22
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,480
Grab the Inspector Controls component.

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,320
Next, we are going to import the panel body and toggle control components from the WordPress slash

24
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,710
components package.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,770
These components will be necessary for building our block settings.

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,310
Let's move on to the edit function from the attributes object.

27
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,450
Add the show category attribute to the structure list.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
We are going to need this attribute for the toggle control component.

29
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:15,580
Next, let's add the inspector controls component above the template for the block.

30
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,740
This component will help us insert content into the sidebar before rendering the control.

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,650
Insert the panel body component for isolating our block settings from other panels.

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,210
Next, we should add the title property for the panel's title.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,220
Let's set the title to the double underscore function with the following text.

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,090
General.

35
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,020
The typical setup for the sidebar is ready.

36
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,330
Let's get into using the toggle control component by inserting it into the panel body component.

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,230
The toggle control component will add the UI element we saw at the beginning of the lecture.

38
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,790
This UI element can be customized with a few set of properties.

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,830
For starters, let's add a label with a property called label.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,530
As we do with all text, we are going to call the double underscore function with the following value

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,180
show category.

42
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,410
The label property will render the text next to the slider.

43
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,600
After adding the label, we should allow the control to manipulate the show category attributes.

44
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,800
At this point, you may have noticed a pattern with components defined by WordPress.

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,470
Most components have a property for setting the initial value of a control.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,070
In addition, there is any event for updating the attribute after the controls value has changed.

47
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,570
This is a very common pattern you'll come across for most components.

48
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
The toggle control component is no difference.

49
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,600
On this component, we can set the checked property to the show category attributes.

50
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,280
This property will set the current value of the control.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,020
It's expecting the value to be a boolean.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,030
Luckily, our attributes data type is also a boolean.

53
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,579
Moving on, let's add an event called On Change.

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,930
This event gets fired on updates.

55
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,940
We can execute a function on this event.

56
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,750
Let's pass in an arrow function that accepts the new value.

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:33,060
Next, we can update the show category attribute with the new value.

58
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,240
As we learned before, we can shorten this syntax by renaming the argument to show category.

59
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,260
Afterward, the property can be inserted without a value.

60
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,310
This is the equivalent of what we had before.

61
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,910
I just wanted to show you the shorthand syntax again.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,370
After making those changes, our component is ready.

63
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,530
It's that simple.

64
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,550
And the browser.

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,250
Let's refresh the experimental page.

66
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,490
Next, let's add the page header block.

67
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,570
On the sidebar, we are going to find a panel called General.

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,810
The toggle control component will render the UI we saw on WordPress Storybook.

69
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,910
We can interact with this component to enable or disable the category option.

70
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,850
Let's verify the attribute gets updated.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm going to enable this option next from the block list.

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,320
Copy the page header block to your clipboard.

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,190
If you were to view the block's HTML comment, you should see something like this.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,500
Originally, the default value of the show category attribute was false.

75
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,720
However, by enabling the slider, the attributes value has been set to true.

76
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,810
This means our control is working as intended.

77
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,890
That's awesome.

78
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,780
We can start applying this attribute to our block.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,960
In the next lecture, let's start using our attribute to toggle the content.
