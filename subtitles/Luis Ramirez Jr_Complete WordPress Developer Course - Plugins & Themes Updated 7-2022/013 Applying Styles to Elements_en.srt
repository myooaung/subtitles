1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,800
In this lecture, we're going to apply styles to regular elements.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,430
Thus far, we've been applying styles on a global level or block level.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,720
In some cases, you may want to apply styles to specific elements.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,100
At the moment, WordPress supports custom styles for links and headings.

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,700
Other elements are not supported for this demonstration.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,970
We are going to change the default color of our links.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,220
Let's set the text color to the primary color from our theme inside your editor.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,620
Open the theme JSON file.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,310
Next inside the Styles object.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,040
Add a new object called Elements.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,230
Inside this object, we must specify the name of the element we'd like to apply styles to.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,800
Surprisingly, WordPress has a special name for links.

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,740
Technically, the name of the element for links is called anchor.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,790
However, WordPress uses the word link.

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,830
After adding the name, we can start applying styles to the link.

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,680
Before we do, I want to quickly mention the names of headings.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,050
We can change the headings of a document with their HTML names.

18
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,230
For example, if you would like to change the color of the H one tag, the name would be H one.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,330
Back to our previous example.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,050
Inside this object we can change the colour and background.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,490
The text colour can be changed with the text property.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,330
The value will be the following.

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,600
WP presets colour you primary.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,570
Next.

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,940
Let's refresh the full site editor.

26
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,090
Our site title block has been modified.

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,700
The color has changed from blue to our primary color.

28
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,930
Changing the links will apply to all blocks for further demonstration.

29
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,290
Let's try adding a paragraph block with a link.

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,570
Perfect.

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,100
The link for the block matches the color from our theme settings.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,650
Hopefully as time goes on, WordPress will support styling for all or most elements.

33
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,490
In the next lecture, let's finalize our discussion of colors by applying them to borders.
