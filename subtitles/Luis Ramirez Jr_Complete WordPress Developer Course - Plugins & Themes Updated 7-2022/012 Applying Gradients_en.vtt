00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.030
In this lecture we are going to start applying gradients.

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.320
I should mention that colors can be applied to blocks.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.100
It's not necessary to apply colors on a global level.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.910
Let's try applying these settings to specific blocks.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.690
In your editor, open the theme dot json file.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.770
We're going to update these styles.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.130
Object adding new property called Blocks.

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.010
The Blox property will be an object that contains a list of blocks.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.160
The process is exactly similar to modifying a block settings inside this object.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.450
We must add the name of the block.

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.880
For this example, let's try changing the default color of a button.

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.960
The name of the button block is called Core Button.

13
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.570
You can refer to the reference for the official name.

14
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.290
Next, we can start changing the default stylings.

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.640
The properties for modifying a block's colours are the same as changing them on a global level.

16
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.220
We can modify the colour through the colours property.

17
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.400
Unlike before.

18
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.350
Gradients must be specified through a different property.

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.100
We can't set the background colour of a button with the background property.

20
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.880
Instead we need to add a property called gradients.

21
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.510
The value for this property must be a valid CSS value for gradient.

22
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.060
Let's try reusing our gradients as a reminder.

23
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.000
WordPress will create variables from your custom colors, gradients and dual tones.

24
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.150
All gradients are prefixed with the WP preset gradient keyword.

25
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.240
The full name of our gradient is WP preset gradient you summer dog.

26
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.540
After making those adjustments, let's try refreshing the page.

27
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.390
If we were to add a new button to the template, the background color should be our new gradient.

28
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.820
As expected, our gradient has been applied perfect.

29
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.490
In my opinion, the gradient doesn't work well for the button.

30
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.540
However, I'm going to leave it as the default background colour.

31
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.480
For example purposes, feel free to remove the gradient from the block in the next lecture.

32
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.660
Let's keep applying colours to our elements.
