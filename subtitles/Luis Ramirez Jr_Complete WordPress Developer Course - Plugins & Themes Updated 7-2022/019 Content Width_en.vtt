00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.790
In this lecture, we're going to start exploring another section of our theme file by adding layout

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.660
options.

3
00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:12.820
Layout options can configure the width of our content margins, padding and block gaps.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.930
To begin, we're going to set the content width of our posts in the WordPress admin dashboard.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.640
Try editing a post.

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.780
We're not going to be viewing the full site ed for this example and said these settings will apply to

7
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.920
post content.

8
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.900
You may have noticed this already, but the content sits on the left side of the document.

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.180
The width of our post takes up the entire page.

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.070
In reality, the width of your post may not be full width.

11
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.310
Instead, you may want the width to be fixed.

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.070
WordPress provides theme developers with two options for changing the width of the content.

13
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.880
These settings apply to posts, but not the full site editor.

14
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.260
That's perfectly fine.

15
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.390
We want the full site editor to have complete control of the editor, not a portion.

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.650
Let's begin configuring the width of our posts in your editor.

17
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.200
Open the theme JSON file.

18
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.460
We can add layout settings by adding a property called layout to these settings object.

19
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
The first setting is called content size.

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220
The content size property configures the default width for all blocks.

21
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.790
Instead of having a block stretch from one side of the page to the other, we can set the maximum width

22
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.010
for our theme.

23
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.860
Most posts should have a max width.

24
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.290
The value for this property will vary from theme to theme.

25
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.310
Let's set the width to 800 x.

26
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.580
You're more than welcome to use other units of measurement.

27
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.630
For example, you can use REM.

28
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.320
However, for our theme, pixels are more than suitable.

29
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.650
The second property is called wide size.

30
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.470
This property is optional.

31
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.060
If you add it in, WordPress will allow blocks to extend outside the bounds of the content.

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.860
You can configure how wide a block can stretch.

33
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.009
If that doesn't make sense, don't worry.

34
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.240
I'll provide a demonstration after configuring our options for our theme.

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.730
Let's set the wide size property to 100 x.

36
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.330
Time to test our code.

37
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.080
Where you press the post editor in your browser.

38
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.850
After refreshing the page, things have completely changed.

39
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.870
The width of our blocks has been constrained to our themes settings.

40
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.130
Adding the width to our theme will help WordPress understand our theme.

41
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.570
It will help the user understand how a page will look on the front end.

42
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.870
At the moment, the default width of our blocks is equal to the value of the content size property.

43
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.440
Let's check if the wide size property is working.

44
00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.740
First, we need to add a block that supports wide alignment in your post, add an image.

45
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.210
The Image block is an example of a block that has alignment settings on the toolbar.

46
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.080
For the block, we can select the alignment option for the various values.

47
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
If we look closely, the wide option is available.

48
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.470
We're impressed will even give us the size by default.

49
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.200
WordPress disables the wide option.

50
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.490
Adding the wide size property to your theme will enable this option.

51
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.980
If we click on it, the image widens.

52
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.970
It has extended outside the bounds of the original content width.

53
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.750
Perfect.

54
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.530
We use successfully added support for content alignments.

55
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.820
Let's continue exploring layout options in upcoming lectures.
