00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lecture, we are going to quickly add the search form block to the search template.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,960
This process shouldn't take long, so let's get into it in the full site.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,380
Editor Open the search template for our theme.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,420
On this page, we added the search form template with the HTML block.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,470
This block can be found above the list of posts.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,910
Let's remove the HTML block.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,180
Next, let's insert the search form block above the list of posts.

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,390
Feel free to modify the colors.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,250
I'm going to leave the block in its default state.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,460
Next from the list, sidebar, select and copy all the blocks into your clipboard.

11
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,290
After copying the blocks to your clipboard, open the unity theme folder in your editor.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,480
We are not inside the plugin folder.

13
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,970
Make sure you switched over to your themes folder inside the templates directory.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,790
Open the search dot html file.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,910
Replace the existing content with the new set of locks.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,400
Our template is ready.

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,370
Time to give our form a test in the browser.

18
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,380
Navigate to the home page.

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,420
In the header.

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,610
Let's search for something random.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,660
This will take us to the search page which contains our form.

22
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,850
Inside the form, the search query has been added to the input.

23
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,460
We can freely modify the input to view a different set of results.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,250
Let's try submitting this form to generate a new set of results.

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,380
Perfect.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,160
Our block has a fully functioning search form.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,750
We've completed our first block with server side rendering.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,420
It's a completely different approach than client side rendering.

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,030
The process heavily involves PHP.

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,590
It's a great solution for developing blocks that require dynamic content.

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,460
Let's start developing our next block in the next lecture.

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,900
Before moving on, you can point your text editor to the plugin file.

33
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,240
We are not going to work on the theme.
