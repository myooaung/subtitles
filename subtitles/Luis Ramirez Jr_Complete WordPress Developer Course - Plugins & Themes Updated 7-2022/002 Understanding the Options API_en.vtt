00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.870
In this lecture we are going to talk about the Options API.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.070
This API was introduced for adding additional settings to WordPress.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.290
Not all settings are related to the content of a page.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.220
Some settings may affect other areas of WordPress in the resource section of this lecture.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.630
I provide a link to the official documentation page for this API.

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.940
Let's read the summary together.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.980
The options API is a simple and standardized way of storing data in the database.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
The API makes it easy to create access, update and delete options.

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.160
All the data is stored in the WP Options table under a given custom name.

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.770
This page contains the technical documentation needed to use the options API.

11
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.260
To summarize, we can add data to the database to store our plugin settings.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.430
It's common practice to create a table for storing the settings of a site.

13
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.980
While this practice may seem appropriate for a web app, it's overkill for WordPress.

14
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.110
Sites may have dozens of plugins installed.

15
00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
If each plugin created a table, the database would become cluttered.

16
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.820
WordPress avoids this issue by standardizing an API for creating data.

17
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.710
Let's look at our database.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.700
The description referred to a specific table called WP Options.

19
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.950
Inside this table, we can find various settings from WordPress.

20
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.430
As you can see, the structure of the table is simple.

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.800
We have a column for the name of the settings and another column for storing the value.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.350
Each record contains one value.

23
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.230
It is possible to store multiple values within a single record.

24
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630
Interacting with this table does not require custom SQL queries.

25
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.780
WordPress has a set of functions for adding, modifying and removing data from this table.

26
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.260
In the next lecture, we are going to begin adding custom settings to this table for our plugin.
