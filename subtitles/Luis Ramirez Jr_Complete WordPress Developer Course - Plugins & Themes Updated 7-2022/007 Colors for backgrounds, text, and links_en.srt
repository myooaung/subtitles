00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,040
In this lecture we will explore the color palette for different CSS properties.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,110
WordPress allows us to toggle the palette for backgrounds, text and links.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,420
In addition, these settings can be modified on a global level or block level.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,810
Let's get into it.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,100
In the WordPress admin dashboard, let's look at the various color settings available.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,040
For example, under the Global Styles sidebar, we can change the color of the background, color and

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,730
text.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,870
We're not limited to these CSS properties.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,740
Links are supported too.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,530
Through our theme JSON file, we can enable or disable each property.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,080
Let's try playing around with these settings.

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,660
Open the theme file in your editor.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,740
Before adding new properties.

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,020
Let's minimize the pallet section.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,150
In most editors, you can fold your code by pressing the button on the left side.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,110
This feature doesn't delete code, it simply hides it.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,590
I'll be using this feature throughout most of this course.

18
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,400
Moving on, let's add three properties to the color object called background text and link.

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,100
Each property will be set to true.

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,090
These properties will toggle the colour palette for their respective properties by default.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,740
The background and text properties are enabled.

22
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,410
The link property is disabled.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,950
For this example, we're going to allow users to modify all colours before testing our code.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,460
Let's learn how to enable these properties for a block.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:43,720
For example, the site title block supports colours for text and links.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:51,610
However, the link property is disabled inside the colour object for the site title block and the link

27
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,310
property with a value of true.

28
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,600
Let's try testing our code.

29
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,960
Inside the ED let's do the color options from the global styles sidebar.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,910
As you can see, we can manipulate the background text and link color.

31
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,810
Up next, let's try viewing the settings for the site title lock.

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,240
Previously, the link option was not available.

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,640
However, by enabling it in our theme JSON file, we've allowed users to change the color of the title.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,250
Feel free to play around with the settings.

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,940
Setting the background and text properties to true is overkill for our theme.

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,860
However, I'm going to leave these options alone.

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,680
For example purposes, let's continue exploring additional options in the next lecture.
