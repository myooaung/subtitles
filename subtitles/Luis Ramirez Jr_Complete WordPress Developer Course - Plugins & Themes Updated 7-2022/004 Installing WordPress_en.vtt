1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.620
In this lecture, we are going to be installing WordPress.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.470
As I mentioned in the previous lecture, I will be using local.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.500
If you're following along with me, we can walk through the installation process together.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.940
I have the app opened on my computer.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.930
Your copy of the program may look slightly different than mine.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
I've already created a couple of projects with local.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.870
We can create a new site by clicking on the plus button at the bottom left corner.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.210
Almost immediately we will be asked to give our site a name for this course.

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.880
I'm going to set the name to Udemy.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.680
Below the input, there are additional advanced options.

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.150
I don't recommend modifying these settings unless you know what you're doing.

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.070
It's unnecessary to alter these options.

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.590
Let's continue to the next step.

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.110
Afterward, we can start configuring our environments.

15
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.290
Like I said before, WordPress needs additional software to be fully functional.

16
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.770
Specifically, it's going to need three programs.

17
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.870
Let's go through them one by one.

18
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.930
I'm going to select the custom option.

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.280
According to local.

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.680
It's going to install three programs.

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.540
Local will install PHP, a web server and a database.

22
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.720
The first program is called PHP.

23
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.840
PHP is a programming language for the web.

24
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.550
In general, programming languages are designed for giving instructions to a machine to perform actions.

25
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.000
For example, we can tell a machine to send an email, create a user, or generate a page.

26
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.910
There are dozens of programming languages available, so why PHP?

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.630
WordPress is written with PHP.

28
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.640
If our goal is to modify or extend WordPress, we must learn PHP.

29
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760
We can't use a different language.

30
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.780
Luckily, the PHP is a very popular programming language.

31
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.220
In fact, 78% of sites are powered by this language.

32
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.770
Almost eight out of ten websites are using PHP.

33
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.639
There's no shortage of information on PHP development.

34
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.740
It's considered beginner friendly.

35
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.080
I think it's a great language to learn.

36
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.900
The second program is a web server.

37
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.180
Computers need to be configured to deliver files to the browser.

38
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.230
The job of a web server is to send files from the server to the browser.

39
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.340
If the browser needs an image, the server will send an image.

40
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.660
If the browser needs an HTML file, the server sends back an hml file, so on and so forth.

41
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.540
Without a web server, our computers won't be able to send the images to the browser.

42
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.020
The responsibility of a web server is to expose files via an HTTP URL.

43
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.580
In a future lecture, we will dive into the mechanics of a web server.

44
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.190
This lecture is meant to give a high level overview of the programs we're installing.

45
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.890
The last program is a database.

46
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.560
Databases are what you imagine they are.

47
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.260
They are programs for storing information.

48
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.030
We can store blog posts, users and settings for a WordPress site.

49
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.770
It's as simple as that.

50
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.940
Local is going to ask us to configure these programs for PHP, we can select a version.

51
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.340
One of the benefits of using WordPress is it's backward compatibility.

52
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.530
We can install WordPress on older versions of PHP such as version five.

53
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.550
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a page of minimum requirements for WordPress.

54
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.400
The word press team offers recommendations of the minimum versions of each software for PHP.

55
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.810
It's recommended to install version seven or higher.

56
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
While it's not against the rules to use an older version of PHP.

57
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.200
Your site becomes vulnerable to attacks.

58
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.590
Older versions of PHP are not maintained.

59
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.070
They have security flaws and bugs.

60
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.150
You should always be working with the latest version of PHP, which is version eight.

61
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.590
Back to the installer.

62
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.600
Let's select version eight.

63
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.010
If there is a higher version, then the version I've selected, feel free to select it.

64
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.210
BHP ships new versions every year.

65
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.390
The next option on this list is the web server.

66
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.240
There are two options called Apache and engines.

67
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.370
If you were to search online, there are dozens of debates surrounding these programs.

68
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.400
Some users prefer Apache.

69
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.290
Others prefer engines.

70
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.380
Regardless, they're both compatible with WordPress.

71
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.720
For this course, we're going to be using engines.

72
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.630
If you have experience with a specific web server, feel free to select it.

73
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.130
It will not impact the theme and plugin we'll be building for this course.

74
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.730
The last option is the database.

75
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.330
WordPress supports two databases called MySQL and Maria.

76
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.040
Initially, WordPress had sole support for MySQL.

77
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:14.240
A couple of years ago, the developers of MySQL decided to create a new database called Maria DB.

78
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.420
They didn't like the direction my SQL was heading.

79
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.730
In a way, you can think of Maria DB as an alternative version of MySQL.

80
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.160
Since that's the case, WordPress is compatible with Maria DB.

81
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.130
For this course, it's not going to matter which database we use.

82
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.280
There are differences, but these differences will not be explored in this course.

83
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.620
Database management is considered a separate job.

84
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.170
In my preference, I like working with Maria DB, so I'll select it.

85
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.650
Feel free to choose my SQL.

86
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.920
Let's continue to the next step.

87
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.790
The final step will ask us to create a WordPress user.

88
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.510
This user will be defined as an administrator of our site.

89
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.550
We can configure the credentials for this account.

90
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.670
I'm going to input basic login details.

91
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.560
Keep in mind that our server is only accessible to us.

92
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.080
The outside world does not have access to our site.

93
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.220
Therefore, our site being hacked is not going to be an issue.

94
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.530
After creating an account click add site.

95
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.640
After doing so, local will begin installing these programs.

96
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.310
This process may take a couple of minutes.

97
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.500
Be patient.

98
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.600
After installation, we'll be presented with an overview of our site.

99
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.790
There are various options at our disposal for modifying the current environment.

100
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.170
Before reviewing these options, let's test if our site is working.

101
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.920
By default, locals should have turned your server on.

102
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:58.070
If not, you can enable your server by clicking on the start button at the top right corner.

103
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.210
After doing so, we can click on the open site button.

104
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.380
A new tab will be opened in our browser without writing a single line of code.

105
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.080
We were able to get WordPress up and running.

106
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.990
Let's continue our discussion of the configuration in the next lecture.
