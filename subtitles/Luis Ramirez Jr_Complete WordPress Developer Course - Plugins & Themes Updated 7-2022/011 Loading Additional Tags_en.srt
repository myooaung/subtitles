1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,850
In this lecture, we are going to start loading additional tags in our document.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,070
We're not the only ones that need to add tags.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,570
The WordPress core and third party plugins may want to add meta tags, load style sheets and load scripts

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,560
by default.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,130
WordPress does not inject tags into our templates.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:25,950
We need to provide a location for safely loading additional tags.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,340
Once again, WordPress has a function for tackling this problem and your editor open the indexed PHP

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,060
file.

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,040
Below the Maytag running PHP function called WP Head.

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,860
The WP head function will allow WordPress and plugins to load tags into the head section of our documents.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,590
I highly recommend calling the WP head function after adding your own tags.

12
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,930
A themes tag should take priority over tags from third party plugins.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,830
In most cases, developers will call the WP head function at the end of the head tag.

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,430
We're not finished yet.

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,970
Some plugins may want to load scripts.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,210
It's recommended that we load script files at the bottom of the document similar to before.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,800
WordPress does not automatically inject scripts into our documents.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,530
We need to provide a location for loading scripts before the closing body tag.

19
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,380
Run a function called WP Footer.

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:41,120
DWP footer function performs a similar operation as the WP head function.

21
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,400
It'll allow plugins to begin loading scripts into the documents.

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,530
We haven't had the chance to jump into JavaScript for now.

23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:56,060
It's enough to understand that we're providing a location for plugins to load additional tags and files.

24
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's try loading our theme in the browser.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,640
After making those changes, WordPress has loaded the admin bar.

26
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,620
If you don't see the admin bar, it's likely that you're not logged in as an admin.

27
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,420
Regardless, WordPress will still inject tags into our documents.

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,900
Open the elements panel in the developer tools.

29
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,630
Our document looks vastly different than before.

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,890
WordPress has injected several tags into the head and body sections of our document, which is great.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,820
Our theme is starting to become extendable.

32
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,940
If a plug needs to load additional tags, it'll be able to without a problem.

33
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,580
We're getting close to finishing the templates.

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,150
In the next lecture, let's wrap it up.
