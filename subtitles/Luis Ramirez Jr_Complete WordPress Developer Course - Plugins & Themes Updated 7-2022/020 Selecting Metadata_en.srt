00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,640
In this lecture, we are going to start rendering the fields for modifying the Post's metadata.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,580
To get started, we'll need to ground the metadata.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,260
Without this information, the fields will appear empty in your editor.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,110
Open the sign bar JS file.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,970
At the top of the file.

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:25,400
Import the use select function from the WordPress slash data package.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,080
This function will help us select the metadata from the current post back in the function run the use

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,720
select function with an arrow function.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,790
The arrow function will be provided the select function for selecting a storage from the application

10
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,540
state.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,660
Let's return the following value.

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,570
Select core slash editor dot get edited post attribute meta.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,000
We are familiar with this function.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,000
We used it for retrieving the Post's metadata for the recipe.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,860
Summary BLOCK Lets store the metadata in a variable for readability, the metadata should be structured

16
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,220
the structure the following metadata values.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,630
OG Image.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,130
OG Description.

19
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,380
OG Override image.

20
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,460
After grabbing the values, we can start rendering the fields.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,290
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a gist.

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,660
This just contains a couple of components for rendering the fields to save time.

23
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,820
I prepared the inner components of the sidebar.

24
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,610
All of these components are familiar to us.

25
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,120
We've used them dozens of times for other blocks.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,580
Copy this code to your clipboard.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,430
Next.

28
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,900
Head back to the editor.

29
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,650
Paste the code into the plugin sidebar component.

30
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,490
Lastly, the components must be imported at the top of the page.

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,259
Add an import statement for the WordPress components package.

32
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,690
Import the following components.

33
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,970
Panel Body Text Control.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,650
Text Area Control.

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:18,940
Toggle Control.

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,250
Before previewing our code.

37
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,260
There's one thing I want to highlight about the components.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,560
If you look through the templates, the components have empty on change events.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,160
In the next lecture, we will update the components to update the metadata.

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,190
For now, the fields will not be modifiable.

41
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's refresh the page.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,240
We can click on the button to open the sidebar.

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,320
As you can see, there are three fields.

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,840
The only field missing is the image.

45
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,570
We'll work on that in the future lecture.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,680
As long as you can view the fields, you're good to go.

47
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,390
In the next lecture, let's begin updating the metadata during updates on our fields.
