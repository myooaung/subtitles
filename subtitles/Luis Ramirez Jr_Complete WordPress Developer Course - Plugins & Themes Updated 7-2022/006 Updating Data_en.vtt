00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.220
In this lecture, we are going to try updating the records from the products table.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.100
Currently, I am viewing the complete table.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.310
One of the records does not have a name for the product.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.720
Whenever possible, we should avoid empty values.

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.530
I think this is an excellent opportunity to update the record.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.520
Let's try updating this row by using a custom query inside the form.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.890
We can type the update keyword.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.729
This keyword will instruct the database to begin updating a specific table.

9
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.000
We can specify the table after writing this keyword.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.090
In this case, we will update the data in the products table.

11
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.200
Afterward, we can add the set keyword.

12
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.550
We can start adding values to specific columns.

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.280
Multiple columns can be modified for a record by separating them with a column.

14
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.290
Let's set the name column to shirts.

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.050
We can add a semicolon to end the statement.

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.590
However, the query we've written is dangerous.

17
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.640
We're not telling the database which records to update.

18
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.500
By default, all records will be updated.

19
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.720
We are overwriting existing data, which may not be what we want.

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.560
You should always remember to add a condition to an update query.

21
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.540
Let's add the WHERE query.

22
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.800
Next the condition will be the following id equals to.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.690
Let's execute our query.

24
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.890
After doing so, the query will update a single record without the WHERE keyword.

25
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.050
All records would have been updated.

26
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.960
Just to make sure, let's check out the products table with admin or upon viewing the data.

27
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840
The second row does not contain a null value.

28
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.360
It's been updated with our new value.

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.500
That's perfect.

30
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.220
We've successfully updated the table in the next lecture.

31
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.190
Let's try deleting data from our table.
