00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.580
In this lecture, I want to take a moment to talk about full site editing for over a year.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.160
WordPress has teased a different way of building themes.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.490
The time has finally come in.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.200
WordPress 5.9 full site editing was introduced into the core.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.310
It completely changes how sites are designed and developed.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.340
To understand why full site editing was introduced as a feature, we need to wind the clocks back.

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.350
Prior to full site editing.

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.729
We had classic site editing for modifying the appearance of a site.

9
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.270
Classic site editing is a term used to describe the suite of tools for modifying WordPress.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.240
Primarily, we had two tools called the customizer and a whizzy wig editor.

11
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
While they're simple, they're not great for designing a site.

12
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.140
It's difficult to design an interface that allows users to modify elements on a page.

13
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.580
Both tools could not meet the demands of regular and technical users.

14
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.620
For that reason, page builders were introduced into the WordPress ecosystem.

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:12.330
In fact, they're so popular, it's become a multimillion dollar industry beaver builder, Devi Elementary,

16
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.020
visual composer and Oxygene are some examples.

17
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.730
One of the benefits of using a page builder is the low barrier to entry.

18
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.700
It's possible to create a beautiful site with minimal knowledge of HTML and CSS.

19
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.950
This can be great for clients.

20
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
Unfortunately, page builders have their downsides.

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490
Firstly, they're expensive.

22
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.950
Secondly, you need to deal with managing licenses.

23
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.150
Lastly, there isn't a unified standard for building pages.

24
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.240
Every page builder approaches things differently.

25
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.970
Once you pick a page builder, you're locked in.

26
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.770
The team behind WordPress decided to introduce a better editing experience to the core by creating Gutenberg.

27
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.060
Originally, Gutenberg could only be used for editing posts.

28
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.690
The team fully realized that Gutenberg could transcend its original purpose to being a page builder,

29
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.720
hence the idea of full site editing.

30
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.820
By adding full site editing, every corner of a template is editable.

31
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.130
You can build headers, footers, sidebars and content areas with blocks.

32
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.840
Best of all, it addresses the issues present in modern day page builders.

33
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400
Firstly, it's free.

34
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.890
No need to open your wallet for anybody.

35
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.100
Secondly, you don't need to manage licenses.

36
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.940
Lastly, it introduces the standard for building pages.

37
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.310
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

38
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.920
There's a lot to explore with the page builder.

39
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.420
However, I would be lying if I said everything is sunshine and roses.

40
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.240
There are downsides to full site editing.

41
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.700
The main drawback of full site editing is the development experience.

42
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.300
Unfortunately, we've received the short end of the stick.

43
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.150
WordPress development was known to be easy.

44
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.810
You could create a custom theme and plugin within hours.

45
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.130
Things have changed.

46
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.970
The requirements for developing custom themes and plugins have risen.

47
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.610
Typically you could get away with PHP.

48
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.890
However, Gutenberg development requires knowledge of JavaScript and react.

49
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.350
The learning curve has gotten steeper, but hey, that's why you're taking this course.

50
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.680
We are going to fully embrace full site editing.

51
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.700
Love it or hate it.

52
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.040
Full site editing is the way to go.

53
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.460
With that said, let's get into full site editing.

54
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.560
I'll see you in the next lecture.
