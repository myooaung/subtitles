00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,560
In this lecture, we are going to work on the template for a single post.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,360
Undoubtedly, this will be one of the most important templates to add to your theme.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,850
It will be used for displaying content for a single post or custom post type.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,180
The index template is not suitable for this job.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,030
There are two problems with the index templates.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,510
To better understand, let's do a post on the front end.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,260
The first problem with the template is the main content.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
The index template does not render the entire post.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,680
It'll output an excerpt of the post, which is not ideal.

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,580
Secondly, the layout feels strange.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,000
There isn't a point in using columns within the post.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,310
We can allow the post content to stretch across the column in another tab.

13
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,770
I have a copy of the static design.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,290
Ultimately, this is what we're going for.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,650
Luckily, we can reuse the index template to help us recreate the single post template.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,810
Most of the styles are the same.

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,340
It's a matter of rearranging the blocks before working on the template.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,640
Let's check out the documentation for the appropriate file name on the documentation page.

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,560
I'm viewing the hierarchy for the single post template.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,950
Starting from the top.

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,480
WordPress will search for a template that contains the single keyword.

22
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,770
This is followed by the post type and ID of the post.

23
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,760
Secondly, it'll search for the same template without the ID.

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,950
Lastly, it'll search for the single singular and index templates.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,900
Our template will be generic.

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,940
It should apply to all posts.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,260
I think the single HTML template is a perfect choice.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,940
Back in our editor, let's create a file called Single HTML.

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,850
Next, let's open the index HTML template.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,560
Let's transfer the blocks from the index template to the single template.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,820
The next step is to begin working on the blocks.

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,370
Switch over to the full site editor.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,650
We're going to switch the template to single post.

34
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,630
This option should appear after adding the template to our theme.

35
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,430
The first step is to move the blocks outside of the loop inside the list view.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,270
Drag the columns block from the post template block.

37
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,940
Place it above the query loop block.

38
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,820
Straight away.

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,070
This placement might seem strange.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,870
Thus far we've been relying on the query loop block to render the post.

41
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,260
So why are we moving the post blocks to a different location?

42
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,800
Let's recap the job of the query loop block.

43
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,660
Essentially, the query loop block will query the database for posts.

44
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,240
This query is based on the URL.

45
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,270
After the posts have been retrieved, they'll loop through the results for a single post.

46
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,770
This isn't necessary.

47
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,580
We can safely assume there will always be a single post.

48
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:17,150
WordPress will take care of providing a post, otherwise it'll render a404 page.

49
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,300
Looping through the results doesn't make sense.

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,810
Secondly, children post blocks can grab post to data without the query loop block.

51
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,710
Placing these blocks in the query loop block is optional.

52
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:37,910
By placing them outside the loop, they will grab the first post from the query since the page for a

53
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:44,270
single post will always contain a single post, the blocks will be able to render the post content.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,530
For these reasons, we're not going to need the query loop block.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,870
Delete this block from our templates.

56
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,810
Next we can begin rearranging the blocks as we saw from the static design.

57
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,150
The author date and common count lock should appear at the top of the post.

58
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,970
They'll be put in the same row at the roadblock at the top of the first column.

59
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,500
Next move the post author post date and common count blocks into the row block.

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,870
We're going to run into some problems.

61
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,240
The first problem can't be fixed.

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,170
As of WordPress, six post blocks will not be able to render a preview of the template without the query

63
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,160
loop lock.

64
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,990
If we were to check out the preview, most of the blocks would render the blocks name.

65
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,180
The actual content is missing.

66
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,760
Unfortunately, we won't be able to test the template from the editor.

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,360
I highly recommend opening a new tab containing a single post for debugging a templates visual appearance.

68
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,130
Let's save the templates.

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,120
Next, let's refresh the page for a single post.

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,650
The template is perfectly functional.

71
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,370
Like I said before, the template won't be functional from the full site editor without the query loop

72
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,030
block.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,890
However, this is how WordPress recommends creating the single template.

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,690
Looking closer at the row.

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,710
The layout is slightly broken.

76
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,680
The spacing between the blocks is too wide.

77
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,000
The comment count should be moved to the right side.

78
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,080
Lastly, the author sits higher than the other blocks.

79
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,820
Luckily, we can fix these layout issues through the block settings.

80
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,540
Let's head back to the full site editor.

81
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,010
First, we're going to modify the row blocks settings towards the bottom of the sidebar.

82
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,230
We can modify the spacing between each block by updating the block spacing option to one rim.

83
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,810
After adding this option, the blocks should become closer to each other.

84
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,120
Next, let's adjust the margins of the post author block.

85
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,650
Previously, we added margins.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,620
These margins are not necessary anymore.

87
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,180
Remove the margin values from the post author block.

88
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:32,510
Lastly, we can move the post comment count block by adding a class.

89
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,700
Unfortunately, this block doesn't support margin values.

90
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,520
We can apply margins via a class on this block.

91
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,370
Add a class called exclamation point.

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,810
EML auto.

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,650
The row is complete.

94
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,860
We can move on to the other portions of the templates.

95
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,300
Back in the list view.

96
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,590
Let's move the post title block below the row block.

97
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,850
The post title block should have a larger font.

98
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,180
This step is optional, but since this is the only post the title should stand out.

99
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,560
Let's set the font size to 2.25 REM.

100
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,470
Afterward move the post featured image block below the post title block.

101
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,100
Lastly, move the post Tang's block below.

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,340
The Post featured image block.

103
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,070
The children blocks of the columns block can be safely deleted.

104
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,500
They're not necessary to keep around.

105
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,270
There's one more block that needs to be added.

106
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,050
In the index template, we displayed the post excerpt.

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,130
This time we're going to display the entire post content.

108
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:06,390
Insert a block called Post Content between the post featured image block and post tags block.

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,400
We've successfully rearranged the blocks.

110
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,630
However, we're not finished yet.

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,900
There are missing sections from the original template.

112
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,900
Let's go back to the static design below the post content.

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,740
There are additional sections.

114
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,270
Firstly, there are links to the next and previous posts below these links.

115
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,400
A comment section is available.

116
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,720
There's another problem worth mentioning.

117
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,820
The post tags have a different appearance from the index templates.

118
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,950
Post tags.

119
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,110
They're similar to the post tags on the sidebar.

120
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,850
We should fix this too.

121
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,660
Now that we have an overview of what's next, let's begin working on the template.

122
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,250
To get started, let's work on the post tags.

123
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,160
For reference, the HTML for the post tags can be found in the single HTML file there under a comment

124
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,050
that says post tags.

125
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,690
We can stylize the links by applying a class called post content tags.

126
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,590
This class should provide the styles we'll need for the block.

127
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,050
Back in the full site.

128
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,100
Editor We're going to modify the post tags block by adding a class called Post Content Tags.

129
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,110
The changes won't be visible from the editor since the editor cannot grab posts will verify the design

130
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,860
after finishing the templates.

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,440
Let's move on to adding links for the next and previous posts.

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,120
The HTML for the pagination links can be found under a comment that says pagination WordPress has dedicated

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,170
blocks for generating links for the next and previous links.

134
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,840
These links will appear side by side.

135
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,860
Aligning the links can be done with a row block.

136
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,890
However, the links themselves won't be easy to style without custom classes.

137
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,950
These blocks don't offer much customization.

138
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,020
We will apply the same classes that can be found on the links.

139
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,240
Let's add a row block below the post tags block.

140
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,210
The pagination links are going to be aligned with Flexbox.

141
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,790
Luckily, this block will already apply flex properties to the block.

142
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,060
We can move on to applying margins and borders.

143
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,110
First, let's enable the appearance of the margin settings.

144
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,910
Set the top and bottom margins to two R.E.M..

145
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,650
The block spacing option should be set to zero.

146
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,890
Next, let's modify the water settings.

147
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,230
Set the width to one x.

148
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,390
These styles should be solid.

149
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,000
The colour of the border should be you to me.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,350
Grey 200.

151
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,450
Lastly, the border radius should be set to 0.5 REM.

152
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,750
The row is ready.

153
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:21,350
Let's add the pagination links inside the row block insert two blocks called previous post and next

154
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,040
post.

155
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,120
As mentioned before, these blocks will generate links to the previous and next post.

156
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,270
There are not a lot of options for styling the blocks.

157
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:38,530
We must resort to classes in your editor.

158
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,210
Open the single HTML file.

159
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,280
Search for a comment that says pagination.

160
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,580
The anchor elements will contain a series of different classes for each link.

161
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,420
Let's copy the classes from the first link.

162
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,370
Next.

163
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,500
Paste these classes into the class field for the previous post lock.

164
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,330
Switch back to the editor.

165
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,820
Let's copy the classes from the second anchor element.

166
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,920
These classes should be pasted into the next post block.

167
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,720
Great.

168
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,500
I promise.

169
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,710
We're almost finished.

170
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:31,500
The last set of blocks is for the comment section below the row block at a new block called Heading.

171
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,850
We are going to quickly add a heading to help visitors identify the comment section.

172
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,450
The block will contain the following text comments.

173
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,440
Next, let's update the settings by changing the font size to 1.5 REM.

174
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,110
The appearance should be set to medium.

175
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:02,640
Finally we can add the final block, which is the block for a post comments.

176
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,650
WordPress has a block for creating a UI for comments.

177
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,560
In my opinion, the UI matches our theme perfectly.

178
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,830
Therefore, we're not going to heavily modify the comment section.

179
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,040
However, we will adjust the form similar to other blocks.

180
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,740
The form is not easily customizable.

181
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,760
We must resort to classes in the single dot HTML template.

182
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,230
You can find a copy of the comment form under a comment that says post comment form.

183
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,360
We're going to apply the comments section class to produce the desired appearance of the form.

184
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,020
At the bottom of the row.

185
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,440
BLOCK Insert a block called Post comments.

186
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,260
This lock will perform two actions.

187
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,660
Firstly, it'll output the comments for a post.

188
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,100
Secondly, it'll output a form for adding a new comment.

189
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,180
It's one of the most comprehensive blocks WordPress has to offer.

190
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,180
However, as I said before, it doesn't provide many options for changing the appearance.

191
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,550
We must apply classes to alter its appearance.

192
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,690
Let's add a class called Comment Section.

193
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,590
This single class will do everything that we need it to do.

194
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,110
I've included it with the theme for your convenience.

195
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,950
You're more than free to check out the CSS for the styles that get applied with that set.

196
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,500
We're officially finished with the templates.

197
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,160
Let's make a copy of all the blocks from the list view.

198
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,790
Next, let's go back to the single HTML template file.

199
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,020
Replace the current blocks with our new blocks.

200
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,880
Before testing the templates, we must reset the templates.

201
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,220
Previously we saved a copy.

202
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,540
Refresh the page in the editor.

203
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,750
Lastly, reset the customizations.

204
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,180
On the front end, we can refresh the page to view the final changes to the templates.

205
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,300
If you did everything right, you should see a template similar to mine.

206
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,790
We fully customize the single template.

207
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,400
Pat yourself on the back.

208
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,540
Creating this template took a while, but it was completely worth it.

209
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,620
Let's continue our journey by creating two more templates.
