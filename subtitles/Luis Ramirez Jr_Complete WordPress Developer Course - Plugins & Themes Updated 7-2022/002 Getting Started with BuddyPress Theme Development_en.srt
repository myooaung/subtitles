1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,680
We're going to start things off with buddy press development, what I want you to do is install Buddy

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,860
Press by the buddy press community.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,690
This is a pretty large plug in, so it may take longer than most plug ins to install once installed.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,620
Click activate.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,610
Currently, Buddy Press is on version four will be going over the latest concepts for Buddy Press.

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,570
Before we write a single line of code, let's modify some of the settings.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,830
The bunny press settings can be found by going to Settings Buddy Press.

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,120
I'm going to turn everything on so that we don't miss a thing.

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,450
When we installed Buddy Press, it created a couple of pages for us.

10
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,780
Let's check those out.

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,700
It will generate the following pages, activity, members, groups.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,460
You can view any of these pages and you'll see that Buddy Press will generate the content for each page.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,770
I'm going to view the members page.

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm going to click on the admin profile.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,390
And here you'll see a profile generated for us with different sections separated with tabs.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,670
We didn't have to do a thing, buddy.

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,580
Press is an extremely powerful plugin that will generate this UI and functionality for you.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,530
I'm going to go back to the page manager.

19
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm going to try and view the edit page.

20
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,790
You'll notice that nothing here is out of the ordinary.

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,620
There are no special settings, it's just a regular page.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,700
So how does Buddy Press know that these pages are associated with it?

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,520
Well, if you were to navigate to settings, buddy press pages, you'll find the settings where you

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,930
can tell Buddy Press which pages it should display its content on.

25
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,440
There are a lot more features to Buddy Press, but we'll see how those work as the course progresses.

26
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm going to go back to the admin profile.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,230
You'll notice that there's this gray strip above the profile and it has a sidebar.

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,600
It's really nice.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,610
The Buddy Press took the time to try and match the design of the site as much as possible, but we could

30
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,400
improve upon it.

31
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,980
What I want to do is make this page for wit and update some of the key assets to match our own site.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,040
So where do we even begin?

33
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,850
Well, keep in mind that Buddy Press uses the same system.

34
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,740
We use something that Buddy Press does is leverage the templating hierarchy system.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,440
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the Buddy Press Template Hierarchy page.

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:40,350
This page shows you how Buddy Press loads a certain page that it generates, just like WordPress.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,440
It'll look for a certain filenames in your theme and then goes down a list until it finds a file.

38
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,190
If it doesn't find anything, then it'll just use the index type template.

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,620
The rest of this documentation details all the various pages and their templates you can set.

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,930
We'll go over how to generate these templates in a bit.

41
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,190
For now, I want to generate the base template.

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,880
The base template is the template that encompasses all other template.

43
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,440
Buddy Press is a plug in and it doesn't want to generate a whole lot of templates.

44
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,640
It would rather depend on one template and generate sections for that template.

45
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,930
The base template can be named any of these names right here on the page.

46
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm going to create the Buddy Press Stop template inside the themes folder.

47
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Then I'm going to open the full width page template and copy everything from here into the new template.

48
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,210
We are going to strip this template down to the bare minimum, I'm going to get rid of the title we

49
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,830
see at the top of every page.

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,030
Then I'm going to remove everything inside the loop except for the post function.

51
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,160
Next, I'm going to call the function, the content.

52
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,420
Lastly, I'm just going to remove some space and format this neatly.

53
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,420
As you can see, our template is extremely basic.

54
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,390
The reason for this is because Buddy Press will take care of generating the contents of the page and

55
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,960
its format.

56
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,430
Don't worry, we can override them later.

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,399
This is just to get us started.

58
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,410
Let's see if everything is working.

59
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,340
I want you to reload the member profile page.

60
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,570
You'll now notice a lot of what we saw previously is gone except for the content that Buddy Press generated.

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,520
This is exactly what we wanted.

62
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,030
There are some Cyesis changes we'd like to make and of course, update some of the HTML here and there,

63
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,240
which is totally doable.

64
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,280
What I really want to change is how the user profile looks.

65
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,680
I really like how the rest of these pages are formatted, it centered and there's space between the

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,270
menu and the content for the profile.

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,020
I want to make this cover image stretch all the way from left to right.

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,540
I also want to remove the space between the menu and content.

69
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,390
Let's read the Buddy Press Template Hierarchy page for a minute.

70
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,030
If you scroll down a little bit, you'll find a section called Single Member Pages.

71
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,810
Here is what Buddy Press says.

72
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,030
If you are on a single member page, Buddy Press will use the following template hierarchy.

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,200
Then it precedes us to tell us more about what files will be loaded.

74
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,870
Unlike the WordPress hierarchy template system, you'll notice that Buddy Press will look for the files

75
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,450
within a certain folder structure.

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,340
This is very important to highlight, as Buddy Press requires dozens and dozens of templates and template

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,880
parts.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,000
So the team decided it would be wise to use a folder structure so that the routine folder doesn't become

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,520
cluttered with various files.

80
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,350
We will be using number five from this list.

81
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,470
I want you to create the folders, buddy press members single inside your theme's folder.

82
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,640
Then I want you to create a file named Index Dot.

83
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,230
This is the file that Buddy Press will look for when creating the single member profile page.

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,170
Next, I'm going to copy the contents of the Buddy press based template into this new template.

85
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,300
Since I don't want spacing and I want the cover image to be stretched, I'm going to remove all these

86
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,840
tanks.

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,530
I'm going to take the time to format this a bit so that it looks cleaner.

88
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,120
What you should have is the header, a basic loop and the footer, it should all be peacoat.

89
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,010
I know this looks very basic, but I want you to bear with me on this.

90
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:41,040
The tags we removed or what causes the content to be centered in space, even though I want that spacing

91
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,920
to be applying to the rest of the content.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,950
It's kind of necessary to remove it.

93
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,160
Since the cover image was inside those tanks, we could do some success hacks to make it appear stretched.

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,860
But I think a better solution would be to apply the sintering and spacing to the tags inside rather

95
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,590
than outside.

96
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,950
Let's test this out really quick.

97
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,590
Refresh the single member page and you'll notice right away that the spacing is removed and all the

98
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,850
content is stretched.

99
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,690
This is almost what we wanted.

100
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,950
The only thing to do now is central the content itself.

101
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,620
We'll get to that in a moment.

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,780
I want to make sure the rest of the pages weren't affected.

103
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,210
I want you to view any other buddy press generated page like the activity page.

104
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:29,260
This page should still be centered and spaced after confirming that only the single member page is updated.

105
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,180
Let's move on to the next task and the next lecture will tackle cleaning up this template.
