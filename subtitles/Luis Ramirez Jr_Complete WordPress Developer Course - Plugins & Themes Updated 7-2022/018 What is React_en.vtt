00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.390
In this lecture, I want to quickly talk about React.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.470
Everything we've been learning has been leading to this topic.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.670
What is React?

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.870
Why should we learn it?

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
What can react to that JavaScript?

6
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.650
Can't.

7
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.980
Let's answer these questions and more.

8
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.620
First things first what is React?

9
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.660
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

10
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.540
That definition is taken straight from the official site for React.

11
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.910
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to this site.

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.000
Naturally, we don't need a JavaScript library for building interactive sites.

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.620
JavaScript has everything you'll need for building a site.

14
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.180
However, developers prefer to learn react after learning JavaScript.

15
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.900
It's the same reason developers prefer to learn WordPress after learning PHP, it makes our lives easier.

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.920
Behind the scenes, WordPress performed dozens of actions.

17
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.700
For example, it will check if the user is authenticated.

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.920
Query the database for a list of posts, send emails and manage plugins.

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
The foundation for building a site is available as developers.

20
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.540
Our job is to extend the existing infrastructure.

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.800
Without WordPress, developing a site may take weeks or months.

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.620
By using WordPress sites can be rapidly developed up to production within hours.

23
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.700
React can deliver the same experience for WordPress developers.

24
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.080
For these reasons, React is considered a library for rapidly developing rich interactive user interfaces.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.820
To make matters better, WordPress has immense support for React.

26
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.580
Both systems work nicely with each other.

27
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.580
There are a lot of benefits to learning React.

28
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.370
However, there is a learning curve to get started with React Node must be installed.

29
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.790
During our journey with PHP, the size of our files didn't impact the performance of our site.

30
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.510
The file size of your PHP files is negligible.

31
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.800
The same can't be said for JavaScript files.

32
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.550
Your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code should be optimized for production.

33
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.810
If you were to ship an optimized code, visitors might leave your site for taking too long to load.

34
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.440
The most common solution to lower the file size is by compressing code into a single line and removing

35
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.340
whitespace.

36
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.650
Here's an example.

37
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.570
The first code snippet is an optimized.

38
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.090
As for the second example, it's been optimized by removing unnecessary whitespace.

39
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.720
Unfortunately, the trade off is that it's difficult to read.

40
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.370
This is just one example.

41
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.660
Imagine if we had 100 lines of code or 1000 lines of code.

42
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.860
It would be a nightmare to scroll through this code during development.

43
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.050
Our code should be neatly formatted.

44
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.610
Once we're ready for production, we should optimize our code base manually.

45
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.010
Removing whitespace can be tedious.

46
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.880
The React team has taken the time to combat this issue.

47
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.150
React is more than a library.

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.680
There's a set of tools for optimizing your JavaScript code for production.

49
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.940
We can get the best of both worlds.

50
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.050
Our code can be written with formatting after we're satisfied with the results.

51
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.890
Our files can be optimized on the front end.

52
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.320
These tools work out of the box.

53
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.260
Oftentimes, beginner developers will ask me if they should learn these tools.

54
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.150
Once upon a time ago I would have said yes.

55
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.160
However, things are changing.

56
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.420
In most cases.

57
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.440
You can get away with the basics without diving deep into a tool.

58
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.560
In fact, these tools have become so complex that configuring them is a full time job.

59
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.320
There are developers who specialize in developing tools for other developers.

60
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.930
They don't focus on developing application.

61
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.990
Instead, their jobs are to create tools that make debugging, shipping and collaborating on projects

62
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.710
easier.

63
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.770
Our goal is to become WordPress developers.

64
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.310
Exploring tools would take dozens of hours to teach.

65
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.480
For that reason, we're not going to be diving deep into these tools and overview will suffice.

66
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.070
The WordPress and React teams have taken the time to configure these tools for you.

67
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.160
We will be able to get away with knowing the bare minimum.

68
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.560
Let's get straight into React.
