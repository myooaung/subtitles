1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,090
In this lecture, we are going to add a toolbar option for replacing an image.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,770
The toolbar is extendable for blocks.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,340
We're not limited to the options created by WordPress.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,770
The Gutenberg Editor provides an option for adding custom buttons in the toolbar.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,480
Let's add a button for changing the image of a team member in your editor.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,790
Open the edit Edge's file.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,960
First we need to import two components from the components package import to components called block

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
controls and media replace flow.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,000
Next, let's use these components in our block at the top of the fragment element.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,350
Add the block controls component with opening and closing tags.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:55,500
The BLOCK Control's component will allow us to insert elements into the toolbar.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,020
This component must sit at the root level of the edit component.

13
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,489
Anything written inside this component will be inserted into the toolbar.

14
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,540
WordPress will handle positioning our content in the correct location inside this component.

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,970
Let's add the media replace flow component.

16
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,590
The media replace flow component was introduced for adding a button in the toolbar.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,110
This button is capable of opening the media library.

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,700
It's very similar to the media placeholder component.

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,300
The difference is that the media replace flow component outputs a button.

20
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,390
It does not output a complete interface for uploading a file or inserting a link.

21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,220
It's just a simple button.

22
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,860
This component has a few properties.

23
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,980
First, we can configure the text inside the button by adding the name property.

24
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,950
Let's translate the text with the double underscore function.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,630
The button text will contain the following message replace image.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,590
Next, the media library can preselect an image.

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,410
I think it would be a good idea to preselect the currently uploaded image.

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,660
This way users can modify the alt text without selecting the image again.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,340
We can preselect an image by adding two properties.

30
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,490
The first property is called Media ID.

31
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,010
The value for this property must be the ID of the media file.

32
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,220
As mentioned before, WordPress stores a record of a media file in a database.

33
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,120
Every file uploaded to WordPress has a unique ID associated with it.

34
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,970
We stored this ID as an attribute.

35
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,890
Let's set this property to the image ID attributes.

36
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,120
The next property is called media URL.

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,150
The value for this property must be the URL to the image.

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,610
Let's set this property to the image.

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,200
URL attributes.

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,480
The URL does not need to be the URL to the original image.

41
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,220
The URL can be to any of the image sizes.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,190
After adding these to properties, the image will be pre selected before going further.

43
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,030
This button should not appear if an image has not been uploaded.

44
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,120
The purpose of this button is to replace the image, not set the initial image.

45
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:29,120
Let's conditionally render the media replace flow components above this component.

46
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,990
Add the following expression image preview and.

47
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,700
Next move the media replace FLO component after the and operator.

48
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,470
Great.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,320
Let's keep working on the media replace flow components.

50
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,280
The next step is to limit the file selected by the component.

51
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:58,380
This component supports the accept and accepted types properties that are identical to the properties

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,010
with the same name on the media placeholder components.

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,790
Let's copy these properties from the media placeholder component to the media replace flow component.

54
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,320
We're almost finished.

55
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,339
The next properties are events similar to the media placeholder component.

56
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,620
The Media Replace Flow Component has an event for errors and image selections.

57
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,020
Let's add the on air event.

58
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,950
For this event, we are going to pass in an arrow function to handle the event.

59
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,250
This function is provided the error as an argument.

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,160
Inside the function's body.

61
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,970
Lets log the error with the console dot error function.

62
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,020
Next, add the on select event.

63
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,940
The value for this event will be the same function passed into the media placeholder component.

64
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,800
However, I don't think it's a good idea to have two copies of the same function.

65
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,210
One of them changes.

66
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,760
The other needs to reflect those changes.

67
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,230
Oftentimes, developers will outsource the function into a variable.

68
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,550
This practice keeps our code base readable and maintainable.

69
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,740
Scroll on to the media placeholder component.

70
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,120
Let's grab the function from the on select event.

71
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,640
Next above the return statement, create a variable called Select Image.

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,570
The value for this variable will be the function from earlier.

73
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,750
Next, let's set the on select event from both components to this function.

74
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,930
We are going to do the same for the on select URL event.

75
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,280
Grab the function for this event from the media placeholder component.

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,790
Next, create a variable called select image URL with this function as the value.

77
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,540
Lastly, set the on select URL event on the media.

78
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,360
Replace flow component to this variable.

79
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:15,780
Update the media placeholder component to use this variable.

80
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:24,500
These steps are not required, but it can make it easier to maintain our block by adding these two components.

81
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,740
A button should appear in the toolbar.

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,750
This button will allow us to change the image.

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,090
Let's give it a try in the browser.

84
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,530
Refresh the page.

85
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,550
Next, add the team group members block.

86
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,550
We can select an individual team member to view the toolbar.

87
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,180
So far the button does not appear, which is what we want.

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,330
The option for replacing an image should not appear until an image has been uploaded.

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,070
Try adding an image.

90
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,910
After selecting an image, the button appears in the toolbar.

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,950
We can click on this button to view a dropdown.

92
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:09,020
We are presented with the option to open the media library or upload an image.

93
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,890
Let's open the media library from the media library.

94
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,050
The image has been pre selected.

95
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,730
We do not need to select the image again if we want to change the details.

96
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,790
Alternatively, we can select a new image.

97
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,470
Let's give that a try.

98
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,460
Upon selecting a new image, the image appears in the block.

99
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,270
Perfect.

100
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,710
We've successfully added the option to replace an image in the toolbar.

101
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,060
In the next lecture.

102
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,450
Let's set an option to delete the image from the block.
