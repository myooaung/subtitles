00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,860
In this lecture, we're going to enable margin and padding options for our theme.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,470
By default, these options are disabled.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,490
We can enable these settings on a global level and block level.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,240
To begin, let's update our theme JSON file.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,230
Inside these settings object.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,390
Add a new property called spacing.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,260
The spacing property is where we can configure the margin and padding settings for our theme.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,810
There are two properties that we can add.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,250
They're called margin and padding.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,030
Let's add both with a value of true.

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,320
It's that simple.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,940
Users will be able to configure the margin and padding for all blocks that support spacing.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,100
While we're here, let's try adding some default styles to our theme.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,940
Specifically, we're going to reset the margin and padding.

15
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,480
Let's switch over to the Styles object inside this object, add a new property called spacing.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,790
Next, add two properties called margin and padding.

17
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,940
We're going to reset the margin and padding for the entire document.

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,260
Not necessary, but never a bad idea to reset your CSS.

19
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,820
WordPress allows us to apply margin and padding to all sides.

20
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,900
All units of measurement are supported inside both objects.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,030
We're going to set the top right, bottom and left properties to zero.

22
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,990
It's optional to add values.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,160
Every property, for example, you may want to apply padding on the y axis of an element.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,000
Therefore you can omit the right and left properties.

25
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,540
It's completely up to you.

26
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,540
Let's try testing our site on the front end.

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,830
Not much will change, however.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,590
Let's check out the body tag with the developer tools.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,050
As you can see, WordPress has applied margin and padding to the body tag.

30
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,229
This is precisely what we wanted.

31
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,300
Applying spacing to blocks is also possible.

32
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,140
Let's try editing the templates in the editor.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,770
If we were to select the site title block there should be a panel on the sidebar called Dimensions.

34
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,900
It May Be Empty.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,410
You can toggle the appearance of the padding and margin settings through the panel dropdown.

36
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,240
By selecting either option, we can modify the spacing with a single value.

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,150
Alternatively, we can change these spacing on an individual basis.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,980
Either way, we've given the user the option of changing the padding and margins of our theme.

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,790
Let's continue exploring these options in the next lecture.
