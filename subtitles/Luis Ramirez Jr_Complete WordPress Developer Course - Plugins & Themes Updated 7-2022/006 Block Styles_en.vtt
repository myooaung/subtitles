00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.710
In this lecture, let's try adding an option for toggling between different block styles.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.090
In my editor, I have added the alert box block to the page.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.700
After a while, I may have second thoughts about this design.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.020
I may want to use the other variation of this block.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.830
There are two options at my disposal.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.700
I can remove this block and add the other variation.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
Alternatively, I can write the name of the class in the class field.

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.730
Both options are not ideal.

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.770
Adding and removing blocks is a waste of time.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.810
Users would need to recreate the block.

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.380
The second option is not great either.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.350
We shouldn't force users to memorize the classes of our blocks.

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.080
WordPress has a solution for our dilemma.

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.130
We can switch between blocks by using block styles.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.040
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a page for this feature.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.960
BLOCK Styles allow us to switch between different variations by toggling a class on the block.

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.780
Let's try applying block styles to the alert box.

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
BLOCK In your editor, open the block JSON file.

19
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.820
At the bottom of the configuration file at an array called Styles.

20
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.350
In this array, we can add an object for each style that can be applied to a block.

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.020
Let's try adding two styles.

22
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.030
Each object requires two properties.

23
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.730
The first property is called name.

24
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.050
If this style is selected, the value from the name property will be applied to the block as a class.

25
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.290
Let's set the name to regular.

26
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.830
Next, we need to add a property called Label.

27
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.550
This property will display a readable name to the user.

28
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.160
Our label will be set to regular.

29
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.860
The first style will be the default style of the block.

30
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.790
We do not have a class for this style, but that's perfectly fine.

31
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.520
We should always provide an option for reverting the block to its original style.

32
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.360
There's one more property which is optional.

33
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.680
We can set a default style by setting the is default property to true.

34
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.640
Let's add another object.

35
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.530
This time the name and label properties will be set to accented.

36
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.820
The name of the style is important.

37
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.380
WordPress will prefix the name of the class with is style.

38
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.060
The value from the name property will be appended after this word.

39
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.410
This is how we can switch between different styles.

40
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.140
Let's give our block a test in the browser.

41
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.710
Refresh the page.

42
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.150
Next, select the alert box block on the sidebar.

43
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.750
A new panel was added for switching between styles.

44
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.310
We no longer have to manually add a class to apply a style.

45
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.990
Behind the scenes, WordPress is toggling the classes on the block.

46
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.460
Under the Advanced Panel, we can monitor the class field for updates as we switch between styles.

47
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.260
The class name changes.

48
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.160
BLOCK styles are another way of toggling between classes.

49
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.340
To give our block a different appearance.

50
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.140
Users won't have to memorize our class.

51
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.290
They can easily switch between variations.
