00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,330
In this lecture, I want to quickly discuss what the next half of this course covers.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,670
It's time to get into plug in and block development.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,300
Unlike theme development, plug and development requires more involvement with code, specifically PHP

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,470
and JavaScript.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,810
So far we've covered PHP but haven't had the chance to cover JavaScript.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,100
In this section we are going to cover JavaScript and react.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,450
Both technologies are going to become relevant for plug and development.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,960
You won't get far without knowledge of these two topics.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,580
If you already know JavaScript and react, you can skip this section.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,280
I won't be teaching anything groundbreaking.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,880
Only the fundamentals will be covered for the rest of you.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,110
Let's get into it.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,780
We won't be touching WordPress for a while.

14
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,010
Our primary focus is going to be JavaScript and react.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,860
Once we have become comfortable with JavaScript, we'll hop back into WordPress development.

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,460
Once you're ready, I'll see you in the following lecture.
