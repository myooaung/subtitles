00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.150
In this lecture, we're going to quickly study the anatomy of a block.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.300
So far, we've been pasting blocks into our template files without a second look.

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.630
I want to quickly discuss the code for a block.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.910
By no means is this lecture comprehensive.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.450
In a future section, we are going to dive deeper into block development.

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.850
For now, a brief overview of blocks will suffice for theme development to get started, we are going

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.910
to look at the index HTML file.

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
Inside this file we have three blocks.

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.610
Let's study the HTML block, html comments around most blocks you can think of them as opening and closing

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.420
tags.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
These comments let WordPress know where a block begins and ends.

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.830
Both comments contain the name of the block.

13
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.480
In this example, the name of the block is WP HTML.

14
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.570
There is a small difference to note in the comments.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.000
The closing comment has a forward slash character before the block's name.

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.660
This character should be applying to the comment that closes the block, otherwise WordPress will assume

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.630
it's a regular HTML comments inside these tags are the contents of the block.

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.290
Ultimately, this content is rendered on the page.

19
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
The HTML block is considered to be the simplest block available.

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.430
Let's look at a more complex example.

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.730
The template part block follows a different structure.

22
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:36.600
Unlike the HTML block, the template part block does not have inner content, nor does it have a closing

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.920
HTML comment.

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.700
Blocks can be self closing in either example, a forward slash character is added after the block's

25
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.270
name.

26
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.730
This syntax tells WordPress that the block does not have immediate inner content.

27
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.340
The template part block is an example of a block that renders content through PHP.

28
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.590
This behavior will be explored during the block development section of this course.

29
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.440
There's another strange feature worth noting after the name of the block we have JSON.

30
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.790
The settings of a block are stored as a JSON value in the comment.

31
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.200
WordPress will parse this object before presenting the content.

32
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.930
You're more than free to modify this object.

33
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.390
In most cases you won't have to.

34
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.960
There are better ways to modify the settings of a block.

35
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.520
It can be difficult to alter these settings through an HTML comment.

36
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.900
Our editor will not be able to provide syntax highlighting or code completion.

37
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.250
This behavior makes editing blocks difficult.

38
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.080
For this reason, I highly prefer editing blocks with the full site editor.

39
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.260
This approach reduces the likelihood of an error.

40
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.150
With that being said, it can be helpful to modify the settings for quickly testing your code.

41
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.690
That wraps up the anatomy of a block.

42
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.420
Let's continue working on our templates.
