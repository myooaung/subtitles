00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,390
In this lecture, we're going to explore an object available in JavaScript for debugging and application.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,760
Thus far we've been relying on the alert function to view our data in the browser.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,580
While useful, it has its shortcomings.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,730
The browser does not allow us to interact with the page while the alert box is opened on the page.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,510
For example, let's try running the script from our snippets.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,950
While the alert box is open, the page is completely unresponsive.

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,820
We can't scroll, click on links or type in forms.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,090
The alert box is holding us completely hostage.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,980
Interacting with the page isn't possible until the alert box goes away.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,140
Another shortcoming of the alert box is the limited space of the box.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,090
Oftentimes we may want to view the contents of an object or array.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,410
The alert box may not have enough room to display this information.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,300
The purpose of the alert box is to display a short message to visitors.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,880
It's not meant to debug an application.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,340
JavaScript has a special feature dedicated to viewing data called the console.

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,550
The browser has a dedicated panel for this feature.

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,360
Up until now, we've been writing into the console through the browser.

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,940
However, it's completely possible to write data from our code, so let's give it a try.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,110
Back in the snippets section, we will replace the alert function with a function called console log.

20
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,260
As you might expect, the console keyword is an object.

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,790
It's an object defined by the JavaScript language.

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,420
This object gives us access to methods and properties for interacting with the console of the environment.

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,480
In our case, the console is available through the browser's developer tools.

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,930
The log function is considered the most common function when available in the console object.

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,980
It will allow us to write a message to the console through our script.

26
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,960
Let's try running the script.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,150
The alert box never appears.

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,419
Instead, the balance gets logged in the console.

29
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,230
The console will provide us with two pieces of information regarding the message.

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,670
Firstly, the message appears on the left side.

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,840
On the right side, we're given the file's name and line number.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,900
This information can help track down a log.

33
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,970
Throughout your career, you're going to be writing dozens of long statements.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,390
It can be challenging to find where a message is coming from.

35
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,280
Clicking on this link will direct you to the exact location of the log.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,530
Unlike before, the page is completely free.

37
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,370
The console does not block us from interacting with the page.

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,210
The messages from the console do not go away with our interactions unless we navigate to a different

39
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,960
page.

40
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,880
In my opinion, the console object is superior to the alert function.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,540
For the rest of this course, we are going to debug our script with the console object.

42
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,820
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the documentation page for the console

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,630
object.

44
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,460
You're more than welcome to explore this page for the various methods available.

45
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,360
The most important method is the log method.

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,980
We'll be using it often.

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,470
Let's continue exploring objects in the next lecture.
