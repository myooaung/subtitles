00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,500
In this lecture we're going to discuss WordPress coding standards in the resource section of this lecture.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,650
I provide a link to the WordPress Best Practices page.

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,120
We're going to be writing a lot of code along the journey.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,910
We should adhere to certain practices.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,290
If we're on a team, it can be annoying if everyone writes code differently.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,780
Code should be consistent across the board.

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,330
WordPress outlines some guidelines for how you should write and format your code.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,590
On this page there are guidelines for different languages.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,280
We should follow these guidelines to the best of our abilities.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,100
Keep in mind that these are recommendations.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,580
You're not forced to write your code in a specific way.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,800
If you want to, you can completely ignore these recommendations.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,540
However, adhering to a standard will provide the best experience for everyone.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,380
If you plan on contributing to the core of WordPress, you must follow these guidelines if you plan

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,420
on releasing plugins and themes independently.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,330
These guidelines are optional.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,410
I'm going to click on the PHP Coding Standards link.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,340
You're more than free to review these standards.

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:22,040
Don't worry if it doesn't make complete sense throughout this course, I will try my best to adhere

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,510
to these standards.

21
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,860
As long as you follow along with me, you should be fine.

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,290
Let's begin coding themes in the next section.
