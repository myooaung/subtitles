00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,939
In this lecture we are going to begin recreating the header with WordPress blocks.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,350
Let's look at the header on the front end.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,960
I've zoomed in for a better view of the header.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,450
The best way to recreate an entire section is to break the section into smaller pieces.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,980
Let's try that together.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,390
Our header should be grouped this way we can move the header around.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,540
Luckily we're already doing this with the template part.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,070
Breaking it down further.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,570
We have three rows.

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,750
The first row contains a menu and paragraph.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,100
The second row contains the logo, search, form and log and link.

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,070
The last row contains another navigation menu.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,220
In total, we're going to have around ten blocks.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,720
That's just an estimate.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,080
We won't know until we create the blocks to get started.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,050
We are going to start from the top and work our way down.

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,600
Let's recreate the row of blocks.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,060
Switch over to the full site editor.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,110
From the site editor, we're going to work on the header template part.

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,790
The other blocks are in the way.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,760
Luckily, by using template parts, we can tell the editor to focus on a specific template part.

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,290
Let's click on the logo.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,550
This will open a sidebar on the sidebar click template parts.

24
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,430
Lastly, select the header template part.

25
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:22,280
By focusing on the template part, we can focus on the headers blocks without the clutter of the other

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
blocks on the page.

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,860
That's going to make development easier.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,520
The next step is to begin adding blocks.

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,490
As discussed before, we can consider the top bar a row of blocks.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,260
Therefore we can use the row block.

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,380
Let's add the row block to the top of the template.

32
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,270
This lock will act as the overall container for the top bar.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,230
The next step will depend on your answer to the next question Does the container need classes or styles?

34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,000
If so, you will need to modify the block.

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,820
Let's look at the HTML block for your convenience.

36
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,810
I've added HTML comments for you to find sections easily.

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,270
The top bar element is the root div element.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,169
Unfortunately, we don't have the benefit of syntax highlighting.

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,520
To make things easier.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,090
Here's an overview of the top bar on this element.

41
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:23,500
We're going to find three classes called P, three Text, SM and BG Gray 700.

42
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,510
The P three class will apply padding to the top and bottom of the element.

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,900
The text SM class will lower the font size.

44
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,400
Lastly, the BG Gray 700 class will change the background.

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,710
Color seems simple so far.

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,880
However, as developers we need to make an important decision.

47
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,500
Do we use classes for styling a block or should we use a block settings?

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,090
In my opinion, either a solution is valid, there is no wrong answer.

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,930
There are advantages and disadvantages to each solution.

50
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,050
Let's take a moment to weigh the pros and cons.

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,360
If you decide to use classes, it's going to be faster then configuring the block settings.

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,970
It's as simple as applying a class to a block, whereas block settings will be a lot of tweaking.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,950
On the other hand, it will be harder for clients to customize a block's appearance.

54
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,700
They will need knowledge of HTML and CSS, whereas tweaking a block settings will be easier with the

55
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,960
Gutenberg Editor.

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,390
Lastly, block settings are limited.

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,560
Not every Cso's property is adjustable through the block editor.

58
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,790
In these classes you will need to fall back to CSS classes.

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,890
For our theme, we're going to configure the properties through the block settings.

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,520
I prefer to give my clients as much control as possible.

61
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,290
It'll be easier for clients to modify a block's appearance through Gutenberg.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,230
At the end of the day, it's entirely up to you.

63
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,650
In the full sign editor Let's change the background color of the row block from the color selection

64
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,540
select the Udemy Gray 700 color.

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,520
This is the same color as the color for the original top bar.

66
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,890
Next, let's change the typography settings.

67
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,100
We're going to customize the font size to 0.875 REM.

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,950
Be sure to change the units.

69
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,790
The default is x.

70
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,769
Afterward.

71
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,540
Let's change the line height.

72
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,230
This setting may be hidden.

73
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,180
You should be able to toggle its appearance under the panels menu.

74
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,370
Once you've added it to the settings, set the line height to 1.25.

75
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,070
By the way, these are the exact same values as the values in the CSS classes.

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,360
All we're doing is transferring them from these static templates to the block.

77
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,390
The last setting is the padding by default.

78
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,530
Padding is applied to all sides.

79
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's unlock the padding to define settings for each side.

80
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,760
The top and bottom sides will reset to 0.75 REM.

81
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,620
The left and right sides will be set to zero.

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,490
Once again, be sure to use RAM as your unit.

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,820
The default unit was p x.

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,860
We're finished.

85
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Our block should be ready to go.

86
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,450
Let's save our changes.

87
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,090
For extra assurance.

88
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,060
Let's try viewing the home page on the front end.

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,350
A gray bar will appear above the current header.

90
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,920
It seems like the top bar has spacing issues, but that isn't the case.

91
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,980
We're currently loading two copies of the top bar.

92
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,780
We've successfully recreated the top bar.

93
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,680
The next step is to start adding the inner blocks to the bar.

94
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,630
Throughout this section, we're going to follow a basic process.

95
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,060
First, we're going to add a block.

96
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,920
This block should be suitable for the UI element.

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,320
We're trying to recreate seconds.

98
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,680
We're going to apply styles through the blocks settings.

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,590
Lastly, we will add classes for styles that can't be applied through a block settings.

100
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,060
In the next lecture, let's begin working on the container for the block.
