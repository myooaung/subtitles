00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.910
In this lecture, we were going to optimize the header and footer.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.020
It doesn't look like it, but there are some issues with our template parts.

3
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:14.040
One of the best ways to optimize a block is by checking the HTML generated by the block.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.260
I'm on the home page of our site.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.530
Let's check out the document with the developer tools under the Elements Panel Search for the header

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.190
tag.

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.230
You should be able to easily find this tag.

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.700
There's an HTML comment above it that says header.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.300
Our HTML is surrounded by a div tag with a class called WP block template part.

10
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.110
WordPress is default blocks will generate additional markup.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.490
Not the biggest crisis in the world, but not something we should overlook.

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.160
A bloated document can cause the page to load slower.

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.120
In addition, pages can be harder to debug.

14
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.600
Whenever possible, we should keep our documents minimal.

15
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.990
Luckily, the template part block is flexible.

16
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.550
We can optimize the generated HTML with the block settings.

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.720
During this section, we're going to ask ourselves a single question Can the block generate the same

18
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.120
HTML as our static template?

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.080
If it can, we will let the block generate the HTML.

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.940
Otherwise we'll use an HTML block.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.350
Keep in mind WordPress is HTML may not always match our static templates html.

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.280
However, as long as we can achieve a similar look, we can consider it a success.

23
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.340
In some cases, the result may be too unacceptable.

24
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.090
In these cases, we will need to resort to custom block developments, a topic we will get into in a

25
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.260
future section.

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
Currently I'm viewing the full site editor.

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.400
Let's select the header template part from the view list.

28
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.580
On the sidebar.

29
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.280
We can change the element that gets wrapped around the template parts blocks by viewing the advance

30
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.940
panel.

31
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.850
By default, WordPress will use the div tag for surrounding your template parts blocks.

32
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.260
We have the option of changing this setting to a different element.

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.510
Let's change the tag to header.

34
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.690
Since WordPress is generating this block, we can remove the header tag from the HTML block.

35
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.700
Before we do, there's one more change we should make back in your text editor.

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.460
Open the header html file.

37
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.980
On the header tag.

38
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.110
We have a class called Shadow.

39
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.350
This class should be applied to the element generated by the block.

40
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.410
Otherwise it will be lost.

41
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.470
Let's copy the class from the element.

42
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.430
Next.

43
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.060
Back in the browser, we can update our template part.

44
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.500
Under the advanced section there will be a field called class.

45
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.560
Lets paste the class into this field.

46
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.530
WordPress will merge its classes with our classes.

47
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.920
Our lock is ready.

48
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.260
The last step is to save it in the template file.

49
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.640
Copy the header template part.

50
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.710
Next, let's update the indexed HTML file.

51
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.650
We're going to replace the first block with the new copy.

52
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.860
Switch over to the header html file, we can safely remove the surrounding header tags from the block.

53
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.520
We will be left with three div tags.

54
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.500
There are sections for the top bar, mid section and primary menu.

55
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.330
Let's try testing our theme by refreshing the home page on the front end.

56
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.950
Nothing seems to be broken using the developer tools.

57
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.910
Let's check out the header tag.

58
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.980
This time things are different.

59
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.160
The element surrounding our template part has changed from a div tag to a header tag.

60
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.110
The classes have emerged.

61
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.300
The header tag has the shadow and WP block template part classes.

62
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.400
This is precisely what we wanted by letting the block generate the HTML.

63
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.540
We've reduced the bloat and clutter that we previously had.

64
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.029
It's time to start working on the footer.

65
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.870
The same problem occurs for this section of our templates.

66
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.500
As an exercise, try tackling this problem on your own.

67
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.660
The element wrapping the footer section can be generated with the template part block.

68
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.900
Pause the video.

69
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.880
Good luck.

70
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.280
Welcome back.

71
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.480
If you are able to update the templates, that's great.

72
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.380
If not, that's fine as well.

73
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.410
Let's go through the solution together in your text editor.

74
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.560
Let's open the footer HTML file.

75
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.320
The root element is a footer tag with the class's BG Gray 716.

76
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.570
Rather than creating this element in this block, we can let the template part block create it for us.

77
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.840
Copy the class to your clipboard.

78
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.260
Next, switch over to the full site editor.

79
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.070
Let's select the footer template area from the list view.

80
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.820
On the sidebar, we're going to update the tag to footer.

81
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.920
Lastly, paste the class into the class field.

82
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.380
The last step is to update our templates from the list view.

83
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.170
Copy the template part to your clipboard.

84
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.700
Switch over to the index html file.

85
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.970
The lock at the bottom can be replaced with a new copy of The BLOCK.

86
00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.000
Lastly, switch over to the footers html file.

87
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.610
We can safely remove the footer tag.

88
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.700
Time to give our app a test by reloading the front page.

89
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.460
If we scroll to the bottom of the page, the template is completely functional.

90
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.950
The footer renders the same as before.

91
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:28.250
Let's verify the template is correct by viewing the element with the developer tools, same as before.

92
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.830
The footer element has the WP block template part class.

93
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840
That's great.

94
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.750
We've successfully finished optimizing our templates in the next lecture.

95
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.530
Let's continue working on the template for the home page.
