00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,330
In this lecture, we are going to begin extending the global styles by adding colors to the color palette.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,590
The color palette is a series of colors that the user can choose from.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,640
Optionally, they can add custom colors to the color palette.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,870
Let's explore the color palette and the editor before modifying it.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,870
Inside the Gutenberg Editor, we are modifying the index templates on the right side.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,850
Let's open the global styles.

7
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,960
Sidebar.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,890
If we were to click on the Colors option, we would be given the option to modify.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,140
You can click on the palette option to add colors by default.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,040
WordPress will provide a few colors to help you get started.

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,040
If you're developing a theme, you should consider disabling WordPress Default Color Palettes.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,230
If you intend on recommending colors, providing too many options can be overbearing.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,310
Less is more.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,120
Therefore you should remove WordPress as recommendations.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,270
At the end of the day, it's completely up to you.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,290
For our theme, we are going to be adding a lot of colors.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,140
It makes sense to remove the default palettes.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,400
Let's give it a try.

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,290
Switch over to your editor.

20
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,650
We will be working with the theme JSON file.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,590
Inside the root object.

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,240
Add a new property called settings with an initial value of an object.

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,950
These settings object allows us to modify these settings related to the editor for a better description.

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:36,340
You can hover your mouse over the property name as long as you're adding the schema to the file.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,490
Descriptions will be available for most properties.

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,060
Without the schema, we wouldn't be given this description.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,360
As you can see, WordPress states that we can modify which customization settings are available to the

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,020
user.

29
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,360
You may be wondering how do I know what settings are available?

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,480
There are two resources worth checking out.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,330
Any resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to both resources.

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,960
The first resource provides a beginner's guide to the theme.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,430
JSON File.

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:14,280
If you're getting started with theme development, this resource will provide examples and descriptions

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,170
of what you can do with the theme.

36
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,690
JSON file.

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,340
As for the second resource, it's not as beginner friendly.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
This reference will provide a complete list of all available options in the theme.

39
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,980
Jason File For example.

40
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,750
We are given the name, type and default value of each property.

41
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,170
If these resources feel overwhelming, don't worry.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,930
Throughout this section, we are going to review the most important settings for theme development.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,320
Don't feel pressured to add every option available.

44
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,720
Let's head back to our editors.

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,980
Inside these settings.

46
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,190
Object add another object called colors.

47
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,110
The description for this property says the following settings related to color.

48
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,810
We're on the right track.

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,230
Inside this object, we can add a property called default palettes.

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,290
By default, this property is set to true.

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,910
Setting this property to true will allow WordPress to recommend colors.

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,900
We can disable this feature by setting this property to false.

53
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,810
Let's refresh the editor in our browsers.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,180
If we take a peek at the color section of the global styles, things are going to be different.

55
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,630
Unlike before, the palette will be completely empty.

56
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,770
To be clear, we haven't disabled the option to pick colors.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:48,610
Users can still add custom colors to their theme by setting the default palette property to false.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,220
WordPress will not recommend colors.

59
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,660
Let's keep playing around with colors in the next set of lectures.
