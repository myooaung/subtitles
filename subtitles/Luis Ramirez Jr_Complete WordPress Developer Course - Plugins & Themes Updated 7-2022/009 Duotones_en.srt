00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,950
In this lecture, we are going to start getting into dual tones.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,630
This is probably one of the most interesting features for customizing a site with colors.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,540
The idea of a duotone is simple.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,550
A duotone is a filter that can be applied to images or videos.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,910
Essentially, the filter applies to colors.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,270
On this slide I provided some examples.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,190
Do tones are similar to Instagram filters, but there is a big difference.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:36,300
An Instagram filter will adjust the color levels of an image, whereas a duotone filter will completely

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,490
override the colors of an image.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,560
For this reason, duo tones are recommended for images with high contrast.

11
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,530
This feature can be cool, but be warned this feature is experimental.

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,230
The WordPress team has stated that there are some bugs.

13
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,570
You should be cautious with this feature.

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,920
Regardless, let's learn how to add duo tones to our theme.

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,650
In your editor, open the theme JSON file by default.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Dual tones are enabled.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,820
We can apply them to blocks that add images to a template such as the image cover and site logo blocks

18
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,280
similar to colors.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,480
We have the option of adding custom duo tones.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
Let's give that a try.

21
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,440
Inside the color object, add a property called Duotone.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,690
Its value will be an array.

23
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,720
This format for adding a duotone tone is similar to registering a colour.

24
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,840
The array must contain a list of objects with the properties, slug colours and name.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,040
Let's add our first duotone for the slug.

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,500
Let's set the ID to you.

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,950
Pink sunset.

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,770
Next, add an array called colors.

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,040
Here's where things become different.

30
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,710
Duo tones are created with two colors, which are the shadow and highlight.

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:06,080
The shadow represents the dark color and the highlight represents the lighter color.

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,020
Inside this array, we must add shadow and highlight in this order.

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,280
If you forget the order, you can hover your mouse over the colors array for a hint.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,990
Keep in mind duo tones offer limited support for color values.

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,590
Only hex and RGV values are accepted.

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:33,080
The colors for our duo tone will be the following 11245e and DC 4379.

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,290
Lastly, let's give our Duotone a name.

38
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,910
The name will be the following to me.

39
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,230
Pink sunset.

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,840
Before testing our dual tone, let's learn how to disable this feature in our theme.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,580
As I said before, dual tones are available for most blocks that have images.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,640
The cover block is one example.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,050
Lets disable dual tone for this block in the blocks object.

44
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,500
Add a property called Core Slash cover.

45
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,280
To save time, I will give you the name of the cover block.

46
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,610
You can verify the name with the reference inside this object.

47
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,500
Add the color object.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,330
There are two settings for completely disabling the block.

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,700
The first setting is the dual tone property.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,870
If you were to add this property without a series of dual tones, WordPress would not provide a list

51
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,390
of duotone colours.

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,180
However, users will be able to select custom duotone colors.

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,400
We can disable the custom color picker for duo tones by setting the custom duotone option to false.

54
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,920
Alternatively, you can disable the custom color picker while providing a series of dual tones.

55
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,610
It's completely up to you.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,420
Let's try testing our new features in the browser.

57
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,570
I'm going to quickly upload an image through the image block.

58
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,670
A dual tone can be applied to an image from the toolbar.

59
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,470
If we were to select this option, our dual tone should appear as an option.

60
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,850
Let's try applying it to our image.

61
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,370
Pretty cool, right?

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Duo tones can be a great way to enhance the appearance of an image.

63
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,940
There's not much else to say about duo tones.

64
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,170
They are an experimental feature for applying colorful effects to an image.
