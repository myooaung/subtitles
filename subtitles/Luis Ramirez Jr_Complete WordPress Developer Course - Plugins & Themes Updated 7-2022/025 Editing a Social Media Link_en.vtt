00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.890
In this lecture, we are going to add the form for editing a link.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.120
The URL and icon for a social media handle will be modifiable.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.430
Let's get into it in your editor.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.770
Open the edit JS file.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.900
To get started.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.470
Let's import some components from the components package.

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.520
Grab two components called text control and button.

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.030
The button component is new to us.

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.610
This component will render a button with the same styles as the buttons in the Gutenberg Editor.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.480
We are going to add a button for removing a link.

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.200
This component will help us add an option for removing the link.

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.720
These components are all we'll need.

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.810
Scroll to the div tag with the class called team member social edit container.

14
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.330
Inside this element.

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.440
Let's add the text control component for changing the URL.

16
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.510
The label property will be a translatable value with the following text your URL.

17
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.390
Next set the value property to the following value.

18
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.180
Social Handles Active social link dot url.

19
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.840
We're selecting a specific item from the array using the active social link state.

20
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.230
This variable contains the index of the active link.

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.760
By using this state, we can easily access the properties relative to the current link.

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.990
Next, let's add the on change event.

23
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.400
Pass in an arrow function that accepts the new value as an argument called URL.

24
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.960
Updating an attribute that stores an array is tricky.

25
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.950
WordPress advises against updating specific items from within an array.

26
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.270
We must completely override the attribute value.

27
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.110
The recommended solution is to create a copy of the array.

28
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.520
The copy of the array can be updated after updating the copy.

29
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.820
The copy can be stored as the attributes value.

30
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.470
Lets copy the item in the array by creating a variable called temporary link.

31
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:23.160
The value for this variable will be an object with the social handles active social link object merged

32
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.750
into the current object.

33
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.740
Next, let's make a copy of the entire array.

34
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.120
Define a variable called temporary social.

35
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.530
The value for this variable will be the social handles array spread into an array.

36
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.780
Next we can update the URL by setting the temporary link dot URL property to the URL argument.

37
00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.520
Afterward, we can update the temporary social active social link item with the temporary link object.

38
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.800
Lastly, let's call the set attributes function.

39
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.300
The social handles attribute will be set to the temporary variable.

40
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.050
The field for modifying the URL is ready.

41
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.120
Let's make a copy of this component for the icon.

42
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.620
Next, let's change the label to icon.

43
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.600
The value attribute will point to the icon property within the object.

44
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.900
Lastly, the on change event will modify the icon property instead of the URL.

45
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.270
We're almost finished.

46
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.550
The next step is to add the button for deleting the link from the team members card below the controls.

47
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.410
Add the button components.

48
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.310
The button component is a convenient component for adding a button to a block that matches the styles

49
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.810
from the Gutenberg Editor.

50
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.080
We can change the color of the button by applying properties to the button.

51
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.800
In this example, the button will delete a link which can be considered a dangerous action.

52
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.149
Let's use the is destructive button to highlight this action.

53
00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:27.820
The is destructive property will change the colour of the button to read in WordPress is opinion read

54
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.560
is associated with the action of deletion or destruction.

55
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.130
I think it's appropriate for our block inside the components tags.

56
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.730
Add the following translatable text remove.

57
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.490
Next, add the on click event.

58
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.080
If the button is clicked, we can begin deleting a link pass in an arrow function to handle this logic.

59
00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.120
Inside the function, we are going to create a copy of the array for the same reason as before.

60
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.340
WordPress does not allow an attribute to be partially updated.

61
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.840
The attributes value must be completely overridden.

62
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.640
Therefore, let's create a copy by creating a variable called temporary copy.

63
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.510
The value for this variable will be an array with the social handles attribute spread into it.

64
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.220
Next, let's call the splice function on this array.

65
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.310
I'm introducing a new function called Splice.

66
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.790
The splice function is available on all arrays.

67
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.830
It'll delete an item from the array.

68
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.640
There are two arguments which are the starting index and the number of items to delete from that index.

69
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.120
Let's pass send the active social link state.

70
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.940
Conveniently, this state variable contains the index of the current item.

71
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.440
As for the second argument, let's pass in one.

72
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.320
We are instructing JavaScript to delete a single item from the array.

73
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.070
The deletion will occur at the index specified in the first argument.

74
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.400
The splice function directly modifies the array it's been called on.

75
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.820
Let's call the set attributes function to modify the social handles attribute to the temporary copy

76
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.630
variable.

77
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.360
Next, let's update the active social link state.

78
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.590
The link will disappear from the block.

79
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.230
Therefore, the link should not be active.

80
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.470
Let's call the set active social link function to set the state to null.

81
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.360
After making those changes, we can start testing our block in the browser.

82
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.150
Refresh the experimental page.

83
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.190
Next, add the team members group block to the page.

84
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.570
We can freely modify the links for each team member.

85
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.330
This includes the icons.

86
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.640
Changing the icons can be tricky.

87
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:08.680
The icons name must match the name from the bootstrap icon set.

88
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.750
Refer to the documentation for a complete list of social media icons.

89
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.760
Let's try removing a social media link by pressing the remove button.

90
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.210
The form should disappear after clicking this button.

91
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.690
The relative social media link has disappeared too.

92
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.450
This is the exact behavior we were looking for.

93
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.080
Great.

94
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.860
We've successfully added support for social media links.

95
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.280
The last set of lectures will focus on saving the block.

96
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.480
I'll see you there.
