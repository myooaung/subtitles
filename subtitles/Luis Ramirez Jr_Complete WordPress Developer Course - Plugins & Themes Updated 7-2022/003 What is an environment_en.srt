00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,720
In this lecture, we're going to learn about environments before writing a single line of code.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,340
We need an environment to test our code.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,180
Naturally, WordPress cannot run without additional software.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,940
It requires an environment to be functional.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,970
That begs the question what is an environment?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,620
An environment refers to the physical location where your code runs.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,700
It's a machine installed with software for executing a program.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,690
WordPress needs additional programs to be fully functional.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,050
There are two types of environments you'll come across.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,800
The first type of environment is a production environment.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,690
Typically, WordPress sites are hosted by a company with hundreds of servers.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,460
You may have purchased a server from one of these companies to host your WordPress site.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,600
Some examples would be site grounds, name, cheap or kin stuff.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,930
These companies will install the software required to run WordPress on top of installing the necessary

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,470
software, your site will be accessible to the public.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,610
Anyone with a link will be able to visit your site from their browser.

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,470
We would consider this type of environment a production environment.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,150
Production environments are great for hosting a site, but not for development.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,980
They're not easy to update.

20
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,440
Let's say a template needs to be updated.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,620
Files must be uploaded manually to a server.

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,720
This process can take a while.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,400
Also, updating a live site can disrupt a user's experience.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,320
If you accidentally upload a broken file, visitors may receive errors.

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,570
Production environment should have the most stable copy of your WordPress site.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,220
As developers, we need an environment that allows us to make as many breaking changes as possible.

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,710
This is referred to as a development environment.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,240
Unlike a production environment, the development environments are private.

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,370
They're only accessible to us.

30
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,780
If we break a site that's perfectly fine, users won't notice.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,960
We are free to experiment as much as we'd like.

32
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,830
Development environments can be created on our machines.

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,070
We don't need to purchase a server from a company.

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,250
It's completely free to get an environment installed.

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,080
There's just one problem.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,890
Various programs must be installed for running WordPress.

37
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,330
Not only that, these programs need to be configured to work together.

38
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,800
That's a lot of hassle.

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,930
Luckily we can avoid the trouble of creating an environment in the resource section of this lecture.

40
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,040
I provide a link to a tool called Local.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,290
Local is a program for creating an environment on your personal desktop.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:49,460
It'll install and configure the software for running WordPress Local is my favorite tool for WordPress

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,390
development.

44
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,110
Before moving on to the following lecture, I want you to download and install this program and selling

45
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,270
this program is like installing any other program.

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,620
Just click next until you've reached the end.

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,570
You may need to provide your email before downloading the program.

48
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,970
However, this program is entirely free.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,050
Local is not the only program available for creating a development environment for WordPress.

50
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,010
If you prefer to use another program for running WordPress, that's perfectly fine.

51
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,240
As long as you can run WordPress on your machine, you're good to go.

52
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,330
For this course, I'm going to be using local.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,100
Once you've installed it, let's begin installing WordPress in the next lecture.
