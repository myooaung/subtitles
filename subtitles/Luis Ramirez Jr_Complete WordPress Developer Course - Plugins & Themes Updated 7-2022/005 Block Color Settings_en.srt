1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,580
In this lecture, we are going to enable the default palette for the site title block.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,180
Previously, we disabled the default color palette on a global level.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,080
This action carries large implications.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,230
Disabling the default palette will be reflected on a global level if blocks have support for picking

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,840
colors.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,320
The default selection will be removed.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,700
For example, in our template we have the site title block.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,920
Lets view the settings for this block.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,549
If you were to click on the block, the settings might not appear.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,690
This is because the global styles sidebar is opened.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,080
You can switch to viewing a block settings by clicking on the cog icon at the top right corner.

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,910
Under the settings there will be a panel called Colors.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,410
If we were to view any of the colors, the default palette has been removed from the block.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,030
In some cases you may not want to apply settings to all blocks.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,140
Alternatively, you can apply settings to specific blocks.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,100
For example, let's try enabling the default palette for the site title block in your editor, open

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,410
the theme dot JSON file.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,580
Inside these settings object at a property called Blocks.

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,420
This property's value will be an object.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,040
According to the description, we can apply settings to specific blocks.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,550
We're not forced to apply settings on a global level.

22
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:36,810
WordPress allows us to be more precise with our configuration inside this object, we need to provide

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,450
the block's name registered with the editor.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,030
The question is how do we get the name?

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,260
Let's head over to the developer resource to find this information.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,060
On the homepage, we are presented with links to different resources.

27
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,450
Resources related to the block editor can be found under the block editor link.

28
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,840
Lets click on it.

29
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,410
The BLOCK Editor handbook will provide information related to the Gutenberg editor.

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,330
This includes information on the core blocks of WordPress.

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,750
On the sidebar, there's a menu called References.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,840
If we view these links, there's a link for viewing the list of core blocks.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,930
Before clicking this link, I want to point out the theme JSON link.

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,530
If you ever lose the link for modifying this file, you can find it here.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,400
All right, let's view the core blocks reference link.

36
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,520
If you're unable to find this link, check out the resource section of this lecture.

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,310
I provide a direct link to this page.

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,400
On this page, let's search for the site title block.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,830
Under each block, WordPress will provide a description name category, list of supported features and

40
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,860
attributes.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,260
At the moment, the most important piece of information is the name.

42
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,590
Everything else will be revisited in a future lecture.

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,780
Copy the name to your clipboard.

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,420
Next head on over to your editor.

45
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,170
Inside the block's object, we will paste the name as a property name.

46
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,140
The value for the block will be an object.

47
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,840
After adding the block name, we can modify the block settings the same way we would on a global level.

48
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,470
Therefore, we copy and paste the color object.

49
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,010
The main goal was to add the default palette to the site title block.

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,470
Lets toggle the value to true.

51
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,300
Time to test our code in your browser.

52
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,450
Try viewing the colors for the site title lock.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,110
Awesome.

54
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,780
The default color palette appears for the block.

55
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,400
WordPress gives us a lot of flexibility with configuring the site editor.

56
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,830
There's one key point I want to mention.

57
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,410
If a block does not support a feature enabling, it will not do anything.

58
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,560
The block has to have support for a feature for it to be enabled.

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,010
Let's continue our discussion in the next lecture.
