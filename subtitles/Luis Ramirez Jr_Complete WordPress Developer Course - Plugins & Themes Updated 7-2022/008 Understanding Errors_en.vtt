00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lecture, let's briefly talk about errors.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.410
Undoubtedly you're going to run into errors.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
There are hundreds of possible errors in the PHP world.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.910
The best way to tackle errors is to read the message for the most part.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
PHP does a decent job of providing basic error info.

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.640
Let's look at an example.

7
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.350
In our PHP file we have a constant as a stated before.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.550
Constants can never be updated.

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.330
Despite that statement, let's try changing the constants.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.850
After defining the name, constants create a second constant with the same name.

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.730
The value should be different.

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.370
Next, let's refresh the browser.

13
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.580
As expected, an error has been produced.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.020
Let's read it together.

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.190
Warning constant name already defined in test PHP.

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.530
In my opinion this is pretty helpful info.

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.510
Every word helps us understand the issue with our code.

18
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.370
Let's dissect the anatomy of an error.

19
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.840
First things first.

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.560
PHP will tell us the type of error in this example.

21
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.260
PHP says the error is a warning.

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.290
Warnings do not stop the script from running.

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.080
If there's a problem, PHP will tell you about it, but we'll continue to run the rest of the scripts

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.280
for this reason.

25
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.980
The name gets outputted after the error.

26
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.090
Afterward, we are provided a description of the error.

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.170
According to the description, our consent has already been defined.

28
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.990
The description is pretty cut and clear.

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.190
We are attempting to define a constant that's been defined before.

30
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.500
The last piece of the error message is the file name and line number of the error.

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
This points us directly to where the error can be found.

32
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.280
Let's try removing this line from our file.

33
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.880
Lastly, refresh the page.

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.610
The air has gone away.

35
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.390
Perfect.

36
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.160
We've successfully debugged our scripts.

37
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.590
It won't always be this simple, but PHP does try to help you whenever it can.

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.270
You should always carefully read the error to understand why your script is not working.

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.400
In the next lecture, let's discuss one more feature before moving to WordPress.
