00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,660
In this lecture, we are going to begin styling the blocks for the post list similar to before.

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,080
The process of styling blocks is straightforward.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,310
We need to compare our HTML with the blocks h html.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,040
Next, we need to identify what properties can be applied via block settings.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,830
Lastly, we can fill in the gaps with custom CSS classes for reference.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,360
If you don't want to watch me applying these changes, check out the PDF.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,860
I provide a summary of all the changes I made to each block.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,240
Let's get started.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,110
We're going to start from the top and work our way down the list.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,350
The first block is the post author block.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,300
In the index html file.

12
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,930
The HTML for this can be found under an HTML comment that says author.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,710
For your convenience, I have a copy in isolation.

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,410
The static copy of this template is straightforward.

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:07,210
We have a single class called Post Author which will change various properties.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,270
The Post Author block is very flexible.

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:17,290
We can change most of the properties through the block settings such as the text, color and margins.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,100
Let's modify the post author block.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,720
Starting with the settings, let's enable the show Avatar Option.

20
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,880
The Post Author BLOCK can display the author's image, name and bio.

21
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,380
For our case, the image and name will suffice.

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,110
Next set the size to 24 by 24.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,630
The image does not need to be large.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,820
The smaller the size, the better.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,350
This is going to allow our pages to load faster afterward.

26
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,420
Set the text color to you.

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,260
To me, Gray.

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,340
700.

29
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,760
This is the same color that's applied by the Post author class.

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,570
The last setting will be the dimensions.

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,660
There should be space below the block set the bottom margin to 0.5 REM.

32
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,100
As for the padding, we can set the padding to zero on all sides.

33
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:27,020
Unfortunately, the block does not have settings for rounding the image or aligning the image and text.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,420
Therefore, let's add the post author class to fill in the gaps.

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,770
The Post Author BLOCK is finished.

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's modify the post title block.

37
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,380
The template for this block can be found under a comment that says post title in the indexed HTML file.

38
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,920
The H two tag has four classes for modifying the spacing and typography properties.

39
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,700
Luckily, the post title block has settings for modifying the same properties.

40
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,890
Therefore, we can omit the custom classes.

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,310
For the block settings, we're going to enable the make title a link option by default.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
The title is raw text.

43
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,760
However, I think it would be a good idea to make the title clickable.

44
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,360
The block will handle generating a link that points to the correct post.

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,200
Afterward, we can modify the color of the text.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,010
Since the title will be a link, we're going to modify the link color to Utomi Gray 700.

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,680
Next, let's modify the typography settings.

48
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,010
The font size should be set to 1.25 REM.

49
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,200
Luckily, our theme has the desired font size as an option.

50
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,600
A custom value is not required.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,960
The appearance option should be set to bold.

52
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,700
Lastly, let's toggle the line height option.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,470
The line height should be set to 1.75.

54
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,150
The dimensions will need to be modified to add spacing below the title if the margins options are not

55
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,870
available.

56
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
Toggle its appearance.

57
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,200
The bottom margin should be set.

58
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,180
2.5 RAM.

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,500
That should finalize our title.

60
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,460
The last block in the column is the Post Date BLOCK.

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,300
You can find this block under a comment that says Date.

62
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,360
Unlike the other sections of the template, there's not much that needs to be changed.

63
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,270
There's a single class for modifying the color of the text.

64
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,300
Under the block settings, we are going to modify two settings.

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,760
First, we're going to enable the link to post option to convert the static text into a link.

66
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,490
After doing so, we can change the color.

67
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,650
Let's set the link color to you.

68
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,430
To me, Gray.

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,390
500.

70
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,380
We've completed the styles for the first column.

71
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,960
So far so good.

72
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,400
Let's start working on the blocks in the second column.

73
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,020
The first block is the Post Featured Image BLOCK.

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,240
The HTML for the image can be found under a comment that says Post image.

75
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,880
There aren't too many classes being applied to the element.

76
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,140
Most of them will allow the image to be responsive.

77
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,580
Luckily, the Post featured Image BLOCK will create a responsive image.

78
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,230
Therefore, most of these classes can be omitted.

79
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,390
Time to start configuring the block.

80
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,370
First, we're going to enable the link to post option.

81
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,690
Our images should redirect users to the post if clicked on.

82
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,570
Next, we're going to set the dimensions by updating the width to 100%.

83
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,860
The height will not have a value.

84
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,990
We'll let the browser determine an appropriate height for the image.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Next, let's apply margins.

86
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,140
These settings may be hidden.

87
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,980
You can toggle their appearance from the panel's dropdown menu.

88
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,880
The image is sitting close to the tags and comment counts.

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,570
We should add margins below the image to add breathing room.

90
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,530
Set the bottom margin option to one REM.

91
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,810
Lastly, let's add to classes called rounded log and overflow hidden.

92
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,750
Our original design will apply rounded corners to a post's image.

93
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,170
These classes will achieve the rounded corner effect.

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,050
We're finished with the image.

95
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,030
We're getting close to finishing the post template.

96
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,320
Let's keep going.

97
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,030
The next set of locks is for the tags and common count of a post.

98
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,880
Unlike the other blocks, we are grouping these blocks with a row block.

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,250
This block allows children blocks to be aligned side by side.

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:09,060
In the static templates, we're applying various classes to achieve the same effect.

101
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,380
As a result, we can avoid most of the classes since the row block takes care of it.

102
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,890
In addition, we may be able to get away with applying properties directly to the row.

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:26,850
As we know, children elements may inherit class values from the parent wrapper.

104
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,200
Since Gutenberg blocks output html.

105
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,940
The same rules apply.

106
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,110
Let's begin by adding spacing between the inner blocks.

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:44,780
The tags block should be positioned to the left, while the common count block should be positioned

108
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,730
to the right.

109
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,890
We can set the justification option to space between to configure their positions.

110
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,800
Next, disable the ramp option to prevent the locks from appearing on new lines.

111
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,870
This shouldn't be a problem for most posts, but it's always good to think ahead.

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,560
Afterward, we can begin modifying the colors.

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,260
The text color should be set to you.

114
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,250
To me Gray.

115
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,210
500.

116
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:20,440
Up next, let's configure the typography settings, the tags and common count block support typography

117
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,210
settings.

118
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,750
However, both blocks will have the same font size.

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,850
Rather than configuring the typography settings separately, we can apply them to the row block.

120
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:38,380
The children blocks will inherit the font size, set the font size to 0.875 REM.

121
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,740
One more thing.

122
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,160
The bottom padding should be set to one room to add space between the row and excerpt.

123
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,090
The changes we've applied are not perfect.

124
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,780
There are two noticeable problems.

125
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:01,360
Firstly, the links for the tags are not the same colour as the colour for the row.

126
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,260
Secondly, the comment count block is missing an icon.

127
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's fix both issues.

128
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:14,410
For the links, we can easily change the link colour by modifying the post tag block under the post

129
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,000
tag block settings.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,510
Set the link colour to Udemy Grey 500.

131
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,050
The color we're using is the same color applied to the row block.

132
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,660
Our tags and common count should match.

133
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,650
Nothing else needs to change.

134
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,070
Let's move on to the second issue.

135
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,210
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a font family called Bootstrap Icons.

136
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,070
Our theme utilizes an icon set by bootstrap.

137
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,600
The icon set is not to be confused with the bootstrap framework.

138
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,890
It's possible to use the icon set without using the framework.

139
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,060
Our theme just not rely on the bootstrap framework only on its icons.

140
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,850
If you're not familiar with bootstraps icons, let's quickly talk about them.

141
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
Bootstrap offers over 100 icons for free.

142
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,740
We can easily load them into our theme with a single stylesheet.

143
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,480
Fortunately, we've already done so in the last section.

144
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,340
We can immediately start using the icon.

145
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,570
Using an icon is easy.

146
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,520
It's a simple list.

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,880
Clicking on the icon on the right.

148
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,570
The documentation will provide a code snippet for adding the icon.

149
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,240
Each icon has a unique class applied to it.

150
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,410
If we can apply these classes to our block, the icon should appear.

151
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,550
Let's head back to the editor.

152
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,750
Select the comment count block from the list under the advanced panel.

153
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,220
Add the following class b i post comment counts.

154
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,660
This class will add one of bootstrap icons to the block.

155
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,580
Keep in mind, the theme I'm providing will apply additional styles to the icons.

156
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,610
This may not work on your theme without a few modifications through CSS.

157
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,280
If we look at the row, the design matches the static templates.

158
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,060
Awesome.

159
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,680
We're almost finished.

160
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,920
The last piece of the puzzle is the excerpt.

161
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,940
There's not much to say about the Post excerpt.

162
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,210
The class applied to the paragraph will modify the font size.

163
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,390
That's about it.

164
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,090
Select the post excerpt block from the list.

165
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:40,780
Next we will update the typography settings by setting the font size to 0.875 REM.

166
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,930
We're finished.

167
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,040
That was a lot to go through, but hopefully things worked out for you.

168
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,790
Let's save our templates.

169
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,680
After saving the template, refresh the page on the front end.

170
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,150
Not everything will come out as expected.

171
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,110
There are noticeable problems with the design.

172
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,140
The second column has awkward spacing above the image.

173
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,850
Do you understand why?

174
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,010
Let's check out the CSS properties for the second column.

175
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:19,910
In the document columns are created with div tags with a class called WP BLOCK column.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,810
On the second div tag.

177
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,610
The developer tools will highlight the problem on the page.

178
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,460
The element has a margin.

179
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,980
This margin is added by WordPress.

180
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,000
We should override this behavior by adding our own margins.

181
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,300
Now that we've identified the problem, let's try fixing the issues.

182
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,840
Back in the editor, let's modify the columns block in the post template, the spacing is awkward.

183
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,710
We can adjust the spacing by changing the columns, padding and margin properties back in the settings.

184
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:55,430
Add the padding and margin options to the dimensions panel.

185
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,700
The bottom padding and margin should be set to 2.5 REM.

186
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,430
Let's address the second issue with the second column, as we've discussed before.

187
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,680
The second column contains unwanted margins.

188
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,120
Select the second column from the Post template.

189
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,810
Unfortunately, individual columns do not support margins.

190
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,020
Therefore we need to resort to classes.

191
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:38,180
Luckily, our theme has a class for removing margins under the advanced panel and the exclamation point

192
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,160
empty zero class.

193
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,410
That should fix the awkward spacing with our columns.

194
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,440
Time to save our templates.

195
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,100
Next, try refreshing the page on the front end.

196
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,630
It took a while, but we finally finished the post templates.

197
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,510
The process should be drilled into you by now.

198
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,600
Developing a theme is as simple as toying around with block settings until you get the design you're

199
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,470
hoping for.

200
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,990
Pat yourself on the back.

201
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,300
You deserve a break once you're ready.

202
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,010
Let's finish the index template by working on the sidebar and footer of the template.
