00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.910
In this lecture, we will add the 404 template to our theme.

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.660
Currently, I am viewing the template hierarchy documentation page for the 404 template.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.540
According to the hierarchy, WordPress will search for a 404 file if a 404 file is not present.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.600
The index template is loaded.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.970
Our index template is not suitable for displaying the 404 page.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.780
If we think about it, a 404 page indicates content couldn't be found.

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.050
Unlike most pages, the query could not find a post or page for the specified URL.

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
Therefore, it doesn't make any sense to display a loop.

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.050
Let's add this template to our theme.

10
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.520
Switch over to your editor in the templates folder.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.280
Create a file called 44. HTML.

12
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.180
After creating this template, let's begin adding blocks.

13
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
I have a separate tab opened with the static version of the 404 template.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.000
As you can see, it's very simple.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.980
We have three rows of text to inform the user that a page couldn't be found.

16
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.410
It's nothing you can't create yourself with heading and paragraph blocks.

17
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.990
For this reason I will give you the template for this page.

18
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.540
I don't want to waste your time creating a page like this when it's extremely straightforward.

19
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.000
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a gist with the templates.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.310
Copy the template to your clipboard.

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.810
Next, switch back to the code editor.

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.180
Paste the template into the file.

23
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.820
Like I said before, there's not much worth mentioning if you were to look through the blocks, most

24
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.140
of them are paragraphs and headings.

25
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.730
Let's try triggering a404 error in our theme.

26
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.920
Open the home page in your browser.

27
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.370
Inside the URL, we're going to add gibberish.

28
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.680
After changing pages, we are presented with the 404 page.

29
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.760
We can consider the new template a success.

30
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.970
Creating templates is very easy.

31
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.300
As long as we follow the naming conventions outlined in the documentation, we can customize pages for

32
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.550
different URLs.

33
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.460
Let's continue working with the hierarchy in the following lecture.
