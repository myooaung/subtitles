00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,180
In this lecture, we are going to begin generating dummy content.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
Fake content is going to help us test our theme.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,250
We could write some content, but that will take up a lot of time.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,300
Luckily, there's a plug in that can generate some content for us.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,770
This will give us a better idea of what our site will look like with content.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,530
Open the WordPress Admin Dashboard.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Navigate to the add new plugin page.

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,300
Search for a plugin called Finger Press by a user called Gustavo.

9
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,710
This plugin will generate dummy content for your site.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,280
I find it perfect for quickly generating fake content.

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,580
Let's install and activate it.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,030
After activating the plug in.

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,920
Let's generate some content.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,540
We'll start by creating some terms.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,010
Terms are the categories and tags associated with a post.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:03,880
Before generating posts, we should generate terms for the posts on the sidebar.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,480
A new menu item called Figure Press will be available under this menu item select terms.

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,100
We have a couple of options we can set.

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,090
We're going to set the quantity to between five and ten.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,000
The name size will be between one and two.

21
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,330
The taxonomies will be set to categories and tags.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,560
Everything else is fine as is.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,110
Let's click generate.

24
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,560
We can move on to generating posts, navigate to figure press posts.

25
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,570
This page will allow us to generate posts.

26
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,070
We're going to set the quantity to 20 and 30.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Afterward, we'll set the date option to last 15 days.

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,180
Up next, the post type field should include posts and pages.

29
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,930
The author fields should be set to admin or whatever account is available on your WordPress demo site.

30
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,220
Scroll to the Taxonomy Field Rules section.

31
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,290
This section is where we can add categories and tags to a post under the rates field.

32
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,630
Let's update the rate to 100.

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,100
We're almost finished under the meta field section.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,730
We can configure the images generated for a post.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
The default settings are fine as is.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,320
There's only one option we'll modify change the weight field to 100.

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,670
The rest of the fields are finances.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,630
We're finished filling out the form.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,250
Let's click generate.

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,290
This process may take a while because WordPress is downloading images from the web.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,990
Hopefully you've received a success message.

42
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,110
If you're experiencing problems, you may need to reduce the number of posts generated.

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,800
We're finished with generating fake posts.

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,470
I recommend deactivating fake press.

45
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,980
We don't need it anymore.

46
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,770
I'm going to quickly deactivate this plugin.

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,230
Let's begin working on our theme in the following lecture.

48
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,410
We'll continue our journey with WordPress development.
