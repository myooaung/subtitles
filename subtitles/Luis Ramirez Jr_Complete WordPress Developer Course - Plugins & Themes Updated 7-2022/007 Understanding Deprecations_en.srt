00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,630
In this lecture, we are going to talk about deprivations.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:09,840
Throughout most of this course, we've developed dynamic blocks there, blocks that use server side

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,560
rendering.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,400
If a block was rendered on the client, it's considered static.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,950
Dynamic blocks are easier to work with.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,090
They do not require as much maintenance as static blocks.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,110
If we modify a block, this can cause our block to break in.

8
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,950
The Editor.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,070
This is especially true for static blocks.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,670
It's not something we encounter often but can happen.

11
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,580
Let's look at an example in your editor.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,370
Open the block JSON file.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,160
Inside the attributes.

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,230
Let's say the blocks content should be stored in a div tag.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,350
At the moment the content is stored with a paragraph tag.

16
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,030
For this example, change the selector from the P to div.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,320
It's not uncommon to change the template of a block.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,240
You may need to move, add or remove elements after updating the block file.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,880
Our functions should be updated to reflect this change.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,540
Open the edit js file.

21
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,270
Scroll to the rich text component in the function.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,460
Change the tag name properties value to div.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,170
Next, open the saved JS file.

24
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,450
Search for the rich text content component.

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,840
Set the tag name property to div.

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,440
Let's refresh the page in the browser.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,480
By making a single modification to the template.

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,870
Our block is completely broken before a block is rendered on the page.

29
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,380
WordPress Performance BLOCK Validation.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,990
WordPress will output a message on the block.

31
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,430
Validation Failure.

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,870
Looking closely, the error states the output of the block failed.

33
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:12,020
The content generated by the save function is different from the content saved in the database.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,020
Let's talk about the validation process.

35
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:23,340
After the content has been retrieved by the database, WordPress will begin processing each block.

36
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,780
First, it will extract the attribute values from the template saved in the database.

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,320
After every attributes value has been extracted, these values are passed onto the current save function

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,340
of the block.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,550
Lastly, the output of the save function is compared with the template from the database.

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,250
WordPress performs validation to guarantee that a block has been successfully saved.

41
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,370
If the outputs are different, WordPress may have made a mistake during the extraction process.

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:59,350
Validation is a great solution to help developers upgrade their blocks.

43
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:05,920
Blocks passing validation means that users can use the latest block version without the block completely

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,380
breaking for your convenience.

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,530
I formatted the templates produced by the error.

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,040
The first template was produced by the save function.

47
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
The second template was the template saved in the database.

48
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,560
Notice the difference between them.

49
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,410
The template created by the save function does not contain the content from the original template.

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,200
The div tag with the class alert box content does not contain content.

51
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,760
Without validation, the content would have disappeared completely.

52
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,120
Users would experience inconsistent results.

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,160
Whenever we update templates, we must provide a smooth upgrade path.

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,470
In the next lecture, let's begin working on upgrading the block to the latest version.
