00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,350
In this lecture.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:03,450
Let's talk about what's coming next.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,340
PHP is a language designed to render dynamic HTML pages.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,430
This section has covered the most common features you'll use in WordPress development.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,230
If you understood everything thus far, you're well on your way to becoming a professional WordPress

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,040
developer.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,250
Before moving forward, I want to set your expectations.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,290
It's entirely possible to create sites without WordPress.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,560
After all, WordPress is written with PHP.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,270
There's nothing stopping us from creating our own system for generating pages.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,700
However, WordPress is not just popular with users but with developers.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,960
WordPress introduces a complete suite of APIs for extending its behavior.

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,630
We can leverage WordPress system to create the additional features.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,370
Therefore, it's not necessary to learn every feature in PHP.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,080
WordPress Abstracts The Complicated Technical Details.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,120
As you'll soon discover, we can tailor WordPress behavior with a few lines of code.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,220
Is a complex language with hundreds of features, there's a lot to discover.

18
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,280
Despite that, we're going to jump into WordPress.

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,710
I don't want this course to get too dull.

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,460
Therefore I'll be introducing additional PHP features as we work on the master project for this course.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,620
If there's something you felt was missing, don't worry, we may cover it in a future lecture.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,410
Our PHP journey doesn't end here.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,920
I hope you're excited.

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,900
I know I am.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,840
When you're ready.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,020
I'll see you in the next section.
