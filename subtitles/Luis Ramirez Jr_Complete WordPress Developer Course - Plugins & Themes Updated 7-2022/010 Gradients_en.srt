00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,230
In this lecture we are going to add gradients to our theme.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,270
A gradient is very simple.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,890
It's an effect with two or more colors transitioning to one another.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,280
WordPress supports all CSS gradients.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,670
They can be applied to a wide variety of blocks.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,760
Interestingly, gradients are persistent.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,930
If a user has gradients and switches themes, the original gradients will survive from older themes.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,070
Overall, adding gradients to a theme is super simple.

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,230
Let's give it a shot, shall we?

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,400
In your editor, open the theme dot JSON file.

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,470
First things first, let's try hiding the default gradients from the user.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,340
Similar to colors, WordPress will provide the user with a preset of gradients.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,630
If you're developing a theme, you may want to recommend your own set of gradients.

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:04,160
For our purposes, let's disable the default set of gradients in the color object and a property called

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,460
default gradients with a value of false.

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,720
Next, let's begin adding a custom set of gradients.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,770
Gradients can be added on a global level and block level.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,920
For our purposes, let's add a global level gradients inside the color object.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,230
Add an array called gradients.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,320
In the array.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,210
We must add an object for each gradient.

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,820
The format for a gradient is the slug name and gradient.

23
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,920
Let's add our first gradient.

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,390
The slug for the gradient will be called you summer dog.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,930
The name for the gradient will be the following you to me some are dog.

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,350
Lastly, the gradient can be added through the gradient property.

27
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:06,680
WordPress accepts any valid CSS gradient value, we can add linear, radial conic or repeating gradients.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,190
For this example, let's keep it simple by adding a linear gradient, set the value to the following

29
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,570
linear gradient hash ay 8f78.

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,990
Hash seven 856.

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,730
Before testing our gradient, let's learn how to disable the gradient feature.

32
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,910
I think the site title block doesn't need to support gradients.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,710
Let's disable it completely for this block which has support for gradients.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,910
Scroll to the site title block settings inside the colour object.

35
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,500
Add the gradients array.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,370
By adding an empty array.

37
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,830
WordPress will not present the user with a set of gradients to select from.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,670
However, users will still be able to select custom colours for creating a gradient.

39
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:03,650
We can disable the custom colour picker by adding the custom gradient property with a value of false.

40
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,630
These settings should effectively disable the gradient options for the site title block.

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,900
Let's try testing our settings.

42
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,310
Refresh the editor in the browser.

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,220
Under the global style sidebar.

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,700
Let's try changing the background colour with a gradient.

45
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,700
The list of presets will present us with our custom gradients.

46
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,750
You can hover your mouse over the option for the name of the gradient.

47
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,580
Perfect.

48
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,420
Next, let's try editing the site title block.

49
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,850
Unlike the global style sidebar, adding a gradient to this block is not an option.

50
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,440
We've successfully disabled this option from the editor.

51
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:54,040
Once again, feel free to explore gradients with additional colors and settings.

52
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,730
We're almost finished with colors, I promise.

53
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:03,010
There are just a few more topics to discuss before jumping into other areas of the editor.

54
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,290
I'll see you in the next one.
