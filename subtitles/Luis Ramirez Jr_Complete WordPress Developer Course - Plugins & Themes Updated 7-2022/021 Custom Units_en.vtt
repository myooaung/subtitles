00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.740
In this lecture, we're going to modify the units for our theme for layouts.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.040
WordPress allows users to use different units of measurement for margin and padding.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.690
Let's look at an example in our editor.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.410
Let's view the padding settings for the site title block.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.760
Next to the input, we can select different units.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.660
By default.

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.090
WordPress will use pixels, but we can switch over to percentages.

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.100
Believe it or not, WordPress allows team developers to add or remove units from this dropdown.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.440
If you know me, I'm not a huge fan of M, I think R.M. is superior.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.840
You may feel differently for our theme.

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.630
We're going to disable M as an option.

12
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.720
Let's try changing the units in your text.

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.840
Editor Open the theme JSON file.

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.970
In the settings object, we're going to modify the spacing option.

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.760
Add a new property called units.

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.360
This property will be an array of units that our theme supports.

17
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.450
Let's add the following units.

18
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.350
P x.

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.650
R.

20
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.190
E m.

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.010
Percent vw v h.

22
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.500
We're excluding the M unit that should do it.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.650
Try testing our theme settings by refreshing the page in the browser.

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
After doing so, try modifying the site title blocks.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.250
Spacing Options.

26
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.550
The M unit has been completely removed.

27
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.510
In its place, WordPress will load our units.

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.940
Pretty simple, right?

29
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.830
We're almost finished exploring the spacing options.

30
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.890
There's just one more setting that we're going to explore.

31
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.350
Let's talk about it in the next lecture.
