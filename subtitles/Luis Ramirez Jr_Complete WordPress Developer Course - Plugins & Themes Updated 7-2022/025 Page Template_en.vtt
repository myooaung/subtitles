00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.180
In this lecture we are going to work on the page templates.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.990
Luckily, it won't take much to prepare this templates.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.720
In my browser, I have a copy of the static design.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.100
The page template is very similar to these single templates.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.350
Unlike posts, pages won't have the author's name post date comment, count tags or links to other posts.

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.970
Basically it'll be a stripped version of the single template.

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
Before creating this template, let's check out the documentation for the file name.

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.310
Pages can have a dedicated template.

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.090
Let's create a generic template for all pages.

10
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
The best option is a file called page HTML.

11
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.450
Let's head back to our editor to create this file in the templates directory.

12
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.570
As mentioned before, the page template is similar to the single templates.

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.730
Lets transfer the blocks from the single template to the page template.

14
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.550
Next, let's begin stripping the blocks from the template.

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.230
Switch over to the full site editor.

16
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.280
Select the page template from the list.

17
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.660
From the list view.

18
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.080
Let's delete the row blocks from the first column.

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.620
Lastly, remove the post tags block.

20
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.340
Our template is ready.

21
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.280
Let's copy all the blocks from the template.

22
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.340
Switch over to the page template to overwrite the existing blocks with the latest copy.

23
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.330
That's it.

24
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.710
We're finished with the page templates.

25
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.900
Let's give our template a test by viewing a page on the front end in your browser.

26
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.080
Try navigating to a page.

27
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.420
WordPress should have loaded the page templates.

28
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.360
Unlike posts, pages are going to have a simpler design.

29
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.530
At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide what should be included on a page.

30
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.210
In addition, users have the power to modify the base template to suit their needs.

31
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.790
Let's cover one more template before moving on to block development.
