00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.230
In this lecture, we are going to quickly add a navigation menu to the top bar section of the header.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.620
It's going to be easy.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.470
Recently WordPress introduced a blog for adding menus.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.610
WordPress menu system is very opinionated.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.980
We're going to find out why in a moment.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
First, let's look at the original code for the menu.

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.110
In our static templates.

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.600
The static menu is simplistic.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.340
We have an unordered list element with a class called Secondary Menu.

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.280
As long as we can apply this class to the surrounding element, we can consider the transformation a

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.120
success.

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.590
Let's give it a try.

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.920
In the block.

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.210
Editor We are going to insert a new block called Navigation.

15
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.980
This block should be inserted into the group block of the first row.

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.370
It'll be the first block in the group.

17
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.130
Therefore, position it before the paragraph block.

18
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.170
The template is going to temporarily break.

19
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.660
That's to be expected.

20
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.060
We haven't applied our styles or classes to the menu before applying these styles.

21
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.360
Let's add some links.

22
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.420
Generally, WordPress will offer to start with a fresh menu.

23
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.970
If you're working on an existing site, you can select a previously made menu for our case.

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.800
We're going to start fresh.

25
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.870
I'm going to add three links.

26
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.170
You have the option of adding a custom link or a link to an existing page to keep it simple.

27
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.590
I'm going to add three links to existing pages.

28
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.610
Feel free to add whatever links you like during this process.

29
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.280
WordPress may accidentally format your text into multiple lines for our theme.

30
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.520
Try to adjust the text into a single line.

31
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.650
This is not a CSS issue.

32
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.170
It's a simple text formatting issue.

33
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.860
After inserting your links, let's begin formatting them.

34
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.070
Make sure you're focusing on the navigation block.

35
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.289
Otherwise, you may be styling the wrong block on the sidebar.

36
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.130
We're going to run through the list of options.

37
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.540
Firstly, the mobile option should be turned on.

38
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
WordPress implements an overlay for viewing a navigation menu.

39
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.560
You may not like this behavior.

40
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.790
In that case, you will need to create your own mobile menu.

41
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.600
However, for our theme, this solution works great.

42
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.430
We will leave it enabled.

43
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.450
Next, we're going to change the text color.

44
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.870
There are options to change the background and sub menu colors.

45
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.760
Our menu is straightforward.

46
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.740
It does not have submenus.

47
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.690
Let's set the color you to me.

48
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.010
Gray 200.

49
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.210
This is the same colour as the paragraph block.

50
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.800
For consistency, we should use the same colors.

51
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.390
Up next, let's modify the block spacing settings.

52
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.870
The block spacing option will modify the space between each link.

53
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.620
The static template uses one ream for spacing.

54
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.440
Let's set the spacing to this value.

55
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.000
Lastly, we're going to add the secondary menu class for applying properties that can't be modified

56
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.350
through the block editor.

57
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.970
If you're curious about what properties get added, you can check out the index CSS file.

58
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.100
We're finished with modifying the menu.

59
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.250
Despite these changes, there's still one issue.

60
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.460
The paragraph and navigation are not aligned to understand why.

61
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.130
Let's save our templates.

62
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.220
Next, open the home page on the front end.

63
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.920
You may be wondering why we are viewing the front end as opposed to the editor.

64
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.460
In my opinion, it can be easier to debug templates on the front end.

65
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.580
The markup and styles are cleaner on the front than on the editor.

66
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.980
For this reason, you may want to have a tab open for the front end, believe it or not.

67
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.640
The problem is with the paragraph, not the navigation menu.

68
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.270
Let's inspect the CSS for the paragraph elements.

69
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.079
The paragraph element has margins.

70
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.870
We found our culprits.

71
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.790
The solution becomes simple.

72
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.480
We need to remove these margins to have better alignment.

73
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.360
Unfortunately, the paragraph block does not allow users to modify the margin and padding.

74
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.290
Luckily, I have a CSS class for modifying the margin.

75
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.460
Back in the editor.

76
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.770
Select the paragraph block from the list view afterward open the Advanced Panel to change the class.

77
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.450
We're going to apply the following class.

78
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.240
Exclamation point t zero.

79
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.130
Once again, this is a class from our themes CSIS.

80
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.280
It'll set the margin top property to zero.

81
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.960
After applying this class, the awkward alignment issue should disappear.

82
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.180
The menu and paragraph are perfectly aligned.

83
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.910
Let's save our templates.

84
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.480
Lastly, refresh the front end.

85
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.430
The top bar is complete.

86
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.840
We were able to recreate the same UI without resorting to the HTML block by taking the time to convert

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.920
our static template to blocks.

88
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.520
Clients will be able to modify the UI more easily.

89
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.010
There's one last thing worth mentioning before moving on.

90
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.170
Let's inspect the markup for the navigation menu.

91
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.950
Almost immediately you're going to notice something different.

92
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.020
The HTML is completely different from our static template.

93
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.310
As a reminder, here's the original HTML for the menu.

94
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.430
WordPress has added dozens of elements and classes to the menu during development.

95
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.490
You need to ask yourself if it's worth letting WordPress take the wheel.

96
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.560
In my opinion, it's worth it as long as the results come out the same.

97
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.800
In future lectures, we're not going to be able to recreate the same UI with WordPress for now.

98
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.670
WordPress does an excellent job of creating the same menu.

99
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.310
Therefore, we'll let it handle the menu.

100
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.650
Let's continue in the next lecture.
