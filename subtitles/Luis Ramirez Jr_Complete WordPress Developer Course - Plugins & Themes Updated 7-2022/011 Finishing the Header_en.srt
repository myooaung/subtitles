00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,180
In this lecture, we are going to finalize the header.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,310
So far we've completed two out of the three sections.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,470
The final section is another navigation menu.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,180
There's not much else to it.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,840
This menu will act as the primary navigation menu.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,450
Creating this section should be easy.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,610
It's nothing we haven't done before.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,650
Inside the header html file, you can search for a comment that says primary navigation for your convenience.

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,170
I'm presenting a simplified version of this section.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,140
We have a div tag with various classes.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,140
Most of these classes can be removed.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,660
The row block will be able to affect the same properties as these classes.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,790
The job of these classes is to center the inner blocks inside our row.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,020
We're going to insert a navigation block as an exercise.

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,690
Try tackling this section on your own.

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,090
Pause the video and give it a try.

17
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,380
Welcome back.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,690
If you are able to add the final section, that's great.

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,750
If not, that's fine as well.

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,510
Let's run through the solution together.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,200
The first step is to add a row block to the header template and the editor add this block to the bottom.

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,640
It should sit at the root level of the template.

23
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,340
Next we're going to modify the block settings.

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,830
Firstly, the wrap option should be disabled.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,900
Afterward.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,070
Scroll to the dimensions panel.

27
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,310
The padding will need to be updated.

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,220
Set the bottom padding to one room.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,520
The other padding settings can be set to zero.

30
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,560
Lastly, we're going to apply the following classes to the row block, container, exclamation point

31
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,940
and auto.

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,790
These classes should censor the element on the page.

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,210
As for the rest of the classes, they can be avoided.

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,400
WordPress can handle the rest.

35
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,550
Time to add the navigation menu inside the roadblock.

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,880
Insert the navigation block.

37
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,400
The links for the lock won't matter.

38
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,150
Feel free to add links to random posts, pages or URLs.

39
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,810
I'm going to add five URLs.

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,160
Next, we're going to modify the navigation block settings.

41
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,390
There's not much that needs to change.

42
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,790
If you scroll to the bottom of the options, you should find the block spacing option.

43
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,540
Let's set the spacing to 2.5 REM.

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,500
After making those changes where finished the header is 99% complete.

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,760
Let's save the template and view the finished product on the front end.

46
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,040
As you can see, we have a near identical header to the static version.

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,350
All that remains are two things.

48
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,780
Firstly, the block based header does not have a border below the last row.

49
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,180
Lastly, the changes are saved in the database.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,740
We should update the header html to contain these blocks.

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,720
Let's head back to the Gutenberg editor from the list view.

52
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,910
Copy the first row block.

53
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,620
Next, open the header html file.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,460
Replace the current contents of the file with the block.

55
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,020
Lastly, we are going to add the other two blocks.

56
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,160
They should be added in the same order as they appear in the list.

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,400
In total, you're going to have three blocks at the root level.

58
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,790
If we did everything right, we should be able to reset the templates in the editor without experiencing

59
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,150
a completely different template in the browser.

60
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,030
Refresh the full site editor page.

61
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,839
Next, we are going to reset the customizations.

62
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,440
This process may take a while since WordPress needs to grab the HTML templates.

63
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,490
After the template has been loaded, nothing should look off.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,390
Here's the moment of truth.

65
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,800
Save the templates.

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,890
Once you save the templates, there's no going back.

67
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,470
After the template has been saved, we are going to refresh the editor and front end.

68
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,860
Hopefully nothing has broken.

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,670
If we were to switch back and forth between tabs, the header template would be fully functional.

70
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,890
These settings we've spent the last hour working on have been applied to our theme.

71
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,970
Anyone who installs our theme will have the same design.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,940
The border issue has been fixed too.

73
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,790
At this point, you should have a good idea of what theme development looks like with the full site

74
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,520
editor.

75
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,780
In earlier versions of WordPress, theme development was geared towards PHP developers.

76
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,150
Up until now, we've written less than two dozen lines of actual PHP code.

77
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,530
Full site development allows us to create a theme with a few core blocks.

78
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,910
Once you're ready, let's finish the rest of the templates.

79
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,070
I'll see you in the next lecture.
