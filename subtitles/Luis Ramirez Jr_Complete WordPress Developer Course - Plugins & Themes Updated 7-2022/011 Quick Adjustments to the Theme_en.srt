1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,900
In this lecture, we are going to make a quick adjustment to our theme templates.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,380
Currently, I'm viewing the home page.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,720
The log and link in the header is completely static.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,460
The same goes for the highly rated posts on the sidebar.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,200
In previous sections, we've taken the time to develop custom blocks for these areas.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,070
I think it would make sense to update our template by replacing the static template with the completed

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,560
blocks in the resource section of this lecture.

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,590
I provide a link to the updated files for these template parts.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,990
The header html and sidebar html files should be updated with the code from this page.

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,130
The updates I performed on the template will replace the static version with their respective block.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,270
Let's quickly update our theme first.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,790
Copy the code for the header html file.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,710
Mixed.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,700
Open the header.

15
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,890
HTML template part.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,960
Replace the contents of the file with the new set of blocks.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,570
Head back to the browser.

18
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,730
Copy the second code snippet.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,820
Open the sign.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,430
HTML template part.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,990
Once again, her place de file's contents with a new set of locks.

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,760
After making those changes, we can move on to the next lecture.

23
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,890
I'll see you there.
