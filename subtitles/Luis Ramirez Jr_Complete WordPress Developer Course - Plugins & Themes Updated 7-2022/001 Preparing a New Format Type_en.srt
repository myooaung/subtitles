1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,680
In this section, we are going to explore a variety of topics.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,189
These topics do not need a section dedicated to them.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,830
However they are important to cover.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,830
This section will be all over the place, regardless our theme and plug in and we'll need some finishing

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,640
touches.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,900
The first set of topics will explore our format types.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,960
A format type gives users the power to modify portions of text with different formatting.

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,860
For example, if we were to type inside a paragraph block, we have various formatting options available

9
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,960
in the toolbar we can bold in italicize or highlight the text.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,870
These options are known as format types.

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,780
WordPress gives us the option of adding new format types for this demonstration.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,600
Let's add a new format type.

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,370
We're adding a neon effect to the text.

14
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,130
Switch over to the editor inside the source slash block editor directory.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,270
Create a new file called Neon Format JS.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,940
Next, let's add the success for achieving a neon effect.

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,010
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the CCIS.

18
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,880
Copy the CSS to your clipboard.

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,240
Head back to the ED in the source slash block editor directory.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,690
Create a file called Neon CSIS.

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,670
Pace the CSIS into this file.

22
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,440
Lastly, back in the neon format js file import the neon CSS file.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,570
After preparing the files.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,320
Let's import the JS file into the index file.

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,360
Open this file in your editor.

26
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,880
Import the neon format JS file.

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,330
This import statement will cause a new CSS file to be generated with our bundle.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,840
If the file does not appear, you may need to restart the command line.

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,680
Otherwise we can begin and queueing the csv file.

30
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,610
Open the register assets dot php file.

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,650
At the bottom of the function.

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,100
Run the WP Register style function.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,930
The name of our asset will be called up.

34
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,650
Ed.

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,660
Next, the URL will be the plugins URL function with the following value slash build slash block editor

36
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,800
slash index CSIS up plug in file.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,590
Lastly, open the editor assets stock php file.

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,410
Inside this file called the WP NQ Style Function.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,450
The name of our file was called Up Editor.

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,110
Our script is ready.

41
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,520
In the next lecture, we will begin registering a new format type.
