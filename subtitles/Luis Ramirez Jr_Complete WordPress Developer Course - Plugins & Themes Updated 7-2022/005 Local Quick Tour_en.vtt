00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.450
In this lecture, we will take a quick tour of local.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.200
We left off with creating a WordPress site after creating a new site.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.420
We are provided a dashboard of options for our environments.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.290
I want to quickly review these options before moving further.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.110
The first step is to select our site.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.000
On the left side of the tool, there is a list of science registered on our machine.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.660
Be sure to select the site we recently generated.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.500
On the right side will be presented with various options.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.370
Initially, we are given an overview of our site.

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.980
Firstly, we are given the domain.

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.800
This domain is not officially registered.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.830
We can't provide this domain to other users.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.260
They won't be able to visit our site.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.840
Local has modified our machine settings to intercept requests to this domain.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.540
If we send a request to this domain, it's going to deliver a file from our WordPress site.

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.080
In some cases, you may want to change the domain.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.280
That's possible by clicking on the change button for this course.

18
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.710
I think the default domain works fine.

19
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.720
Moving along and SSL certificate has been generated for our site.

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
Nowadays, Google will penalize sites that don't have a certificate.

21
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.990
We want our development environments to reflect our production environments.

22
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.680
It's handy to have a certificate installed for security certificates, enable encryption for data sent

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.720
between the server and browser.

24
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840
It keeps our users safe from hackers.

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.140
In some cases, your browser may not allow you to visit your development environments.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.480
You may need to give extra permission by clicking on the trusted button to force the browser to allow

27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.040
you to visit your site.

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.480
If you are able to view your site, you do not need to perform this step.

29
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.140
Next, we have the option of changing the web server.

30
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.260
This is one of the most helpful features of local.

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.940
You may not like Jinks.

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.710
If that's the case, you can switch to Apache without creating a new server.

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.330
On the other hand, you may be developing a commercial theme and plug in.

34
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.490
Verifying your work on different web servers can be incredibly beneficial.

35
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.280
The same goes for the PHP version.

36
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.120
If you want compatibility with older versions of PHP, you can switch to an older version on the fly.

37
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.730
Once again, it's unnecessary to create different environments for the same site.

38
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.090
You can continue working with the same code base.

39
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.110
Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the database.

40
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.340
Databases are more sensitive than the other two programs.

41
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.940
We don't have the option of switching to another database.

42
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.090
Luckily, it's not going to impact our code.

43
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.790
Our code will be 100% compatible with my SQL and Maria DB.

44
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.020
Afterward, we have the option of logging in as an admin.

45
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.470
It can be annoying to constantly log into our site.

46
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.220
If you want to skip this process, you can force your way in.

47
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.610
This option may be disabled if your site is not running.

48
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.450
Lastly, we are presented with the WordPress version and if multi site is enabled for this course,

49
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.940
we're not going to learn about multi site.

50
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.190
That wraps up the overview tab.

51
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.120
There are two more tabs called database and tools.

52
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.270
Let's shift our focus to the database tab.

53
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.050
This tab will present the credentials for your database.

54
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.370
If you're not familiar with database connectivity, that's perfectly fine.

55
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.020
Database management is a topic we'll cover in a future section.

56
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.560
The besides installing programs for running WordPress Local will install additional tools for debugging

57
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.850
a WordPress site.

58
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.370
One of the tools is called Admin Error.

59
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.520
You can click the open link to view this tool.

60
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.370
After doing so, a new town will be opened in your browser.

61
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.300
We can interact with the database through this tool.

62
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.940
Let's go back to local.

63
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.880
There's another tab called Tools.

64
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.060
This tab contains a list of additional tools.

65
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.579
We have the option of adding more tools with extensions by default.

66
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.890
Local will provide you with two additional tools.

67
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.590
The first tool is called Mail Hog.

68
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.070
Mail Hog is a program for creating an email server.

69
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.620
Let's say you're creating a newsletter plug in.

70
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.270
You may want to send emails from your development environment for testing purposes.

71
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.470
Mail Hog will provide you with a fake email for receiving emails.

72
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.090
This way you don't need to pay for a third party service for testing emails.

73
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.740
It's a quick and easy way to test the email capabilities of your plugin.

74
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.730
Lastly, we have a tool called Live Local is capable of exposing your site to the public.

75
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.390
This tool should be used cautiously by going live.

76
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.370
Anyone in the world has access to your site, which is hosted on your personal machine.

77
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.910
Therefore they have direct access to your machine.

78
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.180
The purpose of this feature is to allow your clients to preview your site without uploading it to a

79
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.590
production environment.

80
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.530
It's a powerful tool, but you should only provide links to people you trust for this course.

81
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.780
We aren't going to need this tool.

82
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.020
There's one last feature to be aware of under the name, we'll be given the path to our project.

83
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.740
If we click on this path, the file Explorer will open.

84
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.710
This is probably the most crucial feature.

85
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.350
We need to know where to find our files.

86
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.020
There are a total of three folders.

87
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.870
The first folder is called configuration.

88
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.660
As we discussed before local handles configuring the programs for running WordPress.

89
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.270
You may not like the default configuration.

90
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.480
If that's the case, you can find the configuration files for each program in this directory.

91
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.530
For our project, the default configuration works fine.

92
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.650
The second folder is called logs.

93
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.380
During the development lifecycle of a theme or plugin, you're likely to run into errors.

94
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.290
Local will store a copy of errors produced by our site inside this directory.

95
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.930
It's beneficial for debugging your site.

96
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.510
The last directory is called APP.

97
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.680
If we peek inside this folder, we'll come across a public directory.

98
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.100
This folder will contain the official files for WordPress.

99
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.100
We're going to be working inside this directory.

100
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.940
For the majority of this course, there are hundreds of files, but soon enough you'll become comfortable

101
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.350
working with WordPress.

102
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.680
Let's continue our discussion in the next lecture.
