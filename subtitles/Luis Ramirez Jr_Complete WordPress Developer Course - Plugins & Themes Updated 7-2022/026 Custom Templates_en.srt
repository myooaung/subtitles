1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,800
In this lecture, we are going to cover one last templates.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,130
So far we've been working with WordPress template hierarchy.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,800
However, we may want to offer additional options that aren't covered by the hierarchy.

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,030
For example, what if we had a template for a full width page?

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,600
It's possible to offer custom templates for our theme.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,270
Currently I'm viewing the documentation for the page templates.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,770
We overlooked the first template during our discussion.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,450
Let's take a closer look at what it says.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,260
WordPress allows users to select a custom template for pages.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,280
If a custom template is specified, WordPress will load the template over the other templates.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,020
It has the highest priority before creating a custom templates.

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,850
We must register it's custom template.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,250
Registration can be done through the theme JSON file in your code editor.

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,710
Open the theme JSON file.

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,580
It's been a while since we've looked at this file.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,680
The themed JSON file can be helpful for registering custom templates at the bottom of the object at

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,200
an array called custom templates.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,700
This array accepts objects where each object represents a single template.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,970
Let's register our first templates inside this object at a property called name.

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,340
The name property must be set to the file name of the custom template without the extension.

21
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:43,050
For example, if we had a custom template with the file name breadcrumb HTML, the name property should

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,460
be set to bread.

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,690
For our template, we're going to call it full width page.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,760
The file name should be short and concise.

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,320
The next property is called title.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,290
The value for this property should be a human readable name.

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,350
It will be presented to the user on the front end.

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,310
Let's set the title property to full width page.

29
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,670
The last property is called post types.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,830
The Post types property is an array of post types that the template can be applied to.

31
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,870
We have the option of restricting the template to specific post types.

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,430
This includes custom post types.

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,480
Let's pass in the page post type.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,520
Our template has been registered, we can start creating it inside the templates folder.

35
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,650
Create a file called full width page.

36
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,130
The name of the file must match the value of the name property.

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,010
Next, let's transfer the blocks from the page template to the full width page.

38
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,180
The full width page template will be similar to the page template but without the sidebar.

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:12,010
As you can imagine, our next step is to remove the sidebar with the full site editor in your browser.

40
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,360
Refresh the list of templates.

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,520
On the list.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,240
The full width page template should appear as an option.

43
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,190
Unlike the other templates, our custom templates will be void of a description.

44
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,510
Let's click on it.

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,080
Converting the template to full width is easier than you can imagine.

46
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,950
Click on the columns block.

47
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,440
The number of columns can be configured.

48
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,070
Be careful when modifying this setting.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,980
If you lower the number of columns, you will lose the blocks from within a column.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,700
Let's set the number of columns to one.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
Conveniently.

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,340
This one.

53
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,810
Remove the sidebar.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,750
Grab a copy of all the blocks in this template.

55
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,490
Next, go back to the full width page HTML file.

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,010
Overwrite the current blocks with the latest copies.

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,370
After making those changes, our template is ready.

58
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,540
We won't be able to test our work until we've modified a page to use our custom templates.

59
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,760
Custom templates don't get applied unless they're specifically applied by the user.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,090
Head on over to the WordPress Admin dashboard.

61
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,690
Let's modify one of the pages.

62
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,870
On the sidebar, there's a panel called templates.

63
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,070
WordPress will present us with the option of changing the template to a different template.

64
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,930
Let's select our template from the list and save the page.

65
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,070
Next, let's view the page on the front end.

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,310
Perfect.

67
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,900
Our custom template has been created with that final template created.

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,430
We're finished with developing our theme.

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,530
There are additional topics that we can explore, but let's move on to block development.

70
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,410
Our theme will be revisited after creating a few blocks.

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,630
I know you're excited to get started.

72
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,870
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next section.
