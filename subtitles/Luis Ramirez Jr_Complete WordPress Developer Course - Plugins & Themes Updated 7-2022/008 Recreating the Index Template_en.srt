00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,190
In this lecture, we are going to replicate the HTML file with PHP.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:10,890
It's not required, but it's a great opportunity to learn what's happening behind the scenes.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,610
Let me show you what I mean.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,379
On the home page, I'm going to view the pages source.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,650
Do you remember the last time we viewed this page?

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,410
The contents of the indexed PHP file was returned by WordPress.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,440
This time WordPress has returned dozens of tags and classes by using full site editing.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,950
WordPress will help us with some basic starter content that is required for a fully functioning theme.

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,520
Prior to full site editing, we could be writing every single line of code to produce this templates

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,080
rather than waste time.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,830
This process has been expedited for us, which is great.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,420
But what's happening behind the scenes?

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,400
How is WordPress generating those extra HTML tags?

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,480
Why is it generating additional content?

15
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,069
It's not bloated code.

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,870
I promise the content produced by WordPress is very important.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,600
To give you a better idea, this is the code WordPress uses to generate our page.

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,860
Initially it may seem intimidating, but I promise it's not.

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,570
We have two options at our disposal.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,650
We can proceed to work on our theme or we can study the template produced by WordPress.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,670
In my opinion, studying the template is the best option for two reasons.

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,840
Firstly, it allows us to practice PHP.

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,910
Secondly, it gives us insight into how WordPress builds pages.

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,200
This information might come in handy for extending the base templates.

25
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,680
It will make more sense as you progress through the course.

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,520
For those reasons, we will recreate the base template that surrounds the indexed HTML file.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,540
The code is going to look exactly the same as this image.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,870
To get started, we'll need to switch back to classic site editing in the templates directory.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,350
Let's rename the indexed HTML file to something random.

30
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,680
The file name doesn't matter as long as it's not called indexed HTML.

31
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,820
We're good to go.

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:30,100
If WordPress can't find an indexed HTML file, it'll fall back to the indexed PHP file.

33
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,750
We're going back to classic site editing so that we can start from scratch.

34
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,410
Once we have got a good grip on the technical details, we'll switch back to full site editing in the

35
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,540
following lecture.

36
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,420
Let's get started with recreating the indexed template.
