00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,290
In this lecture, we are going to handle the response to our End Point.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:12,450
First, we must define the function for handling the response from the init php file we call the function

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,430
up rest API sign up handler.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,800
Let's define this function in a separate file inside the rest API folder.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,910
Create a folder called sign up php.

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,290
Next define this function.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,090
A rest API endpoint should always return a JSON object.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,370
It doesn't matter if the request was a success or not.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,500
WordPress will help us with generating a JSON object from this function.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,120
We can return an array.

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,740
This array will be converted into a JSON object by WordPress.

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,670
From my experience, I like to create a variable for storing the response.

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,870
The name of the variable will be called response.

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,890
The value for this variable will be in array with a key called status.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,450
The value for this key will be one.

16
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,150
The response variable will indicate the success of a request by storing the status of the response.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,490
If the response is one, the request has failed.

18
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,780
If the status is set to two, the request has succeeded.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,620
By default, we're going to set the initial value to one.

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,980
The status should be updated at the end of the function.

21
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,980
Let's update the status key to to.

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,480
Lastly, let's return the response variable.

23
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,350
This might feel redundant.

24
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:49,710
In the next set of lectures, we are going to add additional code between the return statement and response

25
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,320
variable declaration.

26
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,490
For now, let's leave it at this.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,250
We can test our endpoint by using Postman Switch over to the Postman application.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,670
It shouldn't be necessary to adjust the request.

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,570
Postman should remember the details from previous attempts.

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,940
Let's try submitting the request.

31
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,200
After a few moments, the response from our End Point will appear at the bottom.

32
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,720
Our array was converted into a JSON object.

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,280
As you can see, the status key has been transformed into a property.

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,030
This property has a value of two, which indicates the request was a success.

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,720
Great.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,460
We've successfully handled the response in the next set of lectures.

37
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,870
We are going to flesh out the rest of the function by registering the user.
