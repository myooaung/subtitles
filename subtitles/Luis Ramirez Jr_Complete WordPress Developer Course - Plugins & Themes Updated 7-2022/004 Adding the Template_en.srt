00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,790
In this lecture, we are going to add the template for the search form block.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,680
As a reminder, we stored the template in a block for the search templates in the full sign.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,500
Editor Navigate to the search template.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,430
After you've navigated to this page search for the HTML block that contains the search form, you should

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,620
be able to find it above the list of posts after you have found the block.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,320
Let's copy the HTML from the block.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,230
We're not going to need the HTML comment.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,470
Next open the index js file for the search form block.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,910
Replace the return value with the HTML copied from the block.

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,170
The next step is to load the CSS for this block.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,460
Without the styles, the block's appearance may not come out correctly.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,700
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the CSS code for our block.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,410
Copy the CCed or clipboard.

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,820
Next switch back to the editor.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,450
We are going to paste this CCIS into the main CCIS file for the search form block.

16
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:27,390
After pacing in the seats, we can import this file from the index JS file back in the index file.

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,270
Add the import statement for the main CSS file.

18
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,930
The last step is to apply the class to the root element in our gsx.

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,130
We are adding a class called WP BLOCK Unity plus search form.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,190
This class will be available via block props hard coding.

21
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,550
The class is valid, however, I think it would be a good idea for WordPress to add it for us with block

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,890
props at the top of the file.

23
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,520
Import the use block props function from the WordPress slash block editor package.

24
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,030
Next create a variable inside the edit function called block.

25
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,840
Props.

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,200
The value for this prop will be the use block.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Props function.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,020
Lastly, we can replace the class attribute with block props.

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,670
Since we're working with an object, this object should have the spread operator.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,780
Spreading the block props object is the equivalent of adding the class attribute to the element.

31
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,710
However, additional properties and attributes will be added for compatibility with the Gutenberg Editor.

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,620
There's one more modification that I'd like to make.

33
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,480
Inside our HTML, there's a div tag surrounding the button element.

34
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,720
On this element, we are adding a class with the class attribute.

35
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:58,060
As we've learned, James X does not like the class attribute.

36
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,090
We should replace this attribute with the class name attribute for adding a class to an element.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,260
That should do it.

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,910
Switch over to the browser.

39
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,050
I want you to navigate to the experiments page from the dashboard.

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,360
Once again, we are using this page to experiment with blocks.

41
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,330
This should prevent disruption to other pages or templates.

42
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,710
On this page, let's amp the search form block.

43
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,630
The search form block is almost perfect.

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,750
Our block looks closer to the original template.

45
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,230
We can proceed to add modifications to the block.

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,800
Let's try adding attributes in the following lecture.
