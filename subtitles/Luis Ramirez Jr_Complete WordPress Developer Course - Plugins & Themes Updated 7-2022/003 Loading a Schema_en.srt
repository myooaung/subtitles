00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,960
In this lecture we are going to load a schema for our JSON file.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,510
Schemas are optional, but they're incredibly helpful for avoiding spelling errors and debugging.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,650
So you find out why.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,160
Let's open the theme JSON file in our editor's.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:20,020
Next, let's add an object with a property called version.

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,760
The first property in your themed JSON file should always be version.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:32,479
WordPress is constantly evolving, however it tries its best to be backward compatible.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,510
The settings of the theme JSON file have changed over time.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,820
The early adopters may still be using an older version of the theme JSON file.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,720
Therefore we need to tell WordPress what version will be using.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,610
The latest version is to the value for this property should be a number.

12
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,070
So far, so good.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,020
However, it's possible we may have made a mistake.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,360
For example, what if we capitalize the V in the property name?

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,810
Property names are case sensitive.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,670
WordPress will not be able to detect the version of our property.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,020
Let's try creating another problem instead of a number.

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,480
Let's wrap our value in quotes.

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,020
Our JSON file has two errors.

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,750
Unfortunately, they will go unnoticed.

21
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,040
Neither WordPress nor our editor will inform us of our mistakes.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,430
For these reasons, we should use a schema in the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,950
to the documentation page for the schema.

24
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,540
According to the documentation, a schema is available to help us address these issues.

25
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,590
Schemas are not specific to WordPress, they apply to all JSON files.

26
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,870
The purpose of a schema is to double check your properties and values.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,450
A schema can help the editor understand the structure of a JSON file.

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,700
They can validate a JSON file.

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,850
If you make a mistake, an error will notify you of your mistake.

30
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,670
A schema can be applied to a JSON file by adding the dollar sign schema property.

31
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,940
The documentation provides an example that we can copy.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,050
Let's grab it.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,880
Next.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,650
Let's paste it at the top of our object in the theme JSON file.

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,940
Be sure to add a comma after adding this property, Visual Studio code should begin validating your

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,540
file.

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,300
For some of you, this may work immediately.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,670
For others, you may receive an error.

39
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,170
This error will appear if the editor is unable to download the schema.

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,260
There are two solutions for fixing this issue.

41
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,440
The first solution is to convert the URL from the HTTPS to HTTP.

42
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,870
However, you may not be comfortable with the idea of using an unsecured connection.

43
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,800
An alternative solution is to grab the full URL.

44
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,750
The URL provided by the WordPress documentation is a proxy URL.

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,600
To better understand, let's click on the link.

46
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,160
In our browser, the URL will redirect us to a GitHub page.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,670
The URL in the address bar is completely different from the URL provided by the documentation.

48
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,360
This URL is the true location for the schema.

49
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,420
Rather than using the documentations URL, we can switch over to the true URL.

50
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,560
Our editor will be able to grab the schema by doing so.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,560
It'll be able to validate our JSON file.

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,250
There are two new errors that haven't been there before.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,880
If we hover our mouse over the opening curly brackets, the error will state our file is missing the

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,140
version property.

55
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,030
Sounds strange, right?

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,800
The aversion property exists in our file.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,700
However, look closely at the casing.

58
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,330
The original name has all lowercase letters, whereas our property has a capitalized V.

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,750
It becomes clear as to what's wrong.

60
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,180
The names don't match.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,300
Let's quickly fix the casing.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,120
After making those adjustments, the errors have gone away.

63
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,890
Perfect.

64
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,060
Well, almost another error has appeared.

65
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,430
This time, the error is related to the value.

66
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,329
According to the error, the type is incorrect.

67
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,240
The data type for the version property should be an integer.

68
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,580
Let's remove the quotes from the number.

69
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,570
Voila.

70
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,370
Our file is error free.

71
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,480
Prior to adding the schema, these errors remained undetected.

72
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,750
While optional schemas are incredibly valuable for developers.

73
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,230
They allow us to quickly debug our JSON files.

74
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,930
This reduces the likelihood of WordPress not understanding our settings.

75
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,050
I highly recommend keeping the schema option in your file in the next lecture.

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,990
Let's continue with extending the global styles for our theme.
