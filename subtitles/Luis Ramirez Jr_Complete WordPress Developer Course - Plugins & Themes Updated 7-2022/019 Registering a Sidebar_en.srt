00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,600
In this lecture, we are going to register a sidebar.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,980
At the moment I'm viewing a random post with the Gutenberg editor.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,910
At the top right corner, there's a button for toggling the sidebar.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,570
This sidebar contains the settings for the page or block.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,690
The sidebar can be toggled by clicking on this button.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,800
WordPress offers us the option to add a custom sidebar.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,320
Within this sidebar, we can render custom field for modifying a post metadata.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,530
Let's try rendering a sidebar in your editor.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,230
Open the sidebar JS file.

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:43,580
At the top of the file import a function called registered plugin from the WordPress slash plugins package.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,860
WordPress provides this function for registering plugins with the Gutenberg editor.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,390
It'll allow us to render a React component from within the application.

13
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,100
Our goal is to create a signed bar below this import statement.

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,640
Import a component called plug and sidebar from the WordPress slash edit post package.

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,870
The plugin sidebar component will create the interface for rendering a sidebar.

16
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,940
WordPress will handle positioning and toggling the appearance of the sidebar.

17
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,440
It's an incredibly helpful component.

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,490
There's one less thing we'll need.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,310
Let's import the double underscore function from the WordPress slash IE 18 and package.

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,420
We can begin rendering the sidebar below the import statement.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,780
Run the register plug function.

22
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,860
Registering the plugin is the first step.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,750
We don't want to render the component immediately.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,800
It should render after the editor has been loaded.

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,230
The registered plug and function will make sure our component gets rendered at the right time.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,920
There are two arguments.

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,570
The first argument is the name of our plugin.

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,820
Let's call it up sidebar.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,009
The second argument is an object of configuration settings.

30
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,210
In this object.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,400
Define a function called render.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,690
The render function is responsible for rendering a component within this function.

33
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,110
Let's return the plugin sidebar components.

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,800
This component has three properties.

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,250
The first property is called name.

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,460
Multiple sidebars can be added to the editor.

37
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,910
The name of our sidebar should contain a unique name.

38
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,590
Otherwise WordPress may be confused as to what sidebar to open.

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,530
Let's set the name to up sidebar.

40
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,700
Next at a property called Icon.

41
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,520
The value for this icon can be a valid icon.

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,730
Let's use the share icon.

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,130
I think this icon is appropriate for our sidebar.

44
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,520
The open graph protocol was introduced for displaying previews of a site on social media platforms.

45
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,730
Lastly, let's add a property called Title.

46
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,540
This property will display text at the top of the sidebar.

47
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:19,600
Our title will contain the following translatable text Udemy plus sidebar.

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,110
Lastly inside the component, lets add random text.

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,950
Before proceeding further.

50
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,640
Let's test our sidebar in the browser.

51
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,180
Refresh the page.

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,930
At the top right corner of the page, a button with the social icon has appeared.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,930
We can click on this button to open our sidebar.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,280
As you can see, WordPress has successfully rendered our sidebar.

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,380
The next step becomes obvious.

56
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,700
We can start rendering a set of fields for manipulating the metadata.

57
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,240
In the next lecture, let's begin rendering fields.
