00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.719
In this lecture, we are going to add a section to our form.

2
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.610
Adding dozens of input fields on a page can feel overwhelming to a user.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.240
We can group inputs into sections for readability.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.370
For example, I am viewing the permalink page in the admin dashboard.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.500
This page has two sections.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
They're called Common Settings and Optional.

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.830
Each section has a different set of inputs.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.880
The purpose of a section is to organize fields into groups.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.580
All fields must belong to a section.

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.040
At the moment we have a single option.

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.310
Therefore we are going to have a single field.

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.530
Regardless, this field must belong to a section before creating the field.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.520
A section must be created for containing the options field.

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.530
Let's get started by opening the settings api php file.

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.730
Inside the function run a function called ad settings section.

16
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.200
This function will register a section with our form.

17
00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.270
It has four arguments.

18
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.300
The first argument is the ID of the section.

19
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.910
A page can have multiple sections.

20
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.000
WordPress needs to be able to identify them.

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.710
The ID can be anything.

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.100
Let's set the ID to up options section.

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.230
Next, we must provide the title of the section.

24
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.290
Let's set this argument to the following translatable message Udemy plus settings.

25
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.160
The third argument is the function for rendering this section's content.

26
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.290
Normally, developers will render additional text to help users fill out the form.

27
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.770
It's completely optional to add additional text for demonstration purposes, let's add a function called

28
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.260
Up Options Section CB.

29
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.670
Let's define this function below.

30
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.330
Normally we would create a separate file for a function.

31
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.470
However, these functions belong to the page.

32
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.120
Therefore, I don't mind using the same file inside the function.

33
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.870
Let's output a paragraph tag with the following message an alternative form for updating options with

34
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.310
the settings API.

35
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.490
Let's head back to the ad settings section function.

36
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.180
The last argument is to assign this section to a page.

37
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.230
Currently, WordPress does not know where to render this section.

38
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.680
Let's call our page up options page.

39
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.930
After defining the section, we must render this section from within our page.

40
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.820
Open the options page.

41
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.860
Alt dot php file.

42
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.990
Below these settings fields function run a function called do settings sections.

43
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.180
This function will begin rendering sections for a specific page.

44
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.700
It has one argument, which is the name of the page.

45
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.360
This argument corresponds to the fourth argument in the ad settings section function.

46
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.120
Lets pass an up options page.

47
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.480
Before testing our code, let's run the submit button function to add a button for submitting the form.

48
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.260
All right, let's refresh our page.

49
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:36.110
The section has been successfully rendered, the section renders a title and paragraph below our section

50
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.360
we have a button for submitting the form.

51
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.120
In the next lecture, we are going to finalize our form by adding fields to the section.
