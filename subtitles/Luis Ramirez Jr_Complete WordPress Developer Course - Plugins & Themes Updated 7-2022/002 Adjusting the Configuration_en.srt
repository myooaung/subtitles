00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,020
In this lecture, we are going to refine the configuration file to help us debug WordPress.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,250
As we discussed before, WordPress is not configured to help us debug issues.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,640
If we want help, we need to enable debug mode.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,560
At the moment I have the WP config PHP file opened.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,440
Open it in your editor if you haven't already.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,750
The configuration file does not contain all these settings mentioned in the documentation.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,830
If an option is missing, WordPress will set a default value.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,320
Some settings are completely optional.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,540
Scroll to the bottom of the file.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,540
It's recommended to add additional configuration settings above this comments.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,920
We're going to turn on debug mode.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,660
It's the first step we should always take when working on a new project.

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,260
Let's define a constant called WP debug.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,940
With the defined function, the value for the constant will be true.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,430
Make sure your code matches mine.

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,780
The words WPD bug should be written with uppercase letters just like that.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,300
We're ready to start coding.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,720
If we make a mistake, we will be able to view the error.

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,290
This behavior is great for a development environment.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,330
There's another setting worth adding below the WPD bug variable.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,740
Define another constant called WP.

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,150
Disable fatal error handler.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,180
The value for this constant should be true.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,460
Pjp has a special type of error called a fatal error.

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,010
Fatal errors will cause the server to produce a blank page, which may not be desirable.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,390
WordPress has implemented a feature to produce a friendlier page.

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,720
If there's a fatal error in our theme, it's better than viewing a blank page by default.

28
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,620
This setting is turned off.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,020
If you would like to enable this behavior, this constant should be set to true.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,660
There are dozens of additional settings that we could add.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,780
When the time comes, we'll tweak our application's configuration.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,449
For now, we're not going to configure WordPress further.

33
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,990
The default settings will be suitable for our project.

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,080
Changing the behavior of WordPress is as simple as changing the values of these constants.

35
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,960
We're finished with configuring the WP config file.

36
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,140
Feel free to explore the documentation for more information for our purposes.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,720
Setting the WP debug constant to true is more than enough to get started.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,300
There are additional settings that we can add for development, but we'll revisit those settings in

39
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,620
future lectures.

40
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,010
Let's continue our journey in the following lecture.
