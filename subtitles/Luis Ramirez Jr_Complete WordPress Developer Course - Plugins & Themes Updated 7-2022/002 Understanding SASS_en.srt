00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,800
In this lecture, we are going to explore a language called SAS.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,150
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the official site for SAS.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,860
SAS is a programming language for CSIS, which might sound strange.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,160
CSIS is one of the simplest languages you can learn.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,540
There's not much to it.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,390
On the other hand, it's not a powerful language.

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,000
SAS aims to solve CSIS issues by adding features found in programming languages.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,620
SAS supports functions, loops, directives, inheritance, etc. For this course we decided not to use

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,280
SAS.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,660
In my opinion, I prefer another tool called Post CSIS.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,310
However, you're likely to find SAS and other plugins for this reason.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,350
Let's try learning SAS.

13
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,370
Typically the first step is to install SAS browsers.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,710
Do not support SAS code written with SAS must be compiled in CSS.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,480
By using the Create Blocks package, we can skip this step all together.

16
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
The developers of this package have added native support for SAS with blocks.

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,790
We can start writing SAS immediately in our editors.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,510
Let's open these style SCC file.

19
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,270
SAS files can be written inside files with the SAS or SAS extension.

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,050
The SAS extension is more common.

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,160
If you were to look through this files code base, you're going to notice that SAS is very similar to

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,210
CSS.

23
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,110
You can think of SAS as a language that extends CSS.

24
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,480
All CSS features are supported.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,960
The SAS syntax rules apply to SAS.

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's look at one of the most common features available inside the WP block u plus alert box class.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,460
We have a list of CSS properties.

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,740
However, things don't stop there.

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,020
An additional selector has been added inside the curly brackets of the current selector.

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,720
SAS supports nested selectors.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,860
The idea of nesting was inspired by HTML and HTML.

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,440
We can add elements inside elements.

33
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,789
Children elements would inherit properties from parent elements.

34
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,390
The same idea applies to nested selectors in SAS.

35
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,410
A nested selector is a shortcut for producing a long selector.

36
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,840
For example, the first nested selector will produce the following selector WP lock you plus alert box

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,790
is style accented.

38
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,770
In the child selector, we have an ampersand character.

39
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,530
This character represents the parent selector.

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,740
SAS will convert this character into the parent selector during compilation, thus giving us the final

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,490
selector.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,970
As you can see, it's shorter to right this selector.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,580
Let's look at another example below this selector.

44
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,180
The child selector does not have the ampersand character by not including this character.

45
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,930
A space will separate the parent and child selector.

46
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,940
This example will produce the following selector WP Lock U plus alert box dash icon.

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,780
By using nested selectors, we can quickly create long selectors.

48
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,350
In addition, this feature provides clarity on the relationship between selectors without nesting.

49
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,030
It can be difficult to organise CSIS.

50
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,030
It's very clear that these properties will only be applied to these classes.

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,670
This is just one feature of SAS.

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,460
Since this is not a SAS course, I won't be diving any deeper.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,750
However, feel free to continue learning about SAS after finishing this course.

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,330
There are many developers who enjoy using this language.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,300
Don't worry, we won't be using any advanced features of SAS.

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,030
The purpose of this lecture was to just give you a taste of this language.

57
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,080
Now that we've covered SAS, let's get back into block development.

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,710
In the next lecture, let's talk about Ed Styles.
