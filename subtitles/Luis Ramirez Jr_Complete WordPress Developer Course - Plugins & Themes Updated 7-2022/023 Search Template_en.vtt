00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.550
In this lecture, we are going to create a search template.

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.689
The search template gets loaded on pages that have search results.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.440
Let's look at an example on the header.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.240
We added the search block.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.590
It's fully functional.

6
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.990
Let's try searching for a post.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.880
After a few moments, the page should load the results from the search.

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.750
At the moment, the search results page uses the index template for displaying the results.

9
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.460
I think it would be a good idea to have a different design for this page in another tab.

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
I have a unique design for the search page.

11
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.510
It's very identical to the index template.

12
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.730
The main difference is that there's a search form within the first column of the template.

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.840
Unlike the category template, the search form will not stretch across the page.

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.270
It'll sit above the list of posts.

15
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.350
The location is very important to highlight.

16
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.820
Let's take a look at the documentation for displaying search results.

17
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.930
According to the documentation, WordPress will search for a file called Search.

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.410
If this file can't be found, the results will be displayed with the index templates.

19
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.340
Now that we have an idea of what we need to do, let's create the templates back in the code editor.

20
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.860
Create a file called search hml inside the templates directory.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.770
Next, let's copy the index template over to the search template.

22
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.920
Since they're almost identical, we can reuse our template to speed up development.

23
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.320
All that's left is to add a search form above the list of posts in the assets directory.

24
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.080
Open the search html file.

25
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.010
Next search for a comet that says search block.

26
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.930
There are two options at our disposal.

27
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.270
We can reuse the search block to add this form.

28
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.540
However, it's not going to suffice for our needs.

29
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.330
The search form for the search template will display the search term above the input.

30
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.510
The search block does not add the search term.

31
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.010
Unfortunately, WordPress does not offer this option to users.

32
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.500
You can probably guess what this means.

33
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.240
We're going to create a custom block to get the functionality we're looking for.

34
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.930
For now, let's create a custom HTML block.

35
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.540
Copy the search form to your clipboard.

36
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.000
Next, open the search template in the full site editor.

37
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.270
It should be available from the list of templates.

38
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.070
As a reminder, this section of the template should be placed above the list of posts inside the first

39
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.640
column.

40
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.340
Add an HTML block.

41
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.870
You may need to adjust the position.

42
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.830
Paste the HTML into the block.

43
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.380
Afterward, we can begin transferring the updated copy of our template to our file.

44
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.220
Let's copy the entire list of blocks by holding the shift key and selecting copy.

45
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.160
Next.

46
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.200
Head back to the search dot html file.

47
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.780
Let's overwrite the current template with the new template.

48
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.950
We're finished.

49
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.830
Let's refresh the search results on the front end.

50
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.960
As you can see, the search form has been successfully created.

51
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.090
It doesn't display the search term.

52
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.780
It's not the end of the world.

53
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.720
Once we get in to block development, this issue will be resolved.

54
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.430
As long as the form appears, we're good to go.

55
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.970
Let's continue exploring templates.
