1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,920
In this lecture, we're going to start working on other templates.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,980
So far we've been focused on the home page.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,830
However, the home page is not the only page that exists.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,380
There are pages for posts, search results for for errors, categories, and so much more.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,700
WordPress offers an exhaustive template system.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,480
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a documentation page for a WordPress template

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,210
hierarchy mechanism.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,840
Previously we talked about the query for a page as a refresher, WordPress will scan the URL to determine

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,830
the type of content that should be rendered based on the URL.

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:47,280
WordPress will perform a query to the database for a list of posts that should be displayed on the page.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,500
There is a step that we skipped over.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,970
After it has grabbed the results, it'll begin picking a template.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,230
WordPress will follow a hierarchy for picking a template which is documented on this page before looking

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,160
at examples.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,610
There's one thing worth mentioning throughout this page.

16
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,210
Most of the file names include the PHP extension.

17
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,410
However, there's a note that says the following and these examples the PHP file extension is used in

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,400
block themes.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,620
HTML files are used instead, but the template hierarchy is the same.

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,360
It's safe to assume that everything on this page applies to block themes.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,530
Let's proceed to look at an example below the notices.

22
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,500
They will be a link to a visual example.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,070
If we look at it, the visual diagram will provide us with an overview of the template hierarchy.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,860
The diagram is read from left to right.

25
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,500
On the left side, the diagram will show us the types of pages selected by WordPress.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,160
For example, let's say we're viewing a singular page.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,680
The diagram will check if the page is for a single post or a static page.

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,400
If it's a single page, it will check if the page is for an attachment, custom post or blog post.

29
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,289
Lastly, it will begin searching for files based on the type of page.

30
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,410
Let's assume the type of page is a custom post.

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,390
First, WordPress will search for a custom template in our theme.

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:24,810
If a custom template doesn't exist, it'll search for a file called Single with the name of the post

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,380
type.

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,290
Once again, if this file doesn't exist, WordPress will continue down the hierarchy.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,470
Eventually it'll reach the index templates.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,280
In fact, if you were to scan through the entire hierarchy, all pages lead to the index template.

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,590
For this reason, every theme must have an index template to be considered valid.

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,570
It's the default for all pages.

39
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,000
When a suitable template isn't found.

40
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,830
The visual diagram can help get an idea of how the hierarchy works.

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,430
However, the documentation page is easier to read.

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,930
Let's go back to the documentation page for the template hierarchy.

43
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,860
On this documentation page, each type of page will have a dedicated section for explaining the order

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,940
of templates.

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,690
For example, let's look at the front page templates.

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,370
According to WordPress, it'll search for the following files in this order.

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:28,380
Front page, html, home, html, page, html and indexed html.

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,600
All template files must be created in the templates directory of our theme.

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,550
For the rest of this section, we will start working on creating these templates.

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,820
However, not every template will be explored.

51
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,200
In most cases, you can get away with less than a dozen templates.

52
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,230
In my text.

53
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,800
Senator, I'm viewing the files for the 22 theme.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,130
This theme is installed with all WordPress installations.

55
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,370
Reading through WordPress default themes can be a great way to learn theme development.

56
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,370
The latest theme is a block theme similar to our theme.

57
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,370
There's a folder called templates.

58
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,660
If we look quickly at the folders files, there are less than a dozen templates.

59
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,100
Like I said before, defining every template is not necessary.

60
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,130
You only need to create what's necessary.

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,400
With that being said, we are going to create the most common templates you'll need for a theme once

62
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:26,970
you're ready.

63
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,230
Let's get started.
