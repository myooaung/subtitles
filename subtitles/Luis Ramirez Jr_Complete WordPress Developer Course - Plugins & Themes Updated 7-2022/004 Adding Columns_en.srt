1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,440
In this lecture, we are going to add column support for our blocks.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,810
Currently, the children blocks are stacked vertically.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,610
The orientation should be modified to horizontal stacking.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,210
We can fix this issue with CSS.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,200
In my editor, I'm viewing the main CSS file for this block.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,960
We are going to use CSS grids for creating columns in this file.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,460
I have three classes called columns, two columns three and columns four.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,210
We're going to allow users to toggle between these classes.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,030
Let's open the index JS file.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,050
Our block has an attribute called columns.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,440
This attribute can be a number between two and four.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:49,200
I've already added a control for modifying this block from the edit function.

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,220
Check out the inspector controls component.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,170
We have a component called range control for modifying the columns attributes.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,670
It has the usual properties for creating an input.

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,420
However, it's missing two properties as it stands.

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,040
Our CSS only supports two, three or four columns.

18
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,210
The range control component will allow users to select numbers beyond this range.

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,940
We can limit the range by adding two properties called Min and Max.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,080
Let's set these properties to two and four respectively.

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,570
This will limit the range of values.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,130
Moving on, let's begin applying the classes to the templates.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,980
We must apply classes to the root element.

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,060
Luckily, we do not need to directly modify the root elements.

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,220
The root element has the block props variable.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,370
The use block props function accepts an object of properties to add to the root element.

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,040
Let's add the class name property.

28
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,310
The value for this property will be a template string with the following value columns.

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,210
Columns.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,030
The class will be dynamic.

31
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,460
We are going to interpolate the columns attributes into the class name.

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,800
Let's make a copy of this object.

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,980
The same classes must be applied to the save function paste the object into the use block props dot

34
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,230
save function.

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,110
One more thing they say.

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,290
Function does not have access to the columns attributes above the save function.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,200
The structure.

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,590
The attributes object for the columns attributes.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,860
Our luck is ready in the browser.

40
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,340
Refresh the page.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,760
And the team members group block to the page.

42
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,000
This time, the blocks are arranged horizontally.

43
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,410
Our columns are working as expected.

44
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,390
On the sidebar, we can modify the columns by moving the slider.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,610
As we do so, the blocks should adjust accordingly.

46
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,060
If you're interested in having additional columns, you're more than welcome to modify the classes and

47
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,900
range.

48
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,030
There's one more thing I want to mention.

49
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,200
In an earlier lecture we set the orientation to horizontal.

50
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,130
By doing so, we can hover our mouse between the blocks to insert new blocks.

51
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,010
Previously, this element would appear underneath the blocks.

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,200
This time it appears in between the blocks.

53
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,820
Setting the orientation is optional, but I recommend setting it for a better user experience.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,180
The parent block is mostly complete.

55
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,940
In the next set of lectures, we will shift our focus to the individual team members.
