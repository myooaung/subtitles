00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,230
In this lecture, we're going to wrap up our discussion of typography.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,250
By setting some initial values, we can apply styles on a global level or block level.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,660
As always, it's considered good practice to establish default values for your theme.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,670
For example, our theme will be using the rubric font for the entire document.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,590
At the moment, this is not true.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,310
We will need to configure the styles to set the default font.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,590
Let's get started in your editor.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,080
Open the theme dot json file.

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,960
We're going to switch our focus to these styles, objects inside this object.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,850
We can begin adding typography styles by adding the typography object.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,570
To begin, we're going to modify the font family by adding the font family property.

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,870
If we hover our mouse over this property, we can verify the CSS property that gets modified by adding

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,290
it.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,580
The value for this property must be a valid CCIS value.

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,560
As we've learned earlier, WordPress will create variables from our theme file.

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,540
This includes font families.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,900
We can set this property to the following value.

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,340
Var WP preset font family you Rubik.

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Variables for font families are prefixed with the WP preset font family keyword.

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,280
This prefix is followed by our slug.

21
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,030
As a reminder, our theme doesn't have custom fonts loaded.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,910
This is a topic we'll tackle in the next lecture.

23
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:42,040
As long as the property gets updated, we'll consider this solution a success.

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,740
Let's try changing the font size by adding the font size property.

25
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,240
This property will be set to 16.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,070
Afterward, we can change the font style of our document by setting the font style property for our

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,640
theme.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,220
This property will be set to normal.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,570
I think it would be awkward if our entire document were italicized.

30
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,480
Setting it to normal is considered standard.

31
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,510
Let's move on to the next property, which is called font weight.

32
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,470
The value for this property will be normal.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,660
Afterward, we're going to configure the line height by setting the line height property to inherit.

34
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,620
Up next, we'll set the text declaration by adding the text declaration property with an initial value

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,370
of none.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,900
Lastly, the casing can be configured by adding the text transform property.

37
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,680
The value for this property will be none.

38
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,490
I ran by this configuration really fast.

39
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,450
However, none of these properties should be new to you.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,420
Once again, you can hover your mouse over these properties for the name of the CSS property that will

41
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,990
be bona fide as long as you have the schema in your file.

42
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,130
A description should be available.

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,230
Some of these values are the default values.

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,750
It's not entirely beneficial to add them.

45
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,730
However, it's never a bad idea to reset your CSS for backward compatibility.

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,740
Before testing our code, let's try applying a font family to the site title block by default, WordPress

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,970
does not use our custom font as the default font family.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,120
Let's configure the site title block to use our custom font as the default font family.

49
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,650
We can apply these same typography settings to a specific block.

50
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,030
Inside the block section, we're going to update the core slash site title object and the typography

51
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,440
object to the block.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,750
Next set the font family property to the following value.

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,800
WP Preset Font Family Yu Pacific Co.

54
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,930
We're not going to modify the other settings.

55
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's give our styles a test for testing.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,750
Let's try viewing their properties on the front end of our site.

57
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,519
Using the developer tools.

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,730
Search for the body tag in the elements panel.

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,690
Perfect.

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,400
Our styles were applied to the body elements.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,400
Keep in mind these styles will not be applied to elements that override these properties.

62
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,080
This is simply a base.

63
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,680
Let's check out the styles for the site title block.

64
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,920
The Font family is being set to Pacifico.

65
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,580
Awesome.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,480
We're finished with exploring the typography options of our theme.
