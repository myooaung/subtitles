00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.130
In this lecture, we are going to quickly look at a set of plugins for debugging a WordPress site.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.830
We never had to resort to these tools, however, you may find them useful during the development of

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.640
your plugin.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.720
Throughout this course, we've explored various debugging techniques.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:22.530
For example, we utilize the developer tools or we dumped the contents of a variable onto the page.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.260
In addition, we've turned on debug mode from the configuration file.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.380
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a page for debugging code in WordPress.

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
WordPress provides an extensive list of tips for debugging plugins and themes.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.950
Let's explore some of the options available.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.170
WordPress recommends two plugins called Query Monitor and Debug Bar.

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.610
I provide links to both plugins in the resource section of this lecture.

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.750
Both plugins will output information on the current request.

13
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.770
They will provide a list of hooks and queries used by the page.

14
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.480
This information can be helpful for understanding how a page was generated.

15
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
You do not need to install both plugins, they both produce the same results.

16
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
I prefer to use the query monitor plugin.

17
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.060
It outputs more information than the debug bar plug in.

18
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.610
Before installing this plugin, let's update our WordPress configuration in your editor.

19
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.360
Open the WP config dot PHP file.

20
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.380
It's been a while since we've opened this file.

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.680
This file contains the configuration settings for a WordPress site.

22
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.120
Previously we turned on debug mode to help us debug our site during development.

23
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.060
Let's add another setting below the WP debug constant called save queries.

24
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.910
The value for this constant will be true.

25
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.040
The same query setting will force WordPress to save the queries performed to the database.

26
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.890
By saving the queries we can inspect them.

27
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270
Next, let's install and activate the query monitor plugin.

28
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.350
Open the add new plugin page in the admin dashboard.

29
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.190
Search for the query monitor plug in.

30
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.820
Install and activate this plug in.

31
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.020
At the top of the page, a new menu option will become available.

32
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.380
The plugin will allow us to inspect various pieces of information on the request.

33
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.650
For example, we can view a complete list of SQL queries executed by the page.

34
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.360
In addition to the query, we are given the function's name responsible for executing the query.

35
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.420
As you can imagine, this information is extremely valuable.

36
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.790
It can help us pinpoint where and when a query was executed.

37
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.130
Queries are not the only piece of information available.

38
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.170
We can view a list of hooks.

39
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.810
I mentioned this before, but multiple plugins can listen to the same hook.

40
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.280
With this information, we are given the name of the hook, priority and function.

41
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.660
If you're curious about the exact location of the function, you can click on the plus icon for this

42
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.320
info.

43
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.730
Overall, the query monitor plugin can be extremely helpful for inspecting various pieces of information.

44
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.250
The most important step for using this plugin is to enable debug mode.

45
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.760
Without this setting, this plugin may not produce reliable results.

46
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.080
In the next lecture.

47
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.620
Let's finish the section by bundling our plugins.
