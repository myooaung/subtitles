00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.300
In this lecture, we are going to toggle the appearance of the plus button in the team member block.

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.430
In my browser, I have added the team member block to the page.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.680
If I were to click on the block, the toolbar would appear clicking outside of the block will de select

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.100
it.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.370
At the same time the toolbar disappears.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.680
Selecting and selecting the block causes the toolbar to toggle its appearance.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.770
It would be annoying if the toolbar never disappeared.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.930
What if we had multiple blocks?

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.840
If we're not editing the block, it doesn't make sense for certain UI elements to stay on the page.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.590
For this reason, we should hide the plus button from the block.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.140
It doesn't make sense for this option to be available while the user is not editing the block.

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.700
WordPress provides the block selection status as a property.

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.310
Let's try using it in your editor.

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.680
Open the edit dot js file.

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.160
In the components function the structure a property called is selected.

16
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.690
The IS selected property is a boolean value.

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.270
This property is managed by WordPress.

18
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.080
It'll tell us if the block is currently selected.

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.510
Let's start toggling the plus button.

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.070
Scroll to this button in our templates.

21
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.480
Above the tooltip component.

22
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.350
And the following expression is selected and.

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.650
Next move, the tooltip component after the expression.

24
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.140
With a single property, we can toggle elements based on the block selection.

25
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.470
Let's try testing our code in the browser, refresh the page and add the team members group block.

26
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.440
By default, the plus button is gone.

27
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.620
We can select individual team members for the button to appear.

28
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.540
Toggling UI elements based on a block's selection can reduce clutter from the editor.

29
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.380
It's super helpful to have a feature like this.

30
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.190
Let's continue working on our UI in the next lecture.
