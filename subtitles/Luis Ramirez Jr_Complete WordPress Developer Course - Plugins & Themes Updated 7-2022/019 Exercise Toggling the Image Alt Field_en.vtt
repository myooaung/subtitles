00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.210
In this lecture, we are going to quickly toggle the field for modifying the images alt attributes.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.990
Let me show you what I mean in my browser.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm viewing the team members group block on this block.

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.280
I've uploaded an image.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.310
If we click on the block a field for modifying the images, alt attribute will appear.

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.620
I've added this field for conveniently modifying the image alt attributes.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
Otherwise users would need to open the media library to modify this value.

8
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.510
On the other hand, this field should not appear.

9
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
If an image is not available, we should hide this field from the client.

10
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.180
Try this as an exercise.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
Toggle the appearance of the field in the sidebar.

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.700
You should be able to do so without a problem.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.910
Pause the video and good luck.

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.480
Welcome back.

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.510
If you were able to toggle the fields, that's great.

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.170
If not, that's fine.

17
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.660
Let's go through the solution together in your editor.

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.210
Open the edit JS file.

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.349
Search for the text area control component.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.780
You can find it inside the inspector controls components.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.680
Above this component and the following expression image preview and not is blob URL.

22
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.380
Image Preview and.

23
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.710
Unlike before.

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.580
We're using two conditions.

25
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.730
The first condition will check if the image preview state variable has a value.

26
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.820
Secondly, the other condition will check for a blob URL.

27
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.060
We do not want to render this option unless the image has been successfully uploaded.

28
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.920
Otherwise it's not worth showing the field.

29
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.900
Let's move the field after the second and operator.

30
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.880
That's it.

31
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.280
The field will only appear if an image is selected.

32
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.780
In the next lecture, let's add one more feature before considering the image selection complete.
