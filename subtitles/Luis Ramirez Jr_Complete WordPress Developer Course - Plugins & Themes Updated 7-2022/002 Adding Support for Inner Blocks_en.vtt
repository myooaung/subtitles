00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture, we are going to add support for inner blocks.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.250
A block can act as a container for additional blocks.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.920
Let's look at an example inside the Gutenberg editor.

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.890
I'm going to add the buttons block to the page.

5
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:22.990
After adding this block, we can open the list view sidebar for an overview of the blocks on the page.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.000
The Buttons BLOCK is not a standalone block.

7
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.950
In reality, there are two blocks for creating this UI.

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.070
We have a container for adding multiple buttons.

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.990
The button block will generate a single button.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.900
It's not uncommon to create this type of relationship for our custom blocks.

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.940
WordPress has a component for supporting inner blocks in the resource section of this lecture.

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.550
I provide a link to the documentation page for the inner blocks components.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.620
This component will add an area for inserting custom blocks from within a block.

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.330
In addition, a button will become available for inserting new blocks.

15
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.410
Feel free to read the documentation after finishing this lecture.

16
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.790
This component offers a few options for customizing the behavior.

17
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.200
Let's give it a try.

18
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.110
In your editor, open the index js file for the team members group block.

19
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.860
Next, let's import the inner blocks component from the WordPress slash block editor package.

20
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.530
After importing this component, scroll to the block's edit function.

21
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.490
We are going to modify the blocks templates inside the div tag with the block prompts variable and the

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.820
inner blocks component as a self closing tag.

23
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.980
The inner component works out of the box.

24
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.450
We don't need to provide configuration.

25
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.980
However, I should give you a warning.

26
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.070
WordPress does not allow a block to have multiple locations for inner blocks.

27
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.320
A block may only have one inner blocks component before testing our code.

28
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.790
The save function must be updated to inside the div tag.

29
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.940
Add the inner block dot content component.

30
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.380
The inner block's component has two variations.

31
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.170
The first variation will provide a UI for inserting new blocks, whereas the inner blocks content component

32
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.000
will not add this UI.

33
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.200
It will simply render the blocks inserted into the parent block.

34
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.210
Let's try testing our code.

35
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.340
Refresh the page in the browser.

36
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
On this page, I'm going to add the team members group block.

37
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.180
As you can see, we have an empty block upon selecting the block.

38
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.130
A plus icon will appear.

39
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.440
Gutenberg is rendering this icon on our behalf.

40
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.760
We can click this icon to open a dropdown.

41
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.760
By using a single component.

42
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.870
We can easily add blocks to our custom block.

43
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.280
I'm going to add two copies of the team member block.

44
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.010
So far the component works as intended.

45
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.460
However, we should refine the behaviour.

46
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.520
Firstly, we should limit the type of blocks that can be inserted into the current block by default.

47
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.700
All blocks are allowed for the sake of consistency.

48
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.710
Let's limit the blocks to the team member block.

49
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.440
Luckily, the inner blocks component is configurable.

50
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.840
We can adjust the behavior to address both issues.

51
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.150
Let's head back to the code editor.

52
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.350
Scroll to the edit function.

53
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.290
These changes do not need to be applied to the save function.

54
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.970
The inner blocked content component will not handle this behavior in the inner blocks component at a

55
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.130
property called orientation.

56
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.140
This option can have one of two values vertical or horizontal.

57
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.710
The vertical option will add the insert or below the block.

58
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.830
The horizontal option will add the insert or on the sides of a block.

59
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.430
Let's set this option to horizontal.

60
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.170
Next, let's add a property called allowed blocks.

61
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.220
The value for this option can be an array of valid block names.

62
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.960
In our case, we're going to limit the inner blocks component to the utility plus slash team member

63
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.540
lock.

64
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.350
After adding these options.

65
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.630
Let's try testing our block again.

66
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.940
If we were to add blocks to the team members group block, WordPress will automatically insert the team

67
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.940
member block.

68
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.010
We don't get the option of inserting other blocks.

69
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.040
It's quicker than selecting a long list of blocks.

70
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.730
We are running short on time.

71
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.440
In the following lecture, let's keep configuring the block to render a template.
