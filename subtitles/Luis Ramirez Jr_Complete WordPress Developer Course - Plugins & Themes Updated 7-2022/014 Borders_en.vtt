00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.250
In this lecture, we are going to finish our discussion of colors by modifying borders.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.500
Most blocs support borders by default.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
These blocks will disable border settings.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.650
Therefore, we need to take extra steps to enable this feature before changing the colour.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.280
To get started, open the theme dot json file.

6
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.510
The settings for configuring borders can be tricky.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.710
The process is slightly different from other settings.

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.299
First things first we need to enable the border settings.

9
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.560
We can enable borders through the settings object.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.230
Inside this object, add an object called border.

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.600
Borders are more complicated than other properties.

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.470
A border has a style, width, colour and radius.

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.910
WordPress gives us the option of modifying all border properties.

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.770
Alternatively, we can have partial support for borders.

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.000
For example, lets enable all border settings inside the border object.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.920
Add the following properties colour, radius, style and width.

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.530
The value for these properties is booleans.

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.600
By default, they're all false.

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.000
In our example, we're turning them on.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.790
Keep in mind, a block has to support border settings before testing our configuration.

21
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.390
Let's add some default styles for our borders.

22
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.070
To mix things up, let's modify the border settings for the pull quote block.

23
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.210
Scroll to the style section inside the blocks object.

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
We can add our block with the name core slash pull quote.

25
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.890
Next we can add the border object to begin adding styles.

26
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.890
As a reminder, we are modifying the styles.

27
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.350
The options for styles are different than the options for changing the settings.

28
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.420
We can't enable or disable the border settings from this object.

29
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.080
The property names are going to be similar, but they require different values.

30
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.590
If you want to enable border settings for a specific block, you must do it from the settings object.

31
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.330
Inside the border object, we're going to modify all border styles.

32
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.770
First, let's set the width property to two x.

33
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.080
Afterward set the radius property to ten x.

34
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
Next set the style property to solid.

35
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.070
Lastly, let's set the colour property to the WP preset color u primary variable.

36
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.320
As you can tell, the values for these properties must be valid.

37
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.760
CSS values.

38
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.500
Time to test our code in your browser.

39
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.640
Try adding the code block to the template.

40
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.250
After adding this block, our default stylings have been applied.

41
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.810
If users don't like the styles, that's perfectly fine.

42
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.770
The border settings are freely modifiable from the sidebar by enabling all border settings.

43
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.980
Users can modify the width, color, style and radius of a border.

44
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.050
Finally, we're finished with the color settings.

45
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.520
WordPress provides us with dozens of options for modifying the colors of a theme from global level settings

46
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.480
to block specific settings.

47
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.400
Hopefully, you will be able to leverage these options for your themes.

48
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.890
Now that we finished working with Colors, let's move our discussion to typography settings.
