1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,590
In this lecture, we are going to shift our focus to the templates of our theme.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,460
Thus far we've been prepping the editor and asset files.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,670
We can finally start converting our template from a static HTML file to a series of blocks.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,400
There are two options at our disposal.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,330
We can try creating our template with blocks from WordPress or we can create custom blocks for this

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,930
course.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,300
We're going to explore both options.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,470
It might seem like you should create custom blocks, but that's not always necessary.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,490
You'd be surprised with how much WordPress can help you with its default set of blocks.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,050
Our first goal will be to split our template into multiple files.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,970
At the moment I'm looking at the index HTML template file.

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,900
The index template file is over 500 lines of code.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,280
It's a lot of code to manage before proceeding further with the course.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,620
We should start optimizing our code.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,710
As you know, I don't like to deal with large files.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,820
It's much more optimal to break files into smaller pieces.

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,050
There's another benefit to splitting templates into multiple files.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,200
It allows us to reuse sections of A templates.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,830
In the future, we're going to be creating numerous templates.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,290
Templates should be split into multiple pieces for manageability and reusability.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,500
The question is how out of the box?

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,930
WordPress provides a feature for splitting templates into pieces called template parts.

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,650
Before splitting the template into separate files, we need to identify which sections should be placed

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,970
in a separate file.

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,180
In my browser I have the home page opened.

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,640
Our theme should look consistent.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,540
It's normal for the header and footer to look the same on every page.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,110
We can put each section into separate files.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,260
We'll be able to reuse them for different templates.

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,050
It's also going to make development easier.

31
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:03,270
If we change one section, the changes will be reflected on all pages.

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,250
We won't have to shift through dozens of templates to apply the same changes.

33
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,449
Let's get started.

34
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,250
Switch back to your editor.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,880
We're going to create template parts.

36
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,070
A template part is an HTML file representing a section of a templates by themselves.

37
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,180
Sampler parts are not responsible for rendering an entire page.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,970
Typically they are included in a templates.

39
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,790
It's not required to use template parts.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,260
However, they were introduced for easily maintaining templates.

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,600
Template parts can be created by creating a folder in our theme called parts.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,120
Let's create this folder in our theme.

43
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:53,410
Next, we're going to create two files called header HTML and Footer HTML.

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,490
Unlike templates, file names for a template.

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,880
Parts are flexible.

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,510
We can call these files whatever we want.

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,490
I highly recommend using short, concise and descriptive names.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,280
In our case, we're creating template parts for our templates, header and footer sections.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,020
The same rules for templates apply to template parts.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,890
We should only use blocks.

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,460
Raw HTML is not allowed, therefore let's create the blocks with the full site editor.

52
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,450
Afterward, we'll paste the blocks over to our templates.

53
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,880
Once again, this is not necessary.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,910
You can manually create blocks in your editor.

55
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:41,960
However, it's easier and safer to let WordPress create blocks switch over to the full site editor.

56
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,110
Let's empty out the HTML block.

57
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,660
Next, we're going to add two more HTML blocks.

58
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,940
In total, we have three empty HTML blocks.

59
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,430
Time to add content for each block.

60
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,030
Switch over to the indexed HTML template file.

61
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:13,360
Inside this file, we're going to copy the header, main content and footer sections into each HTML

62
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,420
block for extra clarity.

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,040
Everything inside the header tag should be in the first block.

64
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,270
Everything inside the main tags should be in the second block.

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,970
Lastly, everything inside the footer tags should be in the third block.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm going to quickly move everything over.

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,960
Awesome.

68
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,050
We're almost done.

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,420
Time to move the blocks into the templates, starting with the first block.

70
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,500
Copy the block to your clipboard.

71
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,930
In our text editor.

72
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,280
We're going to paste the block into the header HTML file.

73
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,310
We will repeat the process for the second block.

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,770
The second block should completely replace the contents of the indexed HTML file.

75
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,120
Lastly, we will copy the third block.

76
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,980
This block should be pasted into the footer html file.

77
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,300
The final step is to load these template parts by defaults.

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,850
Template parts are not loaded into a template, therefore our template is going to be partially broken.

79
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,990
Luckily, WordPress has a block for tackling this problem back in the browser.

80
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,550
We are going to refresh the page without saving the templates.

81
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,010
If you accidentally save the templates, revert the changes to the original template.

82
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,840
After you've got that sorted.

83
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,210
You should notice that the contents of the HTML block have changed.

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,890
It's missing the header and footer tags.

85
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,010
That's perfect.

86
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,390
Below and above the HTML block.

87
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,390
Insert a block called template part.

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,460
The template part lock is capable of loading a template part.

89
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,620
We have the option of creating a custom template part or choosing a template part from our theme.

90
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,540
Let's click on the Choose Option for the first block.

91
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,140
As you can see, WordPress has found our themes template parts.

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,610
This is why creating the parts folder is important.

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,880
If our theme has this folder, WordPress will be able to locate our themes template parts.

94
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,750
The previews will be broken.

95
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,240
That's to be expected.

96
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,940
Our CSS is loaded on the front end.

97
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,720
The editor will not load the styles in a future lecture.

98
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,990
We will fix this.

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,520
For now, let's select the header template part.

100
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,450
After doing so, the HTML block from the template part has been loaded.

101
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,180
Let's do the same for the second template part.

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,700
BLOCK this time, this block should load the footer template part.

103
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,580
Perfect.

104
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,870
We're almost finished.

105
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,450
The next step is to add these blocks to our template.

106
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,460
We can do what we did before.

107
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,110
We can copy the blocks to our clipboard.

108
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:12,790
Unlike before, we're not going to use the toolbar during this course.

109
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,430
We're going to be working with multiple blocks.

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,130
It can be easy to select a block accidentally to avoid this problem from occurring.

111
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:26,110
We can open the list view sidebar to accurately select a block.

112
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,180
Let's select the template part.

113
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,490
Don't select the HTML block.

114
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,360
After doing so you can copy the block from the dropdown menu.

115
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,390
I'm going to copy the header template part.

116
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,880
Next switch over to the index html file.

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,260
Above the current HTML block.

118
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,500
We're going to paste the template part above the block.

119
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,730
Unlike before the HTML block does not get pasted.

120
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,400
WordPress will detect that we're loading a template block.

121
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,810
The blocks from the template part will be loaded in this location.

122
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,100
You'll see how it works in a moment.

123
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,530
Let's grab the footer template part.

124
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,660
This template part should be pasted at the bottom of the indexed HTML file.

125
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,510
Time to test our work on the front end.

126
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,950
Refresh the page.

127
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,360
Awesome.

128
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,560
The template hasn't changed one bit.

129
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,400
Our page is fully functional.

130
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,140
We have the benefit of modifying either the header or footer.

131
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,710
Any changes we make will be reflected on all pages.

132
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,320
By isolating each section into separate files, we can focus on a specific section.

133
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,760
It's an optional but recommended step.

134
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,380
Let's continue working on our theme in the next lecture.
