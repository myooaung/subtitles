00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,020
In this lecture, we will quickly add the toggle control component for toggling the show register attribute

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,730
for the off modal block.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,140
I know I could have provided the code for you.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,760
However, I want to give you another opportunity to practice writing components for manipulating attributes.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,230
Let's get started.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,140
The attributes have been prepared ahead of time.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,460
We don't need to add this attribute.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,090
We can begin adding the component inside your editor.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,690
Open the index, not JS file.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,230
At the top of the file.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,830
Let's update the import statement for the components package to include the toggle control components.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,300
Next we can start adding the component to the inspector controls components.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,930
Typically we would add the attributes.

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,740
However, I've already included the attributes for you.

15
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:02,540
We can start inserting this component into the sidebar inside the panel body component and the toggle

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,129
control component.

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,770
Let's quickly run through the properties.

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,210
The label property will be set to the following.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,330
Translatable Text Show Register.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,820
Next set the help property to a ternary operator.

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,710
The condition will be the show register attributes.

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:34,990
If the show register attribute is set to true, let's render the following translatable text showing

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,430
registration form.

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,390
Otherwise, the message will say the following Hiding registration form.

25
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,450
Afterward.

26
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,130
Let's set the check attribute to the show register property.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,170
The property will configure the current value.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,250
Lastly, let's add the on change events to update the attributes.

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,950
As usual, we're going to pass in a function to accept the new value.

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,130
The argument will be called Show Register.

31
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:18,780
Inside the function's body, we can call the set attributes function to update the show register attributes.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,880
We're finished.

33
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,050
Let's try refreshing the Gutenberg editor to test the block's options.

34
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,050
Before adding the block.

35
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,490
Let's remove the other blocks from the page.

36
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,340
It's starting to get cluttered.

37
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,650
Next we are going to add the header tools and authentication modal blocks to the page.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,420
Our focus should be on these two blocks.

39
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,440
Upon selecting the authentication modal block, we can toggle the show register attributes for this

40
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,010
course.

41
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,710
We are going to enable the registration form.

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,860
As for the header tools blocks, the log and link is enabled after making those changes.

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,210
Save the page.

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,650
There's not much else to the authentication modal block.

45
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,870
We are going to have a single setting in the next set of lectures.

46
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,700
We are going to work on making the log in and registration forms functional.

47
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,860
This is where things are going to start getting challenging when you're ready.

48
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll see you in the next lecture.
