1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,310
In this lecture, we will review the other settings for enabling or disabling typography features.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,730
There's not much to say.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,770
Let's quickly run through them in your editor.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,470
Open the theme JSON file.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,610
All settings will be applied to the typography object under these settings object.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,900
The first setting that can be toggled is line height.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,770
The value for this property must be a boolean.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,470
Let's set it to true.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,620
This setting will allow users to modify the line height see property most blocks with typography settings

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,830
can have their line height modified by default.

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,700
Customizing the line height is disabled.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,900
Up next, let's add a property called drop cap with a value of true.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,970
The Drop Camp property will enable the option of enlarging the first letter of a paragraph.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,980
Currently, the paragraph block is the only block that supports this option.

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,600
Afterward, we can enable the font weight option by setting it to true.

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,220
The font weight refers to the text thickness.

17
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,960
Next, let's add the font style property with a value of true.

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,680
The font style property allows users to add italic text.

19
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,760
The next property on our list is called text transform.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,580
The value for this property will be true.

21
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,450
This property will change text casing such as uppercase, lowercase or capitalization or almost finished.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,360
The spacing between letters can be enabled by setting the letter spacing property to true.

23
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:55,180
Lastly underlines and strike thrus can be enabled by adding the text decoration property with a value

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,960
of true.

25
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,500
To be clear, most of these settings are already enabled.

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,900
Setting them to true is redundant.

27
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,550
However, I'm including them.

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,130
For example purposes.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,660
Let's check out the ED in the browser.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,140
The best way to test our settings is by adding a paragraph block to our template.

31
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,900
The paragraph block has support for all typography settings under the sidebar.

32
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,870
You should be able to find the typography settings.

33
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,480
Initially, most settings may be hidden.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,460
You can toggle their appearances under the more menu item from this list.

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:39,050
We can modify the line height, letter, case, letter, spacing and drop cap.

36
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:45,490
As you can see, WordPress provides us with plenty of options for modifying the appearance of our text.

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,020
Keep in mind these settings can be modified on a block level too.

38
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,050
These typography settings should cover most use cases.

39
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,160
We're almost finished with our discussion of typography.

40
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,710
I'll see you in the next lecture.
