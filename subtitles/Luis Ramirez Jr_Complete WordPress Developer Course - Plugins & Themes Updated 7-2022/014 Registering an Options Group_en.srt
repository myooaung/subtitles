1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,019
In this lecture, we will register our option with a group.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,400
To understand why, let's look at the pages created by WordPress.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,270
For example, I'm viewing the page for the general settings.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,000
On this page we have multiple fields.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,350
Each field can modify a specific record from the database.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,950
If you were to look through the WP options table, most of the records contain a single value.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,240
WordPress does not know how to group options for a single page.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,790
We must teach WordPress what group of options it can modify from a page.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,220
This is known as an options group.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,750
Technically, we have a single record containing our plugins options.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,180
They're spread across multiple records.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,750
Regardless, the first step for using the Settings API is to register our option with a group.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,030
Let's get started in your editor.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,850
Open the indexed PHP file.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,790
At the bottom of the file.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,970
Add an action hook called admin in it.

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,870
WordPress has a hook during the initialization step of the admin dashboard.

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,410
We must register our option group during this hook.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,610
The name of our function will be called up settings API.

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,270
Next, let's define this function inside the include slash admin folder.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,330
Create a file called Settings API php.

22
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,780
Inside this file, define the up settings api function.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,400
Afterward run a function called register setting.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,560
This function will register an option with a group.

25
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,460
The first argument is the name of the group.

26
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,070
The name of our group can be anything we want.

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,140
Let's set the name to Up Options Group.

28
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:04,630
Next, we must register a single option with this group by passing in the options name as the second

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,440
argument.

30
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,650
The name of our option was called up options.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,690
If you have multiple options, this function must be called for each option.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,780
For example, let's say we had an option called B, we would call this function like so.

33
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,130
The second invocation of this function would belong to the same group.

34
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,370
However, the second argument would register the second option.

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,230
In our case, we only have one option.

36
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,920
So calling this function once is more than enough.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:46,480
After registering our option with a group, we can render this group in our form open the options page.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,700
Alt dot php file.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,500
Inside the div tag.

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,000
Add a form tag.

41
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,960
On this tag set the method attribute to post.

42
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,600
Next set the action attribute to options, not PHP.

43
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,410
Here's a huge difference between the Settings API and manually creating a form for modifying options.

44
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,920
Forms created with the Settings API must send data to the options php file.

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,900
This file is dedicated to handling form submissions for the settings API.

46
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:34,400
If we're creating a form without this API, the data must be sent to the admin post's PHP file.

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,810
Inside this form, let's run a function called settings fields.

48
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,160
This function will tell the options php file which option group will be modified by this form?

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,360
This function has one argument which is the name of the options group.

50
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,580
Let's pass in the name of our group.

51
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,810
This step is very important.

52
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,340
Otherwise, WordPress will not know what options group to modify.

53
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,520
After registering our option with a group, we can begin rendering the sections and fields in the next

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,570
set of lectures.

55
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,630
We will finish our form with the Settings API.
