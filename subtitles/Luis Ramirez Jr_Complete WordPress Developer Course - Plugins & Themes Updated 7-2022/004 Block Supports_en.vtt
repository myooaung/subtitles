00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.790
In this lecture, we are going to explore additional features that can be applied to our blocks.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.540
WordPress has dozens of blocks with similar features.

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.220
For example, blocks can be aligned to take up the width of the page.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
It's redundant to recode these features for each block to avoid repetitive code.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.160
WordPress has a list of features that can be applied to any block.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.770
This saves us the time of recreating these features for our block.

7
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.520
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to the BLOCK Support Documentation page.

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.810
We can enable features for our block by updating the block file.

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.930
The various features are documented on this page.

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.500
We won't have a chance to go through every single feature.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.950
However, you're more than welcome to explore them after finishing this section, there are two features

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.300
we are going to look at.

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.930
The first feature is disabling HTML from our block.

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.810
Let's look at an example in another tab.

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.190
I have added the alert box block to the page on the toolbar.

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
There's an option for modifying the block with HTML by default.

17
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.480
This option is available for all blocks.

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.520
This feature can be dangerous.

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.690
Users can easily break a block by modifying the HTML.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.820
This option can be disabled.

21
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.910
Let's disable this option for our block.

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.570
Another feature will implement in our block is wide aligning the block blocks can take up the entire

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.950
width of the page.

24
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.650
This option is available from the toolbar.

25
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.870
By default, it's disabled.

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.470
I think our block should support wide alignment.

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.890
Let's try supporting these features in your editor.

28
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.500
Open the block dot json file.

29
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.500
At the bottom of the file at an object called supports.

30
00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.610
Inside this object, we can add a list of features to enable the HTML feature can be disabled by setting

31
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.130
the HTML option to false.

32
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.520
Next, let's add an option called a line with an initial value of true.

33
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.120
By setting the align option to true all alignment options will be enabled.

34
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.670
This means a block can be aligned left, center, right, wide and full.

35
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.270
You may not be interested in supporting all alignment options.

36
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.730
For example, we can limit the alignment to full by adding this option to the array.

37
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.620
Our block can support all alignments.

38
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.490
We don't need to use an array.

39
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.120
I'm going to revert this option to the original value.

40
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.020
There are more features we can enable, but let's keep it simple.

41
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.750
There's one more thing I want to mention before we test our work.

42
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.500
Open the style CSS file.

43
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.360
WordPress will add a class for the current alignment option.

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.690
We can select this attribute with our CSS.

45
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.100
In the CSS.

46
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.720
I'm selecting the element.

47
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.290
If the full option is selected, if the block is fully aligned against the page, this option will be

48
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.760
applied to our block.

49
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.380
And this example, I'm removing the border radius from the block.

50
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.590
Let's check out the block by refreshing the page.

51
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.680
Next.

52
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.890
And the alert box block to the page.

53
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.070
If we click on the toolbar, the option to edit the block with HTML is gone.

54
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.170
In addition, the alignment options have been added to the block without doing anything else.

55
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.550
These options are automatically available on our block.

56
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.370
We do not need to manage these values.

57
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.360
Keep in mind that the alignment option will not work on the front end.

58
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.410
The page has a sidebar which does not allow for full width.

59
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.700
In the next lecture, let's talk about variations for blocks.
