00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.060
In this lecture, I have an exercise for you.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.920
Open graph images have a recommended size of 1200 by 630.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.710
If the user selects an image, the size should match these dimensions as an exercise.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.410
Try creating a new custom image size.

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.610
With these dimensions, we've registered a new image size before.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.830
The steps will be exactly the same.

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.840
Pause the video and give it a try.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.740
Good luck.

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.140
Welcome back.

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.900
Hopefully you are able to add a new custom image size.

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.680
If not, let's go through the solution together first.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.340
Open the setup php file.

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
A new image size can be registered by calling the add image size function.

14
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.640
Let's call this function with the following arguments.

15
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.550
Open graph 1200 630.

16
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.240
True.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.780
The name of our custom image is called Open Graph.

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.100
Keep that in mind for the next step.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.600
The image may not be exposed via the rest API.

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.200
As we learned, WordPress requires explicit permission before exposing this information to the user.

21
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.740
Open the image sizes php file.

22
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.060
In this file, we modified the filter to add our image size to the response in the array.

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.190
Add the open graph size.

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.470
The value of this option will be the following translatable text open graph.

25
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.020
There's one more step before moving on.

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.740
The new image size will only apply to new images.

27
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.960
We should regenerate our images in the browser.

28
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.740
Navigate to the Regenerate Thumbnails page from the admin dashboard.

29
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.130
Start regenerating the images.

30
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.940
After the images are finished regenerating, you can move on to the next lecture.

31
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.760
We're going to begin selecting the image from the media library.

32
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.110
I'll see you there.
