00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,090
In this lecture, we are going to shift our focus back to the index template.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,939
We've spent a lot of time working on the header.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,210
The rest of the template is still relying on the HTML block.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,110
Our next goal is to begin displaying the list of posts.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,430
Before doing so.

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,380
Let's check out the design.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,930
At its most basic level, the main content area comprises two columns.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,220
On the left column.

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,370
We have a list of posts on the right column.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:36,510
We have a random set of blocks for displaying the sites, tags, categories and highly rated posts.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,280
It's a standard layout.

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,940
WordPress has a block for creating a column layout.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,630
We don't need to resort to the group or row blocks.

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,560
The column block will be more than suitable for creating the layout.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,940
Let's get started.

16
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,170
As usual.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,690
Here's a simplified version of the template.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:03,110
For reference you can open the index HTML file to view the markup for the columns.

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,510
You can find the main content area under a comment that says main content.

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:13,470
The main tag acts as a container for the columns on this tag.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,630
We're applying various classes for creating a column layout.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,690
However, since the columns block can generate the same design, we could omit some classes.

23
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,020
To be specific, we are going to add the container and auto classes.

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,830
The rest can be left out.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,250
These classes will center the columns on the page.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,600
Inside the main tags, we have two sets of div tags.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,960
They're responsible for separating the column content.

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:49,970
The first div tag has a class called Span two, which will set the width of the first column to 70%.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,230
Once again, this class can be avoided since a columns whip can be configured through WordPress block

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,100
settings.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,420
In our editor, we are going to insert the columns block after the header area.

32
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,539
It'll sit at the root level of the document.

33
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,290
Next, we are going to be presented with various column options for this template.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,210
We are going to select the 7030 option after selecting this option.

35
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,200
The columns block will provide two columns.

36
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,990
You can begin adding blocks to either column.

37
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,040
That's great.

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,470
If you were to view the list sidebar, your list of blocks should be similar to mine.

39
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,970
Similar to before.

40
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,000
We are going to leave the HTML block alone.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,930
Once we're finished with the block template, it'll be removed.

42
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,900
For now, it'll be helpful as a reference.

43
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,190
The next step is to apply the classes to the columns block.

44
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,610
This block is not to be confused with a single column.

45
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,660
Before applying these classes, you should select the parent columns block not the children column blocks

46
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,360
on the block and the following classes.

47
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,580
Container exclamation point.

48
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,960
Max auto.

49
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,250
One more thing.

50
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,190
We should add margins to the top and bottom sides of the columns under the dimensions column.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,260
Toggle the margins options.

52
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,350
The top and bottom values should be set to four REM.

53
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,480
After making those changes.

54
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,600
Let's save our templates the columns already.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,240
In the following lecture, we are going to work on the first column which is responsible for loading

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,800
the list of posts.
