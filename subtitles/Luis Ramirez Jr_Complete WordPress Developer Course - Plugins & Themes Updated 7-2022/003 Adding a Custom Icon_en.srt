1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,090
In this lecture, we will add a custom icon for our block.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,910
Throughout this course, we've been relying on word press dash icons.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,870
They're the default icon font sets available in WordPress.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,210
You may want to use your own icons.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,700
Luckily, SVG icons are supported in the resource section of this lecture.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,790
I provide a link to an SVG icon.

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,740
It's a picture of a unicorn.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,930
Truthfully, it doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,660
However, I think the icon is pretty cool.

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,580
You're more than free to use your own icon if you're not familiar with SVG.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,500
They're a format for images.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,760
Unlike other images, SVG images are written in code.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,280
Knowledge of SVG is not required.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,710
Let's copy the image to our clipboard.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,790
Make sure you're copying the code, not the image itself.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,130
Let's head back to our editor's inside the source directory.

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,490
Create a file called Icon Dot JS.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,490
I prefer to outsource my icons to separate files.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,260
This step is not required, but it can be helpful if you plan on using icons throughout your code base.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,380
You're icons can be found within a single file.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,750
Inside this file, export an object under the default namespace.

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,370
Next, create a property called Primary.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,460
This icon will be the primary icon for our blocks.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,530
Let's set the property to the SVG code of the image.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,440
SVG files can be very large.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,460
You may be wondering is it valid to store SVG like this?

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,090
Normally no JavaScript does not support SVG images.

28
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,890
However, we have web pack installed with the installation of Webpack.

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,820
Gsx is supported before this file is delivered to the browser.

30
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,570
The SVG elements will be converted into objects.

31
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,660
Our next step is to load this icon.

32
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,830
We must load the icon from the register lock type function.

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,090
Open the index js file for the search form block.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,400
At the top of the file import the icons object from the icons file.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,610
Take notice of the path to the icons file.

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,760
The file can be found in the source directory.

37
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,720
We are using two dots and a forward slash character to move up a directory.

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,380
After importing the icons, the object passed into the register block type function can be updated with

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,390
a property called icon.

40
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,340
The value for this property will be icons dot primary property.

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,180
The settings from the block file can be applied to this object.

42
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,730
The difference is that we can have dynamic values instead of hard coding the icons name.

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:07,440
Since we're adding the icon to this object, the block file can be updated to not include the icon property.

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,640
Open the block JSON file for the search form block.

45
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,830
Remove the icon property.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,710
Time to test our code in the browser.

47
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,180
Refresh the editor.

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,370
Let's search for the search form block from the sidebar.

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,460
We did it.

50
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,860
A custom icon appears for our block.

51
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,550
WordPress will handle resizing the SVG image.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,140
The recommended dimensions for an icon are 24 by 24.

53
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,970
As an exercise, let's apply this icon to the fancy header block.

54
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,030
For the rest of this course, we are going to be using the same icon for custom blocks.

55
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,010
I want you to try adding the custom icon to the fancy header block.

56
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,350
Pause the video and give it a try.

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,300
Welcome back.

58
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,360
If you were to add the custom icon, that's great.

59
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,390
If not, that's fine as well.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,540
Let's tackle the problem together.

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,870
In your editor, open the index JS file for the fancy header block.

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,140
At the top of the file import the icons object from the icons file.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,590
Next, the object can be updated with the icon by adding the icon property.

64
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,530
The value for this property will be the icons dot primary property.

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,030
Lastly, open the block json file.

66
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,980
The icon property can be safely removed from this file.

67
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,050
After making those changes.

68
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,210
Refresh the page in the browser.

69
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,800
We can search for our blocks by typing Udemy.

70
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,950
WordPress allows us to search for blocks by the value of the name property.

71
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,390
Since both blocks start with Udemy.

72
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,810
Both will appear in the search results.

73
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,650
Perfect.

74
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,470
Both blocks are using the custom icon.

75
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,130
I strongly encourage you to add custom icons.

76
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,890
They can add a premium feel to your blocks.

77
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,090
Let's continue developing our block in the next lecture.
