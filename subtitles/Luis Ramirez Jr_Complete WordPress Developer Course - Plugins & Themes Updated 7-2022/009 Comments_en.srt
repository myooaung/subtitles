00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,740
In this lecture we will cover one more feature of PHP before moving on to WordPress.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,570
It's a very simple feature called Comments.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,860
PHP comments serve the same purpose as HTML and CSS comments.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,510
They are a feature for providing notes and documentation in our code.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,450
There are two syntax for writing comments.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,960
The first syntax is called a single line comment.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,070
Single line comments are written with two forward slash characters.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,770
Single line comments apply to one line.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:37,470
If we attempted to write more text after the comments, it wouldn't be interpreted as a comment.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,670
Instead, it will be interpreted as code leading to errors.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,430
For example, above the defined function.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,590
Lets add a single line comments.

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,280
My editor highlights the text as green.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,910
Your editor may highlight it differently.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,100
Regardless, we've written a comment.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,260
Anything goes on this line, subsequent lines remain unaffected by our comment.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,670
In some cases, you may want to write a long comment.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,480
Single line comments aren't suited for this type of action.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:15,290
The second syntax is called a block comment, which allows us to write multiple lines of comments.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,580
They're written with forward, slash and asterisk characters.

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,930
Here's an example.

22
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,090
BLOCK comments when she opened and closed with the same characters.

23
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,170
In between these characters, we can write as much gibberish as we'd like.

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,630
Some developers like to add an asterisk character on every line.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,290
This does not do anything.

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,070
It's just a style preference that about does it for comments.

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,230
It's time to jump into WordPress.

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,150
See you in the next lecture.
