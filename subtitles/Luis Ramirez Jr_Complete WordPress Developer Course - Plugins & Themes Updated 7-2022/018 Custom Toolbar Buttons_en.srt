00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,840
In this lecture, we are going to add a custom toolbar button for removing an image.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,460
So far we have added the media replace flow component to render a button in the toolbar.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,870
But what if we need to output a custom button?

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,540
WordPress has you covered in your editor.

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,880
Open the editor JS file.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,600
From the components package import a component called Toolbar Button.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,820
This component will render a button for the toolbar.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,880
We can use this component to add custom behavior to our block.

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,900
It's a very simple component.

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,780
Let's scroll to the block controls component below the media replace flow component.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,550
Let's add the toolbar button component with opening and closing tags.

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,720
Inside the tags add the double underscore a function with the following translated text remove image.

13
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,120
Lastly, let's remove the image on a click event.

14
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,260
The toolbar button component supports the on click event for handling clicks.

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,200
Let's add this event to the component with an arrow function for handling the event.

16
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,980
Inside this function, we can reset the attributes with the set attributes function.

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,620
The image ID attribute will be set to zero.

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,330
The image alt and image URL attributes can be reset to empty strings.

19
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:40,310
Next, let's update the state by calling the set image preview function with an empty string.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,610
This function should be called from the select image URL function.

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,270
I forgot to update it from the previous lecture.

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,970
Scroll to this function and our function.

23
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,910
Call this function with the URL argument.

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,890
Perfect.

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,670
Our code should be functional.

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,260
There's one more adjustment than I would like to make.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,690
We have multiple buttons in the toolbar.

28
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,259
The more buttons there are in the toolbar, the more difficult it can be to read the toolbar.

29
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:17,400
For readability, we can separate our buttons by adding the group property to the block controls component.

30
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,700
The group property will surround our buttons with separators.

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,450
It's a subtle change, but will help make our buttons stand out.

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,230
The value for this property must be set to in-line.

33
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,500
Let's try testing the block by adding the team members group block to the page.

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,210
Next, try selecting an image.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,730
After selecting an image, an option will appear in the toolbar to remove it.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,790
We can click on this option to remove the image.

37
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,650
We've successfully added an option to remove the image.

38
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,520
After removing the image, the media placeholder component will reappear.

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,500
Adding a button on the toolbar is as simple as using a single component.

40
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,010
Let's continue working on our block in the next lecture.
