00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.620
In this lecture, we are going to modify the block gap settings for our theme.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870
A block gap refers to the space between blocks that are aligned side by side.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.620
In most cases, your content should have room to breathe.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.230
If elements are too close to each other, it can make your content appear cluttered.

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.070
Let's look at an example.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
The columns block is an example of a block that implements gaps.

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.990
We're going to quickly add the columns block to our templates.

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.140
The number of columns doesn't matter.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.420
As long as there are two or more columns, you're good to go inside.

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.030
All columns add an image block.

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480
We're going to add images to demonstrate the spacing between columns.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.740
As you can see, there's a gap between both images.

13
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380
The size of the gap can be configured.

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
In addition, we can enable settings for allowing users to customize this gap.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.030
We're going to enable these settings as well as increase the default gap.

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.739
Before we do, let's look at how the gap gets applied.

17
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.700
I'm going to save the post rather than inspecting the CSS in the editor.

18
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.390
We're going to view the home page of our site.

19
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.560
WordPress adds additional markup that can be confusing to look at.

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
The final output of the template will be much easier to read once you're on the home page.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.520
Inspect the images.

22
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.970
The element we're looking for is a div tag with a class called WP BLOCK columns looking closely at the

23
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.690
styles.

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.950
WordPress uses flex for creating columns.

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.250
The most important property is the Gap property.

26
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.770
This property will determine the gap between each column.

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.010
We can't remove this property, but we can override it.

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.270
Let's try configuring the Gap settings for our theme in your text.

29
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.270
Editor Open the theme JSON file.

30
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.330
First, let's enable the settings for configuring the gap in the settings object.

31
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.830
We're going to update the spacing option.

32
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.150
Add a new property called block gap with a value of true.

33
00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.810
You must enable these settings if you want to configure the gap for your theme.

34
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.670
Otherwise, WordPress will not allow you to override the value.

35
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.210
By turning this setting on, users will be allowed to customize the gap.

36
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.100
As theme developers, we should recommend a default gap.

37
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.000
I think the gap between images is too small.

38
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.190
I would like to give more breathing room to our columns.

39
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.560
Scroll to these styles object.

40
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.260
We're going to modify these facing property.

41
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060
Let's add a property called BLOCK Gap with a value of four REM.

42
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.970
The value for the gap must be a valid CSS value.

43
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.110
Configuring this value will vary from theme to theme.

44
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.100
You will need to experiment with this option for the best possible value.

45
00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.160
Let's try testing our theme by refreshing the home page.

46
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.020
Awesome.

47
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.320
The gap between images has increased.

48
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.830
We're going to keep this gap for our theme.

49
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.440
Once we start adding the template and asset files, this is going to come out great for our theme.

50
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.920
We're finished with our discussion of the layout settings for WordPress.

51
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800
Let's wrap up our discussion in the next lecture.
