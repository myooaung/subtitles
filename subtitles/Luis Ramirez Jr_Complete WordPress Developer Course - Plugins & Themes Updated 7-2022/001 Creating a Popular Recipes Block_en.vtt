00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.500
In this section, we are going to begin working on our next two blocks.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.460
Both blocks will involve querying the database for recipes.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
The first block will display a list of popular recipes.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.600
Clients will have the option of fine tuning their results to specific cuisines or limiting the number

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.070
of posts in the block.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.500
The ultimate goal is to provide a list of popular recipes based on ratings.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.520
As usual, I have provided starter files for this block.

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.490
Check out the resource section of this lecture.

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.540
You know the drill.

10
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.820
Create these files in your project.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
The name of the block should be called Popular Recipes.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.370
Pause the video and give it a try.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.570
I'll do the same.

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.790
Welcome back.

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.010
Let's go through the files together.

16
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.630
In my project, I have a directory called Popular Recipes with three files.

17
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.610
The block JSON file contains the typical configuration settings.

18
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.540
There are three attributes for storing the title of the block post count and an array of cuisines.

19
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.220
Nothing special so far.

20
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.910
Let's switch over to the index dot js file.

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.980
In this file we're importing components and functions to help us build our block.

22
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.730
If we scroll to the blocks templates, we are adding the inspector controls and panel body components

23
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.260
to add a sidebar.

24
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.600
Currently the sidebar is empty after the inspector controls component.

25
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.940
We are rendering the title and post.

26
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.340
The post will be represented by a div tag with a class called Single Post.

27
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.860
We are going to loop through this element to render a list of posts for each post.

28
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.520
We will render the post image title and author.

29
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.460
Overall, we have a basic block set up.

30
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.130
Let's register the block before moving on.

31
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.850
Open the register blocks dot php file.

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.460
In the blocks away at another array for the popular recipes.

33
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.050
BLOCK The name option should be set to popular recipes.

34
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.520
Next, let's add the options key.

35
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.310
Rendering posts is a dynamic action.

36
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.450
If a post's image is modified, the block should reflect those changes.

37
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.870
For this reason, we are going to use server side rendering.

38
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.370
Let's set the render callback option to up popular recipes.

39
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.180
CB.

40
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.270
Next let's create a PHP file for this function inside the includes slash block's directory.

41
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.140
Create a file called popular recipes dot php.

42
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.970
Define the up popular recipes CB function.

43
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.520
Lastly, insert the output buffer code snippet.

44
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.710
Everything is ready.

45
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.140
Let's begin working on our block in the next set of lectures.
