00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,360
In this lecture, we are going to add the blocks for the post template and the past few lectures we've

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,300
been adding blocks one by one to save time.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,130
We are going to add everything.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,520
After adding the blocks, we will move on to styling them.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,950
This will make the process go by faster.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,430
Let's get started to get an idea of what we'll need.

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,680
Let's study the post templates.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,550
Design.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,190
The layout of the post is complex.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,780
If you think about it, we have two columns of data on the left column.

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,810
We have the author's profile, image, author, name, post title and post date.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,690
On the right column we have the post image tags, comment, count and excerpt.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,680
To achieve this layout, let's try adding the columns block.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,030
In each column, we can add blocks for loading each piece of data.

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,380
Let's give it a try.

16
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,430
Switch over to the block editor under the post template.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,490
BLOCK We are going to add the columns block.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,720
Keep in mind, the blocks for rendering content should be children of this block.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,320
The block is responsible for rendering the content of each post in the array of posts.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
Next, let's move this block to the top of the template.

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,750
The editor will ask us to select a preset of options for our theme.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,610
The column widths should be 33% and 66% respectively.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,140
If this option is unavailable, the widths must be set manually.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,390
Select the 5050 option.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,600
After doing so, select the first column block from the list on the settings sidebar.

26
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,650
Set the width to 33.33%.

27
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,240
Next, let's update the width for the second column.

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,590
The width should be set to 66.66%.

29
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,670
Perfect.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,940
We can start moving on to adding blocks to each column.

31
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,949
As we discussed before, the left column should have the author's profile, image, author, name,

32
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:12,310
title and date inside the first column.

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,680
Insert the post author block.

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,130
This block will render the author's image and name afterward.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,020
Let's move the title and date blocks into the first column.

36
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,100
They should sit below the author.

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,950
The order does matter.

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,450
Otherwise, our template styles will not work.

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,730
Make sure the order of your blocks matches mine.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,910
Once you've got that confirmed, let's begin adding blocks to the second column.

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,770
The second column contains the post, image tags, comment counts and excerpt.

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,300
WordPress has blocks for each of these sections.

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,450
First, let's add the post featured image block.

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,300
Next we need to add the tags and comment counts before doing so.

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,820
Let's check out the front end one more time.

46
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,380
If we look closely at this part of the template, these elements sit on the same row.

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,970
Unlike the other blocks.

48
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,450
We can't stack these blocks without grouping them, otherwise they will not be able to sit in the same

49
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,020
row.

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,020
We have a few options at our disposal.

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,860
The row group and columns blocks are viable.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,490
These blocks will allow us to achieve the same layout.

53
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,490
For this example, let's go with the row block.

54
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:40,390
I think it offers enough features for creating this layout back in the editor at the row block to the

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,500
second column.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,490
Inside the row block.

57
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,040
Insert the post tags block.

58
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,770
Lastly, insert the post comments count block.

59
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,360
We're almost finished.

60
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,320
There's one more block to add, which is the excerpt.

61
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,930
The excerpt will appear below the row.

62
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,870
Insert the Post Excerpt BLOCK.

63
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,530
While the layout is ready, all that's left is to apply styles to the blocks to consider our template

64
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,630
complete before moving on.

65
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,209
Let's save the templates.

66
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,050
After saving your template, let's begin styling the blocks in the next lecture.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
Also you there.
