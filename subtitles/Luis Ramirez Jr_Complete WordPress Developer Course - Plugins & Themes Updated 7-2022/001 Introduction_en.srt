00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,780
Welcome to the WordPress development course.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,860
I'm super glad to have you on board.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,180
WordPress is the most popular content management system in the world.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,900
I've been working with WordPress for over a decade.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,810
My goal is to transfer all my knowledge of WordPress to you, whether your goal is to become a professional

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,940
developer or start your own site.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,490
I'm here to guide you every step of the way.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,590
Once we're finished, you'll be able to call yourself a professional WordPress developer.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,070
I know you're antsy to get started, but before jumping in, let's make sure we're on the same page.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,360
First things first.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,160
What can you expect to learn?

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,570
Like I said before, my goal is to help you become a WordPress developer.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,020
This means we're going to create custom themes and plugins.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,320
We will cover topics from post types to extending the rest API with custom endpoints.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,980
Other topics include translations, block development, custom database tables, transients, data,

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,710
sanitisation, optimizing code, etc. Not a single stone will be left unturned.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,350
WordPress provides a strong foundation for developing any type of site.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,220
Various tools and techniques will be explored to tackle the most common situations a WordPress developer

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,240
will encounter.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,580
I have designed this course to be accessible to most skill levels.

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,270
We With that being said, there are some prerequisites for taking this course.

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,300
Firstly, you should be able to handle basic WordPress administrative tasks without a problem.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,900
If I ask you to install a fresh site, upload a plugin or create a post, that shouldn't be a problem.

24
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,480
This course is not about performing basic administrative tasks, it's about programming.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,400
Secondly, you should have a solid understanding of HTML and CSS.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,930
WordPress utilizes four languages which are HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript.

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
Covering these languages would take dozens of hours.

28
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,140
As you can see, this course is already quite lengthy to keep the course from becoming too long.

29
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,560
I've excluded the basics of HTML and CSS.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
You are expected to know these languages.

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,960
As for PHP and JavaScript, it's entirely optional to know them.

32
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,080
If you have experience with programming, that's great.

33
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,690
This course shouldn't be a challenge for you.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,700
For the rest of you, if you're not.

35
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,880
I have sections dedicated to these languages.

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,940
Not only will you learn these languages, but you will be able to apply them to WordPress development

37
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,930
practically.

38
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,910
We're almost at the finish line.

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,790
Two more things before jumping into the course.

40
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,740
From my experience, videos can be a great way to learn a new topic.

41
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,230
Being able to follow along with someone is an extremely valuable experience.

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,400
However, revisiting topics can be a burden along the way.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
You may forget some things that's perfectly normal.

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,710
Scrubbing through a video to revisit a fundamental concept can be tedious.

45
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,820
For that reason, I've included a free PDF with this course.

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,230
It summarizes the key concepts discussed in each lecture.

47
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,070
I highly recommend downloading it for your convenience.

48
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,430
Humans can read faster than they can watch videos.

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,250
It's also a great way to review a lecture.

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,340
After watching a video, the free PDF book can be downloaded in the following lecture.

51
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:34,560
Last but not least, feel free to ask me questions related to the course.

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,980
I'd be lying if I said you wouldn't encounter problems.

53
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,540
Programming is hard.

54
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,930
Don't be afraid to ask for help in the Q&A section.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,000
If you have questions, typically I will respond within 48 hours.

56
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,410
I can only respond to questions that are specific to the course.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,280
Often students will ask for help with their personal projects.

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,820
Unfortunately, I can't provide guidance or consultation for personal projects, especially if you offer

59
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,360
money.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,380
WordPress is an extensive tool with a large community.

61
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,360
I can't cover every topic.

62
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,850
I will try my best to cover the most common topics in WordPress development.

63
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,740
I can't wait to get started.

64
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
