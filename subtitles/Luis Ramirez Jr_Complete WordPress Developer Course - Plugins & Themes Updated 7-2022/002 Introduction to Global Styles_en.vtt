00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.540
In this lecture, we are going to start extending the full site editor by adding global styles.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.790
Global styles are a beta feature.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.220
It's getting closer to coming out of beta.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.710
The idea is to allow users to modify a site styles on a global level.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.830
Let's look at an example in your browser.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
Navigate to the WordPress dashboard on the sidebar.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.160
Navigate to Appearance Editor.

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.660
This link will bring us to the full site editor at the top right corner.

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.840
There's going to be a button called Styles if you click on it.

10
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.870
The Global Styles sidebar will pop up.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.170
Initially, the sidebar will allow us to modify the typography and colors of a theme.

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.350
For example, let's try changing the color of the backgrounds.

13
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.050
The changes are going to apply on a global level.

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.170
As you can see, the entire page has changed its background color.

15
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.620
I'm going to clear this change.

16
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.810
We can fine tune our changes to specific blocks.

17
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.410
For example, I'm going to add additional paragraphs to the templates.

18
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.920
Next, I'll head back to the initial section of the sidebar towards the bottom of the sidebar.

19
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.690
There's going to be an option for manipulating a specific set of blocks.

20
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.960
WordPress will provide a list of blocks that can be modified as a group.

21
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.040
Let's try modifying the paragraph block by changing the background color.

22
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.890
By changing the background colour, all paragraph blocks are affected.

23
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.970
Global styles are a very powerful feature.

24
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.550
They empower users to modify the appearance of a theme without programming knowledge.

25
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.240
While convenient, you may want to extend or restrict this behavior.

26
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.630
Luckily, WordPress doesn't leave us powerless.

27
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.250
Theme developers can extend the global styles with a single file.

28
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.889
Let's switch over to our editor.

29
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.060
Inside our themes folder, we are going to create a file called Theme JSON.

30
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.330
For those unfamiliar with JSON, JSON files are created with the JSON extension.

31
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.030
The name of our file is very important.

32
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.530
WordPress is going to look at the specific file name in our themes root directory.

33
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.370
It's completely optional to define a theme.

34
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.860
JSON file.

35
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.260
If WordPress finds this file, the settings from this file will be applied to the full site editor.

36
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.100
Inside this file, we can configure the editor by adding colors, fonts and spacing rules.

37
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.060
Additional features include enabling or disabling settings, adding custom templates and adding styles

38
00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.960
to blocks.

39
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.600
As theme developers, we can use this feature for tailoring the editing experience.

40
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.570
For example, rather than letting users pick ugly colors, we can recommend colors that will match our

41
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.260
theme.

42
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.370
This section will explore the various settings available in the theme JSON file before getting started.

43
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.230
Let's reset our template.

44
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.260
Switch back to the browser.

45
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.680
This is a good opportunity to discuss another feature of templates.

46
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.450
Users have complete freedom of modifying the base templates in our theme.

47
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.650
However, these changes do not directly affect our files.

48
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.360
For example, I'm going to save the changes I've made to the templates.

49
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.060
Next, let's open the index on HTML file in our theme.

50
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.540
WordPress does not directly modify our themes template files.

51
00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.300
Our template files are preserved and said WordPress will make a copy of our templates.

52
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.800
The copy is stored in the database.

53
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.310
Once the user changes our templates, the copy in the database will have priority over the original

54
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.030
copy.

55
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.970
This feature gives users more power.

56
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.510
In some cases, you may not like the changes made to a templates.

57
00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.829
It is entirely possible to revert the changes.

58
00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.720
Switch back to the editor.

59
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.990
At the top center of the page, we have the option of switching templates.

60
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.040
If a template has been modified, WordPress will provide the option of resetting A templates.

61
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.470
Let's revert the templates and save our changes.

62
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.820
Keep in mind, this option does not reset global styles.

63
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.980
It only reverts the locks to their original state.

64
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.960
This feature is going to come in handy throughout this course.

65
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.000
We are going to modify these templates in the editor.

66
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.720
If the editor is not accurately reflecting the template in your theme, you may want to check if WordPress

67
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.140
has a different copy by resetting the template.
