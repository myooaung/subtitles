00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.370
In this lecture, we're going to add more headers to the style CSS file.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.460
Technically, we could move on to adding the template.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.010
However, we should be professional.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.360
I don't think it would be a good look to only have the name appear on WordPress.

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.010
We should add more information.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.530
Let's switch over to our editors.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.330
We're going to continue working inside the style CSS file.

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.229
Before you move further, I recommend pointing your editor to the Udemy theme folder.

9
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.020
I've already done that before starting this lecture.

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.070
We're not going to need to view the other files in WordPress.

11
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.060
Our focus will be on the theme for the rest of this section.

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.040
Pause the video if you need to.

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.190
Once you've got that done, let's begin adding file headers inside the style CSS file.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.410
We're going to add another property called theme URI.

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.790
The value for this property should be the URL for the theme.

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.520
Normally, developers will point to a URL where the theme can be downloaded or bought.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.980
We're not going to be selling this theme, therefore we'll set the URL to Udemy.

18
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.870
Up next, we need to revive the name of the author with the author property.

19
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.340
The author is the creator of the theme.

20
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.820
If you're on a team, you may put the name of your team.

21
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.390
I'm going to set this option to you.

22
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.930
To me.

23
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.060
Afterward.

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.770
We have the author, you or I?

25
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.600
Property.

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.710
This property should be set to the author's site.

27
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.150
I'm going to set this property to the following URL.

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.830
HTTPS colon.

29
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.230
Slash, slash, youtube.com.

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.440
Let's add a description by adding a property called description.

31
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.150
The description for your theme should be short and concise.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.910
All right, the following description of our theme.

33
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.700
A simple WordPress theme.

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.540
The next property is called tags.

35
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.060
We have the option of uploading our theme to the official repository of themes on WordPress.

36
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.420
We can help users find our theme by defining a list of tags.

37
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.740
Tags are words or phrases we can associate with our theme.

38
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.320
Each tag is separated with a comma.

39
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.710
If you plan on uploading your theme to WordPress dot org, this piece of information is important.

40
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.750
We won't be uploading this theme to WordPress.

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.620
It's safe to exclude this header property.

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.370
Moving along the version property is the current version of this theme.

43
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.490
This option should be regularly updated whenever your theme receives updates.

44
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.750
We are creating a brand new theme.

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.130
The version number will be set to 1.0.

46
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.140
Next we have the requires at least property.

47
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.210
We were allowed to set the minimum WordPress version.

48
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.420
You may want to set this option if your theme requires newer features of WordPress.

49
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.270
If someone attempts to install our theme with an incompatible version of WordPress, an error will be

50
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.170
thrown at them.

51
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.080
We will leave this option at 5.9.

52
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.290
Subsequently we have b tested up to property.

53
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.540
This option will let the user know which version of WordPress the theme was tested on.

54
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.660
We should always set this property to the latest version.

55
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.520
It will assure users the theme is compatible with the latest version of WordPress.

56
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.510
We're going to set this option to the current version of WordPress we have installed in our environment.

57
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.900
You can refer to local for the current version.

58
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.210
Up next we have the requires PHP property.

59
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.310
As we've learned, wordpress is compatible with older versions of PHP such as version 5.6.

60
00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.590
This property should be set to the minimum PHP version required for a theme to be functional.

61
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.650
Everything we write will be compatible with versions eight and up.

62
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.340
WordPress will throw an error if a theme is installed on an older version of PHP.

63
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.529
The next two properties are called license and License URI.

64
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.079
It's optional to add these properties.

65
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.800
Typically, developers will use the new license, which is the same license used by WordPress.

66
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.440
I recommend consulting with a lawyer for the best possible license for your theme.

67
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.720
There's a lot of information online about licenses.

68
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.510
Since we're not going to be making this theme public, we are not going to add these file headers.

69
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.840
The last property is called text domain.

70
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.400
The text domain is very important in regards to translations.

71
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.590
You can think of the text domain as a unique ID for our translations.

72
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.480
It's common practice to set the text domain to the same name as your folder.

73
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.820
In our case, we're going to set it to you.

74
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.360
To me.

75
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.270
Translating a theme and plugging is a topic we'll cover in a separate section.

76
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.110
Don't worry if you don't fully understand what this setting is for.

77
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:21.340
The first step for translating a theme is to set the text domain property in the file header.

78
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.070
It'll help WordPress identify our translations.

79
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.180
That does it for the file header.

80
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.090
After the file header, we have complete liberty to add additional information.

81
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.820
WordPress will not grab this information.

82
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.070
You can write gibberish if you'd like.

83
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.750
Typically developers like to add nodes for other devs who might need to extend the theme.

84
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.150
WordPress will not bother scanning this part of the file.

85
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.120
We're finished.

86
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.700
Let's refresh the admin dashboard.

87
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.520
We can click on the theme again.

88
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.170
This time WordPress is displaying the information from our file header.

89
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.580
It was able to scan the style dot CSS file, extract information and display it.

90
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.250
As you can tell so far.

91
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.650
WordPress handles a lot for us.

92
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.250
There's one last thing I want to do before I end this lecture.

93
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.300
While not required, WordPress will search for a file called screenshot PAG.

94
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280
The image should provide a preview of your theme.

95
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.610
Alternatively, you can display the name of the theme.

96
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.260
It's completely up to you.

97
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.410
In the resource section I provide a screenshot you can use for our theme.

98
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.480
Download it.

99
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.360
After downloading the image, let's upload it to the Udemy theme directory.

100
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.980
Lastly, refresh the page.

101
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.420
The box for the theme will show the image perfect.

102
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.210
The image should be a screenshot of your theme, but an image with a logo works to the recommended dimensions

103
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.180
of your image should be 1200 by 900.

104
00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.760
It's the recommended size by WordPress.

105
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.100
The name of the file should be called screenshot pag.

106
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.380
Let's recap what we've learned.

107
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.260
WordPress will retrieve a list of themes installed in our app.

108
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.940
Themes must be defined in the WP content themes folder.

109
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.220
Each theme should have its own folder.

110
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.390
WordPress will search for a file called Style CSS.

111
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.330
It will scan and extract the contents of the file.

112
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.750
The information in the header will be presented to the user.

113
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.890
That's about it.

114
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.430
In the next lecture we'll continue developing our theme.
