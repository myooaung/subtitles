1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,010
In this lecture, we are going to start applying colors to specific blocks.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,210
So far, users have had to select their preferred colors for each block.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,400
It would be nice if we could set a default color.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,440
WordPress allows us to configure the default colors through the theme dot JSON file.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,420
Open this file in your editor.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,200
Next, let's add a new property at the root level of the object.

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,830
The name of the new property will be called Styles.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,850
Let's hover our mouse over this property to read the description.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:44,990
Organized way to set CSS properties styles in the top level will be added in the body selector.

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,140
As its name suggests, this property is an object of styles that we can apply to our theme.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,810
This option gives us the opportunity to configure the styles, values for different elements and blocks.

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,860
Users will be able to tweak these settings.

13
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,000
You should view these styles as a starting point for our theme.

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,840
To get started, let's change the text color of our theme.

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,100
At the moment, the text color is pure black, in my opinion.

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,100
I prefer a text color in the gray ish area.

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,280
Luckily, we have nine great colors in our theme.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,310
Let's try using them in the settings object.

19
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,080
Search for a gray color.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,620
I'm going to use the Udemy Gray 700 color.

21
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,990
Copy the value to your clipboard.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,740
Next back in the Styles object at a property called Color.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,890
The colour object is where we can modify the colours of our page since we're not modifying a specific

24
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,500
block.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,380
This property will affect the colour of the entire document.

26
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,580
We can change the text colour by adding the text property.

27
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's set it to our copied value.

28
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,830
Next, let's try viewing the editor in the browser.

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,419
At the moment we have a site title block let's try adding a paragraph.

30
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,780
BLOCK Otherwise we won't be able to properly view the changes.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,020
After adding a paragraph block.

32
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,850
Try inspecting the element.

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,370
The colour should have been applied through the color property.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,740
WordPress will add the property to a selector called Editor Styles wrapper.

35
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,290
This solution works, but we can take it a step further.

36
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,570
Rather than hard coding the color.

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,660
Let's try using a variable.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,330
The color already exists as a variable under the elements panel.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,150
Click on the body element to inspect its properties.

40
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:53,450
If you scroll through the properties, you should come across a long list of CSS variables.

41
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,010
In fact, you'll be able to find our custom colours.

42
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,390
The names are slightly different.

43
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,370
WordPress will extract the colours from the theme JSON file.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,690
These colours will be added to WordPress as list of variables.

45
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,210
All variables are prefixed with the WP preset colour keyword.

46
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,870
Therefore we can find our text colour under the variable called WP preset colour.

47
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,000
You grey 700.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,760
Lets copy the entire variable name.

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,150
Before updating our file, let's check out the other variables.

50
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,440
WordPress will create variables for gradients and duotone.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,650
For example, if you scroll through the list, you'll find our summer dog gradient.

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,470
Unlike colors, the prefix for a gradient is WP preset gradient.

53
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,480
For dual tones, the preset is WP preset duotone.

54
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,560
Under this list you should be able to find the pink sunset.

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,490
Duotone.

56
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:04,700
All right, let's try updating our theme back in the editor.

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,080
Replace the hardcoded value for the text color with our variable.

58
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,560
The variable should be wrapped with the var function.

59
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,339
It's completely valid to use variables after making those changes.

60
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,860
Lets view the editor.

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,490
You may need to add a paragraph element before inspecting the colour.

62
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,840
Once more.

63
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,210
Looking through the properties, the colour property is being set to our variable.

64
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,190
Perfect.

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,670
Of course, users are not restricted to our colours.

66
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,770
They have the option of changing the text colour.

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,550
Open the global styles sidebar.

68
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,260
If we were to look at the colour section, we're going to notice something different.

69
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,850
Previously, WordPress did not preselect a colour.

70
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,510
However, by setting the colour in our theme, the colour is preselected.

71
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,520
WordPress is smart enough to detect that the colour is part of our preset.

72
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,090
These changes are not exclusive to the back end.

73
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,030
The front end of our site has been modified to.

74
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,010
Lets check out the home page.

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,960
Next, let's view the body tags CSS properties with the developer tools.

76
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,470
As you can see, the color gets applied to the front.

77
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:38,230
WordPress is more than capable of modifying our document styles in the front end and back end.

78
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,740
We were able to accomplish this action without writing a single line of PHP.

79
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,850
There's one more thing I want to talk about before ending this lecture.

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,490
Let's try changing the background color.

81
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,410
Switch back to your editor.

82
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,680
Inside the color object, we can add another property called background similar to the text property.

83
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,470
The value for this property can be a valid CSS color value.

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,370
For our background, we're going to set the color to white.

85
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,940
Luckily, we have a color in our variables that stores the color white.

86
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Set the property to the following value.

87
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,650
Var WP preset color u white.

88
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,710
Let's refresh the front end.

89
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,120
Under the developer tools, the background color property has been added.

90
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,600
WordPress makes it incredibly easy to add default values for the background and text color.

91
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,230
In the next lecture, let's continue exploring the various options at our disposal for applying colors

92
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,250
to blocks.
