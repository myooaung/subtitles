00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.390
In this lecture we are going to add a custom image size in my browser.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.310
I have a copy of the team members block.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.730
For each team member we have a profile image.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.250
The dimensions of this image are 56.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.600
By 56, WordPress will create copies of our images.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000
These copies have different sizes.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
By default, WordPress creates four copies.

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
The sizes are called original, large, medium and thumbnail.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.400
As you can imagine, WordPress creates copies of our images in different sizes for optimization.

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.830
If we don't need to load the full sized image, we can load a smaller version of the image.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.030
Unfortunately, none of these sizes are suitable for our block.

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
While not required, there are a lot of benefits to creating a custom image size.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.820
The smaller the image, the smaller the file size.

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.580
Thus our pages will load faster.

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.680
I think it would be a good idea to create a custom image size for our block.

16
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.459
Adding a new image size is easy in your editor.

17
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.160
Open the indexed PHP file.

18
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.350
New image sizes must be registered during a specific hook called After Setup Theme.

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.930
Let's call the add action function with this hook.

20
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.750
This hook runs after the theme files have been loaded.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.150
As a reminder, plugins run earlier than themes.

22
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.890
We must wait for the theme to be ready before registering a new size.

23
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.350
Otherwise, we may run into issues.

24
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.970
Next, let's set the name of the function to up setup theme.

25
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.070
This function doesn't exist.

26
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.080
Let's work on defining it inside the included directory.

27
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.020
Create a file called setup PHP.

28
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.630
Inside this file.

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.520
Define the up setup theme function.

30
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.530
Afterward run a function called add image size.

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.070
The ad image size function will register a new image size for new images.

32
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.300
WordPress will create an additional copy of the image with the dimensions specified in this function.

33
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.090
This function has four arguments which are name, width, height and crop values.

34
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.140
The name of our custom size can be anything.

35
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.900
Let's set the name to team member.

36
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.710
Next, set the width and height to 56.

37
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.160
The fourth argument can be used for configuring the crop settings.

38
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.800
Images may not be able to maintain their ratios during the resizing process.

39
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.190
In these cases, WordPress will crop the image.

40
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.150
We can crop the image from the center corner or edges and the resource section of this lecture I provide

41
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
a link to an article on the cropping process.

42
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.370
This page provides an overview of the various cropping values that can be passed into the fourth argument

43
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.630
of the ad image size function.

44
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.740
WordPress is very flexible.

45
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.700
We can crop the image from various locations for our purposes cropping.

46
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.450
The image from the center will be the best option.

47
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.290
Let's head back to the editor.

48
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.680
We can crop an image from the center by passing in.

49
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.370
True.

50
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.230
Feel free to explore the other options.

51
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.400
In most cases, cropping from the centre is the best way to go.

52
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.760
After registering the image size, we can begin installing a plugin in the admin dashboard.

53
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.270
Navigate to the add new page for plugins.

54
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.860
The new image science will be applied to fresh uploads.

55
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.400
But what if this plugin was installed on an existing site?

56
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.590
It's possible that a site may have hundreds of existing images.

57
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.500
These images will not be available in our custom size.

58
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.450
For this case, it's common for developers to recommend a plugin called Regenerate Thumbnails.

59
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.140
Let's install and activate this plugin.

60
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.780
This plugin will force WordPress to create new image sizes, including custom sizes for all images.

61
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.730
It's a great plugin for assuming that an image will be available in our custom size on the sidebar under

62
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.810
the tools menu.

63
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.570
Click the regenerate thumbnails link.

64
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.740
This page will provide us with the option of regenerating thumbnails.

65
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.980
Let's regenerate our thumbnails.

66
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.900
This process may take a while.

67
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.950
Be patient.

68
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.270
After a few moments, the plugin should finish regenerating thumbnails for your entire site.

69
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.520
Let's try testing our image size by editing the experimental page.

70
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.240
On this page and the team members group block.

71
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.410
Lastly, try adding an image.

72
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.880
Make sure your developer tools are open.

73
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.670
Inside the console, the images info gets logged.

74
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:30.060
You can look through the object to find various pieces of information on the image search for a property

75
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.510
called Sizes.

76
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.760
This property will be an object of sizes available for an image.

77
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.690
WordPress will include its own sizes.

78
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.610
However, our custom size is not available.

79
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.820
In the next lecture, let's talk about why our custom size is not appearing in their response.
