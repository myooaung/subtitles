00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.780
In this lecture, we are going to allow clients to add images from external sources.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.510
Clients may not want to upload images to their site.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.250
They may prefer to upload their images to a different hosting platform.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.180
We should give them the option of directly linking an image.

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.850
Luckily, the media placeholder component can be configured to handle URLs in our editor open the indexed

6
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.730
JS file for the team member block.

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:39.660
Scroll to the media placeholder component on this component and an event called on select URL.

8
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.650
During the initialization of this component.

9
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.420
The component performs a check for a function to handle the on select URL event.

10
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.310
If a function is available, a new option will appear in the component for adding an image via a URL.

11
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.650
Let's pass in an arrow function.

12
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.420
This event is emitted when a URL has been submitted.

13
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.250
We can accept the URL as an argument to the function.

14
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.950
Inside the functions body, let's call the synch attributes function.

15
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.790
We are going to reset the image ID and image alt attributes to their original values.

16
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.420
Lastly, let's set the image URL attribute to the URL argument.

17
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.740
After making those changes, our block will be able to accept image URLs in the browser.

18
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.830
Refresh the Gutenberg Editor.

19
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.220
Next, add the team members group lock.

20
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.530
On the media placeholder component, we have a new option for adding a URL.

21
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.000
We can click on this option to input the URL.

22
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.640
I'm going to quickly grab an image.

23
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.600
After adding the image, the image appears within our block.

24
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.410
Supporting your LS is as simple as adding a single event to the media placeholder component.

25
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.730
The component will handle the rest.

26
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.780
In the next lecture, let's address an issue with our current implementation of the component.
