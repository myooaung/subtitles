00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,810
In this lecture, we are going to work on the category template.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,930
On our sidebar, we have a list of categories.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,890
If we click on a category, WordPress will modify the query to present a list of posts for that category.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:19,140
By default, WordPress will load the index template for displaying this page.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,480
It's optional to create a template dedicated to categories for our theme.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,250
We're going to create a template for categories in another tab.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,640
I have the static design of the category templates.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,080
As you can see, the template is very similar to the index templates.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,170
The big difference between both templates is that the category template has a large gray bar at the

10
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,190
top of the page inside this bar where displaying the name of the category, this section will help visitors

11
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,820
distinguish between the home page and category page.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,890
Let's view the template hierarchy documentation for the category templates.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,129
According to the documentation, WordPress will check our theme for five templates starting from the

14
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:05,760
top.

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,450
A template file called Category Slug will be loaded.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,760
The file name may look strange.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,210
There are curly brackets surrounding the word slug.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,760
Curly brackets indicate a placeholder.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,830
Typically, WordPress will provide more information on what the placeholder is for.

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,270
In this example, the placeholder is for the slug of the category.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,200
A slug is a keyword that gets attached to the URL.

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:38,370
For example, if we were to go back to our site, the URL structure would be the same for all categories.

23
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,260
It's the word category, followed by the slug for identifying the category.

24
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:50,130
Back in the documentation, we can create a template for a specific category by using its slug.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,490
This can be helpful if you would like to load a unique design for a specific category, let's keep going

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,480
through the list.

27
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,470
The next template is called Category ID.

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,090
The categories are stored in a database.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,540
Most entries in a database are assigned an ID.

30
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,449
Slugs are useful, but they're not reliable.

31
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,600
Administrators have the power to modify a slug.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,690
If you would like to create a special template for a category without a slug you can use its ID.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,880
IDs can never be changed.

34
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,090
Next, we have a template called category.

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,330
This template will be used for all categories.

36
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,390
Afterward, there's a template called Archive.

37
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,190
Archives are generic templates for various pages that aren't the home page.

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,590
Lastly, the index template will be loaded if the other templates aren't available.

39
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,500
We have various options at our disposal.

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,390
WordPress provides theme developers a lot of flexibility with their templates.

41
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,370
For our case, we're trying to create a generic template for all categories.

42
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,870
Therefore, I think the category template is perfect for our theme.

43
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,410
Head back to the code editor in the templates folder.

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,950
Create a file called Category HTML.

45
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,590
As I stated before, the category template will be very similar to the index template.

46
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,260
Since that's the case, we can copy the template from the index file to the category file.

47
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,760
Let's give that a try.

48
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,460
Next we can start adding the header at the top of the file in the assets directory.

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,810
There will be a template called category.

50
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
Open it.

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,820
Inside this file search for an HTML comment that says page header.

52
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,650
The markup for this section is very simple.

53
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,130
We have classes for changing the color, position and size of the header.

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,920
Most of this can be recreated with blocks.

55
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,400
There's just one problem.

56
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,630
WordPress does not have a block for displaying the name of a category for the page.

57
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,920
Without this information, our block will output the same text.

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,400
The page header should display the current category.

59
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,250
For this reason, we are going to create a custom block to address this section of the page.

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,690
A temporary solution will be the HTML block.

61
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,760
Let's copy the HTML for the page header.

62
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:28,180
Next, open the full site editor in your browser, you may need to refresh the page for the template

63
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,960
to appear.

64
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,800
WordPress does not check for newly created files.

65
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,790
We are going to select the category template from the list.

66
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,650
The template should look identical to the index templates after the template has been loaded.

67
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,680
Insert an HTML lock after the header template part.

68
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,090
Next paced the hml into the block.

69
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,160
Afterward.

70
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,380
Copy the lock to your clipboard.

71
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,700
Lastly, let's update the category template file back in the code editor.

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,740
We are going to paste the block below the WP template part comment.

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,150
Let's refresh the category page on the front end.

74
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,080
Perfect.

75
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,660
The template has been successfully saved.

76
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,720
We have a template dedicated to categories.

77
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,820
The header will always display the same category.

78
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,230
In a future section.

79
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,690
We are going to create a custom block for rendering the correct category.

80
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,940
For now, let's move on to the next template.
