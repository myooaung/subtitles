00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.200
In this section, we're going to start diving into theme development by working on a master project.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.410
This course focuses on developing a large theme and plugin.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.610
By doing so, you'll be given first hand experience on what it takes to develop a large project.

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.800
We got a taste of PHP in the last section.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.800
It's time to see how WordPress uses PHP to power a content management system.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.690
First things first, let's check out the files in our editor right away.

7
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.230
You'll notice there are hundreds of files in WordPress.

8
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.960
It can be daunting to decide where to begin.

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
I think the best place to start is with the configuration file.

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.220
It's one of the most important files in WordPress.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.570
At the heart of every WordPress site is the configuration file.

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.150
Regardless of what you're doing, the configuration file is loaded on every request.

13
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.490
Let's take a peek at what's inside.

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.870
It can be found in the root directory of your WordPress installation.

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.680
The file is called WP Config PHP.

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.190
The configuration file contains the core settings of WordPress.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.780
This information is highly sensitive.

18
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.340
We can find info such as the database, login credentials, security keys, etc. In the resource section

19
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.920
of this lecture, I provide a link to the WP Config Documentation page.

20
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.970
This page provides documentation for WordPress configuration file.

21
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.210
It contains a comprehensive list of every option available.

22
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.010
We're allowed to freely edit the configuration file without our changes being overridden.

23
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.190
Updates will not affect the configuration file.

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.490
We won't be able to cover most of these settings.

25
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.420
The default settings are optimized for most WordPress apps.

26
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.540
Normally we would have to configure WordPress.

27
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.020
Luckily local expedited this process for us.

28
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.440
So you may be thinking why are we starting with this file?

29
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.880
As developers, we're inevitably going to be running into problems.

30
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.400
It's completely natural by default.

31
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.890
WordPress disables debugging mode.

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.130
While errors are helpful for developers, they can be incredibly dangerous to show to visitors.

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.410
If a visitor is malicious, they can use the info from an error to hack our site.

34
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.300
It's considered good practice to hide errors in a production environment.

35
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.750
In our case, we're in a development environment for the best possible development experience.

36
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.600
We should enable WordPress debug mode.

37
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.430
On the sidebar, there is a link to an option called WP Debug.

38
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.720
Let's click on it.

39
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.690
According to the documentation, this option will allow errors to appear on the screen in a production

40
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.510
environment.

41
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.560
This option should always be set to false.

42
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.970
Since we're working locally, we should set this option to true.

43
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.810
It's going to help us debug our code if we run into errors.

44
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.040
Let's turn it on.

45
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.840
Switch back to the editor.

46
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.930
Immediately, we're going to be given dozens of lines of code.

47
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.350
It can seem intimidating at first, but don't worry.

48
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.790
Take a deep breath.

49
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.740
If you were to read each line of code one by one, you're going to notice something.

50
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.800
This file is filled with comments and constants.

51
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.080
Nothing you haven't encountered before.

52
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.410
Word presses configuration settings are defined with constants.

53
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.140
The comments are to describe each setting.

54
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.790
After all, WordPress is an open source project.

55
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.400
The developers of the project trying their best to keep the code base beginner friendly.

56
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.830
Feel free to read through the comments.

57
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.700
Let's take a look at the first constants.

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.150
As we've learned, constants are created with the defined function.

59
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.660
In addition, constant names are written with all uppercase letters.

60
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.280
It's a common practice among WordPress developers.

61
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.690
Feel free to explore the constants in this file.

62
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.090
You can always refer to the documentation for more info and the next lecture, we're going to modify

63
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.510
this file to help us with debugging WordPress.
