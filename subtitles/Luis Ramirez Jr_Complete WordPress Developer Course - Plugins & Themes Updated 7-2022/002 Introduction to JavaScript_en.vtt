00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.780
In this lecture, we're going to begin our discussion of JavaScript.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.880
It's the language that powers the web.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.580
Without JavaScript, sites like YouTube, Netflix or Google wouldn't be where they are today.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.950
The world would be completely different.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.310
Let's look at what the world would look like without JavaScript.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.410
Feel free to follow along with me.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.060
Throughout this course, I've been using Chrome as my browser.

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.810
Under the browser settings, we can altogether disable JavaScript by navigating to security and privacy

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.040
site settings.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.080
At the bottom of the page, we can view the settings for JavaScript by default.

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.890
Most modern browsers will enable JavaScript for all pages.

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.660
Let's disable this feature.

13
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.470
After doing so, nothing's going to happen in another tab.

14
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.110
I have YouTube opened, it's fully functional.

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.180
I can click on a video to watch it.

16
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's see what happens if I refresh the page.

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.570
YouTube is completely broken.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.700
We're unable to watch videos without JavaScript.

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.849
Let's look at another example.

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
The New York Times is another site that relies on JavaScript.

21
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.190
If I refresh the page, we're not going to experience the same result as before.

22
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.520
Unlike YouTube, The New York Times can be viewed without JavaScript.

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810
However, the ads will not work.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.340
The ad at the top of the page is gone.

25
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.020
There are users who will genuinely disable JavaScript to avoid ads.

26
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.090
Let's look at one more example.

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.750
In my last tab, I have the Gutenberg editor opened.

28
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.750
If I refresh the page, watch what happens.

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.340
WordPress will throw an error at us.

30
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.880
The Gutenberg editor heavily relies on JavaScript.

31
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.780
As you can see, JavaScript is a powerhouse for the web.

32
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.730
Best of all, we can harness this power to enhance the user experience.

33
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.650
Initially JavaScript was introduced as a language for the web.

34
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.990
To understand why, let's take a walk down memory lane.

35
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.449
Before JavaScript, we had a language like PHP for processing a web page.

36
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.270
The relationship between PHP and the browser is simple to understand.

37
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.070
The client will send a request to the server for a page.

38
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.100
The server will process the request, generate a page, and send a response.

39
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.470
We've seen this exact behavior with WordPress on the front end.

40
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.630
We can navigate to round the site.

41
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.680
As we do so, the page refreshes on every request.

42
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.090
This behavior works fine until you run into some common problems.

43
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.390
For example, on the header, we have a search form.

44
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.160
I may be interested in researching recipes for pizza.

45
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.080
If I were to type the word pizza into the search bar without the last letter, the application wouldn't

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.100
notify me of my typo.

47
00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.270
To make matters worse, if I were to submit the form, I wouldn't be able to fix my mistake until the

48
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.090
page completely loads.

49
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.980
I have to wait for the server to respond.

50
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.000
Form validation is the most common use case for JavaScript.

51
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.770
Let's head back to YouTube.

52
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.000
YouTube doesn't have this problem.

53
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.890
If I were to perform the same typo, YouTube would recommend a complete list of possible search terms.

54
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.860
This behavior is powered by JavaScript.

55
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.170
There is an important distinction to make between PHP and JavaScript.

56
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.430
PHP runs on the server, not the browser.

57
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.640
The moment the page loads in the browser, PHP loses control over the page.

58
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.330
We can't insert additional elements.

59
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.870
PHP has to wait until a new request is made.

60
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.740
On the other hand, JavaScript does run in the browser.

61
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.400
It was introduced as a way to add interactivity and logic to the page without sending another request.

62
00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.280
Unlike PHP, JavaScript has access to the elements and styles of the documents.

63
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.230
We can move elements around, validate forms or play media files.

64
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.570
If you were to do research, you might come across various use cases for JavaScript.

65
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.320
Two decades ago, JavaScript was aimed at the web.

66
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.730
As the years progressed, it's considered a general purpose language.

67
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.080
We can use JavaScript for programming, desktop and mobile apps.

68
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.310
For this course, we're going to focus solely on web development.

69
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.790
Learning a new language is easier the second time around.

70
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.040
After all, JavaScript is a programming language.

71
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.540
Like most programming languages, concepts like functions, variables and conditional statements are

72
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.140
supported in the language.

73
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.570
The syntax is different, but the ideas are the same.

74
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.670
You'll be surprised how fast you'll catch up with the language.

75
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.590
Let's begin programming with JavaScript in the next lecture.
