00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,470
In this lecture, we will add a button for adding new social media links for a team member.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,360
For additional help, let's create this button with a tool tip.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,710
WordPress has a component for easily adding tooltips to an element.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,990
Let's get started in your editor.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,420
Open the edit JS file.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,470
First, let's grab the components we're going to need for this lecture from the components package.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,600
Grab the tool tip and icon components.

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,460
The icon component will render an icon from the dash icon font set.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:41,050
This icon set has a plus icon which is perfect for our needs.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,040
Next, scroll to the loop for the social media links.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,110
Below the loop and the tooltip component.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,210
The tooltip component is responsible for rendering a tooltip.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,670
The component must be wrapped around the element that will have the tooltip.

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,540
Before adding the link, lets add the message in the tooltip.

15
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,440
The message can be customized by adding the text property.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,540
Let's set this property to the following message with the double underscore function add social media

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,230
handle.

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,200
Next, let's add an anchor element inside the tooltip component.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,890
Set the ref attribute to the hash character.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,650
If this button is clicked, a new social media link will be added to the current array of links.

21
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,170
Lets add the on click event to the function with an arrow function as the value.

22
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,170
And the argument list except the event argument.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,340
Clicking on a link will cause the URL to change.

24
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,990
To prevent this behavior.

25
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,400
Let's call the prevent default method on the event object.

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,720
Next, let's update the social handles attribute using the set attributes function.

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,130
Unfortunately, the set attributes function will completely override and attributes value.

28
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,750
That's not what we want.

29
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,710
The goal is to add a new item to the array.

30
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,290
We can achieve this result by setting the social handles attribute to an array.

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,390
In this array, we can spread the current value of the attribute into the new array.

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,030
Next, we can add an object to add a new item in this object.

33
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,090
Let's set the icon property to the question.

34
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,840
Icon.

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,050
The IRL property will be an empty string.

36
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,780
This solution will add a new item to the array.

37
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,740
Next, we can begin rendering the icon inside the anchor element.

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,710
Add the icon component.

39
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,180
The icon can be configured by adding a property called icon.

40
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,020
The value for this icon must be a valid icon.

41
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,870
Name from the dash icon font set.

42
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,340
The name of the icon for adding a plus symbol is called plus.

43
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,090
Let's test our code in the browser.

44
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,290
Try adding the team members group block to the page.

45
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,600
We can hover our mouse over the plus button to view the tooltip.

46
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,190
The tooltip renders without a problem.

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,510
WordPress can handle toggling the tooltip based on mouse events.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,360
Now that we've confirmed the tooltip works, let's try clicking on the button to add a new social media

49
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,960
link.

50
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,960
The new links will have question mark icons.

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,680
Perfect.

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,250
We've successfully added an option for adding new links.

53
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,970
Let's continue working on this section in the next lecture.
