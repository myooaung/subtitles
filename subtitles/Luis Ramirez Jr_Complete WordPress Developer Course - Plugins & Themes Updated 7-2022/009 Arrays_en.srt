00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,240
In this lecture, we are going to explore a raise.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,330
I bet you can guess what an array is without looking at the syntax we learned about them in PHP.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,860
Arrays are a feature for storing a collection or group of data.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,310
Creating an array is super simple with JavaScript as usual, we are going to continue working with the

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,010
snippets file from the developer tools.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,400
There are various options for creating an array.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,920
However, the preferred solution is to use square brackets inside the script.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,410
Create a variable called states.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,760
The value for this variable will be a pair of square brackets.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,380
By setting the variable to a pair of square brackets, JavaScript will assign an array to the variable.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,130
At the moment our variable is empty.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,590
We're not restricted by the type of values that can be inserted into the array, strings, numbers,

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,870
booleans, etc. Inside our array, let's store a list of states.

14
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,930
Next, let's try rendering an item from the array below the array.

15
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,710
Run the alert function.

16
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,790
Inside the function, we can reference a specific item from the array by typing a pair of square brackets.

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,650
JavaScript uses zero based indexes for its array.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,910
Therefore, the first item of the array can be retrieved with zero.

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,670
The second item has an index of one.

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,760
The last item has an index of two, so on and so forth.

21
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,620
Let's grab the second item in the array by typing one.

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,680
Lastly, let's try running our script.

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,460
The alert box will contain the second state from our array.

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,480
Another feature checked off our list in upcoming lectures.

25
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,670
We're going to start getting into more advanced features.

26
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,870
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next lecture.
