00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.540
In this lecture, we are going to recreate this form with a different API called the Settings API.

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm going to be perfectly honest, I'm not a fan of this API.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.860
That doesn't mean that other developers feel the same way.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.220
You may come across this API in other plug ins.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.280
For that reason I'm going to cover this API.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.320
It's possible to create this page with PHP functions.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.760
We do not need to hardcoded the templates onto the page.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.070
The settings API was introduced for generating forms with PHP.

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.460
WordPress can handle updating our options in the resource section of this lecture.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.670
I provide a link to the official documentation for this API.

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.380
You may be wondering why should we use this API over creating a custom template.

12
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.480
As noted by the documentation.

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.910
Using this API provides visual consistency, prevents your forms from becoming outdated, and can handle

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.230
basic security.

15
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.120
The goal is to reduce the amount of work for creating a form.

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.600
Let's give it a shot.

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.520
First, let's create a separate page for the form in your editor.

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
Open the menu's PHP file.

19
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.750
Previously we registered a page by using the add menu page function.

20
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.020
This function adds a top level menu item to the sidebar of the WordPress admin dashboard.

21
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.870
This time we're going to add a submenu.

22
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.900
It doesn't make sense to clutter the sidebar with various links.

23
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.130
We should try our best to organize our links under a single menu below this function.

24
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.490
Run a function called Add sub menu page.

25
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:50.610
The Add submenu page function will add a sub menu page to any top level menu on the dashboard.

26
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.780
The first argument of this function is the name of the parent menu.

27
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.470
We can add this some menu to our custom menu by setting the value to the same value passed in as the

28
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.710
fourth argument to the add menu page function.

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
In this case, set the name to up plug in options.

30
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.220
Afterward, we can begin configuring the title of the page.

31
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.470
The arguments are very similar to the arguments from the Add menu page function.

32
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.290
Let's set the title to the following translatable message alt udemy plus.

33
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.630
The third argument is the text for the menu.

34
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.760
The value for this argument will be the same as the value for the second argument.

35
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.520
Next, we need to set the permissions for viewing this page by setting the required capability.

36
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.440
Let's use the same capability, which is the edit theme options capability.

37
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.160
The fifth argument is the name of the plug in.

38
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.480
The name of our page will be called up plug in options alt.

39
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.030
Lastly, we must provide the function's name for rendering the page.

40
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.280
Let's call our function up plug in options alt page.

41
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.660
Next, let's define this function in the include slash admin folder.

42
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.840
Create a file called options page alt php.

43
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.290
Define the function in this file.

44
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.760
Within this function.

45
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.030
Let's add a div tag with a class called ramp.

46
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.940
Lastly, let's add a dummy message.

47
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.290
And the WordPress admin dashboard.

48
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.850
Refresh the page.

49
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.040
Under the Udemy plus menu we can find our custom menu.

50
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.680
Lets click on the link to view the page.

51
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.010
Our message gets rendered on the page without a problem.

52
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.090
That's perfect.

53
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.850
And the next lecture we will start rendering the form for modifying the options from our plugin.
