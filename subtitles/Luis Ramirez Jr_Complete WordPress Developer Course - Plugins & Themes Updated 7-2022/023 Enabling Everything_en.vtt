00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.750
In this lecture, we're going to add one more feature to our theme.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.939
Thus far, we've enabled everything.

3
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.600
Users will have ultimate control over the appearance of our theme.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.530
We've had to write dozens of lines of code to get this behavior.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.379
However, there is a shortcut worth looking at.

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.700
Let's quickly take a look at it inside the theme JSON file.

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.880
Open the settings object at the top of the object.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.530
Let's add a property called Appearance Tools with a value of true.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
You can hover your mouse over this property to read the description.

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.170
According to our editor, this option will enable everything if you're developing a theme that gives

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.040
your clients complete freedom.

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.040
This can be a quick way of supporting all settings.

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.600
In some cases, it may be better to enable the setting.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.430
If you need to disable a feature, you can do so on a per block basis.

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.240
That wraps up our discussion of the theme JSON file.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.800
We've written over 100 lines of code.

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.709
WordPress gives us so much power for customizing the editor with a single file.

18
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.040
Hopefully you can use this file to your advantage for tailoring the editing experience for your clients.

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.340
Before moving on, let's reset our template.

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.470
We've made several changes to the template that the original template has been overridden.

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.750
Switch over to the full site editor for the indexed HTML template.

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.390
Let's clear the customizations to reset the templates.

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.550
Be sure to save your changes.

24
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.580
Otherwise, the reset will not be complete.

25
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.190
After making those changes, we can move on to the next set of topics.

26
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.680
In the next section, let's begin loading our templates.

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.590
It's time to begin converting our templates into a functioning theme.

28
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.840
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next section.
