00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.350
In this lecture, we are going to briefly explore databases and tables in my browser.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.280
I have the admin or applications opened for the rest of this section.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.890
You should have this program opens to.

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.620
We are going to be repeatedly using it.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.250
Upon opening this tool, you may be presented with a list of tables available in your database.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.680
We're going to talk about tables, but first, let's look at how to access a database.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.700
At the top of the page, there's a breadcrumb menu to the left.

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.470
There's a link that says My SQL, click on it by defaults local will authenticate us into the database.

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.400
As you can imagine, databases contain sensitive data.

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Before entering a database, we must have valid credentials, admin or can log into a local database.

11
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.740
However, we're not limited to local databases.

12
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.750
Databases hosted publicly can be accessed for this course.

13
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.379
We're going to focus on the database installed in our environment.

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.260
Let's try logging into our database.

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.430
The first option is to select the type of database admin, AH supports various databases.

16
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.040
Almost immediately you may notice that Maria DB is not listed as an option.

17
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.720
My SQL and Maria DB are treated as similar databases.

18
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.290
It's safe to select the my SQL option admin.

19
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.490
I won't have a problem connecting with a maria DB database.

20
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.950
Next, we must provide a server.

21
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.530
This option refers to the URL.

22
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.450
Let's switch over to local.

23
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.360
Local will provide us with the information admin or needs for logging into the database.

24
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
The host field contains the URL.

25
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.030
Typically the URL to a local database has a domain called local host.

26
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.750
Let's pass this value into the server field.

27
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.560
Next, let's pass in the username and password.

28
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.370
Local will create a user for accessing the database.

29
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.860
This user has complete access and permissions.

30
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.000
You can find the credentials from local according to local.

31
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.850
The username and password are both root.

32
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.190
Let's pass those into the form.

33
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.920
Lastly, we must provide the name of the database.

34
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.640
Multiple databases can exist within an environment.

35
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.220
For example, we may have a database for WordPress and another database for payroll management.

36
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.330
Both databases may exist in the environment, but they should be stored in separate databases.

37
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.880
There isn't a reason for WordPress to have access to financial information for employees.

38
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.200
This field is asking us to select a database by default.

39
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.120
Local will call our database local.

40
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.420
Let's input this database.

41
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.970
Next, let's submit the form.

42
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.770
After doing so, we're brought back to the same page as before being able to log into your databases.

43
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.600
Important.

44
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.750
At the very least, your client will ask for the URL, username, password and database.

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.150
Within a database we have a list of tables, tables or groups of data.

46
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.550
They're very similar to spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

47
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.310
WordPress will create 12 tables.

48
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.890
We have a table for comments, posts and users before digging into a table.

49
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.970
Let's talk about the information associated with each table.

50
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.710
Specifically, let's focus on the engine and correlation columns.

51
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.210
An engine is responsible for processing commands given to the table.

52
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.720
It'll determine what features are available in a table.

53
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.150
There are dozens of engines available.

54
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.940
Each engine supports different features.

55
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.450
WordPress recommends an engine called ODB.

56
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.170
This engine is the default engine for most tables.

57
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.070
It's a general purpose engine that covers most use cases.

58
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.120
When in doubt, you should select this engine for your table.

59
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.250
We won't dive into the details.

60
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.380
However, when working with the database, choosing the right engine will provide the best experience.

61
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.700
Next, let's talk about the collation column.

62
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.800
Data can contain text.

63
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.790
Storing text is not as simple as it seems in our world.

64
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.600
There are hundreds of languages with their own character set.

65
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.680
For example, Japanese is not written the same as English.

66
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.520
The Japanese language has a unique set of characters.

67
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.360
Databases can support various character sets.

68
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.690
In some cases, you may want to support everything.

69
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.750
WordPress recommends the UTF eight MV for Unicode CI collation.

70
00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.840
This character set supports various languages from Arabic to French to Chinese.

71
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.330
Overall, it's a great character set.

72
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.280
Let's start viewing a table.

73
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.960
I'm going to select the WP Post table next.

74
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.780
Let's select the Select Data link.

75
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.950
On this page.

76
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.100
We are presented with the data stored in the table.

77
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.450
To the surprise of no one data is stored in a literal table.

78
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.490
Records are stored in rows.

79
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.290
We are given a clear view of the relationship between each piece of data.

80
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.010
At the top of the table we are given column names.

81
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.000
They clearly describe the type of data found under each column.

82
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.820
For example, the Post title column contains the title of each post on our site.

83
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.260
One of the first posts is called Sample Page.

84
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.410
This post is created by WordPress for fresh installations.

85
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.470
Being able to search through the database is nice, but it may not be easy with thousands of posts.

86
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.990
Let's start exploring queries.

87
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.000
A query is a request to the database for performing a specific action.

88
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.460
We can create tables, select data, change data or delete data.

89
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.550
There are dozens of actions that can be performed.

90
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.190
In the next lecture, we are going to create a table for experimenting with queries.
