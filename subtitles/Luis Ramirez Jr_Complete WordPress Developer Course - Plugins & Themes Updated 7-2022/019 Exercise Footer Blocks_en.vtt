00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lecture, I'm going to give you an exercise.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.930
Thus far, you've had the opportunity to view my process for developing themes.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.750
Hopefully you've been following along with me for this lecture.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.910
I'm going to give you an exercise.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.120
The last section in our template is the footer.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.250
Let's take a look at the footer.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.610
Looking closely, the footer has a few sections.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.660
First, we have a set of three columns with headings and paragraphs afterward there's a white line that

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.340
goes straight through the footer.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.340
We haven't explored all of WordPress blocks.

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.350
However, there is a block for adding a separator below the separator.

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.800
There's another paragraph of text on the right side.

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.990
There are social media links.

14
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.860
WordPress has a block for creating this type of UI.

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.410
Overall, we don't need HTML blocks for creating a footer at this point.

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.210
I feel like you can tackle this type of template on your own as an exercise.

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.090
Try recreating the footer with blocks, take your time and don't worry about being perfect.

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.860
We'll go through the solution together, pause the video and good luck.

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.640
Welcome back.

20
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.580
If you were able to successfully create the template, that's great.

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.170
If not, that's fine.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.950
In the resource section of this lecture, I provide a link to a gist.

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.170
Rather than going through each option, I'm going to provide you with the entire solution.

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.510
Copy the code into your clipboard.

25
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.650
Next, open the footer html file in the parts folder.

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.150
Let's replace the current template with a new copy of the templates.

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
Understandably, you may be curious as to how I've created the templates.

28
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.070
Your solution may be completely different than mine.

29
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.070
Keep in mind, WordPress provides various ways to tackle the same solution.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.310
If your layout is different than mine, that's fine as long as you are able to achieve the same thing

31
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.070
visually.

32
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.150
You're good to go.

33
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
Let's walk through my solution in the browser.

34
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.570
Open the footer template file.

35
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.630
You may need to reset the template to view the original templates.

36
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
The HTML block should not be inside your template.

37
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.900
Overall, we have a few dozen blocks for creating the footers design.

38
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.930
Most of these blocks should be familiar to you.

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
Starting from the top, everything is wrapped with a group block.

40
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.150
On this block, we're applying three settings.

41
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.970
The first setting changes the text color of the block.

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.550
By changing the text color on the group block, children blocks will inherit the color.

43
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.660
This saves us time by modifying the colors on each block.

44
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.780
Secondly, we're changing the background color.

45
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.690
Lastly, we have padding on the block to add breathing room.

46
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.500
They shouldn't be sitting near the edge of the group.

47
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.170
Up next, we have a columns block.

48
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.400
There's not much to say about this block.

49
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.910
We have a total of three columns.

50
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.800
Each column has a heading and paragraph.

51
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.060
The columns block has the class's container and mix auto to center the content.

52
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.900
These same classes can be found on the other blocks too.

53
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.300
Afterward, we have the separator block.

54
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.180
I'm introducing a new block.

55
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.750
The separator block will add a horizontal line across the container.

56
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.080
There are two settings on the block.

57
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.140
Firstly, we're setting the style to wide.

58
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.550
Otherwise the separator block will not stretch from side to side.

59
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.760
Secondly, we're changing the colour to white.

60
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.570
Let's move on to the last block, which is a row block.

61
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.670
It contains the paragraph and social icons blocks.

62
00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.530
The row has the space between option enabled for the justification.

63
00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.910
This option will allow the children blocks to sit on the opposite ends of each other.

64
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.790
The social icons block is new to us.

65
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.790
As the name suggests, it's a block that can contain a list of social icons under the hood.

66
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.740
They're links that can redirect the user to a business's social media page.

67
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.640
The settings for the icons are mostly unchanged for the style.

68
00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.560
I have decided to go with the logo's only option.

69
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.810
This was to remove the background color of the social icons.

70
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.180
As for the color of the icons, they've been modified to white by default.

71
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.680
The color of the icons will be based on the social media platform.

72
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.190
In my opinion, the icons stood out too much.

73
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.860
Setting them to white will match our footer.

74
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.610
I've enabled the open links in new tabs option.

75
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.480
Lastly, I've modified the block spacing option to 0.5 REM.

76
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.150
This option will add spacing between each icon.

77
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.520
Feel free to add any social media icon.

78
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.040
I've added generic platforms.

79
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.150
We're finished.

80
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.040
If we were to view the front end, the footer should be fully functional.

81
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.100
Perfect.

82
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.500
The index template is finished.

83
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.060
If the footer template is not working, you may need to reset the index template.

84
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.850
It took us some time, but we've got a functioning home page.

85
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.750
However, some elements aren't functional.

86
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.350
These elements will be revisited in a future section.

87
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.410
For now, we can move on to other templates.

88
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.430
Let's begin exploring other templates in the next lecture.
