00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.020
- Let's learn about the options on how we can get started

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.030
with Kubernetes by creating our first Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.090
There are multiple ways to get started with Kubernetes.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.010
You can run it easily on your desktop,

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.010
on-premises data center, or in the cloud.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.060
There's a wide variety of choices

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.010
for running in each of the environments as well.

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.070
This course will cover running Kubernetes on desktop

9
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.080
and in the cloud.

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.060
Minikube runs on a single-node Kubernetes cluster

11
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.090
using the type 2 hypervisor, such as VirtualBox.

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.070
It is a single-node Kubernetes cluster

13
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.070
running inside a virtual machine.

14
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.070
If you're building Docker Images, you are likely

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.010
to have Docker for Desktop installed on your local machine.

16
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.020
It provides a seamless way to start a Kubernetes cluster.

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.060
In this case, a single-node Kubernetes server runs locally

18
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.010
within your Docker instance,

19
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.090
and the version is not configurable.

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.050
I conducted a Twitter survey

21
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.030
to check which tool is popular for desktop development,

22
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.090
virtually using Kubernetes, on desktop.

23
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.050
Docker for Desktop and Minikube

24
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.040
are certainly the most common ones.

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.070
This course will explain both getting started

26
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.070
with Minikube and Docker for Desktop.

27
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.010
And, we will use Docker for Desktop for all development,

28
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
in this course, because of simplicity,

29
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.040
and seamless integration with Kubernetes.

30
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.080
Let's start with Docker for Desktop first.

31
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.000
In order to get started with Docker for Desktop,

32
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.030
you go to www.docker.com, look at products,

33
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.010
pick a Docker desktop.

34
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.080
Depending upon your operating system,

35
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050
we are on a Mac machine here,

36
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.010
click on download for Dock for Mac, scroll down.

37
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.090
You can pick a Stable, or an Edge release.

38
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.040
In our case we'll take the Edge release

39
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.000
so that we get the latest version of Docker.

40
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.020
Once the download is complete, click on it, now we go ahead,

41
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.020
and move the Docker install to our Applications directory.

42
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.060
And, we can go to our Applications folder, and start Docker.

43
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.030
Applications, click on the icon here to start Docker.

44
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.060
Click on next here.

45
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.070
You need Admin access.

46
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.020
And now, you can see Docker desktop is starting for you.

47
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.030
And on the top here, what you're seeing is,

48
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.080
in the whale icon that is going up and down,

49
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.000
indicating that Docker is getting started.

50
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.050
And you will see something very similar on your

51
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.070
Docker for Windows as well.

52
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.010
Now that your Docker daemon is up and running,

53
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:48.040
now you can enter your Docker ID, and password, and log in.

54
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.030
In order to enable Kubernetes, using Docker Desktop,

55
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.040
click here, go to preferences, go to Kubernetes,

56
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.010
click on enable Kubernetes, and apply.

57
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.070
This will download all the images required to run your

58
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.080
Kubernetes, and install it in the Docker instance itself.

59
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.040
So it's really that simple.

60
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.080
It will take a while for it to download the images,

61
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.060
and start it, so we'll speed up the process.

62
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.080
Alright, after waiting for a few minutes, you can see

63
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.040
that Kubernetes is now successfully installed,

64
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.060
so let's go ahead and close it.

65
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.050
Now we're going to go to our terminal,

66
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.000
and take a look it, how we can start using it.

67
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.030
First thing we look at is, what is our, kubectl version.

68
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.020
So we say, kubectl version,

69
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.000
and this shows the Client Version, and the Server Version.

70
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.050
Client Version of course is the version

71
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.030
of the kubectl CLI, or kubectl CLI.

72
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.060
And Server version is the Kubernetes server version for us.

73
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.020
The second thing that we try is,

74
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.060
kubectl config get-contexts.

75
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.040
This shows the Kubernetes server configurations

76
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.070
that exist on our local machine.

77
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.000
And of course, Kubernetes cluster installed in

78
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Docker for Desktop is the only cluster

79
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.060
that we have available, and so

80
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.070
that's the config that is shown over here.

81
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.080
The star over here indicates that

82
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.010
that is our current context, so any command

83
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.030
that we guide, from now onwards using kubectl,

84
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.040
will be guided towards this particular cluster.

85
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
Now let's look at how many nodes this cluster has.

86
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.010
Of course, as we said, Docker for Desktop is a single-node

87
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.090
Kubernetes cluster, so it shows a single-node.

88
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.050
So it's very straightforward, to get started with

89
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.070
Docker for Desktop, and enable a Kubernetes cluster.

90
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.010
And this is going to be the mechanism

91
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.000
that we will use in this course.
