00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] As a Java developer,

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.070
how do you take your existing skills

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.080
and apply them to Kubernetes?

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.030
Kubernetes has gained a significant adoption

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.020
in the container orchestration world

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.090
in the last couple of years.

7
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.030
Java is the most prolific language in the enterprise.

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.000
I'll show you how to package your Java application

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050
as a docker image, create Kubernetes manifests

10
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.080
and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster

11
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.000
on desktop and in the cloud.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.010
We'll also talk about observability of these services,

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.080
using Service Match and how to create deployment pipelines

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.030
so that you can focus on what you do the best,

15
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.010
building your applications.

16
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.030
I'm Arun Gupta, actively involved

17
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.070
in the Kubernetes community and a Java champion.

18
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.020
I've been playing with Kubernetes for over three years,

19
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.090
authored a book on it and programming and Java

20
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.090
for over two decades.

21
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.040
If you're ready to learn how to package, deploy

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.010
and manage your Java applications of Kubernetes,

23
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.060
then come join me in my LinkedIn learning course

24
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.000
on Kubernetes for Java Developers.
