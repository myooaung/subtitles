00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] This course requires you to have

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.050
basic knowledge of Java programming.

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.080
If you want to learn Java,

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.000
there are several courses available on LinkedIn Learning.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.050
This course uses Spring Boot application framework

6
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.010
to create the Java application, but you're welcome to use

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.090
any other framework of your choice.

8
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.060
You only need to know about Spring Boot

9
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.070
if you want to tweak the existing application.

10
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.050
A prior knowledge of Docker and containers

11
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.030
would be very helpful, however it's not necessary,

12
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.010
as this course provides a sufficient introduction.

13
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.070
If you're looking for more details,

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.000
then you can refer to my course

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.080
on Docker for Java developers,

16
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.020
also available on LinkedIn Learning.

17
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.050
You need to know basic Shell programming.

18
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.040
We use a lot of commands in the Shell.

19
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.010
This course was built on macOS,

20
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.060
and so all the commands are OSX friendly.

21
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
For example, software is installed using BLUE,

22
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.080
which is a packet manager for macOS.

23
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.080
You'll need to either find a corresponding

24
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.060
packet manager in Windows,

25
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.050
or download the releases from the corresponding tools

26
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.030
get have website.

27
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.060
It does not require you

28
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.000
to have any prior knowledge of Kubernetes.
