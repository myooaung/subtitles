00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
- [Instructor] We've deployed a Kubernetes deployment

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.010
and a Kubernetes service using two separate manifest files.

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.070
But more often than not, we would like

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.090
to deploy them as a single manifest file.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.070
Let's see how we can achieve that.

6
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.040
I'm in the workspace directory.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.090
Let's go to manifests, standalone directory,

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
and we will look at greeting.yaml.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.060
Now this greeting.yaml, has exact same

10
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.080
deployment manifest that we explained earlier.

11
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.010
On line 24 is our key message here,

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.000
where we're doing three dashes,

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
basically showing that this is a new resource

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.070
is starting from here onwards.

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.010
And then line 25 onwards, of course, is our service.

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.000
So essentially, you can put as many Kubernetes objects

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.090
in a single manifest file separated

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.030
by three dashes over here.

19
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.080
So let's go ahead and deploy this manifest

20
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.080
as one single file.

21
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.090
So kubectl create dash F, you guessed it right,

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.020
greeting.yaml, just one file.

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.080
And as you can see, the message has changed,

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.030
it's creating deployment and service for us.

25
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.020
And let me show you a different command as well.

26
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.080
How do we get access to these?

27
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.030
So, service, deployment and pods.

28
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.000
In one command, you can get access

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to all of these objects together.

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090
And, once again, you have your service greeting created,

31
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.050
accessible and local host, deployment.

32
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.080
All status looks good and powered,

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.080
once again, up and running.

34
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.090
So, let's goo ahead and access our service here.

35
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.010
Local host and hello, and we get the same response back.

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.020
So that is really cool.

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.000
It allows us to combine our multiple Kubernetes resources

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.090
into a single manifest file.

39
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.060
Now let's also understand how we can delete

40
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.030
all of these resources together.

41
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.040
Of course, we can say kubectl delete

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.010
dash F greeting.yaml, but we can also say

43
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.080
kubectl delete, and I can say deployment slash greeting

44
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.010
because that's the name I gave to the deployment,

45
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.060
and similarly, service slash greeting

46
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.000
because that's the name of my service.

47
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.050
This will delete both deployment and service.

48
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.010
And, once again, if I try to access service,

49
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.000
deployment and pods, none of them is available

50
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
at least for my application.
