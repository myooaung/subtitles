00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Narrator] One of the alternative options

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.030
to get started with Kubernetes on your desktop

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.080
is to use Minikube.

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.000
This section will show you how you can get started with

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Minikube on your desktop.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now Minikube requires a Type-2 hypervisor.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.060
So in this case we're going to use VirtualBox.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060
Provide the admin access

9
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.000
because VirtualBox would need to create vm's on your behalf.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.020
Once VirtualBox in installed

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.060
the next step is to install Minikube.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.020
Now Minikube is installed.

13
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.070
One of the things I want to highlight here is,

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.030
if you look at "brew link --overwrite kubernetes-cli,"

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.090
as part of Minikube it also installed the latest version

16
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.020
of Kubernetes to CLI

17
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.030
but it did not override it so that is an explicit decision

18
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.090
that you will have to make if you want to use the latest

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.030
Kubernetes to CLI.

20
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.050
Then you can explicitly link it as part of

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.080
brew command itself.

22
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.060
But for know, we'll just move on.

23
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.000
So, our first thing is to start Minikube cluster.

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.080
So we say, "minikube start."

25
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.020
This is going to download the ISO that forms a basis for the

26
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.070
VirtualBox image and then is going to fire up the cluster

27
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.040
and is going to download the components in the cluster

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.080
and finally, our Kubernetes cluster will be ready.

29
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.010
This could take a little bit longer

30
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.020
depending on your internet speed.

31
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.000
Alright, after downloading all the components,

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.070
configuring them, Minikube cluster is now up and running.

33
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.040
So, the first thing we're going to do is

34
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.050
take a look at our contexts.

35
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.060
In this case, it shows two contexts.

36
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.000
The first context is Docker for desktop

37
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.020
because this is what we installed in our previous section

38
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.080
and it shows Minikube

39
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.020
which we just installed.

40
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.090
Now the start is around Minikube.

41
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080
What that means is Minikube is a current context.

42
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.090
So what that means is any Kubectl commands that we give now

43
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.060
are going to be configured and used against

44
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.000
this particular cluster.

45
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.070
So let's try, "kubectl version" now.

46
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.070
Kubectl version shows client version,

47
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.080
which is a Kubectl cli version.

48
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.030
In this case this is 1, 10

49
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.040
and the Server Version, which is the kubernetes version

50
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.020
is 1, 12, because that is the version of the Kubernetes

51
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.010
server installed by Minikube.

52
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.070
Let's try, "kubectl get nodes."

53
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.000
And once again it shows that

54
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's a single-node Kubernetes cluster

55
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.050
running our local machine.

56
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.080
Now, one important thing for you to understand is

57
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.010
as part of pursuing in this course,

58
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.010
we will be using Docker for desktop.

59
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.070
So let's go ahead and change the context to

60
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.070
Docker for desktop.

61
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.010
So we will say," kubectl config use-context,"

62
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.010
is the command. Which basically explains that this is a

63
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.090
context that I want to use.

64
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.010
Copy the context name from here,

65
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.090
paste it here,

66
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.070
and now the context is switched to Docker for desktop

67
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.040
and now if I say, "kubctl config get-contexts,"

68
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.030
both the contexts are shown, but Docker for desktop

69
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.090
is the one that is our current context.

70
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.090
It's important that you switch to this context

71
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.000
because for all of our local development

72
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we will be using Docker for desktop for Kubernetes.
