00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] Let's install Istio

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.020
on our Amazon EKS cluster, and have some fun with it.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.090
In the GitHub repo there's a link to a blog post

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.020
that provides complete details

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.060
about how you can get started with Istio on Amazon EKS.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.080
It explains Istio architecture

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
and how you can get started with it.

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.020
For convenience, we have summarized the command here.

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.060
The first thing we need to do is download Istio.

10
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.000
Copy the command here.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.010
In our terminal, I'm in the home directory.

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.020
Give the command.

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.080
This is going to download the latest Istio release.

14
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.050
Now notice that this is Istio 1.0.5.

15
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.040
We need to include Istio bin directory in our path.

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.070
And the convenient command for that.

17
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.010
So copy it, paste it,

18
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.010
and now Istio bin directory is in our path.

19
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.060
The only thing remaining

20
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.040
to essentially get Istio up and running

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.030
in our Kubernetes cluster is to install Istio.

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.000
So let's go to our Istio directory here,

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.010
and there is a Helm chart

24
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.040
that is already available for Istio.

25
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.000
So we're going to say helm, install,

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.080
run this in a synchronus mode,

27
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.010
call this deployment Istio.

28
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.060
In the namespace, Istio system,

29
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.060
and the helm chart by itself is in the directory install,

30
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.080
Kubernetes, helm, Istio.

31
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.040
Because we are doing this in a synchronus mode,

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.090
it'll read for all the images to be downloaded

33
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.080
and configured and install, and now Istio is ready to roll.

34
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.090
Let's take a look at what pods

35
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.010
have been installed as part of this.

36
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.080
Kubectl, get pods,

37
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.000
and remember our namespace was Istio system.

38
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.010
And so you can see all the pods have also been installed.

39
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.000
And this completes our Istio installation

40
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
on the Amazon EKS cluster.
