00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.030
on how to package your applications as Docker image

Another area to watch

22
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.060
in Service Mesh space is AWS App Mesh.

23
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.000

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040

If you want to learn more

30
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.010
about how to use EKS more effectively,

31
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.040
then eksworkshop.com is a self-based hands-on workshop

32
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.020
