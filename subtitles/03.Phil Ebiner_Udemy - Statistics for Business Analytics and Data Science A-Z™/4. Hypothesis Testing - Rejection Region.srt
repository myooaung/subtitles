00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,510
Today we're talking about the rejection region.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:10,390
So previously we saw the steps that are involved in hypothesis testing.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,670
And today we're going to see a alternative way of testing hypotheses.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,510
It's just a bit different towards the end.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,940
Otherwise everything is going to be the same.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,170
So let's have a look.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,950
You've probably seen this chart before somewhere online or in other research that you might have been

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:31,120
reading about or maybe when you were doing a stats course back in the day.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,030
So here we've got a rejection region.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,810
And as you saw previously we did the hypothesis testing we followed the rejection region.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,650
So how is this approach different.

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:47,170
So let's have a look here we've got the problem from the previous tutorial where we've got the millennials

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,170
who in 2015 used to watch twenty six and a half hours of TV per week.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,520
And now you've surveyed 50 of them or 50 random millennials and you found that 24 like they watch about

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,220
24 hours of TV per week.

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:09,880
And we went through the analysis and we showed that we can reject the null hypothesis with at least

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,950
a 95 percent confidence.

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,480
So now what are we going to do is we're going to do exactly the same thing we've learned even plotted

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,890
our distribution.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,210
So this is the sampling distribution and we've done all these calculations.

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,710
But now when we proceed we calculate the score just as we did previously.

23
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,580
And it turns out to be one minus one point seventy seven.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,100
And that's why our X bar is actually sitting here not as we thought originally was over there but now

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,330
instead of going to the Zad table we're here and finding minus one point seventy seven what are we going

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,710
to do.

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,840
We're going to reverse engineer the situation we're going to look in this table.

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,120
Let's zoom in a little bit.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,790
So now we're going to look for the opposite.

30
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,260
We're going to look for zero.

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,030
We're going to look at 5 percent in the state.

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,720
We're going to we wants to find Zed such that it is a 5 percent chance of something falling into this

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,330
area because we want to reject our hypothesis with a 95 percent confidence.

34
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,660
So therefore we want to see where it is zed which is responsible for 5 percent is sitting.

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,610
And so we look for 5 percent in our table.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,840
You can see you at 0.5 375 to six.

37
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,810
So as that increases this primary this value decreases of course because as that gets to that goes more

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,030
to the left the percentage decreases.

39
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,350
So as you can see we going down to 0.5 or fives or four point four 9:5.

40
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:39,640
So therefore you're Zed at which 5 percent will fall into there is about this that so minus 1 6 4.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,730
But to be safe is to take this one because this is just a bit greater than 5 percent.

42
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,500
You want it to be a bit less than 5 percent rather than émigrés.

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,580
So the best to go with here is minus 1 point 6 5 1 6 1.6 5.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,050
So this from this value you can tell that the Zehr that you're looking for is minus 1.6 feet and that's

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,600
going to be used critical and you might have heard this somewhere that is your.

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,270
Zed cret or Zed critical.

47
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,250
So if now we go back here we're going to calculate so pick the critical the p the critical p value that

48
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:18,310
we're looking for is 5 percent and therefore we've found that Zed critical is minus 1.6 5.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,930
And the beauty about this approach is that Zayd critical is not going to change that table.

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,070
Or that said table as its artistic table is never going to change it's always going to be like this.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,310
So if you just remember for yourself that if you're always testing and 5 percent confidence you just

52
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:39,730
remember for yourself minus 1.6 five years you've said that you are looking for then you don't really

53
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,170
have to use that table you just remember OK this value just compared to minus 1.6 5.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,500
And the way you compare it is like you draw.

55
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,960
So as you go here you draw the Xat critical.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,370
There it is.

57
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,060
So it is about minus 1.6 five standard deviations away from the mean.

58
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,540
So that's one sound deviation that's a half that's about 6 1 0 points 1.6 and there's one point six

59
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,950
five standard deviations away from the mean.

60
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,620
And then you just color the skin.

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,150
So there you go that's your rejection region.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,860
That's what we're looking at so that's the rejection region and therefore anything or the likelihood

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:21,340
what it's telling us is that the likelihood of picking of randomly picking a sample size from this rejection

64
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,980
region is always going to be less than 5 percent.

65
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,750
The further you go to the left the lower it will be.

66
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,840
But even if you pick one just right on the rejection region on the borderline It will only be 5 percent

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,180
likely.

68
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,860
And that's what's called the rejection region.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,080
As long as you've picked a sample from here randomly You can reject the null hypothesis meaning that

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,400
it is so unlikely that this happened that there's probably something fishy going on that this null hypothesis

71
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,820
isn't actually correct that our assumption is incorrect.

72
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:56,470
We don't live in that universe we live in this universe and therefore that's how it works so that's

73
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,440
two approaches to the same problem.

74
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,820
WALLACE First finalizes that is a critical minus one point sixty five hours it is minus one point seventy

75
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,470
seven.

76
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,340
This is lower than this so we're further away from the mean.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,230
Remember if you're going to be doing on the other side then you want to be.

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,710
This has to be greater than this because it's going to be positive.

79
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,940
So you want to be further away from that.

80
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,420
That's why this helps I think is a good idea to always draw this sketch at all just to understand what's

81
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,690
going on so you remember to do the right comparison so we can reject the null hypothesis and there and

82
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,440
we can accept the alternative hypothesis I mean has decreased.

83
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,270
So there we go that's two different approaches slightly different very slightly different.

84
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,040
You can see the whole thing is the same we're still using the sampling distribution.

85
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,740
We're still calculating the sampling mean the sampling standard deviation same formulas we're using

86
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:49,330
the central and the theorem we're then calculating we know our eggs bar with calking Nozette score and

87
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,700
then only the only difference is off to calculate the score in the first approach that we saw you go

88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,780
to the table and you find your score that you've calculated.

89
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,600
There it is.

90
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,700
So mine is 1.7 7.

91
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,390
So you know exactly the percentage likelihood of that happening 0.03 8 4 so three point eighty four

92
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,170
percent.

93
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,830
So therefore you could reject this hypothesis even if a 96 percentage confidence because this is lower

94
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,380
than 4 percent then yeah this is a long and 4 percent or whether it was a problem or one that we had

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,270
privey in the Prius or Toral in this to trial what we did is we reverse engineered the situation we

96
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,210
looked for Zero Point or five or five or it was a point of 195 that once that's a 5 percent and then

97
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,920
we just looked at the Zed's critical so minus 6 minus 1.6 5.

98
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:41,040
So and then we calculated well minus 1 some point 6 5 because that Croisette is less than that critical

99
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,400
is like further away from the mean.

100
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,520
Is it critical therefore we just reject this hypothesis.

101
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,390
So in this case we just say that's why it's it's also convenient to say that we reject it for 95 degree

102
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,900
percent confidence instead of always changing it up and saying that all this time is 96 percent degree

103
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,360
confidence stems 97 percent degree confidence.

104
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,760
Just because you always have to use that first approach to find out the exact degree of confidence.

105
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,940
If we set a threshold and say 95 percent degree of confidence is sufficient for us then we can also

106
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,440
use the second approach and it's up to you what you like that or so.

107
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,720
This might be faster if you just remember the minus 1.6 five.

108
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,470
It corresponds to the 95 percent degree of confidence or symmetrically at 1.6 five on this side and

109
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,640
therefore you can just use that without having to look at that table so that can be a bit faster.

110
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,610
So you go other than that these two approaches are identical in their results and methodology that they

111
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,010
are relying on no results at the yield and the methodology that they're relying on.

112
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,810
So I hope you enjoy this Tauriel and hopefully this is starting to make you come all come together and

113
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,610
further down the section of course we're going to have a look at more and more examples of how to apply

114
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,430
hypothesis testing to real world problems.

115
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,260
And I can't wait to see you next time.

116
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,760
Until then happy analyzing.
