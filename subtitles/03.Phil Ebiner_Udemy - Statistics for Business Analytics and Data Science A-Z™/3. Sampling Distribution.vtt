Hello and welcome back to the course on business statistics and today we're talking about the sampling

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.810
distribution.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.380
So previously we left off here where we discussed that there is a population and then we can take samples

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.800
in order to estimate the parameters of the population.

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.220
However not always taking samples is useful and can lead to the results that we want.

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.910
Sometimes there will be situations when just merely having a sample or taking a sample and getting formations

7
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.420
from that sample is not going to give us the right insights in order to solve the business problem.

8
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.630
And in fact at the end of the session we'll actually have a look at an actual business problem which

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.640
we are not able to solve through just mere sampling but which we will need more advanced techniques

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.110
to solve.

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.900
And that's exactly what we're preparing here for in order to prepare ourselves to understand the Central

12
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.500
Limit Theorem.

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
We need to discuss one more thing and that's exactly what we're doing now.

14
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.650
We're going to be looking at the sampling distribution so the sampling distribution sounds similar to

15
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.760
sample but is actually two very different concepts.

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.090
And let's have a look at what a sampling distribution implies.

17
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.550
So instead of just taking one sample like we see here in red How about we take several samples from

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.250
our distribution.

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.630
So let's take one sample here and they'll be the same size of the same number of observations in them.

20
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.360
Take another sample here take another sample here and take another sample.

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.300
And so we just keep taking samples like that and every time as you can see we're recording ex-parte

22
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.950
which is the mean of the metric that we're looking at for that specific sample so we just we take a

23
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.710
sample we look at what the mean is we recorded.

24
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.300
We take a sample We'll look at what the mean is and record it and so on and so we keep doing it many

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.070
many times.

26
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.260
And in the end we have lots and lots of these values which means means of the sample.

27
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.250
And then what we're going to do is we're going to actually plot those values on a chart.

28
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.430
So there's our charts and whatever results we get from these observations we're going to plotted on

29
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.960
this chart it will look something like that we don't know what will look like so as for a question mark

30
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.110
here before we get too carried away it will look as some sort of distribution and you'll be called the

31
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.060
sampling distribution of the sample.

32
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.320
I mean I know there's a lot of words that are similar in their sampling distribution of the sample mean

33
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.310
and actually get even more like that in the further trials.

34
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.640
But nevertheless it's important just to understand what we're doing here we're just taking samples from

35
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.560
our population lots and lots of samples that can overlap no problem because just taking all these random

36
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.230
samples and we're recording the mean of the metric that we're interested in and we're writing it down

37
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.030
every single time.

38
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.030
And then we are plodding that the probability density function of that we're coming up for distribution

39
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.320
for that new variable.

40
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.910
So now we will have a sampling distribution of the sampling.

41
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.950
So that's what sampling is all about.

42
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.200
And in the next tutorial we'll finally get to the Central Limit Theorem.

43
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.340
And I look forward to seeing you there.

44
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.050
Until next I'm happy analyzing.
