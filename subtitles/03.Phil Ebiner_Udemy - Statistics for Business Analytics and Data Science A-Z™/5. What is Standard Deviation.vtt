00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.950
Hello and welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.440
Today we talk about standard deviation.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.070
Very interesting topic ahead.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:15.060
So let's clarify what standard deviation is once and for all so that we never ever have to worry about

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.200
this again.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.800
All right.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.010
So we stopped over here when we talked about continuous and discrete or discrete and continuous variables

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.840
and then we talk about discrete and continuous distributions and we established which is very important

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.800
that distributions are actually functions attached to.

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.460
In our case the columns are the variables and so they're a descriptor of our data rather than some sort

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.600
of graph or graph.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.020
In this case a discrete chart or a continuous or the probability density function here.

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.880
There are just auxilary elements they assist our understanding and distribution and visualizing them.

14
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.280
But and in essence you don't need a graph for the distribution to to exist.

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
Distribution exists independent of the graph.

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090
So with that in mind let's move on.

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.750
There's this clear the chart that clearly area here and we're going to talk about height just for nomos

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.510
to mix it up and just to make it a like for illustrative purposes going to be a convenient variable

19
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.740
for us to work with.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.200
So here we've got five variables five values in this day and fiberglas as we saw Briest it's actually

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.420
a greater or larger data set.

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.510
We just trimmed down.

23
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.170
But for the purposes of today's tutorial let's imagine that that is all we have that we only have five

24
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.990
rows in this dataset and that's it.

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.400
That's a whole dataset.

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.350
In that case let's write out our five rows over here or five values of height.

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.920
So we have five people.

28
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.280
It's a very small bank.

29
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.030
There's only five people who are customers of his bank.

30
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.080
You can all you can count them on one hand and that that's how tall they are in inches sixty one point

31
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.710
two inches 62 inches sixty five inches seventy point four inches.

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.510
Twenty point nine inches.

33
00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.590
So we want to find some parameters about our population this is our this is a population because we

34
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.440
only have five people on a sample and we'll talk about the sample populations further down in the course.

35
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.300
But this is not a sample of the population because that's all the people we have in the back.

36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.170
So we want to find out some parameters about the circulation.

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.750
For example what is the meaning of their height.

38
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.450
What does the average of their height while the mean of their height is calculated as you add all their

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.480
heights up.

40
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.580
And they divide by 5 and that gives you sixty five point ninety two that's going to be the mean or that

41
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.840
is the mean of the height of all of the customers of this bank.

42
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.210
Now let's talk about the variance.

43
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.910
So variance what is the variance variance is a measure of the spread of your data.

44
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.820
So you know what the mean.

45
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.450
So we know the meannesses five point ninety two which is somewhere in the middle.

46
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.400
So they can see six 5.1 sousaphone 292 somewhere in here.

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.730
And the question is how spread out is your data because it could be very close we could get 65 or 9:2

48
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.860
if we had all of them here like sixty five point sixty five point two sixty five point three.

49
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.140
And two of them here like seventy seven point four and so if or something like that or seventy point

50
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.390
three seventy point to something I got we would get when I do or in this case are a bit more spread

51
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.320
out all the way to 12:54 to sone point.

52
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.410
Or they could be even more spread out because could get the same mean sitting over here but they could

53
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.780
be all the way to 40 inches and all the way to what is two meters six six foot something and not that

54
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.710
good a chance of converting is well let's say up to 80 inches.

55
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.850
So between You'd have you could have the same mean but your data could be spread out way further it

56
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.750
could be only from 40 to 80 inches or or more or less so this in its own on its own doesn't tell us

57
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.120
everything it touches a bit but it doesn't tell us a lot that much about the dead it just tells us one

58
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.940
thing tells the.

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.180
But we don't know the spread.

60
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.590
For example we don't know the spread about this and so that's why we introduce a new metric which will

61
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.680
help us understand.

62
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.650
OK so we know the I mean how are our observations spread out around this.

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.580
I mean on a very close together or are they quite sparse.

64
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.620
Are they quite far apart from this.

65
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.990
I mean and that's why we need a measure of spread.

66
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.580
A very simple trivial very trivial measure of spread that we could introduce is the range.

67
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.990
We could just say OK what's the seventy point nine maximum minus 60 will point to one point to maximize

68
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.730
its minimum.

69
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.000
And that would give us the range that it would be a really good measure of or a starting measure of

70
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.150
spread because of rate of spread.

71
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.280
Because if if or if all the values are very close to sixty five point nine point ninety two.

72
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.310
Then the spread will be then the range will be low.

73
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.390
If the values are spread out far away then the range will be high but that only talks about the maximum

74
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.880
of the minimum.

75
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.060
That's what if we have an outlier we it doesn't tell us anything about the ones in between.

76
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.950
So we'll know or we'll know the mean which.

77
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.530
So here are the minimum the maximum like some barometer about the minimum next month.

78
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.380
But we won't know what's going on in between why we want to do something more robust and that's why

79
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.290
we're introducing variants so variants is introduced as again in an average but an average of what.

80
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.040
Well let's start by experimenting.

81
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.120
Let's see what we can come up for together.

82
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.050
Let's say we take so where you have the mean.

83
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.480
So let's say and we know it's sitting somewhere over there.

84
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.390
Let's take this value the starting first value and we calculate the distance between this value and

85
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.740
the mean and we calculate as on point to my sixty five point ninety two.

86
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.700
That's basically a different system assigned differences are going to be negative here.

87
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.240
But let's just keep this calculation consistent for everybody we're going to take this minus this.

88
00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.500
OK.

89
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.520
So that's pretty cool.

90
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.950
So you are asking how far away is this value from the mean which is sitting over here.

91
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.670
Next one let's add 62 minus sixty five point nine.

92
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.750
So again we're asking OK this is the man here sitting somewhere here in between these two.

93
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.630
How far away is this value from the mean.

94
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.860
OK.

95
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.460
That's how far away we are at this one.

96
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.830
How far away that's how far this one how far away.

97
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.430
And at this point how far away.

98
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.170
OK that's really cool.

99
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.890
But if we add them up the problem is it will always add to 0 1.

100
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.590
You can check that for yourself is just the way that means calculate calculated because of the way the

101
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.890
mean is calculated if you plug in the formula here.

102
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.170
Or if you just plug if you're just calling from calculation and this version of variance it would always

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.420
add up to zero because these are negative here.

104
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.320
These are positive and the sum is.

105
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.970
And they balance each other out.

106
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.180
So what can we do to this equation to make it better.

107
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.530
Well we could just simply take the absolute values instead of taking the negative here.

108
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.200
Just take the absolute So module Munjal this module this module all of them and then they're positive

109
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.390
or zero positive all of them and that means they'll definitely not add up to 0 unless they're all the

110
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.330
same.

111
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.800
That's not what what happens in this takes in statistics.

112
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.370
We don't take the module.

113
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:01.210
There is a metric where you use the module which just is not commonly used.

114
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.450
The problem with that is just the graph of the module has a kink in it.

115
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.910
And that means things like differentiation or integration.

116
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.600
They are going to be problems that.

117
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.130
More like more advanced mathematics and calculus are going to be problems.

118
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.610
And it's not just it's not smooth enough.

119
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.990
Probably something not the right word.

120
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.360
It's just not the best approach in the long run.

121
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:31.580
It might work for us here but in all the other applications of variants that exist in all these cross

122
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:38.480
across disciplines both Physics Mathematics up to biology chemistry pretty much anywhere.

123
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.730
The modules are going to be the best choice.

124
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.100
So that's why that's probably the main reason why what we go with is squared.

125
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:52.520
So if we square them we still get the benefit that they are all positive and at the same time we don't

126
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.650
have those same problems as modules.

127
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.190
So there we go.

128
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.080
That's that's what variance is.

129
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.160
So you basically calculate the distance the mean from every single one of these you square it.

130
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:09.140
You take the average and in mathematics if we put this in an equation then it looks like this so variance

131
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:16.280
equals the sum of x minus X minus mew mew is our mean we're square.

132
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:23.870
Divided by hand as we discussed this is a measure of spread of our data and it's fair to say that because

133
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:29.720
now we're calculating how far in this calculation each variable is controlling the distance from the

134
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.850
mean for each Marable's construe contributing.

135
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:38.570
So if the data is spread around your mean very tightly packed Orangemen then this will be low.

136
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.280
The variance will be low.

137
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:44.330
If your data is spread out far away from me mean then this will be high will higher have a high variance

138
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.070
meaning it'll have a high.

139
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.590
The spread of your data is high.

140
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.560
So in our case if you calculate it sixteen point sixty four and now we're going to choose a new concept

141
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.430
standard deviation which you've definitely heard about before.

142
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.370
Standard deviation is basically the square root of your variance.

143
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.300
And in our case it's equal to four point 0 8.

144
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.910
Senator tuition's What are you going to be working with mostly when talking about distributions and

145
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.420
statistics for data.

146
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.820
But sometimes you will you will still hear about variance.

147
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:24.020
Some tools use variants some methods use variants some equations are only valid for variants and so

148
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.350
on.

149
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.560
So it's good to remember about both of them but also standard deviation is also good to know that.

150
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.330
Let's say if this is height in inches then you mean is in inches.

151
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.550
But if youre here you can see your square.

152
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:43.210
So your variances in square inches which is not that useful in terms of a measure of spread.

153
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.810
Thats why standard deviation is better because it will be youve got inches squared here and then youve

154
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.760
got to square roots.

155
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:54.680
These are inches again so you can actually add the standard deviation to your mean you can say OK so

156
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.680
what was the mean plus 1 standard deviation.

157
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.420
OK so in this case mean plus one standard deviation equals 70 right.

158
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.890
Nine laws Yeah.

159
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:13.080
So equal 70 or mean minus 1 standard deviation equals sixty one point eighty eighty four.

160
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.650
So you can actually work with these operate with them because they're in the same units.

161
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.970
In our case interest you can do the same variance because that square inches.

162
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.520
And that's why variance is used for other things.

163
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.450
All right and now let's change the words to their correct Greek letters.

164
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:33.930
So there we go that's new which is the mean that's Sigma squared which is your variance and that's Sigma

165
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.080
which is your standard deviation.

166
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.370
Well hopefully all of that makes sense and hopefully that's pretty straightforward what the standard

167
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.440
is what the mean is and what the standard deviation is the variances and standard deviation.

168
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.300
So I mean as you know what is your data centered around and your variance or send division is how spread

169
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.060
out about how spread out is your data around that when it wallet's centered or even though it's centered

170
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.520
around this value hospitalities.

171
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.520
And but the probably the most important question I guess is how do you remember the difference between

172
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:05.920
the two.

173
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.730
How do you remember that Sigma squared has variance and Sigma and deviation because I used to have this

174
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:16.740
problem where I would look at something like Ok Sigma squared variance the standard deviation I'll have

175
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.850
to think about it.

176
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.110
I could even get wrong.

177
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:23.520
So how do you remember which is which because these are obviously if this is your first time dealing

178
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.860
with this is a new term.

179
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.390
The way I remember it now is Siegman squared.

180
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.540
So this is going to give you a visual anchor.

181
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.330
I'm going to give you a visual anchor and for further arrests of your life you're going to remember

182
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.360
what this actually hard to remember this.

183
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.280
OK ready.

184
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:39.900
All right.

185
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.700
Let's look at this.

186
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.580
Sigma is one.

187
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.470
And the Wii has one part and sigma two as two.

188
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:52.920
So the first letter here has two parts to it has that line and that line and that and this symbol has

189
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.490
two parts.

190
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.630
So that's how you can always remember so the has two sigma squared.

191
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.120
So a single square has variance.

192
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.840
It's just a quick tip.

193
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.830
So that's you are always on your feet when you're talking about variance and standard deviation.

194
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.610
OK.

195
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.700
So that was standard deviation and variance and mean.

196
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.460
And I hope you do this material and I'll see you next time.

197
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.380
Until then happy analyzing.
