00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.110
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.110
My name is Vitalii And today we're going to talk about baselining and forecasting the exciting topic

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.320
which is a continuation of our discussion on the trends.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.690
So baselining and forecasting who comes first I would like to clarify the definition and the subtle

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.620
difference that we have between baseline and forecasting baselining is usually referred to using the

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:33.620
past performance in order to understand derive the model so we can help inform the future.

7
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.740
In the management consulting baseline baseline is also used to determine something the behavior of the

8
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.990
system without any influence without any improvement.

9
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.860
So we can measure any improvements that we could do to the system from that baseline forecasting.

10
00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.390
On the contrary is something that is looking into the future and something that determines the future

11
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:10.660
state of the system whether with influence or without So forecasting is a little bit more inclusive

12
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.550
term in this case and baselining is more simple and primitive.

13
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:24.160
And so I would like to cover baseline first because this will help you understand how forecasting is

14
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.850
made.

15
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.650
So let's do the baseline that lets outline the steps to do the baselining and then walk through a specific

16
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.680
example which will be quite interesting hopefully and quite exciting for you.

17
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.070
So step number one in in the baselining process is to plot your data and here specifically we're going

18
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.570
to cover the process for time series data set.

19
00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:01.250
So the one that has as the argument and the independent argument as time and the way we want to plot

20
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.550
Aldora is that our next exercise days hours months.

21
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.890
So time related.

22
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.490
Step number two is to identify and remove outliers and noise if that is possible.

23
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.280
There are a few rules of thumb to follow here.

24
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.300
You don't want to massage your daughter too much.

25
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.680
So it becomes unrecognizable and not trustworthy anymore.

26
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:32.290
And the rule of thumb here is if you do more than five alterations to a data set it is likely to start

27
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.460
losing credibility if you apply like a dozen.

28
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.370
Then it's probably too much and the data is no longer representative.

29
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.040
But it depends a lot on the size of the data set.

30
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.870
We're talking about and and what not.

31
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.110
Step number three is to estimate the average and understand the variability.

32
00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.510
And usually we play with standard deviation as the proxy for variability search for patterns is always

33
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.490
top number four.

34
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:12.940
And the example patterns are seasonality or cyclic behavior and step change step number 5 look for dependences

35
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.130
to enhance your model the dependencies or next level down in details behind your metric usually help

36
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:32.280
inform the underlying behaviors and underlying mechanisms of your indicator that you are trying to baseline.

37
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.840
So let's use an example from the previous lecture which is number of cars painted in April 2016 and

38
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.900
walk through these these steps quickly.

39
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:50.800
So to make sure that we are on the same page you put your dot up self-explanatory no comment on that.

40
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.890
I didn't find remove outliers and noise if possible.

41
00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.780
And if you remember we're headed one outlier on the 18th of April where a fire alarm worked in the painting

42
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.480
workshop and therefore these dots that point is not representative of our normal performance.

43
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:22.690
And we had two days where in the painting workshop we had to redo repaint the cars and repainting usually

44
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:30.880
takes less time because we needed to repaint a very specific spot an area of the car and our system

45
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.100
data capturing system were not able to distinguish whether it was like full car painted from scratch

46
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:45.670
or it was a repainting therefore adding noise to our daughter and effectively not making those days

47
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.980
representative.

48
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.830
But we knew we had to know each and therefore we were able to remove it.

49
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.160
And as you can see I've color coded this with white collar.

50
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.850
So it is not and because that we want to exclude these data points.

51
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.130
Step number three is to estimate the average and understand the variability to estimate the average.

52
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:19.960
I just calculated the mean for the salad bars for the data points we are left with.

53
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.530
And in this particular case the number is.

54
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.730
Hundred and twenty five point eight.

55
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.910
From my memory the.

56
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.230
And you can see this line as a dark blue horizontal line.

57
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:42.010
The red lines are is our kind of like tunnel affordability and the way these these lines calculated

58
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.480
is we took the average and added a standard deviation and subtract and standard deviation one standard

59
00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:01.510
deviation from those numbers and I used the Excel formula as t d s to calculate the standard deviation

60
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.920
for a sample set not for the full set for the full set.

61
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.650
I would have used STV P for the whole population.

62
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.680
So that's a subtle difference.

63
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:24.040
What we can see from this chart that the variability or volatility of that specific metric is not very

64
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.580
high.

65
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.290
And this is good.

66
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.750
It means that the model we're going to build would probably have more credibility and it will be easier

67
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.040
to build a model.

68
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.970
Step Number four is searching for patterns like seasonality step change.

69
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.160
And in this specific example there are no obvious patterns.

70
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.680
However not to be sneaky.

71
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.690
I actually included a few data sets that have some patterns for our practice.

72
00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:03.400
So let's step to the side or step a little bit from our previous example and see how to recognize those

73
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.850
patterns.

74
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:11.340
So if our data set were to look like this you can see it on the left hand side.

75
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.960
This is likely a step change button in here.

76
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.840
And as you can see something happened on the 16th of April and the performance dropped.

77
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:31.750
Two hundred and one Korus per day painted versus Hammerton twenty five twenty six previously and other

78
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.490
pattern is called seasonality.

79
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:43.300
In this case you can see a cyclic behavior were during the summer in the northern hemisphere.

80
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:49.320
The number of course painted is greater generally than during winter.

81
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:57.370
And given that two years demonstrate similar behavior we can probably make a good assumption that this

82
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.350
is going to continue going forward.

83
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:08.170
So these were a couple of examples of the recognizing pattern behind your data set this step number

84
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:16.360
five is to look for dependencies in order to further enhance your model if in case of the cars painted

85
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.360
we can think of.

86
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:26.010
What are the main inputs into the system to get cars painted and assuming manual labor and manual painting

87
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.610
in the workshop.

88
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:33.640
The number of cross painted would probably depend on the number of safeties that work on the day number

89
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:39.880
of full time equivalent employees and their productivity individual productivity.

90
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.030
Multiplying one by another we'll get number of cars painted on that specific day.

91
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:53.080
And let's assume that our previous our data set looks like this.

92
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.960
So there was a bit of a step change.

93
00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:03.800
As you can see and if you were to dig down into the data and check on the full time schedule and then

94
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:11.840
police working on a day and doing that month or you would see that on the 16th of April number of fifty's

95
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:20.470
dropped by two people could have taken their annual leave or they called in sick or whatnot.

96
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.720
And therefore the output of the workshop dropped.

97
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:32.760
So assuming similar productivity day and day probably good for I a little bit.

98
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.840
But you can buy it by digging into the details.

99
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:45.800
You can enhance the understanding of the past performance and we'll be able to make better predictions

100
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.160
going forward.

101
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:58.720
So these were the five steps how to derive a good baseline and to recap first step is to plot your daughter.

102
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:06.470
Second step is to exclude or eliminate your outliers and reduce noise where possible.

103
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:15.770
Step number three is to develop average and the understand the variability of your data in order to

104
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:22.060
understand the sensitivities the accuracy of them or potential accuracy of the model and what not.

105
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:30.650
Step Number four was to look for any patterns in the behavior of your daughter whether it's seasonality

106
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:41.360
or step change any other cycle behavior or the having an incline and growth in your model in your dorm

107
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.560
and stubborn.

108
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:50.810
Step Number five is deconstructing your output and trying to get more details by looking at the next

109
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.040
level of details behind the data.

110
00:10:53.270 --> 00:11:02.350
So these were the five steps of baselining forecasting being the logical next step.

111
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:14.990
Here's a few approaches that has a few approaches and I took Wikipedia as the source of the list of

112
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.040
those approaches.

113
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:23.190
And because I found it as probably the most comprehensive out there I will quickly run through them.

114
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.670
I'm not going to go into a lot of details because you can jump on Wikipedia and check it out yourself

115
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.440
but I'll give the definition.

116
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:36.110
The way I understand it hopefully will help you in reading that material going forward.

117
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.340
So first forecasting method is called versus quantitative.

118
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:49.370
In the absence of data in order to build a baseline Sometimes you have to operate with 3:45 and the

119
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:54.830
data could be collected collected through service of your customers through the service of your suppliers

120
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.610
and whatnot.

121
00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:03.350
And based on understanding of the expert customer or

122
00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.630
opinions you can predict and put the forecast forward.

123
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.700
Step number two is the leverage approach.

124
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:21.480
It is a very simple approach where all future values are equal to the average or mean of past performance.

125
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.030
As you can imagine it is a very simple simple approach.

126
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:33.620
And the forecast could be sometimes oversimplified especially if there is a behavior or pattern like

127
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:43.100
seasonality or step change your average could not be as accurate of a prediction approach.

128
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.110
Number three is what is called a naive approach.

129
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.570
It's very simple to understand.

130
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:56.970
You take the very last point you have and make all future value is equal to that.

131
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.720
So if.

132
00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.990
Let me give you an example from everyday life.

133
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:17.170
If you've had a few drunk three liters of water on on today by the end of the day the forecast would

134
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:23.290
suggest that going forward until the end of the week you'll keep drinking three leaders a day regardless

135
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.880
of how many years you drink yesterday or the day before.

136
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:33.820
So taking the last data point and projecting it forward forecasting method number four is drift method

137
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.240
drift method is a particular application of your naive approach.

138
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:52.270
But instead of projecting forward all the same data point you want to project the trend and to do that

139
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.970
the drift method suggests that you need to take the first point in the data set.

140
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.950
And the last point in you that I said connect them one with one straight line and continue that line

141
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:03.930
in the future.

142
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:15.140
So if on Monday you drank one liter of water on Tuesday you drank two liters of water.

143
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.510
And these are the only two data points you have in your data set.

144
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.680
You can suggest that on Wednesday they'll do three leaders on those day 48 hours and so on and so forth

145
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:34.510
so using the slope and the last data point in order to for agast forward the approach Number five is

146
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.480
seasonal Knabe approach.

147
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.170
We've talked about seasonality a little bit in baselining.

148
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.180
So I'm not going to repeat myself.

149
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:51.970
But this approach takes the very last data point you have as per Knabe approach and uses the seasonality

150
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:57.280
pattern as of that point time series methods.

151
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.000
So there are several of them.

152
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:08.650
Most commonly used in the business world are the rolling average and weighted drawing average these

153
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:20.950
methods are good because they are good and quite practical because you include more than one or two

154
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.260
data points.

155
00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:30.130
You include some history in like in the past performance in order to make prediction prediction for

156
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.130
the future.

157
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:38.390
However it is still sometimes can be simplified especially in case you have some pedant's in the data.

158
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:46.090
Approach number 7 which is casual or econometric forecasting method this approach is very similar to

159
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:53.770
the one we discussed in the baselining where we deconstructed our performance into a number of employees

160
00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.320
and their productivity of of the employees.

161
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:08.050
So casual and kind of metric or econometric method actually tries to look behind the KPI into underlying

162
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:20.230
factors and to give you another example this could be temperature as the factor of electricity consumption

163
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.050
in the building used for air conditioning.

164
00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:31.740
So if the outside temperature is rising the consumption is likely to increase.

165
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:37.660
So there are some dependencies that are being looked at in order to do the forecast.

166
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:48.680
The method number eight is judgemental method and it is pretty cool method and worth exploring and probably

167
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.830
deserves a separate conversation.

168
00:16:51.890 --> 00:17:00.710
This method is used sometimes when there is a severe lack of Dardenne or lack of data overall in order

169
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:09.840
to make a prediction and this method is reliant on expert opinion or some assumptions.

170
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.730
This could be.

171
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.710
There are several frameworks that could be used here.

172
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.940
One of them is

173
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.390
a framework that the belief framework.

174
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:35.030
If people believe in something happening with sudden probability then it has good chances in order to

175
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:41.220
be implemented and therefore good enough prediction and forecasting in some cases.

176
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:50.090
So this method is very useful like the kind of like believe in quote marks framework especially when

177
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:59.760
you have a lot of stakeholders around the table that you want to interview ask step or the approach.

178
00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:05.290
Number nine is artificial intelligence intelligence methods.

179
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.180
There are several of them that are included there.

180
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.910
But I'll give you an example of one.

181
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:18.410
Neural networks is one of the forecasting methods where you train your neural network in order to give

182
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:23.680
you a model that will predict the future performance.

183
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:30.340
And so the method number 10 is a variety of other methods.

184
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:38.900
As an example one of them could be simulations and for example to give you a specific product any logic

185
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:49.610
as simulation software can potentially make predictions based on different models built into it of the

186
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:50.650
future performance.

187
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:58.220
So forecasting methods are not limited to having a solid data set behind it.

188
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.160
But the baseline baselining usually requires the data set.

189
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:15.000
Otherwise there is not much to baseline with and but as you can see the techniques and the the approach

190
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.290
that you use in both baselining and forecasting a bit of an overlap.

191
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.010
So this is it for this lecture.

192
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:33.120
I hope this gives you a little bit of a better understanding how to understand your data from the business

193
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:42.750
point of view from non hard scientific statistical point of view by just looking at it plotting it seeing

194
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:51.360
some dependencies excluding data points that noise and outliers and predicting the future performance.

195
00:19:51.360 --> 00:20:00.690
Plus Additionally we looked at some of the forecasting methods that go beyond using baseline and the

196
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.480
historical data set.

197
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:09.500
Hopefully that was useful and I hope to see you in one of the next tutorials.

198
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.210
And until then enjoy the course.
