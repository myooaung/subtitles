Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.930
My name is Vitale and today we're going to talk about the ultimate parade the principal or the principal

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.920
on steroids.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.700
How I would have liked to refer to it.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:23.100
So we learnt in the previous tutorials that the 80:20 rule is referring to 20 percent of the inputs

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.730
usually give us 80 percent of the outputs that we're intending.

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.090
This same rule can be applied consecutively and if we do it twice we will get to the equation that only

8
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.790
1 percent of the inputs will give us roughly half roughly 50 percent of the output.

9
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.370
So this is what I would call the ultimate or proto principle on steroids.

10
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.790
It's the ultimate way to prioritize things.

11
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.400
And you can apply it not only in the business world but also in the personal world.

12
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.250
And let me show you how how to do it.

13
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.400
Imagine that you have a task list or to do list for tomorrow and let's say tomorrow is Wednesday out

14
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:27.070
of all these tasks that are roughly of equal of equal value in terms of resources consumed of equal

15
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.120
capacity.

16
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:36.850
For example one man hour every one hour of your time tomorrow will equal one task.

17
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.850
You can quickly prioritize those tasks based on the intended output from them whether it's the amount

18
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.340
of work done per that task or the importance on in your life the pleasure you're going to get from doing

19
00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:03.420
things like your hobbies for example or the work related outputs for example money earned or whatnot

20
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.290
you can use the period of principle to prioritize your tasks and identify the precious few the 20 percent

21
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.510
that will give you 80 percent of the output if you try to apply the same principle to this list over

22
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.330
and over.

23
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.240
You should be able to get to only one task that matters the most.

24
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.950
That gives disproportionally large outputs compared to any other task on the list.

25
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:46.680
And what it would mean effectively that by doing just this one single task tomorrow would give you the

26
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.670
most.

27
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:57.690
In that timeframe and then you could think of allocating your time and effectively your resources elsewhere

28
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.630
and just stick to one task.

29
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.490
Or just simply prioritize and start with this task 11.

30
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.380
First get it done and then move on to the next next tasks.

31
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.220
So if there is any destruction that happens during the day and you will have to abandon your to do list

32
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.550
early in the morning you've already nailed the most important task on that list which has the biggest

33
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.890
output.

34
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.810
So this is what I would call the ultimate period of principle.

35
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:42.750
And again to recap effectively means applying your Pareto principle over and over until you get to a

36
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:54.690
very small almost single unit of the inputs on the left hand side that determines a big part disproportionately

37
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.100
big part of the outputs.

38
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.560
I hope you enjoyed it guys.

39
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.960
Thank you very much for listening and I'll see you in the next tutorial.
