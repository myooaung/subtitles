00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.650
All right homework challenge I hope you enjoyed the section on hypothesis testing and now it's time

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.420
to put your skills to the test.

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.240
And today we're talking about spoons.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.880
You are a consultant engaged by a factory which manufactures spoons.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.130
How cool is that.

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.850
All right.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:27.470
So the factory executives recently spent 10 million dollars 10 million dollars upgrading equipment and

8
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.070
processes in order to combat excessively high defects in manufacturing which were 23 percent at the

9
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.980
time which were leading to higher return rates from clients.

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.900
You have been asked to prove with a confidence level of 95 percent that the new equipment has improved

11
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.830
the situation and that the number of defective spoons has decreased to under 18 percent.

12
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.840
You have been supplied with a random sample of 150 spoons and found that 23 spoons have defects from

13
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.980
that sample.

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.730
So there you go that's your challenge for this section.

15
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.600
There are no hints.

16
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.580
This time it's all you.

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.050
It's all on your own.

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.930
Because you know everything you need to know to process this to actually get a result for this.

19
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.080
And you know there's a few underwater stones here that you need to look out for and maybe some excessive

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.130
information.

21
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.350
But other than that good luck with the challenge and I look forward to seeing you in the solution for

22
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.140
this tutorial.

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.070
And until then happy analyzing.
