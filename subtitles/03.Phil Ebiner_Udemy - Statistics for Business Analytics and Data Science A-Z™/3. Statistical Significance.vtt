00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.700
Hello welcome back to the course on statistics to day.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.210
We've got a very exciting topic.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.780
Statistical significance and it's very exciting because I know that from my experience from my career

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.380
it's a question that is always asked or at least you ask yourself this question is Marisol statistically

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.420
significant or not.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.840
Or are these insights statistically significant or not.

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.640
And if you don't understand the significance then it's a question that you read from your manager or

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.530
the person you're poring to because you cannot substantiate your results you found some stuff but you

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.220
don't know if it's right or wrong.

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.070
And in this section we're going to be exploring this concept in a lot of detail and we're going to be

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.960
referencing it a lot and you will get a great understanding.

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.190
Hopefully you'll be able to build a strong understanding of statistical significance.

13
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.890
However in this tutorial what we're going to focus on is in on the intuition Behi statistical significance

14
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.940
of what how you can link how you feel about an experiment to one actually statistical significance is.

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.700
So let's have a look.

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.110
All right so here we have gone experiment a coin toss.

17
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.540
I know it's always a coin toss but a coin toss is.

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.200
In all fairness a great example to get started with because it is so simple.

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.900
There's only two possible outcomes and you're already done this so many times in your life that you

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.050
know what to expect and that's why it will help us build intuition.

21
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.160
So there are two possible versions or two possible situations.

22
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.480
Kind of like we're going to start talking about hypothesis testing right now.

23
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.130
We're not talking about hypothesis testing we're thinking about two possible alternative universes if

24
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.900
you will if you want to put it that way.

25
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.870
So one possible universe is that in that universe it's a fair coin in that scenario in that environment.

26
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.690
But probably I like the way to put it as in that universe so in that universe that is a fair coin.

27
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.230
So that's that's our original assumption as far as age zero that's the null hypothesis that we are starting

28
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.900
off with.

29
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.030
And then one is the alternative universe or the alternative hypothesis.

30
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.960
Sometimes also called H A.

31
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.680
And in this universe this is not a fair point.

32
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.490
So we want to understand which universe do we live in or which situation or are we actually dealing

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.770
with or what is the truth.

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.130
That's what we're trying to assess is it a fair coin is the null hypothesis correct.

35
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.340
Or is it not a fair going and then the alternative hypothesis is correct.

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:31.070
And so the way we're going to go about this is we're going to assume that a zero or the null hypothesis

37
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.910
is true.

38
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.130
So again to assume that we live in the first universe and then based on our experiment we're going to

39
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.190
see if we can contradict that if we can come to a contradiction and say oh actually our assumption was

40
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.230
incorrect and we'll talk more about that at towards the end of this tutorial.

41
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.570
But for now let's assume that you've got a coin that you're tossing that some or somebody is going to

42
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.450
toss just now and you're assuming it's a fair coin.

43
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.120
We live in that universe.

44
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.690
So the coin is tossed the first time and the result is tails.

45
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.210
The question is how do you feel about this figure.

46
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.180
Forget about those statistics for a second.

47
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.750
How do you feel about this do you feel that this is a fair coin or that the coin is rigged.

48
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.430
You probably feel that it is likely a fair coin.

49
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.240
This is a totally probable outcome in that universe that we have assumed we live in in the Age 0 universe

50
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.680
the probability of that is 50 percent.

51
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.100
So it could have been has could have been tails no problem.

52
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.090
Then the coin is tossed a second time and tails again.

53
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.600
How do you feel about this now.

54
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.140
Do you feel that the coin is rigged.

55
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.500
Or do you feel that is a fair point.

56
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.050
Well let's look at the possibility of this happening in our universe that we're living in in the Age

57
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.520
0 hypothesis.

58
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.010
The probability of that happening if this is a fair coin is 25 percent.

59
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.900
So no big deal could happen then the coin is tossed again and again it's tails.

60
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.640
OK so what how do you feel about that now.

61
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.050
What do you feel about having three coins.

62
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.440
Three times the same coin is tossed and you get every single time it's tails.

63
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.770
Well you know it might be a bit a bit suspicious but it's fairly OK because in our universe in which

64
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.080
we live in in the age zero universe where the coin is assumed to be fair this could have happened and

65
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.960
the probability of that happening is 12 percent.

66
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.000
But then that coin is tossed again.

67
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.680
And guess what.

68
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.000
It's tails again.

69
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.800
All right so are you getting a bit suspicious now.

70
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.620
Do you feel that if this were a fair coin this would be quite hard for this to happen.

71
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.590
Well in the universe we assume we live in in age zero universe where the null hypothesis is assumed

72
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.210
to be true or will the new proposed is true and we assume we're in that universe.

73
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.260
Well in that case this could have happened with a ruler of 6 percent.

74
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.720
All right.

75
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.530
And then the coin is tossed again and again it is tails.

76
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.620
Now how do you feel about it.

77
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.960
How do you feel about seeing somebody toss a coin and then getting tails every single time.

78
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.360
Times in a row well you feel a bit.

79
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.470
Correct me if I'm wrong but I I'm assuming you feel a bit uneasy about that that you feel that something

80
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.450
might be going on here something is a bit not right.

81
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.290
It's a bit suspicious that this coin is has had tails five times in a row.

82
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.820
And your feeling is correct your feeling is natural because the probability of this happening if we

83
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.190
assume that it is a fair coin the probability of this happening is only 3 percent.

84
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.460
So if we assume that we live in a universe where the null hypothesis is true where the coin is a fair

85
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:44.420
coin we would have only seen this if likelihood of 3 percent meaning that you'd have to watch this experiment

86
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.400
on 33 different occasions like you watch it today you watch it tomorrow you're watching another day.

87
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.030
You don't have to watch it on 33 different days or 33 different times.

88
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.080
This experiment of five quintals would have to be conducted only once you would see the results so it's

89
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.470
a very low probability.

90
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.150
And that's why you're feeling of this is something something's going on here is completely valid completely

91
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.350
justified.

92
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.260
But then let's see what happens.

93
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.240
The coin is tossed again and this time it's yes what's tails again.

94
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.220
I know you are probably expecting heads.

95
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.310
Now it's tails again.

96
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.450
What do you think is going on here.

97
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.160
How do you feel about this going do you feel that it is still a fair coin to feel that our assumption

98
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.690
that it's a fair coin is correct or do you feel uneasy about that assumption.

99
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.860
Do you feel that something might be suspicious here.

100
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.390
And if you feel that something is suspicious here you are again very well just right even more so than

101
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.310
previously because of that happening is about 1 percent 1 percent only.

102
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.100
And then what is going on here is that the probability of this happening is dropping as you get more

103
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.520
and more tails.

104
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.760
And in terms of the Scorsone further down we'll be operating with the term P-value.

105
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.070
In fact we've already seen P-value is when we looked at the score table previously when we were looking

106
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.490
up the Zed's scores well in that table in the middle what you have is actually a P-value.

107
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:12.470
So you can see that the P-value is dropping that simply the probability of this happening given that

108
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.340
we are in a universe where the null hypothesis is true.

109
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:22.280
And this is very important to understand that if we're in this universe this universe then this is what

110
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.490
the P-value looks like.

111
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.910
It's very unlikely that you'll get six tails in a row.

112
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.360
However if you think about it for a second if we were in this universe where it's not a fair coin whereas

113
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.770
for example it's a weighted coin or both sides of the coin are tails that if you have a comment like

114
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.600
that if we are in this universe then these values will be completely different it wouldn't be like this.

115
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.600
The P-value would be 100 percent 100 percent 100 percent 100 percent higher and higher.

116
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:55.820
And so in if we lived in the second universe we wouldn't get that feeling we wouldn't get suspicious

117
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.750
over here.

118
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.510
We're even more suspicious over here.

119
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.630
We would totally be comfortable of this because we know that the coin has two tails on each side there's

120
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.510
a tails on the coin and therefore we would be totally comfortable with one.

121
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:14.930
1 tails in a row or two tails in a row three four or five six thousand or so we wouldn't get any uneasy

122
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.980
feeling about it if we lived in this universe.

123
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:23.150
However the way hypothesis testing works is that we assume we live in this universe over here at the

124
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.450
top.

125
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:30.140
The null hypothesis universe and then we want to see will we get whatever our experiment is.

126
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:36.580
Will we get uneasy and uneasy feeling about it and this uneasy feeling in mathematical terms.

127
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.900
You can't just come up to your boss and say or your manager or your client you can just go and say I

128
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.130
had an uneasy feeling about this.

129
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.740
I don't think it's true.

130
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.010
Of course you have to put in mathematical terms and that's where statistical significance comes in.

131
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.920
So statistical significance is basically this line over here is simple is that 5 percent.

132
00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.410
So that's where you started getting this uneasy feeling just as just after the 6 percent you started

133
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.660
being very suspicious about things going on.

134
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.500
And that's about right.

135
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:09.800
That's because as soon as something is 5 percent less likely to happen that's the alpha here then that

136
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:17.720
is like 5 percent is like 1 out of 20 so that's when we draw the line we say OK so that is it's so unlikely.

137
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.230
I am so unlikely to see this by random.

138
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.840
That's I'm going to reject this null hypothesis.

139
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:29.210
I'm going to say that because I'm seeing this and it was so unlikely to happen at random.

140
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.370
This cannot be true.

141
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:37.390
And that's where you say that I'm confident I'm rejecting this hypothesis of 95 percent confidence that

142
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.080
I'm 95 percent sure that we don't live in this universe.

143
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.890
There's a 5 percent chance that we do.

144
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.770
But I'm 95 percent sure that we don't live in this universe.

145
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.370
I'm going to reject that hypothesis and I'm going to state that we live in a universe where this going

146
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.670
is actually correct.

147
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.030
And you can set this confidence level to whatever you like.

148
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:59.080
You can set it to 10 percent and you'd be rejecting over a year.

149
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.350
You can set it to one percent you're going to be rejecting here so it depends on your experiment.

150
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.320
Most of the time 95 is a good level to go with but sometimes especially in medical trials and things

151
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:18.610
like that where people's lives depend on that the results or the confirmation or not confirmation or

152
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.160
like there is whether or not we reject the whole hypothesis.

153
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.670
In those cases you might want to sometimes require that you said it tonight and so depends on your experiment

154
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.540
and on your on what you're doing with those results.

155
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:38.140
But generally speaking this is what's descale significance all about it's the point where in human intuitive

156
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:45.040
terms you get uneasy about the null hypothesis being true and you get super suspicious about it in mathematical

157
00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.130
terms is just where you draw the line and you say OK I have enough confidence or like this a sufficient

158
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.190
level of confidence for me to reject the null hypothesis.

159
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.430
So I actually I'm going to state that we live in this alternate universe.

160
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:04.120
So there we go that's kind of the back of the intuition behind hypothesis testing and we'll we'll actually

161
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.440
talk more about hypothesis testing intuition further down and throw out these tutorials.

162
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.190
But more importantly this was a tutorial on the intuition behind statistical significance.

163
00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.650
And as you go through these tutorials what I encourage you to focus on is to develop a gut feel for

164
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:21.790
statistical significance.

165
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:30.610
So it's one thing to run to calculate the formulas write out the equations and understand if something

166
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.060
sophistical statistically significant or not statistically significant.

167
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:41.530
But at the same time it's an additional benefit if throughout this tutorials you kind of think about

168
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.370
what we're talking about here that you don't just run the calculations and do the mathematical side

169
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:45.930
of things.

170
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.250
Also think about it from an intuitive perspective.

171
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.160
Think about it.

172
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:55.060
Do you feel uneasy about those numbers do you feel as something suspicious is going on or not and then

173
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.060
see what the mathematics tells you.

174
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:03.220
And that way you will be able to slowly but surely develop this gut feel for statistical significance

175
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:09.880
and sometime in the future in your career you'll be easier for you to apply these things and just look

176
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:16.920
at a problem and without even doing the math not have an answer right away but at least have some ideas

177
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:23.050
of where this all can go and whether or not this problem is likely to be or this conclusion is likely

178
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:29.410
to be statistically significant or not and especially beneficial when or if you already or when you

179
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:36.040
become like a manager if that's your goal or like a an executive because you want sometimes you just

180
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.740
don't have the time to write those things out.

181
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.540
But you can look at results that are being presented to you and you can assess those things in you know

182
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.710
your mind very quickly.

183
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.340
So there you go.

184
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.340
Hope you enjoyed this tutorial statistical significance and I look forward to seeing you next time.

185
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:51.820
Until then happy analyzing.
