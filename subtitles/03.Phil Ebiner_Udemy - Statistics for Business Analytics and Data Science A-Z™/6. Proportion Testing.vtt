00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.740
Hello welcome back to the course on statistics.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.650
Today we're continuing our journey into the world of hypothesis testing and we're adding on a new version

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.490
of hypothesis testing for portion testing.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.420
So let's have a look.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.150
A new business challenge again according to a 2016 survey.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.840
A staggering 58 percent of American households have tablets.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.500
Your manager has asked you to test the hypothesis of a 97 percent significance level that only 58 percent

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.760
of American homes have tablet devices.

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.980
You surveyed 100 random household and found that 73 of them had tablets.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.840
So what have we got going on here.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.570
Well the first thing is of course the challenge.

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.720
This is a real statistic.

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.280
So it's about 58 percent.

14
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.090
If you look at different sources it's around there.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.080
I did add though the staggering part of American households because it just makes it sound really cool

16
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.310
that's back in 2016 people thought that that was a lot.

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.580
Probably that's more by now especially by the time you are watching these tutorials.

18
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.100
If it's further down the track and your manager has already already had a feel for that he already had

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.430
a feeling that is probably greater than that.

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.040
And so he asked you to go out and test this hypothesis and the whole concept here is pretty cool in

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.630
itself.

22
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.760
Even without having to report to a manager or working for a business you can just take any statistics

23
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.140
on the Internet that you're interested in and you can check if it's changed.

24
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.620
All you have to do as you'll see from the down.

25
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.250
You just have to survey like 100 random samples or maybe less depending on how you construct your test

26
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.730
and based on what we're going to discuss.

27
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.660
You're going to know better how to construct these tests and you can check without having to wait for

28
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.110
another year before New results are released and so on you can check if it's true or not.

29
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.350
So you might be interested in a different statistic.

30
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.400
You can approach it with the same methodology and then just for yourself with your small random sample

31
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.490
of 100 people or households or whatever it is find out what's the real situation in the world is if

32
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.430
it's increasing or decreasing and things like that.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.760
All right.

34
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.360
So let's get started on the hypothesis.

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.760
We have sustained our null hypothesis the hypothesis first.

36
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.130
So no hypothesis is that 58 percent or fewer homes households have tablas.

37
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.370
So P is less than 50 percent and P is the new thing that we're working with is that proportion.

38
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.450
So as you can see here Brucey would you.

39
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.200
We work with means so so many hours or so many dollars and so on.

40
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.450
But here is actually a proportion so what proportion of your population says does something or doesn't

41
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.290
do something in this case.

42
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.410
What proportion of question has tablets.

43
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.020
What proportion of the households have tablets and tablets by tablets we mean like tablet devices such

44
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.930
as iPads and so on.

45
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.990
And yes so but other than that is going to be very similar.

46
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.730
The only thing is just keep in mind that we now are going to have to let her Ps that Eleanor P for the

47
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.920
proportion of p for the p value and are two separate piece.

48
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.130
And your alternative hypothesis is that more than 58 percent of households have tablets and you can

49
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.790
tell that we want to look at more is because it says only 58 percent so meaning that anything to the

50
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.740
left is kind of like expected.

51
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.230
You already have prior knowledge that number of tablets is probably going to go only going to grow and

52
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.890
therefore you just want to check if it has grown or not.

53
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.020
And so as usual which is going to draw or distribution or we hear the some new things are going to happen

54
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.970
or we have to take into account some new things for a proportion test as opposed to just a standard

55
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.600
hypothesis test with means.

56
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.950
So here what we are going to have is first of all we need to do two checks.

57
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.560
Very important.

58
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.960
We need to check that and times p hat is greater than 10.

59
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.350
I'd rather be had.

60
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.630
So p as your population parameter for the proportion so what's the real situation in your population.

61
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.840
The hat is what you measured.

62
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.770
In our case we had to 73 divided by 100 so that's 70 percent.

63
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.700
And what this is saying is that 73 percent times the number of people in your population should be greater

64
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.310
than 10 so 73 percent times 100 is 73 should be granted and that is correct.

65
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.010
So basically it means that logis of ledges are the next one you know will make sense so here we're saying

66
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.710
Q Is one minus be so that percentage of people that don't have tablets in their homes and that should

67
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.720
also be greater than 10.

68
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.470
And so one minus P is zero point twenty seven twenty seven hundred point twenty seven and the heart

69
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.080
is 27.

70
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.500
So this is also correct as are both of these are saying just that in your sample or the number of observations

71
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.330
that said yes.

72
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.590
And the number of observations that said no they both have to be greater than 10.

73
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.240
So in this case asked to be more than 10 households who which do have tablets and more than 10 households

74
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.590
which don't have tablet so that's important condition that you always have to check before doing a proportional

75
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.380
test.

76
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.780
It just it does not meant that just means you need to increase your sample size until that is met.

77
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.790
Very straightforward.

78
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.430
And we have some new formulas which we need to take into account.

79
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.600
So the mean of the population is actually equal to P and the standard of the population is equal to

80
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.530
the square root of P-Q.

81
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.070
Now we're not going to derive these formulas here.

82
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.340
I might include historial in the course later on to derive these formulas but I don't really think it's

83
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.030
necessary as long as we know that these formulas are like that that this is what we need to use and

84
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.090
we then can apply them in practice.

85
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.540
But other than that maybe we'll talk about them sometime in the future.

86
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.400
For now let's just go ahead and apply these formulas.

87
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.700
All right.

88
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.130
So that's going to be our.

89
00:05:53.150 --> 00:06:01.220
I mean is it just equals Tupi that's how proportionate testing works and send division is equal to square

90
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.720
root of P-Q.

91
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.460
Here you can see the sampling distribution.

92
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.040
So that's where you see the mean of p hat and stand version of jihad.

93
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:15.080
And just as we did with the sampling distribution of means this is a sample sampling distribution of

94
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.090
proportions.

95
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.740
So basically we're taking lots and lots of samples from our population and in each of those samples

96
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.020
instead of kallikrein I mean we're now calculating the proportion and the central limit theorem tells

97
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.380
us that this is how the proportions will be distributed.

98
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.110
They'll be distributed normally around this mean p hat.

99
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.840
So this is a distribution center.

100
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.320
Remember how we had eggs bars inside the distribution.

101
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.890
This is a distribution of people.

102
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.600
So all of the possible samples of size 100 that you could possibly take from your population and then

103
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.490
look at those proportions in those samples.

104
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.660
This is how they will be distributed.

105
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:58.040
And now let's proceed to our calculation so I just left all the necessary things at the top to make

106
00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.970
some space.

107
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:08.070
And our calculations are very very similar to what we had previously inside hypothesis testing for means.

108
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:14.170
So we had this myu is equal to myu the of the population and is equal to P..

109
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.480
In our new formula is equal to zero point fifty eight.

110
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:25.040
That same thing that's from the central limit theorem then a sigma or some is equal to the square root

111
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.970
of pusillus calculate that.

112
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:33.270
And remember here we need to take the population parameters of 58 percent that we are assuming is correct.

113
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.570
So we're living in this universe.

114
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.860
We think that this is correct so we can take 58 percent times one minus 58 percent is 42.

115
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.400
He was a square root of zero point forty nine.

116
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:48.960
Then we take the standard deviation of the sampling distribution and according to the central theorem.

117
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.460
Same thing as before.

118
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.470
Sigma divide by square root of an serpent and I divide by skirt of 100 which is 10.

119
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.390
And so zero point zero for the night.

120
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.260
And then we've got pea hat which is zero point 73.

121
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.380
That's we calculate that 73 divide by 100.

122
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.920
So just based on this I'm just curious.

123
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.310
Remember we talked about developing a gut feel for the physical significance.

124
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.710
And so before we start proceeding with their next steps from here what do you feel like.

125
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.980
What do you feel that this is going to.

126
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.020
This hypothesis is true.

127
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.350
Or do you feel that it's not true.

128
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.000
So let's just go through this.

129
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.190
We know that previously it was 58 percent of people who have tablets in their homes.

130
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:41.150
You found that 73 percent out of 173 people out of 173 households out of 100 have tablets and mobile

131
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.040
phones tablets.

132
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.580
So what does it feel like.

133
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.810
Does it feel like too much or does it feel like you could have randomly sampled a hundred households

134
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:57.770
and it's it's fair that with a quite a high likelihood you could have gotten 73 percent 73 households

135
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.970
that do have mobile tablets.

136
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.220
So what does it feel like.

137
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.170
Does it feel OK or does it feel a bit suspicious.

138
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.620
If you couldn't tell right away like after we've done these calculations what does it feel like now

139
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.660
you already know that now you know a bit more from these calculations.

140
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:20.270
You know that's OK so the sound thinking of this distribution assemblage you have 58 percent here in

141
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.740
the middle and your PC or your standard deviation is zero point zero or 49.

142
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.730
So it's quite narrow.

143
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.950
It's like like that and the you pick the hat is zero point seventy three.

144
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.210
So it's somewhere here.

145
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.810
So this is Troy.

146
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.100
What impression does that give you now.

147
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.100
Do you does it feel like too much or OK silica.

148
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:47.960
Well now we can even though we are full Follett's yet calculating Nozette score we can estimate where

149
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.800
this will be.

150
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.460
We know that's standard deviation is about 0.7 49 so it's it's less than 0.05.

151
00:09:54.530 --> 00:10:03.310
And the question is how many jobs will it take from here to here in 0.05 terms so from zero from here

152
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:10.250
one 0.05 jump will take us to six point zero up to about 62 or zero point let's say 62.

153
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.080
In percentage terms it's 63 percent and other jump.

154
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:20.620
So another sound deviation will take us to sixty eight percent and another jump will only take us to

155
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:27.330
73 percent so this is sitting at around three standard deviations away one to three.

156
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:33.610
And as we are in you know ninety five percent ninety five point four percent of our observations fall

157
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:41.440
into two standard deviations and into three standard deviations we have to have ninety nine point seven

158
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.280
observations of these.

159
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.960
The hats fall into ninety nine point seven so basically are doing the score calculation.

160
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.400
We already found out what we kind of did it in our mind here but what is this is saying is that ninety

161
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.230
nine point seven percent of the time you'd run this experiment.

162
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:06.340
You would not get this p hat getting this p hat is very similar to what we discussed before about the

163
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:12.100
coin that it takes six goes six flips of a coin to get six times in a row tails when you have a coin.

164
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.810
It's only like a 1 percent chance.

165
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:15.930
Same thing here it is only like a 1 percent chance.

166
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:23.180
So let's just do the calculations to concrete this and so there is that score P minus knew he had to

167
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:23.710
by Sigma.

168
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.180
He had to calculate that.

169
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:32.340
So plugging plugging in this this value minus this values of the distance divide by zero point zero

170
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.350
for nine basically.

171
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.130
Same thing as we did in our mind.

172
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.190
It's just three point 0 six a bit higher than three.

173
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.360
And so now if we calculate the score.

174
00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:47.800
So let's really we don't calculate we just look at the table and we find that table we're here.

175
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:55.200
So if we now calculate three point or six and it's important to remember it's always the whole area

176
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.990
on the left so from here to the left so you will have to subtract something from that.

177
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.630
Well one we need we need the area in the right so we just have one minus whatever we get.

178
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:12.680
So 3.0 6 3 0 0 0 6 there is so nine nine eight nine.

179
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.500
So let's have a look.

180
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:20.180
B minus one point minus one month zero point nine hundred nine zero point alone.

181
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.850
And so this is not 11 percent.

182
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.680
This is zero point eleven percent.

183
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.450
So the result is zero point 0 0 1 1.

184
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.410
And then if you turn the percentage Zero Point percent so it's less than 1 percent.

185
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.760
Sometimes this can be a bit confusing when you go from here to percentages and then you might think

186
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.190
slopes is actually 0.1 percent.

187
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.450
And so as we discuss remember that example of the coin toss.

188
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.390
There's only a 1 percent chance to get six tails in a row.

189
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.970
Well this is even less than that.

190
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:55.090
This is like getting like eight like nine tails nine times you flip a coin and you get tails.

191
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.300
Every single time.

192
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:03.130
So there is even less than what we had before and you know like in your experience how often would you

193
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.800
get nine tails in a row.

194
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:11.290
Very low and likely So that's why this is a very unlikely hypothesis very unlikely a universe that we

195
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.870
live in that we know that these things are distributed like that from the Central in a theorem and we

196
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:24.100
still managed to pick out 73 homes households with or a hundred households are which 73 of them had

197
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.970
tablets.

198
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:31.240
So therefore this is just like in our universe it's very unlikely close to impossible as zero point

199
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.510
to learn.

200
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.460
Percent chance of that happening and it's definitely less than 3 percent chance because we were asked

201
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.170
to test a hypothesis were 97 percent significance level so it's definitely less than 3 percent.

202
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:49.690
So therefore with a 97 percent degree confidence we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative

203
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.480
hypothesis.

204
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.870
In fact as you can see from here we can even reject the null hypothesis with a 99 percent confidence

205
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.000
with ninety nine point eighty nine percent confidence a very high degree of confidence.

206
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.730
But since we are asked to do the 97 percent we're doing 97 percent.

207
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.760
And by the way since you have this alpha you can take that approach with the rejection region if you'd

208
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.630
like to.

209
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:18.070
There might be some good practice to look up 97 percent in the P-value table and then calculate the

210
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.400
zid critical and do this same problem.

211
00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.240
But through the approach of our rejection regions.

212
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.980
So there we go I hope that that was useful and I'm glad we had a chance to go through the intuition

213
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:36.280
behind things so that you kind of can see how to think about these things intuitively and as you can

214
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:42.310
see even just by selecting 100 only 100 random household not thousands not tens of thousands would just

215
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.220
100.

216
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.130
We can get such strong results like.

217
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.840
Ninety seven percent significance level.

218
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:54.160
Well partially it is attributed to the fact that it's changed so much from 58 percent to 73 percent

219
00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:00.550
if it was like if you say 100 million households and you only got 61 percent then this would be different

220
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.380
because this would be this would be the same this would be the same.

221
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.310
This would be different so this would be less 0.60.

222
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:13.270
And this would be less so and this would be much smaller so it wouldn't be three points or six would

223
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.890
be much smaller and therefore you wouldn't get that so good.

224
00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:24.340
Another good exercise for you if you like is to just kind of experiment and or do like reverse engineered

225
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:30.610
this problem and find out at which level what number you would have to have here for this to be exactly

226
00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:31.470
3 percent.

227
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:39.400
So at what level if you found how many households do have tablets out of 100 would not be able to reject

228
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.590
an all hypothesis.

229
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.850
That's a good exercise as well to help you understand when you reverse engineer a mathematical problem

230
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.460
like this.

231
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.280
You kind of like creating it yourself.

232
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.440
You better understand what's going on in the background so it's a it's a great opportunity for you to

233
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.130
practice feel like.

234
00:15:54.130 --> 00:16:00.560
So what number has to be here instead of 73 for this percentage to be exactly 3 percent.

235
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.670
And on that note I hope you enjoy today sectorial and I look for you next time.

236
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.300
Until then happy analyzing.
