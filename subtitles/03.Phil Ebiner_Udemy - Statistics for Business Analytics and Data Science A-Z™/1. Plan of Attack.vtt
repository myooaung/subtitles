00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.590
I'll write another section.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.040
So let's have a look at what we've learned here in this section we're going to learn them one statistical

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.740
significance.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.050
So we're going to talk about what it all is and we'll look at a very basic example hypothesis testing

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.820
to help us develop the intuition around it and it will show us what exactly is statistical means.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.470
Then we'll talk about hypothesis testing the steps involved in a full hypothesis test and we'll actually

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.640
go through a live example.

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.340
Then we're going to be doing some hypothesis testing in terms of region rejection will be just a quick

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.630
tutorial to demonstrate.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.280
The second approach or the there's actually two slightly varying versions of the hypothesis test that

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.500
you can take and we're going to cover both of them.

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.360
That's what the story is all about.

13
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.970
There are going to be talking about hypothesis testing assumptions.

14
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.130
So the important assumption that by hypothesis testing and you'll notice that this is quite a long tutorial.

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.800
That's not because our assumptions are complex you'll see that they're actually very simple and logical

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.170
assumptions.

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.180
But at the same time we're going to be talking a lot about the Indu intuition behind those assumptions

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.760
and also the underlying potential pitfalls that exist with those assumptions.

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.400
So that's going to be an interesting choice in terms of the way you look at assumptions and hopefully

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.000
we'll discover some some new things about these assumptions possibly something that you may have not

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.350
considered before and hopefully that will help you avoid making certain mistakes in the future.

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.930
Then we're going to be talking about proportion.

23
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.880
So it's another type of hypothesis testing slightly different as well but also very popular.

24
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.430
It tests instead of just testing the mean old test proportions in your population and samples are also

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.700
very powerful techniques.

26
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.910
And finally we'll have an exciting homework exercise at the end of the section and that's what we have

27
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.600
planned for this part of the course.

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730
And I can't wait to see the first girl.

29
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.480
Until then happy analyzing.
