00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Narrator] The Java Cryptograpy Extension

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.020
is by far the most common provider

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.060
that you will use as a Java developer.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.000
The JCE as it's also known by,

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.040
is the default provider for Oracle Java,

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.050
and in fact, it comes out of the box

7
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.070
with every JDK download.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.070
Now the JCE provides implementations

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.030
for every single engine, however it does not

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.000
support every algorithm or every variation

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.070
of those algorithms that exists in the world today

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.080
and as such, you may need to use third party

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.040
providers to do the work that you want to do.

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
Now I wanna talk a little bit about the concept

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.080
of the unlimited strength JCE.

16
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.040
Prior to Java 8, update 151,

17
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.010
JCE Unlimited Strength was a separate download.

18
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
What this essentially meant, was that key sizes

19
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.060
could not be used if you did not download

20
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.070
this separate piece of software.

21
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.050
Now since Java 8.151,

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.070
the JCE Unlimited Strength is now included by default

23
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.030
with the JDK download, however, it's turned off.

24
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.030
There's a simple property, called crypto policy,

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.040
that you need to set to unlimited

26
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.040
if you are using Java 8.151 or greater,

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.030
Up until you get to Java 8.162.

28
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.010
And in Java 8, update 162, the

29
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.070
JCE Unlimited Strength is not only included,

30
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.020
but it's enabled by default, and in fact,

31
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020
the same exists in Java 9 and Java 10

32
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.050
and we assume that Java 11 will have the same thing

33
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.030
at the time of this recording.

34
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.050
Now, this course will leverage the

35
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.040
Unlimited Strength JCE, and key size support

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
is the main impact that we will experience.

37
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.070
There are a few algorithm options that may not exist,

38
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.080
that we may be tied into, so as such,

39
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.090
you need to be using the Unlimited Strength JCE,

40
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.030
and you really have two ways of doing that.

41
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.090
The first is to upgrade to the latest version of

42
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.030
Java 8 or greater that you are using, in which case

43
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.070
it will include the Unlimited Strength JCE.

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.010
Now if you can't upgrade to that, then go to

45
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.060
Oracle's website, and go to the Java SE section,

46
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.060
and download the JCE Unlimited Strength

47
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.000
specific to your version of Java.

48
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.010
With that being said, I highly encourage you

49
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070
to be on the latest and greatest Java,

50
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.000
simply from a security perspective.
