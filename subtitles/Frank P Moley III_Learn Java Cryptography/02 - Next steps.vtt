00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Instructor] So now that we've gone through the JCA

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.040
and cryptography, you may be asking yourself what's next.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.090
And I'd like to talk a little bit through that.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.010
But before we jump in, let's do a quick recap

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.090
on what we focused on in this course.

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.070
We started with a general discussion of cryptography

7
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.010
and crypto in java itself.

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.030
We looked at the history of cryptography

9
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.090
and we talked about some terminology

10
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.020
so that we could level set on the language

11
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.030
that we're all using when discussing crypto.

12
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.080
We then went into discussions of encryption,

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080
both asymmetric and symmetric

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.000
and did code examples of both of those.

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.040
We then talked about cryptographic hashing

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.040
and how to create a method to do a cryptographic hash.

17
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.020
We dug in a little bit into the complexity

18
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.050
of password hashing and talked about leveraging B crypt

19
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.090
for passwords in your real world scenarios today.

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.000
And finally we concluded with a discussion

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.030
of both digital signatures and Java KeyStores.

22
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.020
So what is next after that?

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.090
I highly encourage you to investigate

24
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.000
the other algorithms that are available in JCE.

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.010
There's slight variations in the way that you use them

26
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.040
and the only way to really experience them

27
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.060
is to get practice with them.

28
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.070
In addition to understanding the algorithms in the JCE,

29
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.050
it also would benefit you to investigate

30
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.030
when to use which algorithm.

31
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.090
Some of them are not supported by the JCE,

32
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.020
which is when you might then

33
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.060
jump into library like Bouncy Castle,

34
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.020
which I highly encourage you to read about,

35
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.060
study, and understand when it's worth bringing

36
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.070
that large jar into your class path.

37
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.020
And as always when it comes to technology,

38
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.020
I encourage you to play with it and learn.

39
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.070
The only way you're really gonna get crypto in Java

40
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.010
is to do several iterations on it

41
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.020
until it becomes second nature.

42
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.030
Now I really wanna take some time to thank you

43
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.030
for the time that you've dedicated in this course.

44
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.070
And I want to insure you that my commitment to you

45
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.010
does not end when you close your browser today.

46
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.060
In reality, my commitment to all of my courses

47
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.020
continues long after they're actually published.

48
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.020
I get responses quite often from followers on Twitter

49
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.090
and you can follow me @fpmoles and tweet at me

50
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.060
if you have questions about this or any of my courses

51
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.070
here in the LinkedIn learning library.

52
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.040
I also do collaborate with people when they have concerns

53
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.040
through my GitHub account, which is github.com/fpmoles.

54
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.080
So once again, thank you for your time,

55
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.020
and I really hope that you've gotten something valuable

56
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.080
out of Java Cryptography.

57
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.000
So until next time, thank you and happy learning.
