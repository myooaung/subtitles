00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Cryptography is literally

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
translated from Greek as the study of secrets.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.070
In computer science, we are looking

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.050
for developing strategies and practices

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.050
for protecting the most sensitive data

6
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.080
at rest, and in motion.

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.080
Hi, my name is Frank Moley.

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.040
I am a software technology

9
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.000
and security developer and architect.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.030
I spend much of my time writing software

11
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.080
for globally distributed systems where

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.010
the privacy and secrecy of data is of the utmost importance.

13
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.040
I have been involved in the software industry

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.010
in many different aspects for over 16 years.

15
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.020
In this course, we will start with some very basic

16
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.060
crypto concepts to level set

17
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.040
about the terminology that we will use.

18
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.030
We will then take a look at how the JDK

19
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.090
organizes its interfaces and providers

20
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.030
while focusing on the built-in JDK provider,

21
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.000
the Java cryptography extensions.

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.080
From there, we will look at the various engines

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.090
at play in the JDK to allow the developer

24
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.000
to do his or her job in a secure fashion.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.080
This course is not designed to teach cryptography,

26
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.060
but instead to teach you the basics of how

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.030
to consume the crypto libraries in Java.

28
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.000
So with that, let's get ready to secure some data.
