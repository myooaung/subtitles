00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] In order to truly be successful

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.020
in this course, there's a few thing things

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.020
that you need to know.

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.070
First and foremost is Java itself.

5
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.020
All of our development will be using

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.010
the Java programming language.

7
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.080
So, I need to expect that you have a basic understanding

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.040
of how Java works, the syntax,

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.090
and the program flow through in it.

10
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.070
Now, we're gonna be using Java 1.8 or greater,

11
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.020
and I highly recommend that you have

12
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.020
the latest versions of that JDK installed and on your PATH.

13
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.010
We're also gonna use Maven 3,

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.020
but only to handle dependencies.

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020
So, you'll need to have Maven 3 installed

16
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.050
and also on your PATH.

17
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
I'm gonna be using IntelliJ, the Ultimate edition,

18
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
but you can use any IDE that you're comfortable with,

19
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.090
including VI, if you want to.

20
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.050
I expect you to have basic knowledge

21
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.030
of how to use your IDE of choice.

22
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.030
Again, noting that I am gonna be using

23
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.040
IntelliJ Ultimate edition.

24
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, we're gonna use JUnit throughout this course

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.010
in order to test our cryptographic functions.

26
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.050
As such, I expect you to have

27
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.090
some very basic JUnit knowledge.

28
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.050
Now, we're gonna use JUnit 5 in this course,

29
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.060
however, in reality, you can use anything that you want,

30
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.070
including simple main methods,

31
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030
to test these cryptographic functions.

32
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.000
And, that's really all you need to work in this course.
