00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.355
Welcome back.

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.520
In this video, I'm gonna show you how you can

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.490
download the versions and how to set the environment.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.485
But in the Mac operating system,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:15.990
because you might have a multiple versions and you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.780
don't know how to cite multiple versions.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.060
Okay, let's see how we can do that.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.100
The first thing, as I mentioned,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.950
go to OpenJDK, okay?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.420
And that you can find different versions of Java.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.775
So what do I, what do we need?

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.605
We need Java 11.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:36.840
So you can go for Java 11,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.295
general available devotion, or you can go to the updated builds up to 011.2.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.940
So what I did,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.850
I download a d dot dot z.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.885
Is that okay?

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:51.020
And I downloaded it and I extracted the file and I keep it in.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.690
My machines are under okay,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.170
so my hard disk and we have a library unreliability,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.210
we should see some, okay,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.565
So we have a Java here under the Jarrah,

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.175
we have a Java virtual machines. Just double-click on it.

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.740
Now you should be able to see that at different versions,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.445
JDK and JD get 13 and JDK 10.

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:18.485
But now I don't know when I render Java or whenever execute a Java file.

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.180
I don't know which version it will be

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.065
take or which version it will took to execute the code.

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.140
So now I need to know what is a default version.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.825
So in order to know that opening a terminal and you can simply type Java iPhone version.

00:01:35.825 --> 00:01:37.685
It'll tell you what the version is available now.

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:41.990
So now the available version is Open JDK version 11,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.385
which means you are good to go.

00:01:43.385 --> 00:01:45.680
But in case if it is not anywhere mission,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.795
how you can modify that.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.705
So the way we can do that, simple,

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:55.070
I'll go to your Mac and then you can find out your user,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.975
correct, under the user,

00:01:56.975 --> 00:01:59.450
you'll have for a file example.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.490
Now I can see the hidden files,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.335
but normally when he opened the first time,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:06.995
you won't be able to see the hidden files here.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:08.630
Okay, So in order to enable them,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.095
you need to use Command Shift dot.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:16.010
Now, you should be able to see the hidden files.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.880
So the file which you're looking for is bash underscored profile.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.255
So right-click and open it text editor.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:28.010
Now you should see here Export Java home library, Java virtual machine.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.910
So JDK 11.11 O.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.195
So that is a reason when I look for what is a default version,

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:37.640
it gave me 11.2.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.915
Okay, so if you want to make my JDK tennis activation,

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:48.290
so what I can do, I can simply come on this one and uncommon this one.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.415
So just save the file and close it and try to open a terminal again.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:56.420
Okay?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.200
So the version will not impact immediately.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.850
So you need to close the terminal and reopen it again.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.830
So I'm going to open a terminal again.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.860
Now I'm gonna try what is the default version?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.395
See now the version changes to 10.2, right?

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:16.985
That's what we're looking for.

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:20.960
But we're going to work on Java 11.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.650
So I want to make my Java 11 as a default one.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.510
So what we need to go to you,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.090
dry your user account and there you'll find

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.080
the bash profile and open with text editor and make sure

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.935
you comment out D and wonder volition and income and D and D,

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:43.040
the one you wanted, which means that year 11 in our case.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.235
So just to make sure I'm going to open a terminal one more time.

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:52.505
And I'm going to check whether Java version is points to see.

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:55.520
We are good to go. Okay, so in the next video,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.745
I'm gonna show you how we can do the same thing in a Windows machine.

00:03:58.745 --> 00:04:00.630
Thank you.
