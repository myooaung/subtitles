00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:04.380
So let's try the second mentor.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.345
The first method which we tried using Padlet off and the multiple parameter,

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.145
I'm in the sequence of parameter.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:13.950
So now let's try the URI.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.875
So the first thing i now to get the path,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.960
I need to get the URI,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.670
which is available in java.net.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.370
So URI here, I need to use e or i dot create.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.105
So here what we need to do,

00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:35.440
we need to provide the path, right?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.890
So we know the path right?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.655
So under Users slash,

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:48.710
slash and the desktop and slash test.txt,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.505
you might think how it can be done in Windows, Windows operating system.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.920
It's now much harder.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.915
So it is pretty much the same.

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.790
So instead of like that,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.120
you can provide d dr and I have a folder called iron and other folder,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.160
I have a x-dot or test.txt,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.720
which is pretty much the same thing.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.845
Because in, in Mac and Linux we don't have the drives,

00:01:12.845 --> 00:01:15.650
physical drives, so we are using the users,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.675
but they will have Windows, you can use a drive.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:19.999
So now I have the URI.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:24.845
So the paths that AF murder the second type is taking your a as a input.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.030
So can you try that?

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.175
Okay, so let's try.

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:30.170
Path is the colored pad,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.910
one Patt dot of metadata.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.580
So we just take that URI as an input.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.665
So that's the URL I'm going to use,

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:41.330
which you create are right now.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.555
So now I'm going to check whether this is a existing using Xist math.pi.

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:51.695
So let's copy them will exist as well.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:56.060
Copy here and paste it here and exits to one.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.500
And here is where do they exist?

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.770
One.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.835
Okay, so now we actually the same thing you can do differently.

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:07.415
So ultimately we need a path.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:09.350
So right-click and run it.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.530
Now, you should be able to see the path.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.350
Okay, so, okay, so when you're trying

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.260
to write a code like this where you might end up with an issue

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.080
when you're using specifically you are a because we need to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.965
specify the URI because you are a can be Intranet address,

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:26.720
it may be HTTPS.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.920
But now we are looking into my local physical drive, my hard disk.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.515
So we need to mention something like I'm looking for a file here.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:40.115
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna provide the extension.

00:02:40.115 --> 00:02:42.185
I'm looking for a file here,

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:47.060
File and color entry slashes.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.175
So save it and then it again,

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:50.435
you might end up with the issue.

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:53.765
So make sure you're uploading files when you're using QRA.

00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.970
See now we've got both of them on existing.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.355
Okay, so let me try something.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.690
Invalid file that test 1 dot txt, which is not available.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.890
I'm looking for a false answer, right?

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.090
So run it now.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.540
So now you've got, okay,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.335
so what a problem here where you still seeing through it's supposed to be false, right?

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.590
So test.txt.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.070
Okay.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.625
So part IRI file study existing.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.785
Ok, So it is supposed to be a part one.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:29.000
That is a problem with doing. They're doing hobbyist exist when it's just on save.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.785
And let me run it again.

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:34.070
Now we should be able to see the first one is existing,

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.130
so it is written is true and the second one is not existing.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.675
So we did enter files.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:43.430
There are a lot of the major changes inner part level,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.770
you might think how it can be done without,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.295
but there are other ways to do that before Java 7.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:53.015
So now you can use a class loader.

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:55.820
You can use a class loader.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:04.860
Or we can use our file file input stream.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.360
And then you can use buffered stream.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.135
And the advanced one you're going to spot.

00:04:14.135 --> 00:04:18.455
And at sometimes you're gonna, it's a scanner has a lot of different ways to do that.

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:22.730
Okay, So this well, we use path

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.885
the tumor types of matter one using the multiple parameters and sequence.

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:30.080
I mean segregating your path into multiple pieces.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.690
And the second, you are a and make

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.515
sure when you're using your'e unit to mention, are you using,

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:38.690
are you trying to look up your local file or you're trying to

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.180
look for any they've said you are when you're using,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.590
you've said you have to make sure you're not providing the file here. Right?

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.900
So let's see it in the next video with another Fisher.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.440
Thank you.
