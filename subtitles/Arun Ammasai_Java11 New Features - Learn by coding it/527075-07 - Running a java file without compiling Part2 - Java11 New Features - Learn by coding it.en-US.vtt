00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:02.550
Welcome back.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.870
So let's modify the class which we already created here.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.220
Like so I have only one class.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.025
Now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create multiple classes here.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:19.590
So class a and which contains on, let me copy this one.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.375
Copy that main method from here.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:22.815
I don't want to rewrite them again.

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.965
So copy and paste.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:32.265
And this is going to be class 1, class a.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.325
Now what I'm going to do, I'm going to copy the entire class.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.950
I'm going to repeat it two more times until we can tell me.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.860
So and this is going to be my class B and this is going to be

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.005
my glass C. So I had to change this ASL.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:51.935
So now I have a three different classes. Okay?

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:57.590
So if i, the file has been saved as a Java versus Java C.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.105
So if you execute the file,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.690
it has to execute this public static void main method,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.310
which is available in the Java,

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.855
java C class, but it will not because class yay,

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.235
available in the first place,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.995
so it will exit the class here. I'll show you that.

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.645
So let's go back to the terminal.

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.815
So I'm going to clear. So let's see.

00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:24.245
Let me remove the class feels like or m dot star dot Java.

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.105
Okay, so see here,

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.145
now, I have only one.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:32.240
Java for omega device.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.890
Looks like.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.260
So let me save it again.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.200
Control C, Control S. Save

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.520
this until we shall replace.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.010
Okay, so now go back to terminal and look for ls.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.110
So now we have everything.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.605
So our m dot star dot class,

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:02.120
I wanted to run a class file.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.320
Now do Alice.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.330
Now we have a Java file.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.840
So let's try to under same file with the Java space.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.190
And this is Java 11, right?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.405
So I don't have to provide a Java C.

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:19.115
Have you seen what happened?

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:20.450
It's approach to execute,

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.590
welcome to Java 11,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.900
but it is printing class a,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.230
which is available in the first-place classy.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.090
Okay, so you might think, okay,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.335
let me copy the class C and put it under the Class B until S.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:39.635
Now, go back to your terminal and try to run them again.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:43.370
Now you see classy because class is available in the okay,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.190
so class okay, it's supposed to be class B, right?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.325
Yeah. So class B is available the first place.

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:51.070
So let me read a normal time.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.460
So now we have a class B,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.680
okay, so now what I'm gonna do, okay,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.740
let me put the class shallow S's Java C in

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.305
the beginning to just make sure whether it is working based on the order.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:06.785
It is just a, We just double-checking again.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.065
See now we've got welcome to Java 11.

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:11.360
So since Jarrod 11,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.390
the file name you saved,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.195
it doesn't matter even though the file has been saved as a Java,

00:03:17.195 --> 00:03:18.785
java C dot Java,

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:24.455
it will still consider the first class file which is available in the file.

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:29.330
So it is against how we used to quote, normally,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.810
that is a rule when you're creating Java fail that Java file must

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.085
be saved with the class name dot Java.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:39.770
Okay, So the reason why we are saying that,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.400
because at the moment when you're executing the code or exiting the file

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.680
will only that particular class main method

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.330
will be executed, but it's seen as Yahweh alone.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.525
It is changed. So doesn't matter

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:54.140
how many glass rod dead always the first class will be executed.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.130
The order matters in channel 11.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.850
Okay.
