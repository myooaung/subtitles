Hayes and welcome to this new tutorial and this one we're going to make a function that will convert

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,600
the questions that are right now in strings to list of encoding integers and why are we doing this.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,870
That's because we will need that function for this final step right after this to toile to set up the

4
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,440
chat between a chat but and us.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,700
So let's make this function.

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,750
We start with def.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,710
We're going to call that function converts Well let's say string to int and that function is going to

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:39,480
take two arguments the first one is the question and the second one is word to int which is a dictionary.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,280
So it can either be the questions word in Dictionary or the answers words to any dictionary.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,170
All right so these two arguments.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,930
And now let's define what it has to do first before making that conversion we're going to clean everything

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,490
in the question and we have a nice function for that that we made which is the clean text function.

13
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,700
So that's why I'm going to take my question which is one of my argument and I'm going to clean it.

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,390
Thanks to the context function.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,470
And of course this quintic function takes the question as input and now we can make the conversion.

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,480
And to make that conversion we'll first we will return directly what we want to return.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,300
That is the question as a list of encoding integers.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,710
And therefore since we want to return a list I'm going to introduce here some square brackets and I'm

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:35,280
going to use this for loop inside the list trick that you know we've done several times in this course.

20
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,900
So there we go for.

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,650
And we're going to loop over of course the word in the question.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,750
So for word in question and then remember we need to add that split with some parenthesis to get the

23
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,460
words separately.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,240
And so what are we going to do for each of the words in the question.

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:02,220
Well we are going to convert them and for that we're going to use our word to ant dictionary but we're

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:09,570
going to use a trick which is to get function because the problem is that we filtered out some words

27
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,590
that were not frequent.

28
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,250
You know among the least frequent words we filter them out and therefore they do not exist in the dictionary

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,690
but they might exist in the question and we're using just get here to make sure that if this nonfiction

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:32,010
word is not found in the dictionary whether out token ID will be returned remember we made an out token

31
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,440
for each of these non-African words and that's why in this get function we are going to input first

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,000
the word that we're dealing with right now.

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,720
And if this word doesn't exist in the dictionary.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:52,290
Well we'll return the word to inte dictionary of the key which is the out token.

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,060
All right so that it returns the unique integer encoding outspoken otherwise it will get the unique

36
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,500
integer idea including this word based on the mapping of this dictionary.

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:03,820
All right.

38
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,340
And that's it.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,570
That's just a function we had to make here.

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,660
Congratulations.

41
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,710
We are ready to set up the chat so we'll do that in the next tutorial.

42
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
And until then Id been on the.
