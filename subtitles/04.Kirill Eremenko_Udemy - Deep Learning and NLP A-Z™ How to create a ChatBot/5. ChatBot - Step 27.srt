Hello and welcome to this new tutorial and this one we're going to load the model input that is we're

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:12,950
going to load the inputs of our set to morrow and to do this we have a great tool for this which we

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:21,870
actually made ourself which is the model input function that we made in part to building the SEC moral.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,230
That was the first one.

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,890
This one here that returns the inputs to targets the learning rate and the key probability hyper parameter

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,840
and we chose a learning rate of 0.1 1 percent and keep probability of 50 percent.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,110
All right so we're going to use this function basically to return all these model inputs that will be

8
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,350
just one line.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,210
Very easy.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,320
Let's do it.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,550
So the first thing returned by this function is the inputs.

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,690
That's basically the questions that will feed into our set to SEC Network.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,340
Then we also have the targets which are the target answers the answers to the questions target.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:12,140
Then the third element returned by this function is the learning rate L R and finally the fourth and

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:21,020
last elements returned by this function is the keep prob parameter keep probability and all of these

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:29,190
these four elements are the four elements returned by our model inputs function.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,170
All right so let's get all these inputs by executive on this line and there we go we have the inputs

18
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,520
to target learn rate and the key probability parameter.

19
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,290
So another quick and easy step.

20
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,930
Right now it's pretty calm but then we're going to have a storm when starting the big main part of the

21
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,110
training but no worries we will survive it.

22
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,450
So now I'll see you in the next tutorials to do some other quick steps and then we'll start this main

23
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,380
part of the training until then.

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,360
And Jaideep an Audi.
