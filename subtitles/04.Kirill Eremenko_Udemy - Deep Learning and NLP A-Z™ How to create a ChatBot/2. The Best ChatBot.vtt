00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.750
Is welcome to this to toil in this one I'll be super happy to introduce to you the best chat but implementation

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.470
I have found on the Internet.

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.810
So this implementation is by the author Suria depan run.

4
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.500
So huge congrats to him.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.350
He made an awesome wrapper for the SEC the SEC moral and besides he wrote two articles explaining dyslexic

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.460
morale and how his model works.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.470
I'm going to provide Of course these two articles.

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.420
So that's the first one.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.050
And that's the second one.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.210
On this practical sectors like model he implemented.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.050
So I strongly recommend to read these two articles and that is his or her page where you will find his

12
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.260
model and the model I'm going to give you is based on this model only I simplified it a lot for you

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.590
not to get lost and see mostly the parallel with what we implemented before you're going to see that

14
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.510
I modified the code I modified the comments so that you can find yourself in the code and mostly recognize

15
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.070
what we implemented before.

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.970
So no need to clone or download this Rabo Well you can actually do it.

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.430
But since I'm providing a totally different folder.

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.050
Well I rather recommend to download this folder and this folder you can find it in the resources of

19
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.610
it all you're watching right now.

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.110
So on the course content page on you to me go to this lecture and then you will find the resources not

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.820
only the folder that will contain the model that is this best chat but there are also these links of

22
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.820
this first article on Jedburgh SEC the SEC and practical SEC to say the second article and of course

23
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.810
the link to this page and this fourth thing here is just to show you that people had a lot of errors

24
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.540
when trying to import this moral but I managed to make it work for you and you're going to see the results

25
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.170
are absolutely amazing.

26
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.610
I'm telling you this might be the best job.

27
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.800
But on the Internet.

28
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.330
But of course if you find another one like that I'm very interested in knowing.

29
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.800
And actually I would like to provide the best models in this course and always keep them updated.

30
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.230
So now please download this zip folder on the resources of the Statoil.

31
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.650
That's the thing you should do.

32
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.960
And then once it's done.

33
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.220
Well follow me.

34
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.370
Since this implementation was made on tenso of flow 0.12 been one.

35
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.440
Well the first thing we're going to do is install a new virtual environment that we're going to call

36
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.290
the best chat but and that will contain tons of low 0.12 porn one.

37
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.550
So let's do this let's install this virtual environment.

38
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.890
All right.

39
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.550
So on your computer for Mac Linux users open the terminal and for Windows users opened an echo on the

40
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.430
prompt that you can find by going to the list of programs then finding Anaconda and then a second prompt.

41
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.400
And for Mac and Windows users just open the terminal.

42
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.360
There we go.

43
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.290
The terminal is opened for you Windows users.

44
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.330
Please have your an icon that popped open.

45
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.210
And now we are on the same page.

46
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.060
And so now what we have to do is as we did for our chat about virtual environment we have to answer

47
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.690
the Create minus and the best shot.

48
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.900
But that's the name of the virtual environment we're creating by.

49
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370
Equals three point five.

50
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.150
We have to be on site and 3.5 and then anaconda to install it in Anaconda.

51
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.130
All right and then just press enter and it's going to install this virtual environment that we called

52
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.500
the best chat.

53
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:50.710
But with by 3.5 inside Anaconda then you have to press Y and then enter to say just yes you would like

54
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.160
to install this.

55
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.440
So that's basically what we've already done with our previous virtual environment.

56
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.670
And it should be very quick because we already installed bison 3.5.

57
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.610
All right perfect.

58
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.750
Then the next command you have to enter is for Macs and Linux users.

59
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:21.870
Source activate the best shirt but for Windows users the same thing but without the source.

60
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.780
So for Windows users just type activate the best shotput and this command is to activate this virtual

61
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.110
environment to get inside of it.

62
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.110
And then once we're inside of it we will install tens of 0.12 on one.

63
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.860
So now I'll just press enter.

64
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.930
All right and now we were inside the best chat but virtual environment.

65
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.540
All right.

66
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.850
And so inside of it what are we going to do.

67
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.500
Well we are going to install tens of low 0.12 on one which we can do with the following command tip.

68
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.290
So that's the same for Mac Linux or Windows users.

69
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:08.220
Install then 10 server flow and then be careful to double equals 0 point twelve point one.

70
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.610
And then just press enter.

71
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.010
All right.

72
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:18.380
Collecting tons of flow 0.12 1 1 require an already satisfied and Stallin collected packages produce

73
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.150
a booth and tons of low end successfully installed tens of 0.12 on one.

74
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.210
Perfect.

75
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.660
So now you have your virtual environment the best judge but that contains tens of 0.2 of 1 1 and that

76
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.200
will allow us to run this best shot.

77
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.590
But in my opinion inside and out and speaking of Anaconda we'll go right now to an update on just closing

78
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.700
the terminal.

79
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.460
And let's go to Anaconda.

80
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.030
Anaconda Navigator.

81
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.670
And then in the navigator.

82
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:59.660
Don't forget to connect to this new virtual environment that we just installed by going to applications

83
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.900
on and clicking on the air here and then.

84
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.800
So that's our previous virtual environment chat but but then we want to go now to this new virtual environment

85
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.350
that we just created the best Shadbolt.

86
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.580
There we go.

87
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.450
That contains tens of flow 0.12 on one.

88
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.750
All right so we are connected and now we're going to launch spider inside this virtual environment.

89
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.460
So Spider is launching.

90
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.640
And there we go.

91
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.550
We are inside spider.

92
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.500
All right so now what we're going to do.

93
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.120
So the zip folder you downloaded from the resources of this lecture which is called by the way the best

94
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.520
chat but please put it anywhere you can find it easily on your computer.

95
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.590
So me I put it on my desktop and file explorer.

96
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.730
I just need to go to desktop here and there we go we have to keep an LP.

97
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.660
It is a folder that was a file that contains this whole implementation we made up until here.

98
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:04.420
But then there is this best book that I unzipped because the resources you have the zip folder just

99
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.650
adds a bit and you will find the best Shadbolt later.

100
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.640
So then just go inside because you have to be inside his father which is the working directory folder

101
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.530
to execute this jabat.

102
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.090
So I'm just quickly going to describe the file here.

103
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.500
So this first file is a data processing python file that will just preprocess the data.

104
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.540
Then Same here that's kind of some data processing as well but more specific to natural language processing.

105
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.790
Then we have these two files that you might recognize.

106
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:43.260
You know these containers for example some dictionaries for the answers here and the questions.

107
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.890
Then this is the data set and by the way this is not the Cornell data set which is interesting this

108
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:54.860
is another data set which is actually the Twitter data set and this other data set works very well for

109
00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.150
us because you know we want to build a general conversational chat but that can talk about anything

110
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.670
to anyone and we'll actually Twitter is perfect for that because on Twitter you can talk about anything

111
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.820
and besides you talk on Twitter like you would talk to your friends.

112
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.570
So that's another great data set.

113
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.970
And I think it might actually be better than the corner data set because you know sometimes the movie

114
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.900
lines are not exactly like in real life.

115
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:25.060
You know it's always researched with a little style to make it exciting.

116
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.070
And on Twitter it's like it's a little bit more natural.

117
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.770
So I think it would be an even better dataset.

118
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:37.020
And I think it's great that you can have two chat but one trend on the Twitter day is that.

119
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.950
And one of the trends on another day is that like the corner dataset and then this fell this is the

120
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.360
big file that contains the wrapper of the SEC the SEC.

121
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:52.310
MORELL So that's basically the file that will implement the building and the training mostly of the

122
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.310
SEC to sec model we can actually have a look at it.

123
00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:03.350
So as you can see I entitled it part three training sectors like model and you will recognize a lot

124
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.700
of what we did.

125
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:11.390
There are a lot of common things we did in our implementation and this sector Seck wrapper implementation

126
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.920
here.

127
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.550
So following all the tutorials we've done together will help a lot.

128
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.360
Understanding this great implementation.

129
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.940
So I'm just going to close this.

130
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.090
And there we go.

131
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:29.850
Here we are with our best shot but that is the file that will run to chat with our chat.

132
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:37.370
But and as you can see it contains the exact same structure as we made for jabat implementation.

133
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:43.730
First we bought the libraries then part one data pre-processing we import the data set here which is

134
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.740
the meta data data set that is right here you can actually have a look at it you can open it with a

135
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.950
text editor.

136
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.480
Then here we split the data set into the training set and a set classic and data processing.

137
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.100
Then here we do some embedding.

138
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.890
We saw that also for our implementation then part to building the sectors like model.

139
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:11.140
Well we of course use the SEC the SEC wrapper to build it and then Same for this part three training

140
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.290
sectors like more.

141
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.810
Well I invite you to see the training part in the same SEC to sec wrapper python file.

142
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:26.240
And finally in part 4 we test the SEC to signal the same way by first loading the weight and running

143
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.070
the session.

144
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.800
So we opened the session here and actually the weights are gathered here.

145
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.790
Which leads me to the last element of this for there the Wades father here which contains the weights

146
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.780
in the same format as the weights we got after a few hours of the training which I remind was definitely

147
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.350
not enough in our chat but implementation.

148
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.470
Let's go back to the working direct folder.

149
00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.720
So these are the weights.

150
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.410
So there we go you have all these files.

151
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.400
All you need to run this chat but.

152
00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.630
And so that's exactly what we're going to do now.

153
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:06.790
We're going to run it just I finish with this part 4 here we define the function that gets the chat

154
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.660
but responds when we ask it a question.

155
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.730
And then here we set up the chat in a more simple way.

156
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.790
Thanks to all the data processing and other files here that do some great processing of the data and

157
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.100
the text to interact with the chat.

158
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:28.470
But so if you're ready we're now going to execute this jabat and watch the awesome results.

159
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:35.170
So to run this model there is nothing more simple just to select everything here and then just press

160
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.160
control or command to execute.

161
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.210
And there we go.

162
00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.180
Now we have to wait a little bit.

163
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.890
It is setting up the chat and soon enough we should be able to chat with the chat.

164
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.190
But.

165
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.670
All right.

166
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.710
So a few seconds left I think.

167
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.260
Start chatting below you know there we go.

168
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.790
Almost ready to chat with the chat.

169
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.890
But and there we go.

170
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.090
So as you see I introduced yourself as you.

171
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.990
And then the chat with will be Chad.

172
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.780
But all right so what do you want to say first.

173
00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.490
Well let's chat like we would chat to our friends.

174
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.860
Let's just say hi.

175
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.870
For example.

176
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.620
So high.

177
00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.670
What does it say.

178
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:17.430
How's the weekend.

179
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.680
Well the weekend was great actually actually.

180
00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.970
Today is Saturday December 23rd and it's the weekend.

181
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.330
So my weekend is great thank you.

182
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.790
I will just say great.

183
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.230
An answer.

184
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.050
You're welcome.

185
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.660
Yeah well very polite chat and very friendly.

186
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.930
So you see it's really talking like a friend.

187
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.100
What can I say now.

188
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:48.550
Well I'm going to play a little bit with the Twitter subjects that were going on in 2017.

189
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.020
For example I can ask.

190
00:12:50.150 --> 00:13:01.310
So this is a classic if you know it but I can ask who won the first prezzie then show debate because

191
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.960
you know there is a lot of conversations on politics on Twitter.

192
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.670
And so if I press enter.

193
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.760
Well the jab replies Trump will be a better time for men.

194
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.530
And that's the Chulbul replying that nobody else.

195
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.690
So you see Archibold that has a little sense of humor.

196
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:28.900
And then if I say hey happy birthday have a nice day because you know this chat but was just born today.

197
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.570
Well if I press enter the Chabert will say thank you.

198
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.000
So that's really really some good results.

199
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:43.260
But of course these results were cut after a long time of training and mostly a lot of experimentation

200
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.280
a lot of hyper parameter Kunin you know Arshiya.

201
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.780
But with our frustration of course we're going to try to improve it.

202
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.140
But as the developer said he did a lot of parameter Choong.

203
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.610
He tweets a lot of parameters.

204
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.350
He improved a lot of data processing the data processing is a much better one than ours and we will

205
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.830
have to improve ours because you know there is a lot to experiment on the data processing.

206
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.100
For example the percentage of the non frequent words that we filter out we can change that.

207
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:18.690
For example we can decide to only include in the training the questions and the answers that have a

208
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.260
minimum number of words.

209
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:26.590
We can also change the max length and by changing all this we might get some great results.

210
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.110
And so I really encourage you to experiment with the chair.

211
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.600
But if you want to go deeper with mine and again if you want to go deeper with this one I wont be offended.

212
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.690
This is a great one and that besides contains a lot of common points with what we implemented and most

213
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:48.840
importantly if you followed all the tutorials you will have no problem understanding each one of these

214
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.190
files because this is very similar to what we implemented.

215
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:58.650
So right this is the best job but it is true and you can use it you can play with it you just have to

216
00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.270
do exactly what I did here.

217
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:04.420
Don't forget to install the virtual environment because this was implemented intensive.

218
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:09.610
0.12 upon one and therefore doesn't work with Tenterfield 1.0 point zero.

219
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.170
So don't forget to do that and have fun and mostly keep up the good work.

220
00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.460
Never stop learning.

221
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:21.060
And again I'll be very interested to see your comments on the jabat implementation.

222
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.860
Feel free to give your suggestions.

223
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.170
I really want to improve this and I will have much better chance to improve this.

224
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.010
If we are all doing this together all right and right now it is December 23rd so I am wishing you some

225
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.390
merry Christmas.

226
00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.400
If you're watching this Statoil either tonight for the most motivated or tomorrow.

227
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.610
And of course for the rest of you when you watch this later I wish you a great journey and deep learning.

228
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.800
Artificial intelligence.

229
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.610
All these fascinating fields that you can be proud to be part of.

230
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.760
And I'm telling you you made the right choice.

231
00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:01.320
We have some great deal coming in of this field and it's amazing that you take part in this incredible

232
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.460
technology.

233
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.590
So on that note I'll tell you goodbye.

234
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.510
I wish you some great holidays.

235
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.340
And until then in Japan I'll be.
