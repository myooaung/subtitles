1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,290
Now, let's practice how you plan to events and evaluate after you escape to safety the next time you

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,840
encounter a real and imminent threat.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,540
Let's start with events how you will report what happened to the authorities.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,680
Here are 10 pieces of information that would be good to remember and report after an assault.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,290
Number one, what your assailant said or did to threaten you that made his intent clear, like any threats

6
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,510
he made, what words he used, the tone of his voice and his body language.

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,170
Number two, what your assailant had in his possession that he used to threaten or hurt you, which

8
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,760
goes to his means, like when and how he drew any weapons and, if possible, where it ended up after

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,550
the assault, in case the authorities can try to retrieve it.

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,680
Number three How your assailant approached you, where he moved, how close he got to you, and how

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,140
quickly which shows his opportunity.

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,650
Number four, What you did in response.

13
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,930
What you said if, when and how you tried to and finally managed to escape all of which speak to preclusion.

14
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:29,430
And exactly what, if anything, you did to fight back like if and when you drew a weapon where you

15
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,060
hit him?

16
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,300
How many times and what happened when you did?

17
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,550
Number five describe the moment at which you made the decision to use force if you did and why you made

18
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,270
that decision.

19
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,770
Number six Note exactly where he touched you on any part of your body and or your possessions.

20
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,440
So the authorities can try and take samples of DNA or fingerprints.

21
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,380
You may be taken to a hospital for this if you aren't there already.

22
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,280
Number seven Who else was present before, during and after the assault?

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,060
Who may have witnessed what happened?

24
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,920
How far away they were?

25
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,250
And any identifying information you can give about them?

26
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,390
Number eight, how long the whole confrontation lasted from when you first felt the threat of his intent

27
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:26,280
to after you've escaped to safety number nine, what your assailant looked like was wearing and any

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,450
distinctive features that might make it easier for the authorities to identify him.

29
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:39,270
Number 10 If you know it, definitely give them his name, his age, his height, his home or work address,

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,470
his license plate and or the make and model of his car.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,020
Pick three of these pieces of information that you will focus on and pay extra attention to.

32
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,140
With every encounter and interaction you have this week, this is your events homework for the week.

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,220
Carry a notebook with you or use a note taking app on your phone to jot down what you notice about each

34
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,860
interaction for all three pieces of information.

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,130
This will get you into the habit of noticing and remembering this information for when you will need

36
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,820
it most.

37
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,470
Now for Evaluate, let's figure out how you plan to process what happened both immediately and long

38
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,400
after the assault.

39
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,750
Who will you go to for help and counsel and support?

40
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:32,740
One good thing to do is to save the number for the National Sexual Assault Hotline into your phone.

41
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,670
Also, if you know any attorneys, especially any who specialize in sexual assault or abuse, track

42
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,830
down their phone number and program that into your phone, too, do you have a therapist that you would

43
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,030
feel comfortable telling?

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,910
Or maybe an H.R. rep at work keep their number ready in your phone as well?

45
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,970
How about your personal network, it will help to have somebody you know really well and trust to talk

46
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,170
to you about it, to someone you know will believe you and support you?

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,180
Can you think of who that might be?

48
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,510
How about your family or your closest friends?

49
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:15,050
Write down the names of one to three people and make sure their numbers are in your phone to possibly

50
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,280
even on speed dial.

51
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,800
If you don't feel comfortable calling someone, you may want to write about it instead.

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,760
There are a number of online forums and chat support lines.

53
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,750
Some even anonymous, that you can reach out to as well.

54
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,930
So if that's an option you'd prefer, find one that you feel comfortable with and bookmark that link

55
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,710
somewhere you'd be able to locate easily in the heat of the moment.

56
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,180
Lastly, I want you to pick one mantra or phrase that you will remember and tell yourself every day

57
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:54,950
this week to remind yourself that you're OK, that you are strong, that you deserve to feel safe.

58
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,090
So pick one short phrase that best embodies this for you.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,800
Perhaps something I've said in one of these videos or something a friend or a famous figure said once

60
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,460
that really stuck with you or a catchy phrase that you write yourself.

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,860
I have a simple three sentence, six word mantra I wrote that I use for myself.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,480
But you use whatever works best for you.

63
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,970
Write it down in at least three places that are regularly visible to you in your everyday routine.

64
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:33,410
For example, I keep my mantra on a post-it note at my desk, on my phone background image and on a

65
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,170
nifty little drawing I made for the inside of my car.

66
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:44,660
Seeing it every day will help infuse this mantra into your psyche so that if and when you do experience

67
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,620
any kind of trauma, it will be right there in the bosom of your brain.

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,920
Ready to help you deal and heal?

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,850
This is your evaluate homework for this week.

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,380
First program your phone with all those people's numbers from your chosen support network and then pick

71
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,260
your chosen mantra and put it in three places.

72
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,870
You'll see every day and then look at it every day this week.
