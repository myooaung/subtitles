1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.150
Well, hello there.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.860
It's lovely to meet you.

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.770
This is the tough cookie self-defense system.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.040
You are here to learn how to feel safer and stronger wherever you go, whether you're staying home alone

5
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.510
or going to work or walking your city at night or traveling in a new city or just living your life.

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.180
And that is exactly what this training will do.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.080
I'm going to teach you the mental and physical skills you need to protect yourself in any situation,

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.460
ideally without ever having to fight but being ready to, if necessary, fighting not good.

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.040
But he must fight.

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.940
We.

11
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.400
So who am I?

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.390
I'm Rebecca on not and not hung on as in the opposite of off as in get on with it already.

13
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.770
I am a trained martial artist, self-defense instructor and former stunt woman who has also survived

14
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.260
my own share of violence and abuse.

15
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.400
I created Tough Cookie to fill a gap I found in my own search for a more comprehensive self-defense

16
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.020
training that spoke to a woman's experience from a woman's perspective because self-defense is not about

17
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.600
fighting.

18
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.260
Self-Defense is about survival.

19
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.340
Period.

20
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.660
That's why we call ourselves survivors, not fighters.

21
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.920
It is still self-defense if you don't fight at all yet.

22
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.880
Yeah.

23
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.120
So let's talk overview, here's what we're going to cover in this tough cookie self-defense course.

24
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.690
This training series consists of eight modules, each containing videos that describe and demonstrate

25
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.040
that week's lessons and then homework assignments for you to practice them on your own.

26
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.430
The eight modules are laid out in a super simple, logical order of steps for your self-defense.

27
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.600
Each module will teach you the next step in this order.

28
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.880
I call these The ABCs of self-defense because they're as easy as the ABCs and because they're laid out

29
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.600
as such.

30
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.970
First step is a for a void in this lesson, you'll master your situational and self awareness both what's

31
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.110
around you and what's happening in your body as you react.

32
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.830
Your gut intuition, you'll learn what to look out for and how to assess any suspicious behavior or

33
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.820
potential threats.

34
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.370
So you can avoid them entirely.

35
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.860
That is your very best case scenario.

36
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.890
Next is be for BackTrack.

37
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.730
This is your one and only goal in self-defense not to fight, but to escape to safety.

38
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.930
If you must fight in order to get away to safety, then do so, but only as far as is necessary to get

39
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.760
away and no further.

40
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.120
So in this lesson, you'll learn how to use your situational awareness to keep an eye on escape routes

41
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.510
and identify people and places of safety.

42
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.440
So you know where to escape to that safe from the danger in front of you?

43
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.700
After that is see for control.

44
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.900
This lesson covers what to do if you cannot get away to safety and how to then maintain control of yourself,

45
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.150
both physically and mentally.

46
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.180
We'll cover your ready stance and how to use your body and voice to set boundaries.

47
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.070
Get warning and call attention to yourself, which may also help de-escalate the situation and prevent

48
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.480
physical confrontation.

49
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.180
This also helps protect you legally.

50
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.420
We'll cover the legalities of self-defense so you know where to draw the line, both for your local

51
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.750
self-defense laws as well as for your own conscience.

52
00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.820
Next D For a defendant, this is the most traditional part of this self-defense series, and no self-defense

53
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.590
training would be complete without it.

54
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:11.390
If you cannot avoid, evade or de-escalate the situation, then you are going to need to actually physically

55
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.830
defend yourself.

56
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.370
We will go over a basic set of moves that you can use in any situation and practice using them against

57
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.170
the most common types of attacks.

58
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.590
The key is to not overcomplicate it with fancy maneuvers that you're not likely to remember in the moment,

59
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.090
but you use the same simple moves over and over that you know will be effective and easy to remember,

60
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.530
and only insofar as to help you escape to safety after you get away to safety by any of the previous

61
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.980
steps.

62
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.920
Then we go into E!

63
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.900
For events and evaluate, because once you've escaped to safety, it's still not over.

64
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.930
This is where far too many self-defense trainings fall short, but this part is just as important,

65
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.490
if not more so.

66
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.660
This is the time to seek help and speak up both for your own sake and for the sake of your assailants.

67
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.410
Next target.

68
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.210
About 75 percent of sexual assaults go unreported, and less than one percent of assailants are actually

69
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.780
punished.

70
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.610
That needs to change.

71
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.580
We'll go over how to find an authority figure or law enforcement and report what happened, what to

72
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.910
say and what evidence to give reporting.

73
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.210
What happened can also be incredibly beneficial for your own recovery, because the more we talk about

74
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.480
these things, the more support we all have and the bigger difference we can all make.

75
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.210
We are stronger together.

76
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.930
Remember, you are a survivor, not a victim, and you are not alone.

77
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.980
The last step is f for familiarize.

78
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.060
It is vital to your survival that you make each of these steps and moves muscle memory.

79
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.090
In the moment danger strikes, you will not have time to stop and think about what to do.

80
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.780
You will only have a split second to react, so we will go over ways that you can practice these steps

81
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.180
in your own home with what you already own.

82
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.500
Over and over and over until they become instant.

83
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.960
Practice is the key.

84
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:27.170
The more prepared you are, the better equipped you'll be to stay safe wherever you go.

85
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.520
And that's it.

86
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:36.260
Just six steps as easy as a b c d e f, this is your step by step guide.

87
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.540
A veritable alphabet soup of.

88
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.310
Has to navigate any sketchy situation, like when you're alone in a dark alley and you hear a weird

89
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.670
noise, or when that guy looks at you kind of creepily and gives you the goose bumps, or when someone

90
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.900
you know, crosses your personal boundaries and makes you feel uncomfortable.

91
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.020
When that happens, all you need to do is breathe and remember your ABCs.

92
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.010
Take these steps one at a time in this order.

93
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.590
If you can't achieve step a, you move on to Step B and so on down the alphabet.

94
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.650
The bottom line is just to keep it all super simple.

95
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.900
It's really just common sense.

96
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.050
All self-defense should be common sense.

97
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.560
There's more to being strong than having big muscles.

98
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.000
You're a tough cookie.

99
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.150
We value intuition, resilience and mental strength as much as physical strength.

100
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.220
They are two sides of the same coin, and both are vital to your survival.

101
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:43.180
So as you go through your tough cookie self-defense lessons, keep that in mind and be sure you practice

102
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.410
and cultivate those mental skills as much as the physical ones.

103
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:52.930
I focus on both equally in this self-defense system, so make sure you do too.

104
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:59.950
You'll want to bring all of your mental focus and your physical readiness with you to every lesson.

105
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.660
You'll also want to have a few physical items with you now in terms of clothing.

106
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:12.010
I recommend wearing items that you both already wear often and can move around in easily without injuring

107
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.170
yourself or, you know, the clothes.

108
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.870
The idea is to train in conditions as close to real life as possible.

109
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:27.580
For example, I will be wearing my usual t shirts or attentats and jeans with a good amount of stretch

110
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.060
or mum.

111
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:34.390
But if you normally wear dresses or skirts, then please practice in those so you can get used to what

112
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.600
that will feel like and be like then for shoes.

113
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.990
I normally wear boots or sneakers, so I will be practicing those.

114
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:48.880
But if you normally wear heels, I might recommend first drawing these lessons in no hue or low heel

115
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.230
option and then advancing to train in your heels the second time around.

116
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.430
And I definitely recommend not attempting these moves in flip-flops.

117
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:04.540
If you normally wear sandals, try to wear a pair that has a heel strap or some other means of securing

118
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.560
your shoe to your foot so it doesn't fly off when you kick the run.

119
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:15.010
Then in terms of other equipment, you'll want some sort of sturdy padding option that you can practice

120
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.460
hitting when we get to that deep or defend model.

121
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.980
So let's see what you have around the house that could work.

122
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.310
You could use a firm pillow or mattress or large foam roller or even your couch.

123
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.280
Whatever you can find, the firmer, the better.

124
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.940
If you have any kind of large canvas bag, you can fill that with something firm, but with a little

125
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.860
give like raw rice or beans or glass beads.

126
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:48.400
If you're a crafter or dirt or sand, if you have any access to that protest, too much dirt or sand

127
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:55.000
will make your bag too heavy, so you'll want to pack around small amounts of that with something lighter

128
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.600
and softer, like rags or old clothes, baseball gloves or other large hand gloves.

129
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.340
Also make excellent striking pads, especially to use with a buddy.

130
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.060
Now, if you do already have any actual martial arts or boxing pads, then you are definitely set.

131
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.250
Or if you're willing to buy one.

132
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:23.650
I do love this square punching pad that I got on Amazon, and I paid less than $30 for this large canvas

133
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.970
heavy bag on eBay.

134
00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.540
But you don't have to buy anything if you don't want to.

135
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.330
I'm not going to make you shell out more money.

136
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.530
You could absolutely learn all of this with things you already own.

137
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.450
The only other thing you'd ideally want for these lessons is a training buddy.

138
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.890
Now, in these hard times, that might be a bit difficult to come by.

139
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.430
If you do have a housemate or partner who's also interested in these lessons, that perfect, you can

140
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.500
learn and practice together.

141
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.900
But if you live alone or if no one in your household is keen on letting you practice on them?

142
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.680
Fear not, you can still learn all of this on your own.

143
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.640
I recommend figuring out a way to rig up that sturdy padding we talked about, so it stays at striking

144
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.430
height without you having to, you know, hold it up.

145
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.530
It will need to be rigged.

146
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:20.200
Pretty sturdy, though, because you will be practicing hitting it as hard as you can.

147
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.210
We'll build up to that.

148
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.550
But the idea is to train it as realistic of conditions as possible.

149
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:35.020
That means using your full force in a high, adrenalized state and from all sides and angles so you

150
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.160
can get used to what it feels like to hit and be hit.

151
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.340
Now, obviously, to be hit hard is a little harder without a body, but we will make it work.

152
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.660
The idea is to push yourself further than you have before further than you're comfortable further than

153
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.520
you even think possible.

154
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.740
Because your assailant won't care where your comfort level is, they will push right past it.

155
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.140
And so should you as you train.

156
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.490
You won't know what you're fully capable of until you try.

157
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.940
That said, pacing is a different thing.

158
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.190
We all got -- to do.

159
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.950
And times are particularly tough right now.

160
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.120
Now, that may mean you've got gobs of free time you don't know what to do with.

161
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.820
But it can also mean you're busier than ever.

162
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.100
This is very small time commitment.

163
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.170
Just an hour or two a week.

164
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:30.340
But these modules are here for you whenever you're ready for them.

165
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.110
So go at your own pace.

166
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.760
You don't have to do one module a week.

167
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.710
You can take a few weeks if you need or months even.

168
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.120
That's not ideal, but hey, if it's all you got, I'll take it.

169
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.630
Remember, this is not a style or a sport.

170
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.160
You don't need any fancy martial arts moves or a certain belt.

171
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.120
You just need these simple steps and a new frame of mind.

172
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.860
Self-Defense is an instinct you already have inside you.

173
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:05.170
You just need to learn how to harness it and find the courage to use it.

174
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:11.140
We'll go more into each of these ABCs in greater depth in the following videos.

175
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.730
So grab your laptop and your courage and away we go.
