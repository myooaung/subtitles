1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.000
Our next ABC deep or defend is our meatiest and probably most eagerly anticipated.

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.300
So let's dive right on in and learn how to actually physically defend yourself.

3
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.600
Now, remember to keep in mind the boundaries we learned in the last module, including the legal limitations

4
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.620
and consequences.

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.030
I cannot stress enough how these moves you're about to learn should only be used as a last resort and

6
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.900
only as far as is necessary for you to safely escape to safety.

7
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.200
But if you absolutely cannot escape without using force, then let's teach you how to fight back.

8
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.300
Remember egress?

9
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:56.020
Well, that same acronym Initialism can help you remember how and where to strike eg, as also stands

10
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.360
for eyes or ears, throat, groin and shins or stomach.

11
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.840
These are the most sensitive and effective spots to strike when you need to damage your assailant enough

12
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.340
to say it with me.

13
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.450
Escape to safety You may also recall another handy acronym used in the movie Miss Congeniality.

14
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.890
Same as I MGM stomach, instep, nose and groin.

15
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.070
That's also a useful one to remember, and the same points are just as effective places to strike.

16
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.840
It just depends on what you're more comfortable with and what the situation calls for.

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.570
It might be more useful for a frontal or side attack, whereas CNG could be handy if you're being attacked

18
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.630
from behind, though either can be helpful for any situation as long as you've got the moves down and

19
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.430
committed to muscle memory.

20
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130
Now, before we get into the details of these moves and their applications, there are a few points

21
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.640
I want to make clear about the use of force to defend yourself.

22
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.660
These are super important, so please do pay attention.

23
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.440
Seven.

24
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.780
Number one If the threat feels real and imminent and you cannot escape, you have every right to defend

25
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.150
yourself as far as is necessary.

26
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.800
Don't forget this.

27
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.370
No, to assume every threat and assailant you face is armed and willing to kill you with that weapon

28
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.320
and has friends who may jump in at any time, even if you don't currently see any weapon or other assailants.

29
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.310
You always want to be prepared for the worst case scenario.

30
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.640
Whether or not it actually occurs and the price you pay for not being prepared for either of these scenarios

31
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.810
could be your life.

32
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.830
Number three, remember that loud verbal yell.

33
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.950
Repeat it with every strike as you hit.

34
00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:00.000
It will help you keep setting boundaries, calling for help and continue breathing and managing your

35
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.750
adrenaline, as well as put a little oomph into every hit.

36
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.640
Number four, true power doesn't come from strength, but from leverage, rotation and speed.

37
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.940
Of course, sheer strength helps, especially fueled by adrenaline, but it's useless without these

38
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.300
three.

39
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.890
So make sure you're using this power trio in every move as well.

40
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.990
Number five, leverage in particular, is best achieved by constantly driving forward, taking ground

41
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.450
and keeping your assailant off balance.

42
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.870
I realize this sounds counterintuitive and perhaps a bit intimidating, but it's actually very smart.

43
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.680
If you keep him off balance, he can't get in any decent hits or grabs and he can't overpower you.

44
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.090
Number six, you lose significant leverage, rotation and speed if you're taken to the ground.

45
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.660
So you must prevent this at all costs.

46
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.150
This is your worst case scenario.

47
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.220
Do not let this fight go to the ground.

48
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.510
Number seven, if you are taken to the ground and even if you're not, always keep your chin tucked,

49
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.870
elbows up and your feet between you and your assailant.

50
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.500
Number eight.

51
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.980
And a personal favorite of mine, if it's near your mouth.

52
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.850
Bite it nuff said number nine.

53
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.820
It never happens like you imagine it will leave your assumptions of expectations at the door.

54
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.860
They will only get you in trouble.

55
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.230
And number 10, I will say this over and over again.

56
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:44.080
Escape, escape, escape as soon as safely possible at your earliest possible convenience, especially

57
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.670
if a weapon is involved.

58
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
This should always be your first priority.

59
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.680
It is far easier to escape an assailant than to conquer one.

60
00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.340
If you can remember these 10 rules, you will already have a huge leg up on the vast majority of people

61
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.850
out there.

62
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.940
So commit these to memory and to heart.

63
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.690
Keep them in mind as we go through each move and scenario in this module and make sure you're utilizing

64
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.640
them in your own drills and practices, both at home and out in the real world.

65
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.050
Now let's get into the moves and the scenarios in which you use them.

66
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.360
We're going to focus on five scenarios one assaults from the front, two assaults from the rear, three

67
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.240
extreme close range for ground assaults and five weapon attacks.

68
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.260
Those are all the scenarios you need to think about.

69
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.260
It doesn't need to be more complicated than that.

70
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.210
There will always be what ifs and nuances.

71
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.060
But if you stick to the basic principles, you will be able to handle any situation.

72
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.060
I'm going to show you a basic set of moves that you can apply to each of these scenarios in different

73
00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.850
combinations, but everything I show you can be used in all of these scenarios.

74
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.140
I'm not going to make you memorize different moves for every scenario.

75
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.990
I would be a god awful amount of stuff to learn.

76
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.870
There are far too many variations to account for.

77
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.550
Remember, these moves are only as effective as you're able to use them instinctively in the split second.

78
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.130
It matters.

79
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.000
So your best chance of survival is learning and committing to memory as few moves as possible.

80
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.720
My system is simple, but it's still a lot to learn.

81
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.610
So be patient with yourself.

82
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.910
Practice as much as possible and keep in mind that not everything you learn here is going to work for

83
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.270
you.

84
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.620
That's OK.

85
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.650
This is a system with something for everybody.

86
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.600
Not everything for somebody.

87
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.360
Just concentrate on the moves that work for you, practice and memorize those.

88
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.200
Don't fall into the trap of you have to master everything.

89
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.700
That's a load of crap.

90
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.390
Even the best fighters have just a handful of go to moves.

91
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.070
And so can you.

92
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.880
Now, without further ado, here are the ten basic moves you are going to learn in this module.

93
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.060
Number one, the eye gouge or poke number two the ear twist.

94
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.350
Number three the palm strike number four.

95
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.330
The Blade or X hand.

96
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.710
Number five the elbow strike number six.

97
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.500
The knee strike number seven.

98
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.050
The groin kick number eight.

99
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.970
The shin or knee kick.

100
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.410
Number nine.

101
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.930
The foot stone number 10.

102
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:44.090
The hip thrust in general, you want to strike with muscly parts of your body, like your palms, forearms,

103
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.840
thighs and soles of your feet onto bigger bony parts of your assailant's body that can't build muscle

104
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.680
like their nose, chin, shins and knees.

105
00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.380
Now that you've got an overview of what this module entails, let's get down to the nitty gritty of

106
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.510
how to kick some assailant --.

107
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.930
So grab your practice pads, your clothes, your weapons and your buddy if you've got one.

108
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.400
And let's move on to the next videos where we'll take each of these 10 moves.

109
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:22.140
Break them down one by one and show you how each can be used in all of our scenarios to save your life.
