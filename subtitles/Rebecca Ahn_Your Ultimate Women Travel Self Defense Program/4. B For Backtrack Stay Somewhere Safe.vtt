Places of safety are especially crucial to identify when you're traveling because you'll be in a new

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.950
environment that you aren't as familiar with so as you are planning your trip and researching your destination,

3
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:28.140
make sure you locate all of those safer areas and establishments and accommodations for your trip.

4
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.970
Now, I'm not saying don't ever travel somewhere that's less perfectly safe.

5
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.160
That would make traveling very fun.

6
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.150
Just be aware of where they all are, so you can quickly backtrack to any of them when needed.

7
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.300
If you're traveling solo, there are better and worse places to lay your head.

8
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.930
If you want your head to stay untouched and safely atop your body, for example, not so good.

9
00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.030
A budget hotel in the cheaper part of town, where a pushy taxi driver insists he knows the owners and

10
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.090
can get you a great deal much better.

11
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.980
A busy hotel or hostel that's packed with fellow travelers in a bustling, popular, well lit part of

12
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.460
town.

13
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.090
Other good options include an Airbnb or B and B, with a highly rated local host or a popular and well-reviewed

14
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.380
hostel or couch surfing with other trustworthy locals, though this is understandably a tad riskier.

15
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.690
Wherever you choose to stay, make sure you arrange it with a reliable, reputable website like Booking.com,

16
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.090
Hotels.com or Hostel World.

17
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.090
This is a huge part of ensuring travel safety, so please book wisely.

18
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.700
Don't have asked this step or whole athit just don't asset at all.
