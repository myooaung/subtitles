1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,090
Our last, but certainly not least, ABC step is at four familiar eyes.

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,810
This is less about another step in the order of how to defend yourself and more about the final lesson

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,240
you must learn in order to do so.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,250
I've been saying it all throughout the course, but it's important enough to bear repeating.

5
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,600
It is vital to your survival that you make all of these steps muscle memory.

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,340
In the moment danger strikes, you won't have time to stop and think of what to do.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,630
You'll only have a split second to react in a real attack.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,680
So all of these self-defense moves need to be instant, or they'll be of no help to you when you really

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,130
need them.

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:59,340
So this entire module is all about continuing to practice those ABC steps over and over until they become

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,730
instinct this week and for the many weeks to come.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,780
Long after you've completed this course, you must keep practicing these until they are firmly ingrained

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,270
in your mind and muscle memory.

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,810
Remember, the more prepared you are, the better equipped you'll be to stay safe and strong wherever

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,350
you go.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,230
Practice, practice, practice until you are so comfortable with these notes that you can do them in

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,560
your sleep until you start doing them in your sleep.

18
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,900
Taking down threats in your dreams.

19
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,550
I do actually have a lot of dreams where I'm fighting off bad guys to save myself and others.

20
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,510
And I got to tell you it's pretty empowering to wake up from that.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,220
Now to help you practice, practice, practice and familiarize.

22
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,640
You're going to need some version of the following supplies and support number one.

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,430
Some means of continuing to write down and take notes on all the tactics you learned in the avoid,

24
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,190
backtrack and control modules, as well as your chosen methods for events and evaluate.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,230
Number two, your training space pads, clothes, practice, weapons and ideally a buddy for practicing

26
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,630
all the moves you learned in the defend module.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,290
Number three ways to incentivize yourself and hold yourself accountable to a steady, recurring practice

28
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,210
routine until it becomes habit.

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,730
For example, automated reminders, incentives and social accountability.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,470
So let's dive on into the next video and lay out how exactly you will use each of these supplies and

31
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:44,930
support to create an ongoing practice regimen that will hard wire your body and mind for safety and

32
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,020
home you into the ultimate tough cookie.

33
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,940
Ready to take on anything life throws at you with courage and competence and pizzazz?
