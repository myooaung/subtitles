1
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.960
The next letter in our alphabet is B for a BackTrack.

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.590
As soon as your new found awareness skills spot something that could put your life in danger, and as

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.490
soon as that danger feels real and imminent, the next step is to find an exit group and get out of

4
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
there as quickly and safely as possible.

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.130
Remember this acronym e t g.

6
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.120
S A skate to game safety.

7
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.820
OK, technically it's an initial ism.

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.900
This is your one and only goal in self-defense.

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.950
Not to fight, not to beat your attacker or take him down or be the hero.

10
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.720
If you must do these things in order to get away to safety, then do so, but only as far as is necessary

11
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.240
to get away and no further.

12
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.200
It is unbelievably important that you get away safely as soon as possible, always take that option

13
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.130
if it's available.

14
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.290
This should be your default versus engaging with a potential threat.

15
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.240
If you can't avoid it altogether, then evade, evade, evade.

16
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.500
And here's how you get into the habit of identifying escape routes as soon as you walk into a new environment.

17
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.430
Often, the most obvious option is back the way it came in, but look for others like other roads,

18
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.720
side streets, walkways or even usable vehicles.

19
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.110
If you're inside, look for doors or windows or rooves or balconies.

20
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.610
If there's a way down or even vents if they're big enough, it's always good to have more than one escape

21
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.470
option, so you're prepared to get the hell out of there, no matter what goes down.

22
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.020
Now there is an evil villain that you must be wary of, and that is Mr. Freeze, Mr. Freeze.

23
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.400
Can you feel it coming the ice of space?

24
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.970
No, don't be silly.

25
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.810
Not Arnold.

26
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.610
I'm talking about that nasty freeze that takes hold of your body when panic or shock hits you when your

27
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.210
parasympathetic nervous system activates decreasing your heart rate and your muscular response.

28
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.940
It's part of that fight, flight or freeze dilemma we're all so fond of in self-defense.

29
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:39.470
The only bad option there is the freeze, but the good news is that just the act of looking around for

30
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.920
potential dangers and escape routes and other important situational indicators and warning signs will

31
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.860
keep your body moving and breathing, which is the best way to fight the freeze.

32
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.330
The key is to get out of your head and into your body.

33
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.570
Breathe.

34
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.060
Move your body.

35
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.530
Use your voice.

36
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.440
Focus on what you can physically feel.

37
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.710
And you'll be able to stay alert, calm and ready to flee as soon as safely possible.

38
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.100
OK, so how do you know when it's safe to escape?

39
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.430
Well, it's all about getting to safety, right?

40
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.350
So you should escape as soon as you feel you could safely reach a place of safety that you hopefully

41
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.090
already have in your mind without being attacked or stopped before you get there.

42
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.020
You don't have to feel in serious danger to leave, either.

43
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.540
We'll talk in the next module more about what constitutes a real and imminent threat.

44
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.860
But for the purposes of this exercise, you don't need a good reason.

45
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.380
You can run away any time you like.

46
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.510
There is no shame or blame in that.

47
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.750
OK, so then what sorts of safe places could you escape to?

48
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.140
Well, let's think about what safety means to you.

49
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.370
Who would you go to for help when you're feeling in danger?

50
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.300
The most obvious option would be any police officer, law enforcement or security guard that you can

51
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.810
find nearby your local police station or fire house or hospital or courthouse.

52
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.980
Really, any government building open to the public is probably a safe bet.

53
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.550
If none of those are available, a good backup could be any place of business with customer service

54
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.210
or staff who would be readily available to call for more help.

55
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.040
Like a hotel or a large store or shopping mall, if you're at home or in your neighborhood, it's good

56
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.840
to have a neighbour's house in mind where you know someone you trust is usually home.

57
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.580
The idea is to make a beeline for anyone you know you can trust to help if you don't have any of these

58
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.040
options available within reachable distance.

59
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.110
The next best option is any public place that is busy and crowded.

60
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.660
There is safety in numbers.

61
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.180
Obviously, that may not be much of an option at the moment, but once we return to a stage of post-pandemic

62
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.530
normal, you will be able to access more public places for safety.

63
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.080
Of course, at the same time, you'll likewise face more ways to be attacked.

64
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.690
Unfortunately, they do go together.

65
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.310
You got to take the bad with the day.

66
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.200
So I guess that's one reason to be grateful for our current COVID situation.

67
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.630
Silver lining that is, unless you are in a dangerous situation right now where you are, in which case

68
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.020
I commend you for having the courage to get this course, and I strongly urge you to take the next step

69
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:47.040
and call the National Domestic Abuse Hotline at one 800 799 safe.

70
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.230
That's one 800 799 SASE.

71
00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:00.600
It's free and available 24 seven, and the people there can help you, so please don't hesitate to call

72
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.050
them now.

73
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.580
Hopefully, all of this has given you a better sense of how to find exit routes and people and places

74
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.080
of safety, as well as how to know when to escape, to gain safety.

75
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.000
But it's always good to practice.

76
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.940
So when you are ready, go ahead and move on to the next video and give these a go yourself.

77
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.410
Go on.

78
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.150
I'm right behind you.
