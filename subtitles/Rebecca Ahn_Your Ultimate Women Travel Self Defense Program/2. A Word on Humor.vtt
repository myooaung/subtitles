00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.030
Now, before we go on, I'd like to be clear about something I do not mean to make light of assault

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
or abuse or anyone's experiences with it, despite my humorous demeanor.

3
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.850
I have been through my share of it too.

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.800
And I do understand.

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.510
-- is hard.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.850
But who says it can't be funny to?

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.740
Humor is just one of nature's fun little ways of adding some humanity and perspective to a situation

8
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.020
that seems void of that like violence and pain and fear.

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.250
These are very real things we all struggle with, which can give us a common experience on which to

10
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
connect, which is great because connecting is hard, man.

11
00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.330
So sometimes a little laughter can help them along and make us all feel a little less sad and hurt and

12
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.070
afraid and alone.

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.780
Everyone's story is different and everyone's story is valid.

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.730
My humor is not meant to make little of that, but rather to help bring some honesty and humanity and,

15
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.180
dare I say, empowerment back into the subject.

16
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.930
Something that'll help us all connect and communicate with one another because there are more of us

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.600
out there who relate to this than we realize.

18
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.330
You and I are not alone.

19
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.900
And the only way we're going to get through all of this is together.

20
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.480
That doesn't mean we let the fear and insecurity win, and it certainly doesn't mean we allow it to

21
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.380
happen again.

22
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.470
That's why you're here to learn how to fight back.

23
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.630
But you can learn how to defend yourself and have fun at the same time.

24
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.210
It sounds blasphemous, but it's true.

25
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.210
Now, assault and abuse are no joke.

26
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.560
But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your life while you're trying to protect it.

27
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.430
In fact, it can actually help if you do, because if you let the fear drive, if you constantly keep

28
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.200
your guard up and you never let anyone in, then you're not actually being stronger.

29
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.460
And you can still get hurt, all although having a really horrible time.

30
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.760
If you worry too much about protecting your life, then you're not fully living your life.

31
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.590
And that's no way to live.

32
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.350
This -- is hard enough already.

33
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:33.030
There is no need to make it harder on yourself because when you do, they win the harassers and the

34
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.710
abusers and the rapists.

35
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.170
Then they've won because then they've made you as small as they think you are.

36
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.500
But you are not small, you are strong and powerful and amazing.

37
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:53.460
And if you can have the confidence to see that and to wear it proudly, then you will actually make

38
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.620
yourself less of an easy target and hopefully enjoy your life more too.

39
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.970
Humor can also help you deal with the aftermath of an attack.

40
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.620
Of course, it's OK to feel sad and hurt and frustrated.

41
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.300
Those feelings are very understandable and valid, but laughter can also be fantastic therapy.

42
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.560
It can help you find a bit of respite and humanity in a moment that feels empty and lacking.

43
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.800
Of that, laughter is not the opposite of sadness.

44
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.650
Happiness is the opposite of sadness.

45
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.260
LAUGHTER is merely a reaction.

46
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.790
It's free to exist in both, and for some people, it's a very legitimate and effective way to deal

47
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.110
with sadness or pain.

48
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.130
LAUGHTER is also a common response to trauma.

49
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.560
Sometimes, even during the actual act, let's do a quick neuroscience lesson.

50
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.770
When faced with a threatening situation, your brain slows down the prefrontal cortex, which is the

51
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.550
part of your brain that helps assess the situation, create a complex plan and consciously decide what

52
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.540
to do next.

53
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.340
It instead redirects that power to the amygdala and hippocampus, which deploy a pre-programmed security

54
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.430
protocol in response to the trauma you are experiencing.

55
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.050
That could include finding, complying or even laughing.

56
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.340
All of which are designed to appease abusers, avoid life threatening situations or help you cope with

57
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.580
them.

58
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:35.220
So while it may feel weird or even a little shameful to laugh in the situation, it is a perfectly normal

59
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.120
way to respond.

60
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.080
There is nothing wrong with it or with you, so don't feel guilty if this resonates with you.

61
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.910
And don't judge if it doesn't.

62
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.520
Everyone deals with things differently.

63
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.500
So you do you, even if that means having a giggle with yourself?

64
00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:03.330
I certainly do frequently, though, even if that means I look a little crazy or sometimes say things

65
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.980
that sound kind of -- up.

66
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.620
That's just my way of connecting and coping.

67
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.040
So whatever your process, I wouldn't dare judge.

68
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.590
In the end, we're all trying to do the same thing.

69
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.780
Just keep on living as fully and freely and happily as possible.

70
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.300
So let's learn some self-defense.

71
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.260
Let's learn how to protect this precious, precious life we've been given.

72
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.570
Let's build some confidence and embrace that vulnerability that makes you intuitive and strong and maybe

73
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.880
have little fun while we're at it.

74
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.300
That's how we do it, the tough cookie way.

75
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.810
So.
