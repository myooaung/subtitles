00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.650
When you're going traveling, it's especially important to speak up and stay connected with your support

2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.480
network of trusted people.

3
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.200
None of us can do this alone, especially when we're traveling to new places, stepping outside our

4
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.530
comfort zone and potentially facing new dangers.

5
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
It's always good for someone to know where you are at any given time.

6
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.760
At least one person just in case, even if you are a super private person, even if you've secretly

7
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.950
always wanted to be a secret agent, please don't go off gallivanting without telling anyone.

8
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940
It's not as cool as it sounds, and it can really get you into trouble.

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.550
So before you leave on your trip, share your itinerary with someone you trust.

10
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
Like maybe that friend, you keep putting down as your emergency contact without telling them you're

11
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.420
going to want to tell them this time.

12
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
Make sure your itinerary includes a way to stay in touch with you while you're gone.

13
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.250
However, you'll be most reachable.

14
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.150
Phone number, WhatsApp, social media, email, whatever rings your bell or phone.

15
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:26.450
Then stay connected both digitally like on social media or texting or apps like Find My Friends and

16
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.570
physically like leaving a note in your hotel room or informing your embassy.

17
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.530
Just in case you ever need to be tracked down.

18
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.740
Imagine how much easier Liam Neeson's rescue would have been if he'd actually had a way to track down

19
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.550
his daughter.

20
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.130
Sure, that would have made him much less exciting movie, but in reality, you really don't want to

21
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.880
be that girl.

22
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.080
I am admittedly a little bit of a worst case scenario thinker, but I figure the more prepared I am

23
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.670
for anything, the more easily I can relax and enjoy myself.

24
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.870
Worry free.

25
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.430
No matter how many human traffickers there may be lurking around, as I always say, the best prevention

26
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.810
is preparation.
