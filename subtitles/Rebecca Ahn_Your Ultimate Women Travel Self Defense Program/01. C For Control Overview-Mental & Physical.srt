1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:15,110
Our next ABC is C for control as in maintaining control of your mind and your body and a situation as

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,790
far as you're able, as well as preparing yourself for what's about to happen.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,650
Because if you cannot escape, if threat cannot be avoided or evaded, then your only other option to

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,160
get away to safety is to confront the threat directly.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,070
There may still be an opportunity to de-escalate the situation before it becomes physically violent,

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,970
but that will take a lot of courage, confidence and control for you to do so.

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,540
It is crucial that you prepare yourself both mentally as well as physically.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,850
This involves knowing precisely where your mental, physical and legal boundaries lie, so you can draw

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,290
them clearly in the moment and use them as a barometer for what to do next.

10
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,290
They may help you to de-escalate the situation, or at the very least, be prepared in case things do

11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,040
get violent.

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,520
Your mental and physical boundaries depend on knowing your own body and mind, how far you're willing

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,120
to go, and where your comfort level and abilities end.

14
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,060
It's good to be realistic about any physical disadvantages you may have against your assailant, but

15
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:29,990
it's also important to remember that you do have a lot of mental and verbal power inside that body of

16
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,860
yours, which, if used properly, can be quite effective at deterring them or increasing their risk

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,980
of being identified, injured or caught.

18
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:48,050
Now, with these boundaries in mind, the very first thing to do is breathe, yes, breathe.

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,090
Because if you stop breathing, then your brain and your body stop moving.

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,530
And remember, the worst thing you can do in this situation is breathe.

21
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,610
Breathing will also help you manage all the adrenaline that's now coursing through your body, so take

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,840
deep breaths to free yourself from the freeze.

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,990
Keep those wheels turning and ready your body for action.

24
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,730
The next step as you breathe is to get into your ready stance.

25
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:24,230
This both prepares your body for action and signals to your assailant that you see them and you are

26
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,670
ready to defend yourself.

27
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:34,460
A ready stance is basically a physical embodiment of that zen and relaxed readiness centered calm yet

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,740
prepared to move at any provocation.

29
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,840
You'll want one leg back.

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,100
Arms up.

31
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,780
Elbows in at your sides and your palms flashing open.

32
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,980
Feet hip.

33
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,670
Width apart.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,450
Wait light and ready to shift and shift.

35
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,380
They shell as your assailant moves if they move.

36
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:02,420
So should you move with them tracking them so you always stay facing them in ready position at all times?

37
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,250
This palm flashing is a universal boundary signal that all humans are wired to recognize.

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,370
Even toddlers know what it means now.

39
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,210
Besides a strong, balanced tracking stance and palm flashing, it can also be a good idea to have a

40
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,720
weapon at the ready, either already subtly in your hand or else tucked away somewhere easily gravel.

41
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,790
Now you want to be careful not to escalate the situation by pulling out a weapon.

42
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,840
So do this with caution and use your judgment.

43
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,020
But if your assailant already has a weapon out, then it's not a bad idea to counter with your own to

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,760
once again show them that you're ready and trigger their fear of getting injured.

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,700
So it's still good to have something ready or ready able on you at all times.

46
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,330
Even if it's just your keys or a keychain or even a pencil, at least it's better than nothing.

47
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,670
Now you'll be tempted to tense up or flex your muscles, but don't.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,210
That won't make you any more prepared or strong.

49
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,840
A tense muscle is a slow muscle.

50
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,050
You are stronger, faster and more effective when you are relaxed and ready.

51
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:26,510
It's about balancing the two being comfortable with and sure of oneself flexible, clear of mind and

52
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,240
fully focused in self-defense.

53
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,040
Clarity and speed.

54
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,160
Now, after the ready stance is the loud verbal warning and I mean loud.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,440
Now's not the time to be shy.

56
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:46,450
This could be telling your assailant to stop or go away or leave you alone.

57
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,090
It could involve calling out for help.

58
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,870
Whatever words you choose, the key is to yell it as sharply and clearly as possible.

59
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,500
This has many benefits.

60
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,620
It gives a verbal warning to your potential assailant.

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,370
It gets the attention of any bystanders and witnesses, and it gives you a boost of confidence at the

62
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,180
same time.

63
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,710
Personally, I'm a big fan of just a simple, guttural know.

64
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,460
It's easy to remember and keep repeating to reiterate your boundaries and prevent your assailant from

65
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,710
getting any window in yelling.

66
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,310
No can also carry more meaning and positive reminders for yourself, like helping you remember.

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,380
No, I don't want to hurt anyone.

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,990
Or no, this is not my choice.

69
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,600
Or no, this is not my fault.

70
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,740
These simple steps can often actually de-escalate the situation before it becomes violent.

71
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,680
Simply by showing your assailant that you are ready for them, that you won't go down without a fight,

72
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:55,260
that you will not go quietly into that good night is enough to deter the actual fight.

73
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:02,730
Remember, every assailant and criminal has the same common fears being identified, getting injured

74
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,930
and getting caught.

75
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,710
So getting your ready stance on and barking up a storm will make all three of those seem a lot more

76
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,290
likely, as Saul Alinsky put it.

77
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,270
Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.

78
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:26,940
Best of all, with this sharp yell also does is remind you to breathe because as you yell, you exhale

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,270
and then your body needs to inhale to replace the air.

80
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,380
You just exhale.

81
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,200
You keep yelling and the process will repeat.

82
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,300
And voila, you're breathing.

83
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:43,110
Now, as you keep breathing and tracking your assailant in your ready stance, keep those mental and

84
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,580
physical boundaries top of mind and ready to deploy at any moment.

85
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:54,060
You'll be the best judge about when you need to use that loud verbal yell, or if just getting into

86
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,730
your ready stance is enough to deter the threat.

87
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,800
And you will also know best when it is safe enough to get away to safety.

88
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:09,570
Remember, that is still your number one goal as you do all of this, no matter which ABC you are on.

89
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:17,220
You can and should always bail on your card step and getaway to safety as soon as safely possible.
