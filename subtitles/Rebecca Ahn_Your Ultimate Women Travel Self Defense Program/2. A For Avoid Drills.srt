1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,710
Now it's your turn to master how you will avoid dangers.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,010
It's not every day you get to practice being avoided.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,890
So let's try avoiding some --.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,020
First drill, eye scanning.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:28,060
You want to stay alert, keeping all of your senses as sharp, undistracted and ready as possible,

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:37,270
look side to side up and down, near and far in front, behind and all the way around you.

7
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:44,680
Take note of everything that could potentially become a threat or dangerous situation, like someone

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,120
walking behind you a little too closely or a guy hovering by his sketchy looking van parked suspiciously

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,840
near you?

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,900
Or maybe that car that seems to be following you or driving a little too erratically?

11
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,850
Now you give it a try.

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,450
Wherever you're watching this video, I want you to stand up.

13
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,670
Go on now.

14
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,230
Take a good look around you.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,580
If possible, take your laptop or your phone that you're watching this on with you and just pop outside

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,150
real quick.

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,270
Now I want you to stop watching me and take a good look around you.

18
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,710
What do you notice?

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,360
What catches your eye?

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:33,070
Use all of your senses and take note of everything, especially anything that seems slightly dodgy.

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,990
I realize you might not have much to go on at the moment, but you never know.

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,340
And just the act of practicing noticing each thing will get you in the habit for when the world does

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,930
finally start going again.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,670
Second, drill no, you are frequent in areas and routes.

25
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,540
For example, I always take this public transit home from work, and there are usually this many or

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,000
this type of others writing too.

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:18,240
So I'll take note if someone gets on who seems to stand out or maybe look at me too much, or I usually

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,220
walk this way to the store, but that dark alley shortcut probably isn't the safest.

29
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,580
So I'll be prepared to take the longer, more populated and well-lit route when it seems smarter.

30
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:37,740
Or I usually park in this parking garage, so now I'll be extra careful walking to my car and maybe

31
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,510
keep a weapon on me at the ready.

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,250
If it seems to empty or dark, now your turn.

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,590
Think through all your regular routes to and from your regular haunts.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:01,290
Your home, your work, your gym, your hairstylist, the store, your favorite cafes or restaurants

35
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,220
or bars, your friends and families homes.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,670
What do you normally pass by on your way?

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,680
Who do you usually see?

38
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,070
What are you often doing as you go?

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,920
That might distract you or hinder your awareness.

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,800
What areas might be prime or entertainment to sneak up on you or get you alone?

41
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,680
Your homework this week is to continue this exercise for each of your regular routes and stops for at

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,510
least an hour or two this week.

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,520
Take a typical day in the life of you.

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,470
Go through it step by step and take note of each and every thing you might notice along the way.

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,090
If you do go anywhere this week, even better, pay attention to your surroundings and to your gut instinct

46
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,190
as you go and note down everything you see or feel.

47
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,690
You might not have noticed before now, as you do this exercise, remember to write down every possible

48
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,830
danger or threat.

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Make a list.

50
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,100
Check it twice.

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,660
Identify what around.

52
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,200
You could be naughty or nice as you do this.

53
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,840
Also, notice how this starts to change the way you move and carry yourself.

54
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,830
And be warned, I might be checking your work.

55
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,720
So do your best.
