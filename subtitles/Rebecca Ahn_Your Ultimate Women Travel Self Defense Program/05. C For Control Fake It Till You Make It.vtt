00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.080
Staying in control and setting boundaries for yourself can be a little bit harder when you're traveling

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.850
because you're already a bit or a lot outside your comfort zone, so it's extra important to develop

3
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.140
those mental, physical and legal boundaries as pertains to your travels from a mental and physical

4
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.830
standpoint.

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.780
This is largely about self awareness and self-confidence.

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.820
Confidence is key to travelling safely, especially as a woman, but it is easier said than done.

7
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.180
Even the most badass, highly trained of us still struggle with feeling totally confident in new environments.

8
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.350
It's perfectly normal, healthy, even because overconfidence can make you too relaxed, and some uncertainty

9
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.330
can help you be more alert.

10
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.910
But you don't want to make it too obvious when you're not feeling entirely confident yet.

11
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.340
So the solution is simple.

12
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.510
Fake it.

13
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.670
Stand in a power pose.

14
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.900
Put on a positive face and pretend to believe in yourself.

15
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.260
Say a mantra to psych yourself up if you need, then see what that does for you in your travels.

16
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.800
Not only will you get around more safely and assuredly, but you will also start to build some real,

17
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.530
actual, bona fide confidence.

18
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.520
Social psychologist and TEDx talk speaker Amy Cuddy calls this the postural feedback effect.

19
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.240
How we carry our bodies affects how we feel about ourselves and how we interact with others.

20
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.680
It's amazing how much you can get away with when you act like you know what you're doing.

21
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.090
Now we want to appear as if we know what we're doing, even when we don't.

22
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.620
So while it is good to ask for help and speak up for yourself when you need it, you still want to be

23
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.560
wary of how much and what kind of attention you're drawing to yourself, especially in potentially sketchy

24
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.490
situations.

25
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.010
You don't have to be friends with everyone.

26
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.050
It's OK to trust your gut.

27
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.160
Depending on the situation and the location, it is sometimes smarter to stay low key and blend in.

28
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.060
The point here is to avoid looking lost or confused, which would make you an easy target for those

29
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.980
with less upstanding intentions.

30
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.550
Plus, it can't hurt to maintain a little mystery.

31
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.330
Don't feel like you need to tell everybody everything about yourself.

32
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.400
You don't know anyone any explanation for who you are or why you're traveling alone.

33
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.450
Again, this is your trip to do on your terms.

34
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
You can tell people, however much or little as you want.

35
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.270
Remembering that will help you stay extra safe and strong.
