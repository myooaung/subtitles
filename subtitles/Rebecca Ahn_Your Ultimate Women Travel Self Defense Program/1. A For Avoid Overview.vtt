00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.800
Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start our first ABC will be a four avoid.

2
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.000
Remember, there is no sure means of protection than prevention, and the best way to prevent yourself

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.020
from getting into any danger is by staying aware of potentially dangerous threats around you and avoiding

4
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.520
them altogether.

5
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.250
That's how you win.

6
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.270
It's self-defense, not by fighting, but by not having to fight at all.

7
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.900
It's still self-defense if you don't fight something most other Self-Defense Forces failed to mention,

8
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.440
but it is really your best case scenario is the one time in your life when it's actually a good thing

9
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.170
to be avoided.

10
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.340
Now, to avoid, you must first be aware.

11
00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.150
Awareness is your first line of defense, both self-awareness and situational awareness.

12
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.990
Without it, it won't matter what weapons you carry or how well trained you are or what martial arts

13
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.980
belts you have.

14
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.000
None of it will do you any good.

15
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.280
If you are paying attention.

16
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.700
So don't just wander around with your head down headphones in oblivious to what's around you.

17
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.370
Not only won't you see any danger coming, but you'll also be more likely to be targeted.

18
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.270
It takes an assailant seven seconds to choose their target.

19
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.160
It's called victim shopping.

20
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.520
They're looking for easy prey who are alone, who aren't paying attention, who look submissive or easily

21
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.240
overpowered.

22
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.960
They're asking themselves, Does this person have something I want?

23
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.750
And what will I have to risk to get?

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.920
So you want to make it clear at all times that attacking you would be high risk that you won't take

25
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.550
no --?

26
00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:01.510
Every assailant and criminal has the same three common fears being identified, getting injured and

27
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.320
getting caught.

28
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.830
So the more you can increase the likelihood of that in their mind, the less likely they are to target

29
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.700
you to begin with.

30
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.220
Don't make yourself an easy target.

31
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.740
Make yourself a hard target.

32
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.160
Now, with that in mind, here are some ways you can increase your awareness and achieve that ultimate

33
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.300
state exemption.

34
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.250
The remaining mind of constant awareness and relaxed readiness.

35
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.850
Let's start with some good old fashioned eyes scanning.

36
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.320
We'll do some drills in the next video to help you master this move.

37
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.080
The idea is to take out your headphones, look up from your phone and look around.

38
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.660
You take note of everything you see in each new environment you enter.

39
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.590
Both the people and the setting, like the buildings, the streets, the vehicles and so on.

40
00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.880
You want to create a mental map of each new environment as quickly as possible so you can navigate it

41
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.790
with ease.

42
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.260
No matter the situation, whether that's walking confidently into a store or giving someone directions

43
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.710
or meeting your friends for drinks or trying to escape an assailant, it helps in any of these situations

44
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.130
to have the sense of your surroundings at all times.

45
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.700
Now, if you are in an area that you frequent, which by definition we often are, then you should have

46
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.470
an even easier time of this.

47
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.350
You already have the advantage of familiarity.

48
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.120
However, you are also more likely to be targeted there.

49
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:41.650
Fifty five percent of sexual assaults occur at or near the victim's home, so all the more reason to

50
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.300
know that area intimately, including all the routes you regularly take.

51
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.290
If you're paying attention, you should be able to quickly identify anything that's out of the ordinary.

52
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.860
Or is it normally there?

53
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.700
I can't tell you what exactly that will look like.

54
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.510
There is no one standard way someone might attack you.

55
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.940
It could be for any number of reasons.

56
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.200
From any direction and with any number of people or weapons.

57
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
So it won't help if I tell you what exactly to look for.

58
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.790
That will only narrow your focus and increase the chances of something I don't mention slipping by unnoticed.

59
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.090
But what I can tell you is that there are generally two categories of assailants who target women.

60
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.940
There are resource predators such as carjackers, muggers and other kinds of robbers and process predators

61
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.080
such as domestic abusers, rapists and serial killers.

62
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.110
Again, they can look any number of ways and use any number of methods.

63
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.560
So this is more to help you understand what they want.

64
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.080
Not necessarily what they will look like.

65
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.360
These are two very different types of predators with two very different types of goals.

66
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.020
So the elements to watch out for, as well as the tactics to best avoid, evade or de-escalate them,

67
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.010
will be different.

68
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.600
But both are equally dangerous and important to be aware of the resource predator wants something you

69
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.590
have and has decided it's worth the risk to get it from you.

70
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.770
He's willing to use violence, but only if intimidation alone won't be sufficient.

71
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.550
This is a form of a social violence where the assailant is not targeting their victim as a person,

72
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.530
but rather as a resource or the possessor of a resource that you wants, such as your purse, your money

73
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.490
or your car.

74
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.660
These situations can sometimes be more dangerous if they become violent because the assailant is choosing

75
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.980
to ignore the humanity of his victim, so he won't hesitate to hurt you as much as necessary to get

76
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.000
the thing he wants.

77
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.990
At the same time, though, they are also often more easily resolved without violence with a resource

78
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.480
predator.

79
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.840
You can usually just give up the resource he wants, and they'll have no reason to hurt you.

80
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.260
The process predator is not so easily appeased.

81
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.940
For him, the use of violence is the reason itself.

82
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.250
The violence is the goal.

83
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.260
This is an example of social violence, where the goal is to enforce or uphold social beliefs, rules,

84
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.510
territory or status.

85
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.300
Usually in order to assert dominance over the other person with a process predator.

86
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.560
The thing you'd have to give up to resolve the situation is yourself, which is far more valuable and

87
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.670
not at all worth it.

88
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.930
These situations are often harder to resolve without violence.

89
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.700
The process predator requires privacy and time for what he intends to do.

90
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.070
This often means needing to move you to a second location with more.

91
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.350
Privacy and security than where he first attacks.

92
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.200
This is called a secondary location, and this must be prevented at all costs.

93
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:11.080
Once there, the likelihood of violence escalating to rape, torture and even murder is extremely high

94
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.710
and the chances of you escaping are extremely low.

95
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.730
So any risk you have to take in order to escape before it gets to that is worth the price.

96
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.650
Now this is what women like us are more likely to face.

97
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.780
As for what they will look like?

98
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.040
The only advice I can give you is to be aware of your own bias.

99
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:41.500
Statistically, 57 percent of sexual assault perpetrators are white and 50 percent are 30 years or older.

100
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.910
I'm not saying ignore any uneasy feeling you might get from someone who doesn't fit this profile.

101
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.330
I'm just saying keep an open mind and maybe don't ignore that uneasy feeling you get from an older white

102
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.690
dude.

103
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:03.310
Now, while I tell you all of this to keep in mind, I don't want you to spend too much energy worrying

104
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.340
about trying to identify these types of predators.

105
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.680
Firstly, it's never that simple.

106
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.390
People are complex creatures.

107
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.820
It won't look the same in everyone.

108
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.310
Secondly, it's not my intention to scare you or put you on edge everywhere you go.

109
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.620
That's not a very fun way to live.

110
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.460
I only want you to keep this in the back of your mind.

111
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:32.710
For those moments when your intuition perks up or your gut tells you something is off, then this information

112
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.810
can help you determine if there is a real and imminent danger.

113
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.470
Your gut is very smart, not just biologically but psychologically.

114
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:51.030
You know, when something's up, when something doesn't feel right, that womanly intuition, as it's

115
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:58.500
so often called, is called that for a reason because we women tend to be very in tune with our instincts

116
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.850
about our surroundings.

117
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.700
It's a superpower that you should absolutely embrace and enhance.

118
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.060
It doesn't mean find danger around every corner.

119
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.740
But it does mean listen to your body when you feel it tense up.

120
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:22.140
When your heart starts to race your shoulders, contract your skin, tingles your eyes.

121
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.130
Dart around.

122
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.800
Know what it feels like in your body when your inner warning bells start to go off.

123
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:35.100
So you can recognize it right away and take advantage of that heightened energy and awareness.

124
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.730
We often ignore or deny that feeling when it's happening.

125
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.700
So the best lesson you can learn here is to listen to it and heed it.

126
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.000
Better to be ready for something that never happens.

127
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.710
They're not ready when something does better safe than sorry, right?

128
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.140
Let's do some drills to help you master your situational and self awareness.

129
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:06.420
So when you're ready and willing, move on to the next video and practice them yourself and then watch

130
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.850
how they start to transform your self-awareness and your self-confidence.
