00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.280
Now, that's an area we haven't covered yet.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.310
Is there big scenario with weapons, both what to do when your assailant has a weapon and what to do

3
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.570
with a weapon yourself.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.600
The vast majority of self-defense programs out there approach weapons the same way, with the same martial

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.790
arts based weapons techniques that have been passed down through martial arts schools without a whole

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.380
lot of real life field testing.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.880
It always involves some form of disarming or detaching the weapon.

8
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.720
However, this is not very realistic for real life because, again, real life fights are brutal and

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.470
vicious.

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.110
Add in your panic and your fight or flight response, and you're going to have trouble remembering any

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.430
fancy martial arts.

12
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.860
Disarming moves facing a weapon also requires a pretty big mental shift.

13
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.010
Assume that anyone willing to threaten you with a weapon is also willing to kill you with it.

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.600
And when you're facing that weapon, I assume that you will get hit, cut, stabbed or shot.

15
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.990
But there is a big difference between getting stabbed or shot while killing someone and getting stabbed

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.940
or shot until you are killed.

17
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.470
In a self-defense fight, the best strategy is not to focus on the weapon, but on the man holding the

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.450
weapon attack the man.

19
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.070
The weapon is just a tool.

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.680
It's powerless without the man wielding it.

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.530
So disable, not disarm.

22
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.080
This means just doing one extra move first to quickly deflect or pluck the weapon away from your body

23
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.150
or at least your most vital areas.

24
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.660
Just one quick deflection to make sure you won't be mortally wounded and then immediately launch into

25
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.210
a barrage of our ten basic moves to attack and disable the man holding the weapon.

26
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.870
Try not to keep worrying about what the weapon will do.

27
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.880
As soon as you begin your barrage of strikes, you'll be throwing your assailant off his balance and

28
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.810
concentration.

29
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.630
If you do it right, he'll be more focused on blocking your hits than effectively using his weapon.

30
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.030
The key to defending yourself against a weapon is to take the fight to him.

31
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.880
Action is faster than reaction.

32
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.850
The moves in this lesson aren't pretty, but they are effective and they can save your life.

33
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.410
Of course, the other key thing to remember is that a weapon increases the stakes and risks exponentially.

34
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.730
So if you have any window of escape at all, that is a far better option than engaging with the weapon.

35
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.060
The flip side of this is how to use weapons of your own against your assailant for your basic striking

36
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.540
weapons.

37
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.140
The idea is to go through the same motions as your basic hand strikes you learned earlier, only this

38
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.240
time with a weapon in your hand.

39
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.410
So stabbing with your keys, keychains, pens or knives could use the same technique as your palm strike

40
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.090
and striking or slicing with a stick or baton or also knife could follow the same moves as your blade

41
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.050
or axe hand.

42
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.320
The idea here is that you shouldn't have to learn a new set of movements for this just the same simple

43
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.390
set of basic moves that are widely applicable and adaptable to any situation.

44
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.920
So these moves to try with your weapons of choice and your practice patterns and clothes and buddy if

45
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.670
you have one.

46
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.900
Now, the only weapons that should require learning additional moves to use are pepper spray, tasers

47
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.890
and guns.

48
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.220
These are advanced weapons that I don't recommend carrying unless you really know how to properly use

49
00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.490
them.

50
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.470
I also don't have the space or means here to properly show you how to use them.

51
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.790
In my opinion, you really need in-person hands on training for these advanced weapons, especially

52
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.690
if you're new to them.

53
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.980
So if you are seriously considering using any of these three, I strongly urge you to seek out well-reviewed,

54
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.250
professionally certified hands on training.

55
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.500
Now, remember, any time you fight with a weapon, you've upped the ante considerably.

56
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.710
The stakes are higher, and so too the potential for more serious injury and repercussions.

57
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.490
So just as you need to be extra cautious against an armed assailant, you also need to be extra cautious

58
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.680
when using these weapons yourself.

59
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.880
The same rules apply, frankly, even more so about using only as much force as necessary to escape

60
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.510
to safety.

61
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.650
So be smart.

62
00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.000
Remember your mental, physical and legal boundaries as you face and or use these weapons and get the

63
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
hell out of there as soon as you say we can.
