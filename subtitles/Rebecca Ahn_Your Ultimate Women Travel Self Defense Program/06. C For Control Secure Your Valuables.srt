1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,960
When danger strikes while traveling, it can be a bit harder to maintain control of your person and

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,560
your personal effects.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,810
So knowing how and where to secure the more valuable of these like, say, your ID, your passport,

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,980
your money, your travel documents, etc. is really important to think about and prepare for ahead of

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,340
time.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,180
Contrary to what some might suggest, I would caution against leaving your most valuable possessions

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,490
in your room while you're out.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,990
But then it depends on where you're staying and how secure it is.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:51,510
If you have a room that locks with a secure, safe inside that also locks, that could be a better option

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,860
than risk losing everything of value to a pickpocket or a mugger all at once.

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,740
But if you're sharing a room, especially with a stranger, maybe air on the side of keeping your stuff

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,660
with you on your person.

13
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,200
You can always keep it more secure with a portable safe.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,810
That way, if somebody does grab it off you, they'll still have trouble getting to the goodies inside

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,060
wherever is most secure.

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,070
Keep your real passport there, then keep copies of it elsewhere as backups if you do bring anything

17
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:23,530
with you.

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:31,500
Keep it well hidden, like in a travel belt or a hidden bra wallet or this clever underwear with a super

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,180
stealthy crotch pocket.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,450
You can also take a page out of the old spy handbook and keep a dummy wallet on you if you keep your

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,740
phone in your pocket.

22
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,720
Make sure it's in the front pocket then, where any person's bags or cameras across your body and keep

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,180
one hand resting on it as you go.

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:58,620
I also like to keep a spare $20 bill or the equivalent in local currency tucked away somewhere as a

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,290
backup.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,620
Like in my bra or my sock.

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,300
If you lose everything else, 20 bucks can come in quite handy.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,420
Again, the more prepared, the better.
