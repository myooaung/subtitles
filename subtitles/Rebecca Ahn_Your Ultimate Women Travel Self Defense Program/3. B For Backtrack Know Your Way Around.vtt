00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.650
Your number one goal in self defense still applies when you're traveling, you want to be ready to escape,

2
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.890
to gain safety, no matter where you are.

3
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.110
And that may be harder to do if you're traveling somewhere you don't know as well.

4
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.780
So that means really getting to know your way around where you're traveling.

5
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.840
So you are familiar with all of the possible exit routes and places of safety.

6
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.660
This will also make you a lot more comfortable and confident when you're traveling.

7
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
Kind of like feeling like a local, which will make your trip both more safe and more fun.

8
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.520
Study a map of your destination before you go and then while you're on your way there and as soon as

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.360
you get there.

10
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.400
Basically, all throughout your journey, the more often the better.

11
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.830
A lot of the accommodations I mentioned earlier will have maps and guides available, as well as some

12
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770
very friendly people who are happy to walk you through them.

13
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.290
Take advantage of that and put in some study time before you head out on the town.

14
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.500
Learn the major street names and general neighborhoods near you and your planned activities.

15
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.400
Get familiar with the public transit map and make sure you know how one gets and uses a local transit

16
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.940
pass.

17
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.780
You should especially plan out your route before going out at night or to areas where you know you'll

18
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.420
have poor reception and whenever possible.

19
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.330
Plan to arrive at these places during daylight hours.

20
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.960
Then whatever you do, try not to open up that map and stare at it while you're out and about.

21
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.320
This can call attention to you and not the good kind.

22
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.560
You might as well wear a high and lost sign, and that makes you look like a very easy target.

23
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.710
If you must reference a map, keep it folded small and subtle in your hand.

24
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.180
Or better yet, stealthily reference the map on your phone.

25
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:18.360
If you take or rent a car during your trip, stay inside your car while you peruse your maps and directions.

26
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.550
Park in a busy area and keep the doors locked so you stay protected while your attention is preoccupied.

27
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.630
Then get your bearings quickly, but never fully take your attention off of your immediate surroundings.

28
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.630
If it comes down to it, it's more important to know what's around you right now versus where you're

29
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.730
going next in general.

30
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.830
Don't be afraid to really take the time to think things through and use common sense, even if you think

31
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.890
you'll look a little stupid or seem impolite.

32
00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.780
Your safety is more important than your reputation, and with your head full of brains and your shoe

33
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.610
is full of feet, you're too smart to go down any not so good streets.

34
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.240
Besides staying safer, the other benefit to knowing your way around is being free to focus on your

35
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.910
surroundings and really take your time with them, especially if you're traveling alone and you don't

36
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.930
have anyone with you that you have to keep up with or slow down for.

37
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.780
You can go anywhere you want for however long you want at whatever pace you want.

38
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.230
We all have that friend who takes forever to go anywhere or that friend that speeds through a museum

39
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.580
like there's a prize at the end.

40
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.850
Imagine all the stress and guilt that you're saving yourself by traveling solo safely.

41
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.880
It's the ultimate freedom and independence.

42
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.680
And who doesn't want that?

43
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.420
Plus, as a bonus, you'll look more confident as you travel around at the pace that you are most comfortable.
