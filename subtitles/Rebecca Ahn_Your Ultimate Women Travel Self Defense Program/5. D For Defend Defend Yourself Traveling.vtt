00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.960
Now, you may be wondering how and when to use all these sweet defend moves when you're traveling.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.870
And my answer is basically whenever and if ever you feel the need for them.

3
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.590
Of course, keeping in mind all we've learned about your awareness, your other escape options and your

4
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.250
boundaries, including the legal ones when it comes to travel safety, I say, do what you got to do.

5
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.780
If you find yourself in danger and you cannot escape, then by all means use all of the means at your

6
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.500
disposal to defend yourself until you can get away to safety.

7
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.150
Remember, that is the most important part.

8
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.750
Getting a way to safety do whatever it takes with whatever you can get your hands on and whatever words

9
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.910
of warning and boundary setting and calling for help as you can muster, but only up until the point

10
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
when you can get away to safety and no further.

11
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.980
Or you might find yourself in even deeper trouble.

12
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:19.200
That is legally and when you're in an unfamiliar city or country, that can prove quite the sticky situation.

13
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.140
And that is extra drama you do not need.

14
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.070
But don't let these words of warning hold you back from fighting back if it comes down to it.

15
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.300
Definitely defend yourself, turn your fear into fury and do what you've got to do to survive.

16
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.570
I've been there too, so I get it.

17
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.390
You won't get any judgment here.

18
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
Plenty of advice and self-defense training, sure, but no judgment.

19
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.240
That's how we do it here at Tough Cookie and we tough cookies stick together no matter where in the

20
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.470
world we may roam.
