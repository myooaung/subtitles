1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:12,450
Now, your turn to practice these backtracking skills, you're already eye scanning and identifying

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,920
potential dangers, right?

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, now as you do that, let's add in identifying possible exit routes around you, as well as reachable

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,100
people and places of safety.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,060
Let's return to last module's exercise of mentally or literally walking through all of your regular

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,280
routes and stops in your typical day.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,920
Go back through that process.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,540
And this time, as you go through each route and setting notice and knock down all of the possible exit

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,370
routes and places of safety within reachable distance, is there more than one way out of your home,

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:01:00,090
your office, your favorite bar, your favorite cafÃ©, your gym, your local store, your salon?

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,000
Do your usual streets, have any side alleys or shortcuts or alternate routes?

12
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,970
Do you pass by a police station or fire station or hospital on any of your routes?

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,410
Do you see security guards posted at any entrances or around public transit stations?

14
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,480
Is there a hotel along the way that always seems to be bustling and well staffed?

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,370
Do you have a friend living down the street who works from home?

16
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,930
Is there a public park or square nearby that's usually busy?

17
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,770
Also, think about how you get to these places of safety that might create new routes, right?

18
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,970
So now let's go through those new routes in your head, too.

19
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,990
And note down everything you'd encounter along the way that might help or hinder you in getting to safety.

20
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,750
Make no list for both these escape routes and all these safe destinations.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,330
I want you to continue this exercise as you go about all of your regular routines and routes for at

22
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,200
least another hour or two this week, wherever you go.

23
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,970
If you go anywhere, practice making note of all the possible exit routes and reachable places of safety

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,280
every time, over and over until it becomes habit.

25
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,330
It needs to be instinct by the time it really counts.

26
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:47,860
The more you can mentally rehearse every possible option and scenario, the more prepared you'll be

27
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:55,210
to act quickly when it matters most, when the danger is imminent and the panic sets in and you don't

28
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,990
have the luxury of pausing to figure out what to do or where to go.

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,570
You do have the time now, so take advantage of that and prepare yourself.
