1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:14,970
Avoiding dangers when traveling also includes watching out for travel scams, resource predators abound

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:22,350
in touristy areas where unsuspecting travelers can fall prey to a variety of different scams and cons

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,220
and thefts that can be very common depending on where you are.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:33,210
So this is extra important to be prepared for both as you researched your destination and of course,

5
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,210
once you were there.

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,540
Depending on where you're traveling, there are a good many travel scams to watch out for.

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,500
So you want to make sure you do your research and know what's come and where you're going.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,180
Some are pretty universal in any large city like pickpockets and muggers and homeless asking for handouts.

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,860
You also don't want to let anyone hand you or put anything on you like a bracelet or a necklace or a

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,640
pretty pin.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:06,390
It's most likely a scam to then demand payment from you for the item you didn't even want as soon as

12
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,200
they've got it on you or pickpocket you while you're distracted.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,440
You also need to make sure you're safe taking pictures of tourist attractions and performances.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,440
This is common in countries like Morocco, where street performers will often demand payment from you

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,610
for taking their photo.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,210
Also, watch out for taxi scams and other transportation services, especially in any countries where

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,830
kidnapping is more common.

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,310
It's important to be wary of anyone offering you a ride.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,950
Even seemingly harmless people claiming to have their own taxi.

20
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:49,300
Be smart and use the legitimate taxi stands, also, make sure they use their meters and charge you

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,210
fairly, or just book yourself a trusty rental car from a reputable company before you go.

22
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,560
It's worth the extra cost to be safer than sorry or.

23
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:05,890
There are also more tech savvy thieves who can steal your personal information without ever physically

24
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,610
touching you.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,640
That's why it's important to keep your I.D. and credit cards and an RFID protected wallet.

26
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,910
It's just as important, probably even more so to protect your identity as well as your stuff.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,190
This also means being careful what information you give out about yourself.

28
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,550
If someone's asking you for sensitive or private information like your bank account or I.D. numbers,

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,440
make sure you verify who is asking after see their ID.

30
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:42,460
And if you're still not sure, call their company yourself to confirm if it's a police officer or similar

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,420
authority figure.

32
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,890
Ask to see their badge.

33
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,580
Nicely, of course.

34
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,900
And maybe even write down their badge number and name.

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,330
You have a right to ask for this information, and it's a good habit to get into any time you interact

36
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,380
with law enforcement.

37
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,910
You never know when that information will come in handy and whatever you do, never, ever give out

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,000
your passwords or your passport number.

39
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,210
Except for that customs form on the plane, of course.

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,520
I hope that goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyway.
