00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,210
Speaking of familiarizing yourself, this is an especially important thing to do when you're traveling,

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,320
so not just practicing and in graining or self-defense skills, but also your knowledge of your destination

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,660
and its culture and its people.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,830
The goal is to blend in seamlessly with each new environment like a ninja, so you don't attract any

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,100
unwanted attention or become an easy target or, you know, act like a rude tourist.

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,030
Part of traveling and blending into a new place is learning how to act like you belong there.

7
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,590
Think like a local.

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,300
And surround yourself with locals and see what doors that opens up for you both literally and mentally.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,650
Learn the local culture and customs dress appropriately and respectfully.

10
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:05,110
Learn the language wherever I go and make a point of learning to say at least these six things in the

11
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,920
local language.

12
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,970
Hello.

13
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,050
Please.

14
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,220
Thank you.

15
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,340
Sorry, excuse me or pardon me.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,530
And cheers, which sometimes in the local language is literally to your health.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,340
It's also handy to know how to say, Do you speak English?

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,050
And I don't speak.

19
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,700
Insert local language.

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,550
Also, get to know the local transit system so well that you navigate it like a pro.

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,820
And then when you're not sure, talk to locals because that's what locals do, they talk to each other.

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,110
Because even if you memorize the city and metro maps, you're still probably not going to know everything

23
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,520
that's OK.

24
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,820
Locals are the best resource for all kinds of clever tips and tricks for getting around their city,

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,630
and there's an art to asking questions without looking naive or like an easy target.

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,090
Keep your composure, stay calm, and be confidently curious.

27
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,050
Remember?

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,400
Fake it till you make it.

29
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,340
You can also ask the concierge or front desk attendant where you're staying.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,460
Pick the brain of your bartender or server when you go out.

31
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,250
I got some of the best local restaurant and live music recommendations from a bartender in Nashville.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,190
All of these folks are usually very eager to share their insider knowledge with you, and you may make

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,690
some new friends in the process.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,830
So make a point to make yourself a part of their world.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,190
Now, that doesn't mean avoid the more touristy --.

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,550
As long as you're enjoying yourself, I say do what you want to do.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,040
You want to brave the long lines and the packed crowds to see the top of the Statue of Liberty or the

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,850
Eiffel Tower.

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,020
Go for it.

40
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,400
You too, you bill.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Just be aware that a lot of the more popular tourist attractions are not worth the time and money.

42
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,070
I spent two days and unnecessary parking fees trying to see Mount Rushmore.

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,650
And by the time I finally saw it, I got tired of it in an hour and I left feeling like the cost was

44
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,910
so not worth it.

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:14,960
Then again, many group activities and tours and meet ups can be great ways to meet fun locals and fellow

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,740
travelers.

47
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:22,430
So once again, just do your research and know what you'd be getting in to weigh the costs against your

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,560
own travel goals and make sure the experience will be rewarding for you before you commit.

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,600
Don't be afraid to be picky and you only exactly what you want to do.

50
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,930
It's your trip and no one else's.
