00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.140
Welcome to your last and final video in this tough cookie self-defense course.

2
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.130
Now, before you go off into your stronger, sweeter, safer, tough cookie life, let's take a step

3
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.120
back and appreciate everything you've done throughout this course.

4
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.510
Look at yourself with the pride of a parent or a mentor like your own inner Mr. Miyagi.

5
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.840
Look at all your hard work and new skills that are already showing up in your life in very real ways.

6
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
Go on, stick yourself up on that refrigerator.

7
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.030
Invite all the neighbors over and say, Look at that.

8
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.300
Can you believe what an A-plus that is?

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640
She's so gifted.

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.400
Well, you are, I'm sure.

11
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.630
-- proud of you.

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.160
You've come a long way.

13
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.580
Cookie, son, and you've grown into quite the capable, durable, unstoppable, tough cookie.

14
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.800
You're one of us now and forever.

15
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.870
And we tough cookies stick together because we've all been there and we all want to make sure none of

16
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.610
us ever has to be there again.

17
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.580
Well, I daresay we did well, wouldn't you?

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.620
It was high time we had some real talk about what it means to defend yourself.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.030
Woman to woman.

20
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.440
So I hope you got as much out of that as I did, and I hope you now see the immense tough cookie power

21
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.480
you have inside you and feel ready to harness it and unleashed it on the world like a geyser or a really

22
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.860
cute but deadly cat.

23
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
You are now ready to face any dangers that may come your way.

24
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.190
Protect yourself from harm and navigate any of the possible repercussions that may result in your mental,

25
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.330
physical, emotional or legal realms of your everyday life.

26
00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:01.070
You're ready to use all the tools in your toolbox, your mind, as well as your body, all of the skills

27
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.170
and smarts and senses that you've mastered all the fields.

28
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.360
Remember, it's not about feeling no fear, but learning how to manage it.

29
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.290
True courage isn't the absence of fear, but being afraid and pushing through it anyway.

30
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.610
Hearing it, heating it and breathing through it.

31
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.860
You have fear for a reason.

32
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.720
It can actually be your friend.

33
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.770
It taps you on the shoulder or in your gut when she gets bad and tells you to be careful.

34
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.720
But fear can tend to panic sometimes, too.

35
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.660
Just like the rest of us.

36
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.920
So next time, fear speaks up and makes your stomach do a somersault.

37
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.600
Don't ignore it.

38
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.340
Listen to it.

39
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.660
Make it feel special and heard so it doesn't panic.

40
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.410
What panic does to your body ain't pretty.

41
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.040
And that's how our arch nemesis, Mr. Freeze, takes over.

42
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.490
So keep calm and have a cookie.

43
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.670
Don't run away from fear, but you sure as hell should run away from the thing fear is warning you about,

44
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.170
or, if necessary, find the courage to stand your ground.

45
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.220
Yell at it.

46
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.740
Kick it in the nuts and then run away.

47
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.240
And no matter what happens, remember you're a b c's.

48
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.720
Remember to practice them until you don't have to try and remember them, and you'll be just fine.

49
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.340
Better than fine.

50
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.870
You'll be great.

51
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.410
Gonna have the whole world on a plate.

52
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.180
So go on and have your fill.

53
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.890
Eat your heart out.

54
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.270
Go nuts.

55
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.910
Stand tall and wear your tough cookie power with pride living fully and freely and safely as possible

56
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.930
ever was.

57
00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:03.480
And nobody in all of us know a sale and that there is or was is ever going to be reading.

58
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.080
Now go forth and fight like a girl cookies son.

59
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.900
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
