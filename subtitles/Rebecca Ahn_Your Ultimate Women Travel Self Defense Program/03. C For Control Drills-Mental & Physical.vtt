00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.350
You ready to start controlling your mental, physical and legal boundaries?

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.030
Let's start with figuring out where your mental and physical boundaries lie.

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.830
Try this exercise.

4
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.610
Picture yourself facing a man coming at you with a knife.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.690
You know without a doubt that that person intends to stab you with that knife until you die, either

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.720
through their words or through other demonstrated intent.

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.400
Either way, you have a real and immediate fear for your life.

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.860
Now, imagine you have a knife of your own.

9
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.910
Or better yet, a gun, do you shoot your attacker knowing you are likely dead if you don't?

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.710
Let's say from a legal perspective, you are within your rights to do so.

11
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.670
But are you able to do your morals and ethics?

12
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.510
Allow it?

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.470
Now, imagine that your attacker is an elderly man.

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.120
Do you still shoot?

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.250
What if it's a woman, a pregnant woman, a child?

16
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.110
Do you still shoot?

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.210
I realize this is kind of a -- up exercise, but it can be incredibly helpful for your mental preparation

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.920
and your personal understanding.

19
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.330
It's always good to know how far is too far for you.

20
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.950
Now, with these personal boundaries in mind, let's move on to how you set and enforce those boundaries.

21
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.860
First, let's find your ideal ready stance.

22
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.470
Stand up wherever you're watching this video and stand with your feet hip width apart.

23
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.600
Now, step back with one foot.

24
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.420
Which side did you naturally step back with?

25
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.250
This will probably be your dominant side, but go with what feels most comfortable.

26
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.560
This is your natural stance.

27
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.520
Don't fight it.

28
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.750
Next, raise up your arms, elbows bent at your sides with your hands up and palms flashing forward.

29
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.430
If you feel it necessary, you can have a weapon ready in one hand as well.

30
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.580
But if you don't feel it necessary yet, or don't want to escalate the situation by pulling it out,

31
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.600
this is still a good time to make sure you have that weapon.

32
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.990
Whatever it is, tucked away somewhere close by and quickly reachable like in your pocket.

33
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.480
So give that a try now, get your weapon of choice, be it a simple key or keychain a pen or tactical

34
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.660
pen, an umbrella or baton, a knife, pepper spray, taser or even a handgun, whatever you're willing

35
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.380
to buy, or if you already own or any other object around you in your daily routine that could potentially

36
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.300
become a weapon in your hand.

37
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.650
Practice getting into your body stance with the weapon ready, both tucked away and in your hand.

38
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.100
You want to stay in this position for as long as you feel necessary or as long as the threat is there

39
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.370
facing the threat in this 45 degree angle for the best visibility and mobility.

40
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.660
Now in this position, you're going to shift as your assailant or potential threat moves tracking them

41
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.650
so you always stay facing them in this ready position.

42
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.380
If the threat remains or gets worse after you get into your ready stance, then the next step is your

43
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.790
loud verbal warning.

44
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.960
Make sure it's strong, decisive and clear.

45
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.930
Leave no room for misinterpreting what you mean.

46
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.730
So find a place where you can safely go without causing a panic.

47
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.410
And let's give a few a try.

48
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.890
How about a warning like stop or go away or leave me alone?

49
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.870
Maybe a call for help.

50
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.500
Help.

51
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.300
I'm being attacked.

52
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.570
Or try loudly yelling a description of the threat in front of you, like the man in the blue shirt is

53
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.290
attacking me.

54
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.340
Or perhaps you'd prefer to keep it simple with just no.

55
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.560
Try it repeatedly.

56
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.660
No, no, no.

57
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.170
If the threat doesn't feel serious enough yet to warrant something that extreme, you can still give

58
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.620
a verbal warning try something a little less intense but still clear, like, sorry, I can't help you.

59
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.380
Remember, this verbal yell is meant to help you set and enforce your boundaries.

60
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.970
Give a warning.

61
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.490
Try to de-escalate the situation.

62
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.350
Alert bystanders.

63
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.580
Give yourself a boost of confidence and remind your body to breathe to fight off the phrase you are

64
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.450
breathing right?

65
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.680
It has many benefits, and it rarely hurts more than it helps.

66
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.830
So don't be afraid to use it if you need to.

67
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.100
Also, don't worry about being nice.

68
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.860
I know it will feel uncomfortable to break from.

69
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.830
What you've been taught is polite, but it is far better to be rude than be injured or dead.

70
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.640
Your homework assignment this week is to continue practicing, setting and enforcing these boundaries

71
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.260
with your ready stance, your palm flashing, your tracking footwork, your weapons at the ready and

72
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.920
your verbal warning both on your own and with as many encounters as you feasibly can this week.

73
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.780
Well, what are you waiting for?

74
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.710
Oh, if you go.
