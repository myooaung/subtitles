1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,470
When you're traveling, speaking up and seeking support also means connecting with new people where

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:21,840
you're traveling and making new friends both after an incident or attack as well as before because traveling,

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,960
especially solo, can be a little lonely at times.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,060
And there is safety in numbers.

5
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,840
Plus, it's fun, so it's always a good idea to establish some local allies where you're traveling.

6
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:40,350
Besides keeping in touch with the people you trust back home, just because you're staying alert and

7
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,170
cautious does not mean you have to be cold.

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,880
In fact, that might even make you stand out more, so put on a smile.

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,360
Try being friendly and see what a difference that makes.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
Just a simple smile and an open mind.

11
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,270
Now, that doesn't mean you believe and do whatever anyone tells you.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,040
Of course you got to be smart and keep your wits about you.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,840
But that doesn't mean you can't say hi and ask questions and make friends.

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,260
As a woman traveling solo, you will be less intimidating and easier to approach.

15
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,690
That can be really lovely, or sometimes a little annoying, or yes, even dangerous.

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,450
But I'm always amazed to discover how rarely I feel alone when I'm traveling by myself.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,440
As long as you can identify the friendly, trustworthy people wherever you go, you're probably less

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,290
likely to find yourself alone in a dangerous situation than and if anything does happen, you'll have

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,970
plenty of witnesses around you and people who can help you contact the local authorities.

20
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,790
So basically you want to build a local support network wherever you go.

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,940
I especially love to make new friends when I'm eating solo out at restaurants.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,510
It's ideal for you and for the restaurant to sit at the bar or at a communal table if they have one.

23
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,840
Then you can just chat up the people sitting near you.

24
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,530
I've made some lovely connections and had some amazing adventures thanks to random dining conversations

25
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,370
when I was traveling.

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,230
So don't be afraid to ask your new friends for help when you need it.

27
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,060
It's good to ask questions so long as you do it with confidence and ease.

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,360
You've got a voice and a brain, so use them.

29
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,590
Speak up.

30
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,870
Be proactive.

31
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,800
And you will be just fine.
