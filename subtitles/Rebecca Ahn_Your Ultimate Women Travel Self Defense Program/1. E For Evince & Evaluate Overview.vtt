1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.760
Once you have escaped to safety, it doesn't end there.

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.260
The aftermath is just as important and yet difficult to face.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.510
That's why we need our next ABC Step E for events and evaluate because it's incredibly important to

4
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.660
address what happened after the assault is over.

5
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.140
This is a step most of their self-defense classes don't cover, but it can make a huge difference in

6
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.100
both how you recover from what happened and how you can help improve the situation for other women after

7
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.820
you've escaped the threat, especially if you had to fight to do so.

8
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.240
This is when an emotional aftershock can hit.

9
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.480
If this happens to you, it's OK.

10
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.130
It happens to many of us, so many more than we realize.

11
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.820
In fact, ninety four percent of rape victims experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,

12
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.330
or PTSD, within two weeks after the assault.

13
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.500
Seventy percent of rape and sexual assault survivors experience at least moderate to severe distress,

14
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.790
which is a larger percentage than for any other violent crime and for 30 percent of those women.

15
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.100
Those symptoms continue for nine months.

16
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.310
So if this happens to you?

17
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.530
Keep breathing, stay grounded and remember you are not alone.

18
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.860
You are a survivor, not a victim.

19
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.210
I know it may not feel like it in the moment, but you are.

20
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.880
You are strong.

21
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.410
You are powerful, like a cross between a dinosaur and a tank, but not a tank that's used for war.

22
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.160
A peaceful, loving dynamo tengku so strong she doesn't need to do anything but be herself and run away

23
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.120
really, really quickly.

24
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.700
So maybe something faster than a tank.

25
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.670
Breathing is especially important as important afterward as before and during deep breaths will help

26
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.620
you stay calm and in control as you figure out what to do next and who to seek out and what to say and

27
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.750
how to slowly bring yourself back to a feeling of security and safety.

28
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.500
And then talking about it with other people can make a huge difference in how you recover from what

29
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.080
happened and how you can make sure it doesn't happen again to anyone.

30
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:42.650
So as soon as possible afterwards that you feel able find the courage to seek help and speak up both

31
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.100
for your own sake and for the sake of your silence next target.

32
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.420
Find a member of law enforcement and report what happened.

33
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.340
Give all the evidence you can, especially if there was sexual contact.

34
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.720
I know it's hard and you may not feel like you want to in the moment after it all happens.

35
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.610
But one day you may feel differently and will want to have done all you could in that moment when you

36
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.110
had a chance and the choice so that ultimately you can hold him responsible and get some justice.

37
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.600
Don't let your attacker get away with it.

38
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.430
Only 23 percent of sexual assaults are reported and less than one percent are actually convicted or

39
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.060
jailed.

40
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.980
That needs to change.

41
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.620
Reporting what happened to the authorities can help bring those numbers back up where they belong.

42
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.540
We got to catch them all.

43
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.310
Like Pokemon, how would you describe what happened to you?

44
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.580
Is also important.

45
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.030
Remember, you need to be able to articulate why your assailant felt like a real and imminent threat

46
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.190
to you and how you knew that.

47
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.060
Sadly, I had a feeling won't cut it in court.

48
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.400
You need to practice analyzing and explaining what caused your feelings.

49
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.380
Give details and specifics about how he demonstrated his intent, his means and his opportunity, and

50
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.020
how you evaluated your preclusion and had no other option than to fight back.

51
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.960
If you're unsure what to say, you can consult an attorney or call a national hotline for support,

52
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:27.630
RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and -- National Network offers a free national sexual assault hotline 24

53
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:36.330
seven by phone at one 800 six five six Hope or online at online dot Reynaud.

54
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.420
Even if you managed to run away before the threat becomes physical, it's still good to report what

55
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.910
happened and give all the details you can.

56
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.110
Just because you got away doesn't mean the next woman will.

57
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.580
So do what you can to make sure it does not happen again.

58
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.440
Now, telling the authorities is one excellent way to evince and communicate about what happened.

59
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.890
But there are other ways that can help you as well, like finding someone to continue talking to about

60
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.840
it or several people.

61
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.070
The more the better.

62
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:17.780
This could be your therapist or other women who've been through it too, or anyone in your life whom

63
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.880
you trust to believe you and support you or all of the above.

64
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:31.430
This is the evaluate part of this ABC step to help you process what happened, what it means and how

65
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.450
you can heal.

66
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.010
It's equally important to address what happened for yourself and give yourself the space and the support

67
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.170
to heal long afterward.

68
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.660
Going through any trauma like sexual assault or abuse is never easy.

69
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.740
You have every right to feel the way you feel afterward and every right to be believed.

70
00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.210
Most of all, you are not to blame for what happened.

71
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.270
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

72
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:10.770
As Eleanor Roosevelt so memorably said, nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent.

73
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.950
You are worthy of this, of feeling safe, of being safe.

74
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.400
So give yourself permission to accept that.

75
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.280
And --, don't let anyone make you feel guilty about it, including yourself.

76
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.950
Guilt is not invited to your happy, safe party.

77
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.310
Don't even tell them where it is if he tries to invite himself along, just say no, I think you're

78
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.710
thinking of something else and then run away really quickly, just like you'd run away from a dangerous

79
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.310
assailant.

80
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.860
Because who cares what guilt thinks?

81
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.900
You know you were strong.

82
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.090
You know you were bad, MS.

83
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.330
And your bad assets can never be diminished by anyone else's words or stupid hats.

84
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.740
People can say what they want to say.

85
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.050
You just keep on knowing what you know without thinking about what they're thinking about, what you

86
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.850
know, that's what I think.

87
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.960
You also shouldn't have to do it alone.

88
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.860
That's why I'm doing this self-defense course and why I built tough cookie in general, because I get

89
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.810
it and I'm not the only one.

90
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:24.160
There are many others like us who understand and relate and want to help each other through it.

91
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.590
So don't be afraid to join the conversation and share your story too.

92
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:36.640
It can help you recover from what's already happened and rebuild your trust in humanity for the future.

93
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.210
We can get through it if we do it together.

94
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:47.280
On that note, let's move on to the next video and practiced some ways you can actually do this with

95
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.180
those around you.
