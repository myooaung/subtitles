00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.350
There is one more crucial step to staying backtrack ready while you're traveling, once you've researched

2
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.350
your destination and familiarize yourself with all of its possible exit routes and safe places.

3
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.490
You also then need to stay alert mobile and ready to use all of that awesome new information.

4
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.210
The good news is we're usually a bit more focused on how light we're packing and how ready we are to

5
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.720
react to whatever may happen when we are traveling.

6
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.610
But here are a few specific tips I have on how to stay alert, light and covered during your travels.

7
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:53.950
First and foremost, watch your alcohol intake drink to enjoy, not to get drunk and watch your drink.

8
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.710
Or better yet, avoid drinking entirely, especially if you're in a country or an area like, say,

9
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.440
some countries in the Middle East where it's illegal.

10
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.930
If you get drunk or worse, your judgment and motor skills are going to be significantly impaired,

11
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.450
meaning your ability to react quickly and intelligently.

12
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.680
When I'm traveling alone, I never let myself have more than two drinks in a night.

13
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.270
It helps me keep my senses sharp, and it's easier on my travel budget, too.

14
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.680
You also want to keep your head up and looking around you.

15
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.350
Taking note of anything odd or suspicious that you might want to avoid.

16
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.330
Keep note of exit routes in case you need to get away quickly.

17
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.000
It doesn't hurt to be seen looking around and paying attention either and listening.

18
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.850
That means not walking around with both of your headphones in or staring at your phone.

19
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.940
Both will prevent you from quickly noticing things around you while also making you seem like an easier

20
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.480
target.

21
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.700
It's also good to have a makeshift weapon at the ready, like your keys between your fingers or a travel

22
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.620
friendly self-defense keychain.

23
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.420
I personally always travel with a tactical pen like this one and remember to keep those eyes scanning,

24
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.990
though maybe try to do so in a friendly manner.

25
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.000
The goal is to appear alert.

26
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.200
Not like an --.

27
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.770
You also want to stay light and ready to move.

28
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.890
You never know when you're going to need to grab everything and run, either to catch that train or

29
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.670
to evade that creepy guy that will just not leave you alone.

30
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.050
Whatever the case, it's good to stay mobile ready, so keep your things compact and portable.

31
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.820
Use a spacious but light bag and wear it crossbody so your hands and arms are free to grab that last

32
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.790
thing you left behind or defend yourself.

33
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.150
The point is to have everything essential you may need on you, but in such a way that you aren't encumbered

34
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.680
if you need to move quickly.

35
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.910
As for staying covered, I mean this both physically with proper weather protection and theoretically

36
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.740
with proper travel insurance.

37
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.590
If your destination has any chance of inclement weather, you'll want to be prepared with a good compact

38
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.370
umbrella.

39
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.060
Versatile rain or snow layers and ideally waterproof or at least water resistant shoes.

40
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.140
In terms of travel insurance, I know it's easy to skip this step, but you never know what disaster

41
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.650
may strike, whether that's a cancelled flight or lost luggage, or a run in with a drunk driver.

42
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.470
I'm sorry to say so, but it's true that bang ups and hang ups can happen to you.

43
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
So as the cliche goes, it's better to be safe than sorry.

44
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.610
Traveling especially alone as a woman is already a pretty courageous endeavor.

45
00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.210
You don't need to take any additional unnecessary risks that won't make you any more of a badass.

46
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.590
Just plain stupid.

47
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.560
So don't drink too much.

48
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.480
Stay alert.

49
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.010
Pack light.

50
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.390
Bring an umbrella.

51
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.250
Get travel insurance.

52
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.910
And while you're at it, maybe do other smart protective things like buckle your seatbelt and wear a

53
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.690
helmet and put on that bright neon orange life vest.

54
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.930
Risking your safety is so not worth the picture perfect selfie that would be, like, totally ruined.
