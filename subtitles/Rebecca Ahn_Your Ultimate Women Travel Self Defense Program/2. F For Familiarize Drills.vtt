00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.440
To achieve this module familiarisation, you're going to decide which of these supplies and support

2
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.000
you plan to use to help you stick to your ongoing tough cookie self-defense practice to make that practice

3
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.780
a habit and these moves part of your muscle memory.

4
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.190
So first, let's pick what practice supplies you'll be using.

5
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.160
Do you have a good writing pad or platform or app for continuing your brainstorm and review of your

6
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.650
boy?

7
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:45.330
BackTrack and control tactics, as well as your events, and evaluate options like Google Docs or Evernote

8
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
or Microsoft Word, or even a good old fashioned journal.

9
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.830
However, you will keep a record of what you've learned here and what you continue to discover as you

10
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.090
further your practice.

11
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.240
Gather these writing elements together this week, including all the notes you've already written for

12
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.110
the course so far, and then start getting into the habit of reviewing them and adding to them on a

13
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.370
regular basis.

14
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.270
What about your training equipment, your practice pads, clothes and weapons for your defend module

15
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.840
moves?

16
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.810
What did you use when we went over that module?

17
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.950
Do you feel confident you can continue to use these in your ongoing recurring practice?

18
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.790
Well, you have consistent access to the stuff.

19
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.630
Or do you think you might need to replace one of these at some point?

20
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:42.060
If you think you might go ahead and pick a good backup plan now in terms of the padding you use, make

21
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.630
sure it is something hard and solid, but with a little give so you don't damage your bones as you repeatedly

22
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.200
strike it.

23
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.410
You want to condition your muscles, not your bones, and you want to be able to practice hitting and

24
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:03.330
getting hit at full force as much as possible in your ongoing training, so you're optimally prepared

25
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.430
to take it, as well as give it.

26
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.520
Understanding what it will feel like and how much you can take is half the battle and being prepared

27
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.460
to stay calm and react strong.

28
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.910
That brings me to your practice support.

29
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.820
Firstly, what training buddy you might be able to recruit if you don't have one already?

30
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.130
If you have anyone possible in mind, approach them this week and get someone on board who will train

31
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.190
with you on going for as long as you both need.

32
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.930
Maybe somebody nearby who's already taking this course or somebody who is also interested in taking

33
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.380
the course with you, or maybe just somebody who lives with you or near you who is willing to hold up

34
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.660
a pad and let you hit it every once in a while?

35
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.770
The other practice support to decide on now are the methods by which you will keep yourself on track

36
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.990
and stick to your practice habit.

37
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.680
I've laid out three categories for this, so I want you to pick one specific way you will implement

38
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.500
each first automated reminders.

39
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.500
What systems do you already use for this?

40
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.410
That would be easy to set up for this purpose.

41
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.840
Go with that easiest option and set up some reminders for yourself this week.

42
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.660
Perhaps the daily alarm on your phone or smartwatch or recurring calendar event or reminder, or perhaps

43
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.070
a simple Post-it note left somewhere you'll see every day like your desk or your bathroom mirror second

44
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.360
incentives.

45
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.650
How can you reward yourself each time you put in a practice pick, one that works best for you and use

46
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.940
it as often as you'd like?

47
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.450
Maybe a tasty treat like a cookie or chocolate or a glass of wine?

48
00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.490
Maybe you reward yourself with some pampering, like a soothing bath or massage after a long, tiring

49
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.450
practice sesh.

50
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.280
Whatever your guilty pleasure.

51
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.870
Use it to motivate you.

52
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.280
My guilty pleasure is watching too many TV shows and movies.

53
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.610
If that wasn't already obvious from all the clips in these videos, so I like to incentivize myself

54
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.620
with the reward of each next episode.

55
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.590
Third, social accountability.

56
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.590
How can you recruit others to help you stay motivated and incentivized to keep practicing?

57
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.800
Beyond your training, buddy, of course, we all know that Trixie Mistress peer pressure.

58
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.610
She doesn't always steer us in the right direction, but there is a way to use her powers for good instead

59
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.360
of evil.

60
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.910
And that's telling friends, family, co-workers, mentors.

61
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.170
Anyone who's good opinion matters to you about your self-defense goals and plans as a means of holding

62
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.210
yourself socially accountable.

63
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.310
Once you've told them you'll do something, you're going to feel added pressure to actually do it.

64
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.220
Any one of those people could ask you how it's going at any point, and you'll want to have something

65
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.000
to tell them.

66
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.440
So to activate this part of your plan, I want you to pick three people in your life whose opinion matters

67
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.250
most to you.

68
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:25.530
The three people you think most likely to understand and care and be inclined to check in on you, go

69
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.080
and talk to each of them this week and tell them about this course and your self-defense goals.

70
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.320
Ask them to check in with you periodically.

71
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.690
Make it extra fun and tell them to just surprise you at random intervals.

72
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.380
Really keep you on your toes.

73
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.360
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to continue practicing all of these ABC steps and

74
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.610
moves over and over with your practice, supplies and support you've just identified until they all

75
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.070
become truly instinct.

76
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:07.410
Until you feel super confident that you can quickly and thoroughly execute each step in order at the

77
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.720
drop of a hat in a split second.

78
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.740
Anytime anything happens, repetition is key.

79
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.000
You'll be able to practice some weeks more than others, and that's OK.

80
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.070
Just keep coming back to it and rewatching these videos whenever you need.

81
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:30.720
We all have different physical fitness levels and abilities and limitations, so be patient with yourself.

82
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.110
Start off small with what you can comfortably manage in a week and build from there.

83
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.830
Before you know it, you'll be the ultimate unstoppable supreme, tough cookie self-defense warrior

84
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.800
who don't take no crap off and nobody.

85
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.050
Now go forth and train well.

86
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.020
Cookie sign and come back anytime.

87
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.110
This course will be with you always.

88
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.790
May the courts be with you?
