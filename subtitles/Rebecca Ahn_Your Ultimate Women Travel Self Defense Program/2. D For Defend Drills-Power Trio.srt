1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
OK, let's learn some better moves.

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,960
Y'all ready for this?

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,350
Now remember, in every move, you want to utilize leverage, rotation and speed.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,940
The power trio.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,090
So first, let's practice how you will achieve these tactics.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,530
Three.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,880
And the other side you see for leverage power.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
Practice getting low and centered in your ready stance.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,420
Grounded yet quick on your feet.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,200
Move around in this position to get comfortable with it.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,820
The other key to leverage is to keep driving forward with every move advancing on your assailant and

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,080
keeping him off balance.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,380
So as you move around in your low ready stance.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,100
Practice stepping forward as it driving into your assailant.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,510
Think of it as always, trying to get to where he's currently standing.

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,250
Now, since we want to be always driving forward, we can use that to put even more power into every

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,350
move with maximum leverage.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:16,050
It's called the drop step, and it's exactly that a step you drop into with your full body weight as

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,480
you perform each move and strike.

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,610
That means that all of your body weight will go into every hit.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,900
Start in low ready stance now, lift your back leg up as if to step forward, but don't put it down

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,230
yet.

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,300
Lean your weight forward.

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:40,300
And as your weight reaches a falling point, let yourself fall into a forward step.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,550
Don't put your foot down.

26
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,670
Let your full body weight drop you into it.

27
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,050
Now, repeat this with the other leg taking another drop.

28
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,990
Step forward and on and on.

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,480
Marching forward with each drop step.

30
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,450
If you need more room, you can practice this move anywhere.

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,990
Drop stepping around your house, drop stepping down the street anywhere, you feel comfortable.

32
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,600
It's basically just a weird looking step lunge.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,240
People will just think you're working out your quads and glutes for rotation power.

34
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,180
You want every hit you do to start from your feet.

35
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:31,630
Pivoting, come up through your center and your hips turning and into your shoulders, arms or legs.

36
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,350
You've got to engage that core and use your whole body.

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,070
So as you practice each of our ten basic moves.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,980
Try rotating and pushing all that force behind whatever body part you're striking with.

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,950
Just twist your hips and let her rip.

40
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:04,600
For speed power, you want to make every move, every strike, every hit snap with it, good.

41
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:12,540
Try this exercise, hold your arm out, palm facing up now, take your other hand and extend it as well

42
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,210
on top.

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,200
Palm also facing up and bring it down onto the first palm.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,900
Hurts a little, don't it, now do it again, and this time snapped the upper hand back up real quick,

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,260
like immediately after it makes contact with the first people

46
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,130
who feel the difference that sharp sting.

47
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,090
That's exactly what you want every one of your kids to do.

48
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:55,550
Now, combine that snapping speed with your leverage and rotation, and you will have a power, the

49
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,400
likes of which has never been seen, or at least the likes of which your assailant certainly doesn't

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,450
expect to see.

51
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,250
So practice this power trio until you've mastered it with every move you learn in this module and you'll

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,350
give him the surprise of his life.

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,240
While saving your own.
