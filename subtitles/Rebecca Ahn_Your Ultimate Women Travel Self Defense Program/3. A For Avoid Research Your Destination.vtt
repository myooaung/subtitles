In order to avoid dangers, it's a very good idea to educate yourself on what kinds of dangers you might

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.000
expect, where you're going.

3
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.270
So you can prepare and make sure you're ready for any of them just in case.

4
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.450
This means researching your destination.

5
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.270
And in today's age of information and the magic of the internet, this is very easy to do.

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.090
Do your homework before you go.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.830
Gather helpful tips and advice, including any mistakes to avoid from your friends over social media,

8
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.240
over Zoom, or, if you can, over coffee, especially if any of them are also avid travelers who have

9
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.310
a lot of experience with where you're going.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.380
I feel like I'm always seeing people ask for travel recommendations on Facebook, and I've used it a

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.890
few times as well myself to varying degrees of success.

12
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.670
Those posts always seem to get a boatload of responses.

13
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.350
It might be an overwhelming amount of information, but that's par for the course on the internet anyway.

14
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.960
At least in this case, it might be nice to get as much information as possible, and you can always

15
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.590
take the suggestions you get with varying sized grains of salt.

16
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.940
Plus, you never know who you know who might be planning to go to the same place as you at the same

17
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.450
time.

18
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.260
Of course, besides friends tips, it's a good idea to read up on your destination from reputable online

19
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.730
sources like TripAdvisor and Lonely Planet and the CDC.

20
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.620
Or you can go old school with travel guidebooks.

21
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.560
There's something nice about having a physical book that you can flip through and dog ear, especially

22
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.450
while you're on your way there on a plane or other forms of transportation.

23
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.270
Who hasn't seen that classic movie scene of annoying the person sitting next to you with random facts

24
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.560
about your destination?

25
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.790
Then when you're done, you can always gift that travel book or all your travel research to pass on

26
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.170
all of that wisdom and margin notes on your destination.

27
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.400
It's always nice to pay it forward for other tough cookie travelers.
