1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,670
Let's take a moment to talk about that.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,580
I know it may seem a bit of an odd topic for a self-defense course, but then it's not just for Buddhists

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,070
or even wise old martial artists.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,760
Did you know Zen is an integral part of ancient martial arts?

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:28,750
It can also teach us much about how to stay safer and stronger without compromising our quality of life.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
In fact, it teaches us how to get more out of life.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,510
There's a reason they call it enlightenment.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,850
To reach a state of Zen is to be relaxed and alert at the same time.

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,090
It's a lesson in preparedness, and it can be a very useful tool for your life, both for enjoying it

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,620
and protecting it, as it has been for martial arts for centuries.

11
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,720
The first principle of Zen one must master is chosen or the beginners mind.

12
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,470
This means being open and ready to learn without any preconceptions or judgments.

13
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,890
This will help you not only in life in general, but also in how you approach this tough cookies self-defense

14
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,490
course.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,290
So let go of that negative, Nancy.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,210
Inner critic telling you you can't do this or you don't deserve this.

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,820
You are much stronger than you think you are.

18
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,140
As long as you are open to it, once you understand that, you can learn to embrace who the ocean or

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,580
the immovable mind.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,640
This is a sense of steadfast determination and absolute control over one's self.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,820
You must be immovable in your belief in yourself and your right to defend yourself.

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,710
It's OK to be stubborn when it comes to protecting your life and your body.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,190
Then you will balance the tenacity and perseverance with your chosen openness and readiness.

24
00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:00,050
Once you've mastered that, that ready resolve will help you achieve motion or without mind.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,040
This is when one is truly in the zone, completely in the moment and on the task at hand.

26
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,040
Who doesn't love that feeling when you're so engrossed in what you're doing that you don't have any

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,790
inhibitions?

28
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,630
Well, if you can combine that focus with your chosen openness and your food and courage, you will

29
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,760
be truly in the zone free from worry, anger, fear or ego.

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:34,580
All of that will aid you in mastering your ultimate level of Zen exemption or the remaining mind what

31
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,920
you are left with after you let go of prejudgment, insecurity, anxiety.

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,940
It's a state of constant situational awareness, perceptiveness and relaxed readiness.

33
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,110
This is where you truly master the way of tough cookies.

34
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,540
Self-Defense always at the ready, but without doubt, arrogance or fear.

35
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,810
Strong but soft at the same time.

36
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,400
Like a tough cookie.

37
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,950
This is the ideal state to be in when preparing to defend yourself, and even before that, when you're

38
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,480
just going about your day.

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,730
It is a true mastery and melding of mind, body and spirit to fully equip and fortify oneself.

40
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:26,790
Only then are you strong enough to survive and thrive as fully and happily and safely as possible.

41
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,700
You already have the strength inside you.

42
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,040
You just need to tap into it and harness it.

43
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,150
And that is exactly what we're going to learn to do in this course.

44
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,370
So free your mind.

45
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,260
And let's begin.
