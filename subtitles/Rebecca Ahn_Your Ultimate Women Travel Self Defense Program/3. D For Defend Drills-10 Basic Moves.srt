1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,650
Now, it's time to put our power trio into our ten basic moves practice each move first into the air

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,390
and into any kind of pattern.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:21,360
You have your pillow, your couch, your punching pad or bag your dad.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,900
And then ideally again with a buddy, though still using pads.

5
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,050
Of course, you don't want to hit your buddy at full force, I'm guessing.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,130
But who knows?

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,990
Remember, it's not just about what you practice, but how you practice.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,770
You want to create as realistic of scenarios as possible when you practice these moves, especially

9
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,460
with your buddy.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,300
This means starting from the approach, not just standing in front of each other already and ready stance.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,080
Your assailant could very well catch you off guard and close in before you can get into your ready stance.

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:06,600
So it's vital to practice each of these moves from a variety of starting positions in each of our scenarios,

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,490
including one where you're standing there, looking away, not paying any attention at all.

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,760
Don't just stand there and wait for your partner to grab you.

15
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,660
Or, worse still, offer your hand for the initial grab.

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,180
It won't happen like that in real life.

17
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,810
So remember to train as realistically as possible.

18
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,340
This includes giving as good as you get with consent, of course, especially when you're playing the

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,970
assailant.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,170
You'll get a better sense for what that will feel like and how much you can take and create a more realistic

21
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,550
scenario for you both.

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,570
Plus, as an added bonus, you get a full sense for how much power your body is capable of.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:55,590
You might be surprised how hard you can actually hit and how empowering that feels.

24
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:04,590
It needs to become instinct for you to launch into these moves with full force and feeling as soon as

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,700
the threat becomes real and imminent and unavoidable.

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,050
She who hesitates is lost or injured or dead.

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,240
So with that in mind, let's start with our first move.

28
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:26,210
The eye gouge you for I, the first letter in our eggs, this is best used in the third scenario of

29
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,740
extreme close range attacks, especially with the first scenario from the front or in the fourth scenario

30
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,010
if you're taken to the ground.

31
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,960
The point is, your assailants head needs to be close enough for you to reach out and grab.

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,050
Wrap your hands around the sides of your assailants, head fingers, bracing against the back for leverage

33
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,930
and really dig your thumbs into his eyes.

34
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,390
Now, if you're practicing this with a buddy, obviously go easy on their eyes.

35
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,570
You can go full force on a pillow or a dummy, but it's still good to practice this move with the buddy,

36
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:06,770
if possible, to rehearse going quickly from ready stance or other less ready positions into this move.

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:23,480
Next is the ear twist, which could also be in eggs, though this can also be applied to your assailant's

38
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,820
nose, eyebrow or any other part of their body that you can pinch and twist between your fingers.

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,240
This also requires being in close proximity to your assailant's face or other part that you want to

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,780
twist.

41
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,810
So it's most applicable in our third close range and fourth ground assault scenarios.

42
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,870
But of course, use it anytime you're able.

43
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,250
Here's the gist of it.

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Grab their ear or any other body part, ideally with your thumb facing down and then twist your hand

45
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,830
back as hard as you can with all your leverage, rotation and speed.

46
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,340
Work your way up to the speed part with your buddy, as well as how much force you use on their ear.

47
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,120
And be sure to both tap out when the pain is too much.

48
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,980
Then go full force and speed on your tummy or other inanimate pattern.

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,550
Our next basic move is one of the most universal and invaluable.

50
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,630
The palm strike, this can be used in pretty much any scenario and on any target point of the body.

51
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:43,650
Any of the Etgar or CNG spots, the eyes or ears, the throat, the groin, the shins, the stomach,

52
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,450
the instep or foot, the nose or other parts of the face.

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,140
It's an open hand strike hitting with the hard heel of your hand, which can actually withstand a good

54
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,610
amount of damage and have a lot of power behind it from the rest of your arm and shoulder.

55
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,300
So using your rotational power, you could put a lot of force behind your palm strike, using your whole

56
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,120
body weight and driving your hand through.

57
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,830
Even if you're a smaller woman, let's say about about 20 or so, that's still a 120 pounds of power

58
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,180
going into one spot.

59
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,070
Like their face, you're not high fiving their face, you're crushing it.

60
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,110
Now, it's important to mention that a punch is not the equivalent of this move.

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,570
This is far, far superior.

62
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,520
You should never, ever use a fist unless you are properly trained to do so.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,500
Punching with bare fists runs a high risk of fracturing your knuckles.

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,210
Boxers and the main fighters mitigate this risk by wrapping their hands.

65
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:51,750
So unless you have and know how to use any wraps or hand protection, do not punch.

66
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,310
Stick to the palm strike, which frankly can take a bigger beating than your fist.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,690
So let's do some drills with this from your ready stance.

68
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:07,230
Rotate your body as you extend your arm and hand with the heel of your palm out and bring it back.

69
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:14,070
Think about reaching for something, turning your body to get that full reach without leaning over reach

70
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,700
as far as you can turn while staying upright and centered.

71
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,820
Then bring it back with that same snappy motion.

72
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,690
Practice this move slow at first, then work up to full speed with full force and rotational power.

73
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,950
Try them in repetition.

74
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:38,110
Two at a time, then three at a time, then even more and even faster as you get more comfortable as

75
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,550
many as your little heart desires to ingrain this, move your muscle memory.

76
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,370
Our fourth basic move, the blade or axe hand, also uses the hand, but a different part of it.

77
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,290
It's also widely applicable in any scenario and on any striking point of the body, and it also happens

78
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,000
to be a personal favorite of mine.

79
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,450
The idea is to create a blade by flattening your hand and tightening your fingers together, hardening

80
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,790
the whole thing as stiff as possible.

81
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,060
Then you strike with either side of your new hand blade in an x like motion on whatever part of your

82
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:27,990
balance body you can face the eyes, ears, the nose, the throat.

83
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,810
It works particularly well throughout the groin, the shins, the stomach, the foot, all of them,

84
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,810
though orientation does matter.

85
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,480
So different target areas will work in different combinations, whether you're attacked from the front,

86
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,640
from behind, in close range or taken to the ground.

87
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:57,330
Make sure you practice all of these scenarios, at least by yourself and with a buddy if you have one.

88
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:04,260
Start slow and steady to get the proper form down and then gradually add more force and speed until

89
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,530
you're practicing at full force and adrenalized speed.

90
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,750
Mood ever five is another favorite of mine.

91
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:25,080
The elbow strike, which has roots in several martial arts styles, including Krav MAGA and White Tie,

92
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,500
once again, proximity is a big factor here.

93
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,860
So it's most useful in close range and ground assault scenarios, but could still be applicable to any

94
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,280
of them.

95
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,260
It's also good for nearly all of our target striking areas, except perhaps the instep is that would

96
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,810
require a pretty awkward position in order for your elbow to be the most effective move you have.

97
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,790
Let's practice them all anyway, just to be prepared for every possible scenario.

98
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,340
Start by getting into your ready stance.

99
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,000
Now take your elbow and as you rotate your body, bring your elbow up and across in a forward strike.

100
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,630
For another angle, let's imagine the position you're in has your body turned and your side or back

101
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,860
is facing your assailant?

102
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,830
Like in our second scenario of an attack from the rear.

103
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,890
In this instance, you'll want to rotate your body back the other direction as you bring your elbow

104
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,260
up and around in a backward strike.

105
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,530
There are many other scenarios that may call for an elbow strike like, say, if you're on the ground

106
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:35,010
with your assailant on top and you swing the elbow across to strike him off, or he's got you in a close

107
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,620
range attack like a chokehold and you twist your body to bring your elbow up and over to strike his

108
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,030
face and release his grip.

109
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:50,370
Practice all the possible angles for each of these scenarios from the front, from behind in close range,

110
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,630
on the ground as many times as you need into the air, into padding that ideally with a buddy holding

111
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,230
that padding.

112
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:13,750
Now for Move number six, the knee strike, this is essentially the same thing as the elbow strike just

113
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,800
with the lower body.

114
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,950
It's equally applicable to the same scenarios and target striking areas, including the awkwardness

115
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,670
of the instep.

116
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:28,300
The most obvious use is a knee to the groin in a frontal close range or ground assault.

117
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,540
But the knee could also be used to strike the stomach or his face if he's bent over or close to the

118
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:34,990
ground.

119
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm particularly fond of the knee to the face move as a very effective finishing move that will often

120
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,370
knock him out enough to allow you to escape to safety.

121
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,920
But the knee to the groin is a bit more likely for you to use, especially earlier in the fight.

122
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,090
To practice this new strike, start in your right stance.

123
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,570
Now remember that drops stuff this time when you pick up your back leg to drop forward.

124
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,880
Swing it outward and upward, driving the top of your thigh up into your assailant's groin or other

125
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,810
striking area.

126
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,690
Then you can bring your foot forward and down again with the same full body weight of your drop step

127
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,740
driving forward and knocking your assailant off balance, which will be a nice added bonus on top of

128
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,420
the big knee blow you just gave them.

129
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:30,070
The key is to make contact with your thigh and all that strong muscle parts, not your actual knee,

130
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,950
which is much weaker and will hurt a lot more.

131
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,060
I call it a thigh strike, but it just wouldn't have the same ring.

132
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,110
Practice this knee strike with your drop, step repeatedly by yourself and then with your buddy, if

133
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,710
possible.

134
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,490
Of course, go easy on your buddies groin.

135
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,790
That's a sensitive area for all genders.

136
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:59,290
So let each other know how hard is too hard and, if possible, have the one being need wear a cup or

137
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,900
other protective padding over their crotch, while region one may maybe still going, it just have power

138
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,500
and speed.

139
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,220
Then you can confidently go full force having your buddy hold that sturdy padding option of yours in

140
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,710
front of them at groin height instead.

141
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:31,310
Our seventh basic move is the all too well known groin kick, the G and Eggs and SIMD.

142
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,880
And it's in both acronyms for a reason because out of all our ten basic moves, you're most likely to

143
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,710
have used this one before in your life.

144
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,270
I know I have.

145
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,030
So while you may not need a lesson in how to do this one, it can't hurt to go through it one more time

146
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,530
and just make sure you've got it down.

147
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:55,730
So starting ready stance now with a kick move, you'll shift your weight onto your stationary foot as

148
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,880
you bring up your kicking butt in a swift flick motion that drives the full rotational power of your

149
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,190
body out into the target area.

150
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,910
And then just as quickly pulls back and drops down again, you want it to be simultaneously powerful

151
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,570
and quick.

152
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,580
You don't want to take too much time to get into the move, or you'll end up telegraphing what you intend

153
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,750
to do to your assailant.

154
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,510
Losing the element of surprise and giving him a chance to counter the attack, you are aiming to connect

155
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,530
to the top of your shoe with the underside of your assailant groin, not the front of his groin.

156
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,210
The up and underneath.

157
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,870
Way up in there as way up in there, you can get really write it up in there.

158
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,880
I want to kick the guy in the groin so hard I lifted him off the ground with my foot.

159
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,150
That's what you want to do because that will cause the most damage and give you the best chance to get

160
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,050
away to safety.

161
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,590
Now again, practicing this with a body may be a little tricky, especially if you're buddy boy parts

162
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,100
down there.

163
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,990
So take it extra slow and careful, or stick to practicing the motions of the moves up until the actual

164
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:13,190
connect with the groin part or have where cup or just have them hold padding in front of them at groin

165
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,890
height, whatever you're both comfortable with.

166
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,070
But you can still practice this move fully by yourself, into the air and into your padding options

167
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,830
at increasing speed and force until you've really got it down or up as it were.

168
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:42,540
The eighth move on our list, the shin or knee kick, takes that same kicking motion and applies it

169
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,940
to your assailants shins or knees.

170
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,090
Essentially, the US in the eggs.

171
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,520
And let me tell you, that is a really painful place to be kicked for anyone.

172
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,820
It also works in just about any scenario you can imagine, but it's especially effective at knocking

173
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,020
down a standing assailant, either from the front or the rear.

174
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,950
To practice this kick, start once again in your ready stance.

175
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,620
Now rotate your body toward the side, it won't be kicking, pivoting and shifting your weight once

176
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:21,220
again onto the stationary foot as you flip your kicking foot out in a quick and powerful kick motion

177
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,720
aimed directly into and through your assailant, shin or knee.

178
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,970
And then just as quickly driving forward with the drop step into your ready stance.

179
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,880
Now, if you're doing this move in the second scenario with an attack from behind, you can turn this

180
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,060
into a back kick, rotate and shift your weight to your stationary foot as you lift and drive your kicking

181
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,100
foot backward into their leg.

182
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,700
In one swift, powerful motion like a donkey kick.

183
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:55,540
And, of course, just as swiftly pull it down into a drop step or if you prefer to still use the front

184
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:55,960
kick.

185
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,170
This may require an extra step to start your turn, then the pivot and shift on to your stationary.

186
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,540
But as you snap your kicking foot out into their shin or knee and back down again.

187
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,040
Now, if you don't have a buddy to practice this move with, that's OK.

188
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,970
You can just set up your sturdy padding option at shin or knee height and practice kicking that repeatedly

189
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:19,780
on your own.

190
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,700
But if you do have a buddy, you should still use that sturdy padding to kick.

191
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,310
Don't actually kick your body.

192
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,670
A shin guard could be good protection when you're going at half speed and force, but it won't really

193
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,640
be enough when you start kicking at full capacity.

194
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:42,430
So when you're ready to give it all you got, you should still have your buddy hold that padding option

195
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,680
at their shin or knee high for you to kick.

196
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,110
And vice versa you for them.

197
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,870
Next move number nine is the foot storm.

198
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:06,460
This is essentially the instep or the eye and CNG, though really anywhere on the foot will hurt pretty

199
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,760
good.

200
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,130
This move is especially ideal in the second scenario when you're attacked from the rear.

201
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,070
But it can work great from the front, too, though it does require close range or the third scenario

202
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,640
as well.

203
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,000
So this is an excellent move if your assailant has got you in an upright hold of some kind from either

204
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,570
direction.

205
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,280
Let's give it a go.

206
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:34,660
From your ready position, raise your stomping foot up and back down again swiftly and forcefully into

207
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,640
a sharp, decisive storm.

208
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,020
Remember to put your full body weight behind it for extra force.

209
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:47,530
This also helps you drive forward with your body as you start again aiming for where your assailant

210
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,820
is currently standing.

211
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:54,970
Now, try practicing with your buddy and get a sense of how close you'll need to be to your assailant

212
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,590
to get in a good start.

213
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:03,280
If you don't have a buddy, you can still recreate some of this scenario by standing close to a wall

214
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,300
or other tall stationary object as if that's your assailant and then drive forward into that wall or

215
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,700
object as you stomp the ground beneath it.

216
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,230
Our tenth and final basic self-defense move is the hip thrust.

217
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,430
This move is primarily useful for a fourth scenario of a ground assault with your assailant on top of

218
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,600
you pinning you down.

219
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:41,200
That's because this scenario might make it a bit tricky to use any of the other moves we've learned

220
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,370
as your legs and arms could be trapped and rendered useless.

221
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:52,210
In that case, the only useful part of your body that you can really utilize to fight back with is your

222
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,590
hip and core area.

223
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,970
Now, this move is rarely enough to get away in of itself.

224
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,240
So the goal here is to free yourself and your limbs enough to go into a barrage of other moves from

225
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,400
our list and do enough damage with those to help you get away to start.

226
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,220
You'll likely be on the ground on your back and your assailant will be on top of you holding you down.

227
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,510
Now this is where it gets extra tricky to practice without a buddy.

228
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,100
Maybe try putting something else heavy on top of you to mimic the assailant.

229
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:31,870
Now what you'll do in one swift motion is plant your feet and raise your hips sharply into the air like

230
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,690
you're doing a hip thrust or a glute bridge exercise.

231
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:40,750
Now, add in a slight rotation as you thrust and your assailant is launched forward and to the side

232
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,110
of you.

233
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:47,320
This will give you a window to push him further off you or shrimp out from under him, or at least start

234
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,770
striking him with all those other moves from your freed side.

235
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,870
Remember, one of our 10 rules is to avoid being on the ground at all costs.

236
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,470
This includes remaining on the ground once you've gone there.

237
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:06,700
So as soon as this move frees you enough to push or wiggle or hit your way out, you want to get back

238
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,060
up on your feet as quickly as possible and hopefully make your escape or, if necessary, continue fighting

239
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,930
back from there.

240
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,740
Now, I know this move may feel awkward and perhaps a bit silly to simulate at first.

241
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,160
But I urge you to push through it because if you end up in this position for real, there will be nothing

242
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,390
silly about it.

243
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,470
It's also a particularly difficult position to get out of.

244
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,080
So you want to be really prepared for this one?

245
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,820
Practice this move as many times as you can, ideally with your buddy.

246
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,190
Make sure you trade places you never know what position you'll end up in in a real fight.

247
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,500
And that's it.

248
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:03,820
Who you did it, you just learned the ten basic moves you need to defend yourself in any situation or

249
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,480
scenario.

250
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,490
Now I know this was a particularly long video and we covered a lot.

251
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,830
So don't hesitate to come back and rewatch this video any time you need a refresher.

252
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,690
I'll always be here.

253
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,990
Or at least this recorded version of me.

254
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,230
Well, in fact, that's your homework assignment this week to review and practice each of these 10 moves

255
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,360
for all of our scenarios.

256
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:37,210
As much as you possibly can give each move at least five to 10 reps each into the air against some sort

257
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,310
of padding with full force and speed.

258
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,430
And then ideally also with a buddy with as much force and speed as you're both comfortable using on

259
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,940
each other.

260
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:52,780
Remember to make it as realistic as possible, though, of course, without possibly endangering yourselves.

261
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,730
Happy training.
