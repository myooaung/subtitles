Ready to continue controlling your boundaries?

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:16.390
Your next exercise is to find your legal boundaries, so open a new browser window on your laptop or

3
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.940
your phone or whatever device you're using at the moment.

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.410
And let's do a quick search for your state's local self-defense laws.

5
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.800
Simply type in your state's name and self-defense laws, and you should find all the information you

6
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.450
need in the first few results.

7
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.130
Make sure you confirm whether your state falls under duty to retreat.

8
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.620
Castle Doctrine or stand your ground laws and with the specifications of those are.

9
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.760
This is definitely a situation when it's good to read the fine print.

10
00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.760
If you're also interested in owning or carrying a weapon of your own, then start a new search and type

11
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.440
in your state and weapon laws to look up the specifics on what weapons you're allowed to own, carry

12
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.510
in public and take with you traveling like on an airplane if you fly on one anytime soon.

13
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.100
Make sure you do this search for each type of weapon you're considering.

14
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.770
We'll talk more about how to effectively use each of these weapons in the next module.

15
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:39.500
Except for mace, tasers and guns, which I strongly recommend against unless you are trained and comfortable

16
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.160
using them.

17
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.760
Guns especially are significantly more advanced and deadly than any other weapon here.

18
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.640
And they go beyond the scope of this basic training.

19
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.900
So if you are interested in learning how to use a handgun, I strongly recommend finding an Emirates

20
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.410
certified handgun safety course to get you started.

21
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.550
Keep in mind, if your state doesn't allow any good options for traditional weapons, there are still

22
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.710
plenty of common everyday items that can provide you with some decent weapons support.

23
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.550
Now, as long as we're here in the search browser, you might as well do a quick search for the federal

24
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.760
self-defense laws in your country as well, especially if you're outside the U.S., as these can differ

25
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.500
from what I covered in the last video.

26
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.050
Either way, it's a good idea to look it up for yourself and make sure you're familiar with all the

27
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.770
particulars.

28
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.200
Remember, knowledge is power.

29
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.920
You should now have a whole lot more knowledge about your mental, physical and legal boundaries where

30
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.160
they are and how to competently set and enforce them.

31
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.390
Your homework assignment this week is to continue researching and setting these boundaries, your state

32
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.780
or local laws, as well as federal self-defense laws.

33
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.970
So go ahead and do that now.

34
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.140
All wait.
