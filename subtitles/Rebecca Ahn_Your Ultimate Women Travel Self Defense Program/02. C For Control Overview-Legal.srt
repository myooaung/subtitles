00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,040
Now, this module's lesson comes in two parts.

2
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:16,090
The other key boundary to keep in mind is any legal limitations and potential ramifications you may

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,660
face.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,600
You'll want to get to know your state or local laws, as well as federal self-defense laws.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,410
Let's start with your state and local self-defense laws.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,660
Do you live in a duty to retreat?

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,130
State a castle doctrine, state a stand your ground state?

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,060
What are your local weapon ownership and carry laws?

9
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,730
Now, all of these laws vary from state to state, including in their scope and parameters.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:49,810
So make sure you inform yourself on the specific self-defense laws in your state while you have the

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,650
time to do so.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:58,180
Laws on owning and carrying weapons also vary state to state, so make sure you look at those two while

13
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,600
you're at it.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,500
On the federal level in the United States, self-defense is an affirmative defense in court.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,760
Fun fact.

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,380
So is it insanity plea?

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:14,230
That means you are pleading guilty but with the justification of self-defense.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:21,100
So if the court rules out self-defense, you've already pled guilty to using force so you could face

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:29,350
charges of assault or battery or even manslaughter or murder in order for your defense to qualify as

20
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,160
self-defense.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,660
You must be able to explain how the threat felt both real and imminent, and for a threat to be real

22
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,170
and imminent, you must be able to identify four things.

23
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:50,920
Intent means opportunity and preclusion intent your assailant must demonstrate, and you must be able

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,120
to explain how you know that he intends to harm you.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,260
It can be obvious, like with his words or less obvious with his actions, his body language, the brandishing

26
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,980
of a weapon.

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:11,080
But it needs to be clear to you means whatever the intent of the threat, he must have the means to

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,550
carry out the threat like actually having a gun when he's saying he's going to shoot you.

29
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,110
Opportunity the threat must be able to reach you with those means, even if he's yelling and waving

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,800
around a knife.

31
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
If he is far away, we're on the other side of locked doors.

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,710
He does not yet have opportunity.

33
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,270
Preclusion.

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,950
This means you had no other viable option in reaction to the threat, meaning you couldn't avoid, evade

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,530
or de-escalate it without using force.

36
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:47,800
You must be able to explain why using force was the only option that would safely work.

37
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,430
The only exception to this last requirement is if you are in a no duty to retreat state either in your

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,470
home under Castle Doctrine law or anywhere else covered by stand your ground law.

39
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:07,270
That exception aside, once any of those four has been eliminated or resolved, it is no longer legally

40
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,040
self-defense, like if you hurt him and he collapses to the ground injured.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,040
He likely doesn't have as much means if he collapses and starts whimpering for you to stop.

42
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,850
You also likely doesn't have as much intent if you keep attacking him after any of these four are gone.

43
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,670
You won't be able to argue self-defense in court.

44
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,180
That's why I emphasize that your primary goal is always to get away safely.

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,680
If you leave as soon as you're safely able to, even after you start using force, you've stayed within

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,570
the legal boundaries of self-defense.

47
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,780
Now that we've got those legalities down.

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,380
Let's add in your mental and physical boundaries from earlier, and you'll be ready to not only recognize

49
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,540
all of them, but verbally and physically reinforce them when you're in danger.

50
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,290
You'll also know what to expect from both yourself and the authorities in response to an attack.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,440
And as they say, knowledge is power.

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,530
When you know all of these boundaries inside and out, you can maintain a state of control and relaxed

53
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,250
readiness, hopefully de-escalate the situation or at least know where to draw the line for yourself

54
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,560
and for a self-defense legal claim.

55
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,670
So ready to set some boundaries, then let's move on to the next video and practice this for real.

56
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,070
These.
