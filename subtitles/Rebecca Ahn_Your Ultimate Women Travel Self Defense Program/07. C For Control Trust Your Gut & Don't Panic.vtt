00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.370
Above all, when you're traveling, it is unbelievably important to stay calm, collected and keep your

2
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.450
wits about you because our arch nemesis, Mr. Freeze, is even more powerful when we're already stepping

3
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.740
outside our comfort zone.

4
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.050
So if and when danger strikes on your travels, you got to be extra ready to breathe, fight off the

5
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.030
freeze and trust your gut to help you stay in control and make smart, quick decisions to keep yourself

6
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.420
safe.

7
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
Listen to your instincts and heed what they tell you.

8
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.740
Women like us are known for our intuition, so use it to your advantage.

9
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.650
And when it tells you that something is off.

10
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.630
Don't ignore it for fear of being rude or making a mistake.

11
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.070
Trust yourself and don't be afraid to say something.

12
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.510
Or better yet, leave if your gut is telling you to remember.

13
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.270
The best protection is prevention.

14
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.070
If you can avoid a potentially dangerous or compromising situation altogether, so much the better.

15
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.120
So when in doubt, just walk away or tell them to go away or both?

16
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.380
Don't risk it.

17
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270
You won't do yourself any favors by freaking out or freezing.

18
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.270
I know this is easier said than done, and it's hard to know how you will react until you are actually

19
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.020
facing it.

20
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.310
It's understandable to panic in the face of danger, but it is imperative to your survival that you

21
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
stay calm and in control of yourself.

22
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.110
You can't control the situation or what others might do, but you can control how you react and you

23
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.970
are stronger than you think.

24
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:06.840
So do like Frankie says, and relax, breathe, think and then act like the smart, tough cookie you

25
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.320
are.

26
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.180
Panic isn't helpful beforehand, either.

27
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.620
Even if your gut is telling you that -- is going to hit the fan imminently.

28
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.990
Yes, listen to your gut.

29
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.130
But with composure and logical reasoning, you won't be doing yourself any favors if you freak out.

30
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.820
Now, fear can be a healthy emotion.

31
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.720
It's your body's way of keeping you alert and ready, but there is a difference between trepidation

32
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.370
and full blown panic.

33
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.020
It never helps to panic.

34
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.870
So as you absorb and embody all of the advice I've given you here, remember above all to keep your

35
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.410
wits about you and stay confidently, cool, calm and collected.
