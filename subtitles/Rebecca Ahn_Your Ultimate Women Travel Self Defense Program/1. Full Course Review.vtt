00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:14.200
If the next letter in our ABC steps, G stood for anything, it would be good job because you've done

2
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.600
it, you've made it through this tough cookies self-defense course in one piece.

3
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:28.720
Hopefully now one much stronger, more resilient and valiant piece like a brilliant diamond or vibranium.

4
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.580
All that's left to do now is to review what we've covered and see what you've learned.

5
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.710
Better to test yourself now and make sure before you have to face the real test.

6
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.450
So let's go back through each of our past modules in this course.

7
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.670
One by one step by step and review it all one more time.

8
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.270
In your first module, you learned with this tough cookie self-defense system is all about what it entails.

9
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.760
Why I started it, how it's different and why it's so important.

10
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.420
You also learned how to get the most out of this course and out of yourself, how to use them to achieve

11
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.770
a stage of relaxed readiness and have a little fun while you're at it.

12
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.020
Your second module taught you the first of your ABCs a four avoid and how to master your situational

13
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.490
and self awareness.

14
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.930
Identify suspicious behavior, potential dangers and typical predators around you in your daily routine

15
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.900
and practice avoiding them entirely.

16
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.080
The third module taught you be for back track.

17
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.320
And how do I identify all your potential escape routes throughout your daily routine, as well as all

18
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.400
the people and places of safety you can escape to?

19
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.220
Once you've managed to get away to safety, always remembering Etgar escape to gain safety in your fourth

20
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:05.070
module, you learn C for control how to maintain control of yourself, both your mind and body by setting

21
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.000
and reinforcing your mental and physical boundaries with your ready stands, ready weapons and loud

22
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.290
verbal warning, as well as your legal boundaries and local self-defense laws, hopefully to de-escalate

23
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.240
the situation, or at least to be prepared if it does become physically violent.

24
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.890
The fifth module went through all the basic but essential deeper defend moves to use in any scenario

25
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.980
when physical force is your only safe and viable option to help you get away to safety.

26
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.570
You learned and practiced all 10 of these moves.

27
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:53.220
Number one, the eye gouge or poke number to the ear twist number three the palm strike number for the

28
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.550

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.320
And Number 10, the hip thrust.

35
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.670
You also learned what to do in any scenario with weapons, both when your assailant has one and when

36
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.560
you decide to use one of your own.

37
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.120
Your sixth module taught you what to do next after you've successfully escaped to safety, including

38
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.930
for events or how to report what happened to the authorities.

39
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.920

Four Evaluate or how to find others you trust to continue talking about it and processing what happened

41
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.980
for yourself and your own recovery.

42
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.160
Remembering that you are strong.

43
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.840
You are a survivor, not a victim, and you are not alone.

44
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.790
Your seventh module wrapped up all of this in a nice little extra familiarised package, emphasizing

45
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.540
the importance of continued consistent practice of all these steps and moves with all your practice,

46
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.610
supplies and support until they become ingrained in your mental and muscle memory, so they will truly

47
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.720
be instinct in the split second moment you need them most.

48
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.820
Now here in your eighth and final module, we've reviewed everything you've learned over the course

49
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.770
of this course.

50
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.490
This is your final Test before the real life test that you hopefully never have to take.

51
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.500
You've done a real good job so far and you're nearly done.

52
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.000
Feels good down it.

53
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.810
Just one video left to go with my final message to you on this the day of your tough cookie graduation.

54
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.450
So go on.

55
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.450
Watch that now.

56
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.770
Good luck on your final test and then go celebrate yourself.
