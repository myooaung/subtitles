00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Instructor] Quarkus has some great documentation

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.005
and I want to walk you through

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.000
some of the guides before we get too deep into this course

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.005
so that you've got a place to refer back to

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.007
as you need to get a little bit deeper

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.009
in the framework itself.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.002
So, let's navigate together to quarkus.io/guides

8
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.003
and let's take a look at it.

9
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.004
So, here you will see the entire Quarkus documentation

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.008
wrapped up into a single page.

11
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.004
If we take a look, here, at the top

12
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.007
you'll see that there is a cheat sheet.

13
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.001
I would highly recommend

14
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.001
that as you're first starting to work with Quarkus,

15
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.009
take a look at that cheat sheet and keep it on your machine.

16
00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.007
There are several times where you may need to look up

17
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.001
how something is a little bit different than say Spring,

18
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.007
and having that is a great way to get going.

19
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.003
Now, you'll notice here that there's a bunch of categories.

20
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:54.005
They've broken down all of their documentation

21
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.008
into specific categories.

22
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:00.001
So, we can start first with the getting started section

23
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.003
and you'll see that we have several documents here.

24
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:05.002
So, building our first application,

25
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.004
getting started with Reactive, building Native Execution

26
00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.002
and then some of the tooling that goes with it.

27
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:16.000
If we jump into one of the actual guides,

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.005
you'll see that most of them follow the same pattern.

29
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.002
They give you a set of prerequisites,

30
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.004
much like we did with this course,

31
00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.002
they tell you specifically

32
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.002
what versions of Java they're going to be running,

33
00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:29.009
they talk about the architecture

34
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.006
of what you're going to build,

35
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:36.001
from a very high level boxes and arrows type perspective.

36
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.009
Then they get into the actual solution

37
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.003
and you'll see where they talk about

38
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.008
how to start our application,

39
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.008
how to modify this application,

40
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.004
what happens in the various

41
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.003
runtime aspects of the application.

42
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.002
They go into a lot of detail

43
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.007
and this is really what I find to be really valuable

44
00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.001
because I can pick up any guide

45
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.005
and get a baseline of how to actually run it,

46
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:01.008
and then I kind of go from there.

47
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:05.009
And again, that's just getting me the detail that I want

48
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.008
from the beginning, which I think is really powerful.

49
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.004
Then they go on to tell you how to run the application,

50
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.000
talk a little bit about the underlying behavior

51
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.007
and why you're doing what you're doing,

52
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:22.004
going into some things like testing, in this example.

53
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.003
And again, just scroll through the doc

54
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:28.005
and get a feel for what it contains.

55
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.009
Now, the next section here is the core section

56
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.008
and this is a very powerful section

57
00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:37.001
especially as you're learning the framework itself.

58
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.002
They give you some stuff about CDI

59
00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.004
and we're going to talk a lot about CDI

60
00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.004
and, specifically, CDI within Quarkus

61
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.000
and how to work with it.

62
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.005
They talk about application initialization

63
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:51.001
which is something that is very important

64
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.008
as you're building bigger and bigger applications

65
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:57.004
to really understand how your apps run.

66
00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.003
We're going to spend a lot of time with configuration

67
00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.000
and how configuration works.

68
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.002
So, we won't get too deep into this guide

69
00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.008
but do know that there is a guide

70
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:07.008
for everything that we're going to talk about

71
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:11.002
here, today, within this course.

72
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:12.004
You then go into the Web

73
00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:15.007
and we'll see that we've got writing JSON REST services,

74
00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:19.001
we've got CRUD services and the list goes on and on.

75
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.002
Things like WebSocket, Reactive,

76
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:23.005
again, anything that you might need to do

77
00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:24.008
from a full stack perspective.

78
00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:27.009
There's probably a doc that gives you a baseline

79
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.009
and then you build off from there.

80
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.002
Data is a big thing

81
00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:32.009
and we're going to talk about that in this course.

82
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.001
You'll see that there's all kinds of details about data

83
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:40.002
and we're going to be using, specifically, Apache Cassandra.

84
00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:41.006
And there is a definition

85
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:45.006
of how to do Apache Cassandra using the DataStax Client

86
00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.001
and things like that.

87
00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:51.001
Messaging, which is another aspect of writing applications,

88
00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:52.002
especially Cloud Native

89
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.007
where you're writing producers and consumers,

90
00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.006
they've got a lot of documentation on that.

91
00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:59.009
And then, of course, everybody's favorite topic set

92
00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.005
which is security.

93
00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:04.007
Again, they've got several guides here about things like

94
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:09.007
OAuth, OpenID, using things like Vault from HashiCorp

95
00:04:09.007 --> 00:04:11.002
and how to make things work

96
00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:15.001
from within an application space using common patterns.

97
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.006
They've got some stuff on business automation,

98
00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.008
integration with tools like Camel.

99
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.009
Again, you can go through the list

100
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.003
but I think that you will find

101
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:26.000
that there is a lot of behavior

102
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.009
that already has guides, written things

103
00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.009
that you may need to do.

104
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.005
So, spend a little bit of time and go through these docs

105
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.001
and we're going to refer back to them

106
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:37.008
as we get to the appropriate aspects of each of these

107
00:04:37.008 --> 00:04:40.000
throughout the rest of this course.
