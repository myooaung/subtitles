(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.009
- [Instructor] So now it's time for the next challenge.

3
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.005
You get lots of opportunity here to learn.

4
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.003
So take advantage and push yourself.

5
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:18.009
Here's the basic requirements for this challenge exercise.

6
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.006
First and foremost, you pick,

7
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:23.003
you can either do REST or GraphQL.

8
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.004
I want you to implement the room-type filter

9
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.008
on all rooms called,

10
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.001
and that room-type filter was what we did

11
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.009
with the batch before, where we passed in a property.

12
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.002
This time, I want you to pass a filter

13
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:41.007
into the all rooms call so that you only get those rooms

14
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.002
that match the bed info that's passed in.

15
00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.004
I also would like you to allow for additional rooms

16
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.009
through the service, so creating a new room.

17
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.009
And, finally, I want you to be able to select just one room,

18
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.003
and that will be based on the room number.

19
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.001
And that's all there is to it.

20
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.000
You get to do the rest.
