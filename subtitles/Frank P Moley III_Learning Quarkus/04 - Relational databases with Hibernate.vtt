00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] So now that we've seen the basics

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.001
of connecting to a database and using JDBC,

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.003
we're going to take a look at what it takes

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:11.002
to bring Hibernate into the picture with Quarkus.

5
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.003
So let's go back into our command app

6
00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.008
and open up the pom file,

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:21.000
and we're going to add another dependency in here.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The dependency that we are going to add is

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.008
Quarkus

10
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:25.001
Hibernate

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.003
ORM

12
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:34.000
and that is of course going to come from io.quarkus

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.005
And we'll allow Maven to do it's thing.

14
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.002
All right, so let's go into source main Java

15
00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.005
And into our base package.

16
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:43.009
Let's go into our Room class

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.008
and let's annotate this Room class

18
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.002
to be a Hibernate entity.

19
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.008
So @Entity

20
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.000
and we're going to go ahead and give it a table

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.008
with a name equals

22
00:00:56.008 --> 00:01:02.007
Room.

23
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:06.009
And now let's add a private long id.

24
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.003
We'll annotate that with @Id.

25
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.009
@GeneratedValue,

26
00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.006
with a strategy of identity

27
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:21.002
because this is a serial object

28
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.005
and then a column

29
00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:34.003
name equals Room ID.

30
00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.003
Now we're going to add a column

31
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.001
to each of our fields here.

32
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:44.002
So name is name.

33
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:53.008
Room number is Room under number.

34
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.004
And bed info

35
00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.003
is that.

36
00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.005
Now let's go into our CommandRunner.

37
00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:07.003
And we're going to swap out our dataSource

38
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:14.007
with an EntityManager.

39
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:19.000
And now let's take out some of this

40
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.009
data here.

41
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:31.004
All right.

42
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.002
Now the first thing that we need to do

43
00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:37.004
because Hibernate is designed to be request scoped.

44
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:43.005
Is we need to set a requestContext

45
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.009
activate.

46
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.005
And when we are done,

47
00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:53.002
we're going to do the same thing

48
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:59.004
and then we are going to deactivate it.

49
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:00.005
All right.

50
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.002
Now

51
00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:06.005
list of Room elements called Rooms

52
00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:10.009
will be equal to entityManager

53
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.005
.createQuery.

54
00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.002
And the query we're going to pass it is

55
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:17.006
select r

56
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:21.000
from Room r,

57
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
this is going to be a Room.class

58
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.001
and then we want to get the result list.

59
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.009
And then we go ahead and print them out

60
00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.000
and we should be good to go.

61
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.005
And that's all it really takes

62
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.004
to get Hibernate running in Quarkus

63
00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.005
with one other change that we need to make.

64
00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:42.000
We need to go into the resource files

65
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.005
because Hibernate will try to create the schemer

66
00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:46.004
and we've already done that.

67
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:53.003
So let's tell Hibernate

68
00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:55.004
to not generate our database.

69
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:59.003
Now this is the default value is none.

70
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.007
I like to go ahead and set it,

71
00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:03.001
just because I like to be very thorough

72
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.007
and I have seen issues where Hibernate

73
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.000
will still overwrite the settings

74
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.001
so I like to explicitly say none here.

75
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:16.008
But at that point we can run our application

76
00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:19.006
and you'll see once again we've downloaded all of our rooms

77
00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:23.000
from the database by simply using Hibernate.

78
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.005
Now plus or minus on Hibernate,

79
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm not the biggest fan of it

80
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.001
because of the way it does some things

81
00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:29.009
but it does work

82
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.009
and it does make things easier

83
00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.003
especially in simpler use cases

84
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:36.001
and if you add Pinash on top of it

85
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.003
which we're not going to go into in this course,

86
00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:40.004
it can make it even easier

87
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:42.003
if you don't really want to get into the details

88
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:44.006
of running JDBC database connections

89
00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.006
which is how I prefer to do my work

90
00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:49.000
when working with relational databases.
