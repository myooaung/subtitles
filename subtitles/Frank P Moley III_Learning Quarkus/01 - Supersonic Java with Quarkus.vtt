- [Instructor] The world of Java frameworks

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:06.005
is getting bigger, but one framework aims to buck the trend

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.000
in order to deliver applications

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.002
that are smaller with less resource needs,

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.000
while offering the power

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.009
of the Java development language and ecosystem.

7
00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.007
Welcome to Quarkus, one of the most exciting frameworks

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.009
for building Java-based microservices

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.004
and Cloud native components today.

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.003
Hi, my name is Frank Moley,

11
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.005
I'm a developer, architect, leader,

12
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.003
student and teacher of Cloud native architectures

13
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:37.000
and languages that make them possible.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.002
Quarkus is one such technology

15
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.005
that has really sparked my attention

16
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.001
ever since I first laid eyes on it.

17
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.009
So let's get ready for a supersonic journey

18
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:51.000
through the subatomic framework they call Quarkus.
