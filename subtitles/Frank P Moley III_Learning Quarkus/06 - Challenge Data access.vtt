(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:07.005
- [Instructor] Now it's time

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.008
for our next challenge exercise.

4
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.002
We will do some work with data from our database

5
00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.006
in a command mode program.

6
00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:18.002
So here's the guidelines of this challenge exercise.

7
00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.006
You can use either of the databases that we've used

8
00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.001
or use your own.

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.009
I ask you to use the room data as I've provided it

10
00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.004
in whatever database you choose.

11
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.009
Now, what I want you to do is I want you to create a query

12
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.002
that will search for the bed info loaded from config.

13
00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.006
So there's a bed info column, and it contains data

14
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:42.007
like 1K for one king or 1Q for one queen.

15
00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:45.005
And that's the data that I want you to search for.

16
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.006
And then I want you to load all of the rooms that match that

17
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.004
and print them to the console.

18
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.000
So it's relatively much what we've done.

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.005
We're just going to add a little caveat

20
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.004
of querying a subset of the data instead of all of it.

21
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:02.000
So give that a shot, and I'll be back with my solution.
