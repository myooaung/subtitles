00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] To be successful in this course

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.007
there is some baseline knowledge that you will need,

3
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.000
and some software you will need to have installed

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.005
on your machine.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.006
First and foremost, as you might imagine,

6
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.009
you will need Java to compile

7
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.002
and execute Quercus based applications.

8
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:20.004
We'll be using JDK 14 for this course,

9
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.000
you will need to have a JDK installed on your machine.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.005
You can use open JDK, Oracle JDK, or even GraalVM,

11
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:33.003
just make sure that you have a JDK and not just a JRE.

12
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:37.000
Now I am going to expect some baseline knowledge of Java.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.007
This isn't a course in Java per se,

14
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.004
but it is a framework built in Java.

15
00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.004
We won't do anything outside of some basic Java usage,

16
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.000
but I don't want you to get tripped up

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.006
on the Java portions of this course.

18
00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.008
So again, some basic knowledge of Java is expected.

19
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.009
Well, now the hard and fast prerequisites.

20
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.007
Some experience with running executable JARs

21
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.009
and embedded servlet containers will help you get past

22
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:07.006
some of the early complexity of running applications

23
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.007
written with Quercus.

24
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.004
In the same vein, a basic understanding

25
00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.005
of the dependency injection pattern will be helpful

26
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:20.004
as we explain injecting independency injection overall,

27
00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.008
in this course.

28
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.000
Now for this course we will be using Maven

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.006
for dependency management and build routines.

30
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:31.009
You will need to have Maven three executable available

31
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.007
to you and on your path, you can install it on your OS,

32
00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.000
run it through your IDE,

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or use the wrapper scripts that come with Quercus.

34
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.008
Now I'm going to recommend that you use the first option.

35
00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.008
Apache has some good instructions on installing Maven

36
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.007
for each operating system,

37
00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.000
so I'm going to leave that to them on the actual installation,

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.001
check it out on their website and from there

39
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.003
you should be able to do the installation yourself.

40
00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:59.001
Everything we are going to do with Maven,

41
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.005
with the exception of bootstrapping,

42
00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.002
can be accomplished with Gradle if you prefer.

43
00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.006
While some of my examples will be with Maven,

44
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:11.006
there are corresponding options with Gradle,

45
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.002
and it will work just fine,

46
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.000
again, outside the bootstrapping.

47
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.003
But you need to know that you're on your own there

48
00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:21.007
in order to make things work the same.

49
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.005
So if possible, I would suggest

50
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:25.009
that you just go ahead and use Maven.

51
00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:29.004
Now while we will execute compilation routines,

52
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:34.005
much of our use of Maven comes from managing dependencies,

53
00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.001
or extensions, as Quercus calls them,

54
00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.006
and that's going to be the primary use for this course.

55
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.005
Now the next piece of software that you will need

56
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.005
on your system, isn't a development environment,

57
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:50.008
or an IDE, while you can use a text editor just fine,

58
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.009
I recommend that you use a full

59
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.007
integrated development environment or IDE,

60
00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.009
tailored specifically for Java.

61
00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.007
Now in this course I will be using IntelliJ ultimate edition

62
00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:05.004
because I use JetBrains tools every day,

63
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:08.009
and for me, they make me feel most comfortable.

64
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:14.000
Do not feel like you need to use the same IDE that I use.

65
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.002
And I don't expect you to, use what you know.

66
00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.008
Every function that I will use in my IDE,

67
00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:24.004
is either available to your IDE,

68
00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:28.006
assuming it's a first-class Java IDE, free or paid,

69
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:31.003
and also know that if it's not available in the IDE,

70
00:03:31.003 --> 00:03:33.004
it most likely is available on the web,

71
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:36.006
through a web service call or something to that effect.

72
00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.003
And I'm going to call those out when we get there.

73
00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:42.002
Now I want to stress this point very clearly,

74
00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:46.003
you need to be comfortable with the tools you use,

75
00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:50.007
especially your IDE, do not try to mimic solely what I do

76
00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:54.002
in this course, because of the tools that I use.

77
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:57.000
Again, this course isn't the tools,

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.003
it's about Quercus and the software that we will write.

79
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:03.005
Now because you use your IDE as a tool,

80
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:06.002
most often when building applications,

81
00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:09.003
what matters here is that you are comfortable with it

82
00:04:09.003 --> 00:04:11.001
and you are familiar with it,

83
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.003
not that you use the same one that I use.

84
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.004
Now the final software package that we will use

85
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:18.007
in this course is Docker.

86
00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:22.000
This is an entirely optional install,

87
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.006
not all versions of Windows for instance, support Docker.

88
00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:28.006
The installation of Docker is very straightforward,

89
00:04:28.006 --> 00:04:30.009
and the instructions are available on the website

90
00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.003
and very well written for Docker itself.

91
00:04:34.003 --> 00:04:35.008
Now we're only going to use Docker

92
00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.005
to run our database locally for this course,

93
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:41.004
and specifically, we're going to use Cassandra.

94
00:04:41.004 --> 00:04:45.001
Now you can install the database locally if you prefer,

95
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.001
or if you cannot run Docker,

96
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:51.002
but it will be such a small portion of this course,

97
00:04:51.002 --> 00:04:54.002
and the installation of Cassandra is pretty straightforward

98
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.000
from a developer's perspective,

99
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.008
so I'm not going to get too deep into that,

100
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:01.008
but do know also that there are other options

101
00:05:01.008 --> 00:05:05.004
for running Cassandra, such as Astra from DataStax

102
00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:08.006
where you can use a free web version of Cassandra.

103
00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.007
Again, outside the scope of this course,

104
00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:14.004
but there are options if you don't want to install Docker,

105
00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:17.009
or can't install Docker on your machine.

106
00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.006
The rest of the tooling that we are going to use

107
00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:24.003
for this course, are standard for modern operating systems.

108
00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:26.002
We're going to use things like the command line.

109
00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:30.005
So be sure you know how to use it for your operating system.

110
00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:31.008
And of course, a web browser,

111
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:34.009
and I expect that everyone knows how to do that.

112
00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:41.000
So, let's jump in now to some supersonic, subatomic Java.
