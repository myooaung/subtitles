00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] With Quarkus, there are several ways

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.003
to create a new application.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.008
Of course any of them are viable,

4
00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.006
but I want to walk you through some of the basics

5
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.009
of each one of them.

6
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.006
One way to start a new Quarkus-based application

7
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.006
is through the Maven plugin.

8
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.007
You execute a Maven command, pass in the plugin,

9
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.006
and call the create goal on that plugin,

10
00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.002
and it will generate a bootstrapped application

11
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:25.003
for you with some basic extension points.

12
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.009
Now, there's a few things that you need to add

13
00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.008
when you call the create goal.

14
00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.005
First and foremost, is the project group ID,

15
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:33.008
which should look very familiar

16
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.006
if you've ever worked with Maven.

17
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.002
The second is the artifact ID,

18
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:40.004
and this is obviously the name of your artifact itself,

19
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.001
and again, it should be very familiar

20
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.002
if you've ever worked with Maven.

21
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.001
The next element that you need to provide is a class name,

22
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.008
and this is the class name where your application

23
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.009
will respond to web requests at,

24
00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.001
and the path is where those web requests will go.

25
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.009
So those apply really to web-based applications

26
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.005
that you are providing that details.

27
00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.006
Another mechanism to create a new project,

28
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:11.002
and the one that I use most often, is via an IDE plugin.

29
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.007
Now, many IDEs contain plugins specifically

30
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.007
for Quarkus and IntelliJ Ultimate Edition,

31
00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.002
which is what I use, definitely does provide that.

32
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.004
This allows you to select, not only the application details,

33
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.004
but any of the extensions that you want

34
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.006
to add to your application,

35
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.009
and it generates the project locally in your IDE

36
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.002
without having to go through any of the downloading

37
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.001
and expanding operations that we're going to have to do

38
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.005
with the web-based model,

39
00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.007
which is what we will show you next.

40
00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.000
So this is the final way of creating an application,

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.008
and it's probably the most universal inefficient,

42
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.009
since it applies to everybody.

43
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.008
The location is code.quarkus.io,

44
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.005
you select all of your details of the project,

45
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.007
and then any extensions you want to add,

46
00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.006
download it to a zip file,

47
00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.000
and then you go from there.

48
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.006
Now let's jump into a website

49
00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:04.001
and let's take a look at this,

50
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.001
and walk through these steps.

51
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.007
All right, this is code.quarkus.io,

52
00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:09.009
and the first thing that we're going to do here,

53
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.006
is we're going to enter in a group.

54
00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.002
Now I'm going to choose com.frankmoley.lil.lq,

55
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.005
so LinkedIn learning, learning Quarkus.

56
00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.004
This is just a pattern that I use for my courses.

57
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:24.004
You choose, whatever group makes sense for you.

58
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.008
Now, the artifact name here is,

59
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.003
I'm going to just use is example.

60
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.007
We will select the Maven build tool.

61
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.003
Our version is fine.

62
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.005
You'll notice this flag here.

63
00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:38.006
Certain extensions have sample code

64
00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:41.003
that you can download with the project,

65
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:42.009
if you choose that.

66
00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:43.007
We're not going to use that,

67
00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:46.002
so I'm going to select No, Thanks.

68
00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.008
Now I'm going to pick two extensions,

69
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.005
RESTEasy JAX-RS and RESTEasy Jackson,

70
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:54.001
so that I get an object marshaller.

71
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.002
Now I'm going to generate my application.

72
00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:57.008
You'll notice there's a couple ways to do that,

73
00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:01.000
download as a zip file, push it to GitHub, or share.

74
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.005
I'm going to download as a zip,

75
00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:04.003
but oftentimes if you want to do this,

76
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:06.009
you can go ahead and push straight to GitHub,

77
00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.009
so that you have that base commit,

78
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.000
because quite often that's the first thing that we do,

79
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.002
is download it and then push a base commit.

80
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.005
So, that may be an easier way for you.

81
00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:16.005
In this case, I'm going to go ahead

82
00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:19.002
and just download the zip file.

83
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.008
All right, so now that that's downloaded,

84
00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:23.008
let's jump into a terminal window,

85
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:26.008
and you'll see that I have the zip file in my downloads.

86
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.005
So I'm going to go ahead and unzip that,

87
00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.005
and now I'm going to move this folder

88
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:37.007
to where I keep my code on my machine for this course,

89
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.001
and now I'm going to jump into my IDE.

90
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:46.000
So now I need to import this project,

91
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as a new module,

92
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.009
use Maven as the import model,

93
00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.006
we'll go ahead and set our language level

94
00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.000
to the same JDK that I'm using,

95
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.008
which is 14, and we will allow Maven to do all

96
00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.002
of its downloading and dependencies,

97
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:06.001
and while it's doing that,

98
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.004
I'm going to go to source, main, Java,

99
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:13.002
and I'm going to create a new package,

100
00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:20.000
com.frankmoley.lil.lq.example,

101
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.003
and in there I'm going to create a new Java Class,

102
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.008
and we will call this Greeting,

103
00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:29.002
and now, to my Greeting,

104
00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:40.005
I'm going to put an @Path of greeting,

105
00:04:40.005 --> 00:04:46.007
and then I'm going to do an @GET, @Produces,

106
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:54.002
and we'll go ahead and do a MediaType,

107
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.007
and we will just do plain text,

108
00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:00.007
and we'll talk about all these details here in a little bit,

109
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.006
and what all this means, but for right now,

110
00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:05.009
let's just walk through the basics.

111
00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:14.001
We'll do a public String, called getGreeting,

112
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:19.003
and we will simply return Hello World.

113
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:22.008
Now there's a couple ways that we can run our application.

114
00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:25.007
I can set up, because IntelliJ allows me to,

115
00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:28.006
I can just simply run this from a IDE,

116
00:05:28.006 --> 00:05:31.000
because it knows that this is a Quarkus application,

117
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.009
and it knows how to run that.

118
00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.004
A more correct way to do this, however,

119
00:05:35.004 --> 00:05:37.008
I'm going to pop open a terminal window,

120
00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:40.002
directly in my IDE here,

121
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:44.002
and you can do the same from your terminal or from your IDE.

122
00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:47.003
I'm going to go ahead and go into our example project,

123
00:05:47.003 --> 00:05:56.009
and I am going to simply run a mvn compile quarkus:dev.

124
00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.009
Now what this is going to do,

125
00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.001
is it's going to download everything that it needs

126
00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:02.003
to run the application,

127
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.006
and then you'll just turn on your actual application

128
00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:08.003
and get it up and running with live code turned on.

129
00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:11.002
So you'll see that our application has started up,

130
00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:14.000
the CDI container is there, RESTEasy,

131
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.004
RESTEasy Jackson is there

132
00:06:15.004 --> 00:06:17.005
from our second log message,

133
00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:21.005
and now what I can do, is I can go to a browser

134
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:27.003
and I can simply go to localhost:8080/greeting,

135
00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:29.002
and you'll see that I got Hello World,

136
00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.007
which is what I would expect.

137
00:06:30.007 --> 00:06:32.008
Now, we're going to get into a lot more detail

138
00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:36.000
about what we all just did, but I did want to show you

139
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.005
that you can simply download an application,

140
00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:41.006
get it started, and run the application,

141
00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:44.000
in just a few clicks.
