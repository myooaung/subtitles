00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Logging is a fundamental aspect

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.005
of a running application.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:05.007
There should never be a time

4
00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.004
when you deploy to production,

5
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.005
or even dev for that matter, without logging.

6
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.006
So let's take a quick look

7
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.000
at how easy logging is, with Quarkus.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.004
Now Quarkus supports many logging frameworks,

9
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:19.008
and these logging frameworks,

10
00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.007
many of which you've used several times over,

11
00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.003
if you've ever done anything within the Java ecosystem.

12
00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.000
Now by default, you're going to get JBoss

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.001
as the default logging framework.

14
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.003
Now it's not my favorite by any means,

15
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:34.007
but it does do the trick,

16
00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.006
and it will serve all of the needs for this course.

17
00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.001
Now, you do get standard logging behavior

18
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.003
throughout any of your frameworks,

19
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.008
and if you're using something other than Jboss

20
00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.003
there is a handler set up,

21
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:50.008
so that you can use any of your existing logging frameworks

22
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.001
to get their standard behavior.

23
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.004
Now, configuration of the logs

24
00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.001
is actually very straightforward with Quarkus,

25
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.006
and you may find that it's similar to everything else,

26
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.000
which makes sense, because one of the main goals

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.008
of Quarkus was unification of configuration.

28
00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.006
So, you configure your logs

29
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.002
within your application dot properties.

30
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.004
There's a Quarkus dot log, dot star tag,

31
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.009
and you will use that for all of your logging.

32
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.004
Remembering of course, that Quarkus tagged items

33
00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:23.008
are reserved for the language itself,

34
00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:27.002
you cannot create a property with Quarkus dot something.

35
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:30.009
So usually, and it continues to be the case,

36
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.007
anything with Quarkus dot is configured by the system,

37
00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.008
and logging is no exception.

38
00:01:36.008 --> 00:01:39.003
Now you can modify the format of the logs,

39
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:40.009
although it does give you a relatively

40
00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.005
standard log format out of the box.

41
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.002
All right, let's go ahead and open up our command app,

42
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.003
and let's go to source main Java,

43
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.005
and open up our command runner.

44
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:58.002
Now, I told you that you get logging for free with Quarkus,

45
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.006
and let me show you how free it really is.

46
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:06.001
We're going to create a private static final logger,

47
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.008
and this is going to come from JBoss logging,

48
00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.003
because that's what you get for free.

49
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:15.006
We will call it log, and this is going to be

50
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:20.002
logger dot get logger, and we will simply use the command

51
00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:26.002
runner dot class name, to define it.

52
00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:33.001
And now we very simply can do a log dot debug,

53
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:40.008
and we will do starting application.

54
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:52.009
And a log dot debug, completing application.

55
00:02:52.009 --> 00:03:00.000
And let's change this system dot out, into a log dot info.

56
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.002
All right, now let's run our application.

57
00:03:05.002 --> 00:03:08.002
You will see here, second from the bottom line,

58
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:11.005
that we output our hello, LinkedIn learning students,

59
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.004
which is what we'd expect.

60
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:16.002
Notice that everything is at an info level,

61
00:03:16.002 --> 00:03:17.006
and the reason it's at info level

62
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.005
is that's the default behavior.

63
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.000
So let's jump back over here,

64
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.007
let me fix my spelling mistake that I just saw.

65
00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:28.008
And let's go once again to source main resources

66
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:34.000
application dot properties, and let's set our Quarkus

67
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.007
dot log, dot level, equal to debug.

68
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:48.000
And now let's once again run our application.

69
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.004
You'll see we get a lot more messages out,

70
00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:53.004
because now we're getting all the debug messages.

71
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:55.002
And of course you wouldn't do this in production

72
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.009
on a regular basis, because it's very difficult

73
00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.006
to find anything as you're digging through this.

74
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:04.005
You can customize which messages come at which level,

75
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.005
I'm just modifying the route logger,

76
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.000
just because it's easier to show you.

77
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.007
But again, you can go in and say, okay,

78
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:13.004
everything with calm dot Frank Molly,

79
00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:15.008
for instance, needs to be at debug

80
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:19.000
and everything else needs to still be at info, or warn,

81
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.004
again, that's all built into the framework,

82
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:23.003
and there is one of their guides

83
00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:26.004
that goes into a lot of detail on logging,

84
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:28.001
and I encourage you to take a look at that.

85
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:30.005
So we will jump back to info level,

86
00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:35.007
and we can actually delete that, because it is default.

87
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:39.000
And that's all there is to logging with Quarkus.
