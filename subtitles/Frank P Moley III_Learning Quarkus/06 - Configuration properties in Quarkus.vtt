00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] As with every framework,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.008
the ability to add external configuration is critical

3
00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.008
for the framework to not only be taken seriously,

4
00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.001
but to be used in a cloud native,

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.004
as well as containerized workloads.

6
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.000
ConfigProperty is the core concept

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.009
of this within Quarkus.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.000
It's an annotation to load a property from the environment.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.007
It can be applied to classes,

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.002
as well as individual elements within a class,

11
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.009
in order to accomplish grouping.

12
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.006
And there's support for things like profiles

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.009
and Quarkus out of the box supports three profiles,

14
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.008
dev, test, and prod,

15
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.003
and we've already seen the dev profile

16
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.009
in the way that we ran Quarkus as dev.

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.001
And you can also create dynamic properties

18
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.005
via property extensions using the framework.

19
00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:55.009
Quarkus property system also allows for real time overrides.

20
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.008
These can be modified at startup time,

21
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.004
overriden via the command line for instance,

22
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.004
you can load them from the environment,

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.009
or there is also support for YAML,

24
00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.009
and YAML support is really valuable

25
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.002
in a Kubernetes environment

26
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.009
where you may want to load them from a config map.

27
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.002
So let's take a look at configuration properties

28
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.006
within our application.

29
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.003
So, we're going to go to our command app again

30
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.009
and I want you to go to source, main, resources,

31
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.006
and open up the application-properties file.

32
00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:30.004
Now this is where we define

33
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.008
all of our configuration properties

34
00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.006
that live with the application.

35
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.005
Obviously, not everyone will live with the application

36
00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:39.006
and often times,

37
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:41.008
you want to override them at run time,

38
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.005
but for now, let's just stick with the basic case

39
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.009
and put it in our application-properties.

40
00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:56.000
So we will call this application.greeting.recipient

41
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.001
and we will set that equal to,

42
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:07.005
let's call in LinkedIn Learning Students.

43
00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:12.000
So now let's go back to our application,

44
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.001
and you'll see how before we said Hello Students,

45
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.001
well now what I want to do is I want to inject into here

46
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:24.001
@ConfigProperty, there's a couple elements

47
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:24.009
that we can put here.

48
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.009
So the first thing that I want to do here

49
00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.006
is we're going to put a default value

50
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:35.000
and our default value is going to be Students.

51
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.003
Now our name is going to be

52
00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.002
our application.greeting.recipients.

53
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:47.004
I'm going to go ahead and copy that over.

54
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.008
So what this says is if the application recipient

55
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.008
is not found,

56
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.008
go ahead and inject students,

57
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:58.005
otherwise, do your recipient.

58
00:02:58.005 --> 00:03:00.000
Looks like I spelled that wrong,

59
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.008
so let me fix that real quick.

60
00:03:05.008 --> 00:03:07.002
Alright, so now all we have to do

61
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:09.000
is actually use that property.

62
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.001
So the way that we'll do that

63
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.004
is when we say Hello here,

64
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:21.001
we will simply add the value of recipient,

65
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.008
but you'll notice I haven't defined that.

66
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:25.005
So when I do my @ConfigProperty,

67
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.009
I need to tell it where to put it.

68
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:35.005
So we're going to put it into a string called recipient.

69
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:39.008
So now as I run my application,

70
00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:42.005
you will see now that I did exit with a zero,

71
00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.002
so everything worked fine

72
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.009
and a couple lines up from that,

73
00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.003
Hello LinkedIn Learning Students,

74
00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:51.006
and again, that came from the configuration properties.

75
00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:54.008
We can jump back over here

76
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.007
and we can change this again to something like Folks,

77
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:02.009
and I should be able to just hit Enter here

78
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.006
and have this run again.

79
00:04:06.006 --> 00:04:09.001
And you see now, it changed it to Hello Folks.

80
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.001
Now if I'm running this in the command line,

81
00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.001
I could hit Enter to run this again,

82
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.007
what I can't do is that from within this window,

83
00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.001
so there are benefits to running things

84
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:19.003
from within the command line,

85
00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:21.004
but you'll see that I actually had to go restart this

86
00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:24.006
and that's because I'm running it within my ID.

87
00:04:24.006 --> 00:04:27.006
So sometimes running it from the command line is better

88
00:04:27.006 --> 00:04:30.003
because then I can simply hit Enter to restart it,

89
00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:32.003
but in this case, it works just fine,

90
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:33.006
you'll see that we get Hello Folks now

91
00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:36.004
because that's what we changed this to.

92
00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.003
Now, one more test that we want to run,

93
00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:39.009
we're going to actually delete this value

94
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.002
and we will restart our application

95
00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:45.006
and you'll see now it says Hello Students

96
00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.005
and it exited with zero

97
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:48.009
because it fell back to that default value

98
00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.005
that was Students.

99
00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:57.004
So we'll just go ahead and put this back in here

100
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.000
and that's all she wrote.
