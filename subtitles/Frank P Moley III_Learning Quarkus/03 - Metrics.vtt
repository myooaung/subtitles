00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.004
= [Instructor] One of the most crucial components

2
00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.000
for observability,

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.003
is actually metrics.

4
00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:10.003
I use metrics almost exclusively to trigger pages

5
00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:14.003
because of the detail, speed and fine grade support

6
00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:17.003
you can drive through metrics measurements.

7
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.005
Let's take a look at using micrometer in corcus.

8
00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.004
So let's go back into our room service

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:28.002
and open up a POM file,

10
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.001
and we're going to add a couple of dependencies.

11
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:37.009
The first one is quarkus micrometer,

12
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.003
and the next one,

13
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.008
is micrometer

14
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.008
registry

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:50.001
Prometheus

16
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.009
from IOTA micrometer.

17
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.008
Now there's more than one metrics registry

18
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.006
but that's the one that we're going to use.

19
00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.004
cause that's the one that you most often use

20
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.008
with Kubernetes when dealing with metrics.

21
00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:06.003
So now that we have those dependencies in place,

22
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.005
let's go to source main Java.

23
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:15.007
Let's go to our room resource.

24
00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:22.000
And we're going to inject into our class,

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.007
a meter registry.

26
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:29.005
And what we're going to do is we're going to add a simple

27
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.004
timing element

28
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.007
to our method.

29
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.002
So we're going to go back to our get all rooms method

30
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:44.003
and we're going to do a timer,

31
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:48.002
We're going to do this to the room service,

32
00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.002
and we're going to tag this,

33
00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.009
with a method

34
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.009
and that method is get all rooms

35
00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.002
Now, we could tag this with more elements

36
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:01.006
If we wanted to, for instance

37
00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:07.006
if there is bed info populated, but for now, this is fine.

38
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.009
And then we are going to register

39
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.009
that component

40
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.003
to our meter registry.

41
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:23.004
Now, we need to create a start element

42
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:27.007
we need system dot nano time to do that

43
00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:31.006
now, right before we return

44
00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:36.000
we're going to do a timer dot record

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.005
system dot nano time

46
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.006
minus start time.

47
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:48.003
and the time unit

48
00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.004
will be nanoseconds.

49
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:52.009
Now, obviously this is just one type of metric

50
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.003
The timer.

51
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:55.009
You have many different things

52
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:59.000
like gauges and stuff that you can use.

53
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.006
But again, for the purposes of this demo

54
00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:06.000
the timer works sufficient for what we need.

55
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.008
So now that our application has started

56
00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.005
let's go to our web browser

57
00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:15.008
and we're going to go to local host 8080 slash rooms.

58
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:20.002
And let's run that a few times.

59
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:24.006
Now let's send in a,

60
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:30.003
slow it down a little bit by sending in a bad info request

61
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.005
If we go to local host

62
00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.008
8080

63
00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.008
slash metrics,

64
00:03:35.008 --> 00:03:37.008
you'll see in Prometheus's format

65
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:42.000
that we now have a rum metric dump that can be scraped.

66
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.002
Let's take a look and see if we can find our room service.

67
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:51.000
So you'll see here that we had a room service max

68
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.002
and then we have another one, forget all rooms at four,

69
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.005
we got all kinds of data

70
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.008
about our rooms so we can continue scrolling down

71
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:02.009
and you'll see them based on the number of calls we made.

72
00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.009
And that's precisely the value

73
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.008
of metrics is it's a long running estimate

74
00:04:07.008 --> 00:04:09.004
of things like how long it takes

75
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:11.006
and what data's coming out of your system.

76
00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:13.006
and you can use that to trigger alarms

77
00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:17.003
and do many other things from an operational perspective.

78
00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:19.009
Now, we just touched on operations

79
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.005
but operations really is a critical aspect

80
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:26.009
of using a framework to build applications

81
00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.006
especially when running in a microservices

82
00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:33.003
or cloud native container as workplace.

83
00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:34.005
So I highly encourage you

84
00:04:34.005 --> 00:04:35.005
to spend some time

85
00:04:35.005 --> 00:04:38.001
and read through all the docs around operations

86
00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:39.005
within quarkus

87
00:04:39.005 --> 00:04:42.001
as well as everything else we've touched

88
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:45.004
and keep in mind that those docs are there to help you.

89
00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:47.001
There is a lot of information

90
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.003
that we haven't even talked about

91
00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:53.000
within quarkus that you can use in your day-to-day job.
