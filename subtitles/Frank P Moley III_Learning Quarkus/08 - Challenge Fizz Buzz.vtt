00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:06.008
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.001
- [Instructor] So now we get to our first challenge exercise

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.004
of this course and this is going to be the infamous

4
00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.006
FizzBuzz exercise.

5
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.005
So there's some rules that we need to define

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.000
about what FizzBuzz is.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.006
So you're going to iterate from one to some number,

8
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:25.001
and we'll talk about the rules on what that some number is.

9
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.008
I'm going to ask you to print that number to the console.

10
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.009
Now, if the number is divisible by three,

11
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.001
instead of printing the number you're going to print fizz.

12
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.007
If the number is divisible by five, however,

13
00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:43.001
instead of printing the number you're going to print buzz.

14
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.005
Now, of course, if it's divisible by both

15
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.004
you'll print FizzBuzz.

16
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.007
Now, how are we going to do this with Quarkus?

17
00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.000
First and foremost,

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.006
I'm going to ask you to create a command mode application.

19
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:59.006
Then I'm going to ask you to have configuration value

20
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.007
for the max number.

21
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.000
I want you to have logging

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.003
for when the routine starts and when it finishes.

23
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:12.000
And finally, I want you to execute the FizzBuzz routine

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.004
in an injected class.

25
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.000
So I want you to create an injected class

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.001
that contains the FizzBuzz routine,

27
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.000
inject that into the run method

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.007
of our command mode application and execute it from there.

29
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:24.008
That way we can kind of touch

30
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.003
on the various aspects of Quarkus

31
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.006
while dealing with a relatively trivial exercise.

32
00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.000
So now it's your turn and I'll be back in a few minutes

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and let you know my solution to this problem.
