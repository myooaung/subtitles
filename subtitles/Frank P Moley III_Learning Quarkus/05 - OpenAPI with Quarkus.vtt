00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] A web service

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.009
is only as good as its documentation.

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.009
The OpenAPI spec allows you to easily document

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:12.009
an existing service or create the documentation first

5
00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.004
and generate a service from it

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.008
which is usually how I use it.

7
00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.001
But let's take a look at how to do the former.

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.004
So let's go into our room service application.

9
00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:24.005
And the first thing we need to do

10
00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.006
is we need to bring in a dependency.

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.004
Now we could definitely add it to the POM,

12
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.001
but I want to show you another way that Quarkus

13
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.001
allows you to add dependencies.

14
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.009
So I'm going to to jump to the terminal real quick.

15
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.000
So in the terminal I'm going to navigate

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.005
to our room service application.

17
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.007
And from here, I'm going to do a Maven command.

18
00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.008
Quarkus add extension,

19
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:55.007
dash D extensions equals,

20
00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:58.003
Quarkus smallrye,

21
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.006
OpenAPI,

22
00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:03.007
and this is going to use the plugin to add an extension.

23
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.002
So I definitely could've added it to the POM,

24
00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.001
but again I wanted to show you what you can do

25
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.004
with the actual plugin itself.

26
00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.007
So let's jump back into our IDE now.

27
00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.005
And because I did this outside,

28
00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:21.002
I'm going to let Maven run real quick,

29
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:25.002
to make sure it's downloaded everything internal.

30
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.001
And while that's going on

31
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.002
I'm going to go to source main resources,

32
00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.003
and open up the application on properties file.

33
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.001
And in here, I'm going to put in a property

34
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.008
of Quarkus.swagger UI enable,

35
00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.006
and I'm going to set that equal to true.

36
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:48.005
So now when I start up my application,

37
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:49.007
and while that's finishing up,

38
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm going to go to a web browser.

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.003
So in my web browser I'm going to go to local host

40
00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.003
8080/swagger UI.

41
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:00.001
And you'll see that again,

42
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.002
a pretty decent documentation page,

43
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.006
that shows you what I've done with the rooms.

44
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.007
It shows you any parameters, the response code.

45
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.007
Pretty basic, but at least it gets you something

46
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.006
without any work at all.

47
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.002
But let's make this page a little bit more robust.

48
00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.002
Let's go back to our IDE,

49
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.004
let's add a couple more properties.

50
00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:24.001
So MP, OpenAPI,

51
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:29.009
extensions, smallrye.info.title,

52
00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:33.000
and we are going to call this one

53
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.005
LinkedIn Learning API.

54
00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:40.002
And now once again, MP OpenAPI,

55
00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:44.007
extensions smallrye, info

56
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:50.004
and we're going to set our version equal to 1.0.0.

57
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:56.003
Version is very important when dealing with web servers.

58
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.005
Smallrye,

59
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.003
and we're going to do a description.

60
00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.009
And our description is going to be

61
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:11.007
learning Quarkus for LinkedIn Learning.

62
00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:13.000
And that's all we need to do.

63
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.003
I'm going to go ahead and restart the application.

64
00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:16.009
With live reload I shouldn't have to,

65
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.002
but sometimes the properties don't always pick up

66
00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:20.009
like I would like them to.

67
00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.006
So if I modify properties, I go ahead and restart it.

68
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.002
And now we'll jump back into our browser,

69
00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:28.007
and we'll do a refresh once again.

70
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.008
And you'll see that now we've populated

71
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:33.006
the top of our page with some more information

72
00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.003
about the LinkedIn Learning API that we've created.

73
00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:38.009
We've titled it, we've given it a version,

74
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.008
we've told you what version of OpenAPI spec we're using.

75
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:44.006
We've given it a description.

76
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.007
There's a lot more fields you can populate here.

77
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:50.002
License information, contact information for support.

78
00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:51.009
Again, it's a very long list.

79
00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.002
OpenAPI spec tells you a lot about it,

80
00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.009
and the Quarkus documentation does as well,

81
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.006
but that's really the gist of it.

82
00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:03.001
Now one of the cool things about this document here,

83
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.004
is I can come down here,

84
00:04:07.004 --> 00:04:09.001
and look at the schema.

85
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.009
I can look at the detail of the object itself,

86
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.000
and I can take a look at all the details,

87
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.001
like accept header, things like that.

88
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:22.000
Again, very easy documentation with very little work.
