1
00:00:02,034 --> 00:00:05,002
It's really important to have concrete demonstrations of what

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:06,467
you've learned after finishing a course.

3
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:09,860
You can use these to showcase your knowledge to current or future employers,

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,888
or just generally be proud with what you've built.

5
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,061
So let's take a look at some of the serverless framework projects

6
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,365
that you'll have built by the end of this course.

7
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:21,486
In our Up and Running module, we'll be building out an email reminder system.

8
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:24,552
The reminders will be triggered by scheduled events.

9
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:27,746
These events will activate our lambda handler function.

10
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:29,155
When the function is triggered by a Cron event,

11
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:32,425
it will create the email and send it at that specific time.

12
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:35,243
When the function is triggered by a rate event,

13
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,009
which runs in regular intervals, but at a specific time,

14
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,040
it will create and then send another email.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,051
To send emails, we'll be using AWS's simple email service,

16
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,059
which we'll cover in the module.

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,004
In the next module,

18
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,511
we'll be creating a website for The Woof Garden to

19
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,423
send and receive text notifications.

20
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:54,828
This will involve deploying a static website on AWS that includes a

21
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:57,345
submission form and a Google recaptcha validation.

22
00:00:57,345 --> 00:01:01,746
The website will submit form content through our serverless HTTP API,

23
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:04,837
and have that content processed by the handler function.

24
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,524
That function will first check the Google recaptcha API to

25
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:09,490
make sure that the recaptcha is valid.

26
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,632
If it isn't valid,

27
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:13,981
the function will return and serve us an error back to the website.

28
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,945
If it is valid,

29
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:17,726
it will process the remaining form content and use a stored

30
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:21,810
environment variable to make a call to the Twilio SMS API.

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,705
This will then send a text message to the cell number specified on the website.

32
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,323
In the module after that,

33
00:01:27,323 --> 00:01:30,251
we'll be creating our own serverless API to manage

34
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:32,235
CRUD operations for a PET database.

35
00:01:32,235 --> 00:01:34,124
There will be multiple lambda functions in order to

36
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:35,770
manage the creation of new entries,

37
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,652
reading specific entries and listing all entries out,

38
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:42,299
updating existing entries, and deleting old entries.

39
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,307
All of these operations will integrate with a DynamoDB service

40
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:48,771
resource to store and manage the data persistence.

41
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,618
So let's take a quick look at what we've done in this module.

42
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:53,254
We now know more about the serverless landscape,

43
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,483
and how the serverless framework fits within it.

44
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:58,593
We also know how infrastructure as a service infrastructures

45
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,833
interact and relate with the framework.

46
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:03,157
And we're hopefully excited to build our new projects

47
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,317
and skills throughout the course.

48
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,174
In the next module,

49
00:02:05,174 --> 00:02:08,369
we'll be getting set up with the serverless framework on our machines,

50
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,000
and we'll write and deploy our first serverless project. See you soon.
