00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:05,968
Now let's take a look at how we can install Node on Windows.

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,226
The easiest to do this is probably to Google for Node version 6.

3
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:11,631
10.

4
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,035
3.

5
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:13,623
On the Node page for this version,

6
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:16,997
there'll be a download link if you scroll down the page.

7
00:00:16,997 --> 00:00:21,373
Depending on your operating system, you might need a different installer,

8
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:24,524
but we'll be using the 64-bit Windows Installer.

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,731
After the download is complete,

10
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:29,130
open up the Installer and go through the installation steps.

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,981
When the installation is complete,

12
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:35,009
you should be able to open PowerShell or the Command Prompt and enter in

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,338
node -v to see the version of Node you've installed.

14
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,623
If you want to confirm that Node is working,

15
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,340
simply type in Node and hit Enter,

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,679
and enter in some JavaScript code that will be print

17
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,149
something to the console like this.

18
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,395
You can exit out of Node by pressing Ctrl+C twice,

19
00:00:49,395 --> 00:00:51,946
or following the instructions provided.

20
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:56,004
You can also check the version of npm that you've installed with Node.

21
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,611
If you've installed in npm successfully,

22
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:00,426
you should now be able to install the serverless framework.

23
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:03,142
You can do this with the npm install command.

24
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,273
Use npm install serverless -g.

25
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:09,026
This should install serverless globally,

26
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:11,518
then you can check the version of serverless that you

27
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:13,449
have installed with serverless -v.

28
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,393
You can also use the sls command,

29
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:19,469
which will substitute for any serverless commands that you enter in.

30
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,741
So in this case, you'd use sls -v.

31
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,573
Now let's move onto installing the AWS command-line on Windows.

32
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:29,330
There are a few ways to install this.

33
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,256
I'd suggest looking up the AWS documentation for

34
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:33,852
installing the command-line on Windows.

35
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:37,358
The easiest way to install the AWS command-line on Windows is

36
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,961
probably to use the provided MSI Installer.

37
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,209
However,

38
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,774
if you'd like to be able to update the command-line more easily more frequently,

39
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:46,746
then I'd suggest looking into how to install it with PIP,

40
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:49,206
as this will be able to install and upgrade the

41
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,966
command-line package more frequently.

42
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:53,710
After you've installed the AWS command-line,

43
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,060
you can check the version with aws --version.

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,801
Once you've confirmed that it's installed,

45
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,767
you should use the aws configure command and enter in the

46
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,787
credentials that you got from the earlier steps.

47
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:07,405
As always, if you need additional clarification on this,

48
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:15,000
you're welcome to look at the installation steps in my earlier course, An Introduction to AWS Lambda.
