00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:04.905
Probably the easiest way to get started with Node

2
00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:08.568
in npm on MAC OSX is to use nvm, the Node Version Manager.

3
00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:13.498
To do this, you can go to GitHub and look for creationix's nvm.

4
00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.528
You can see the URL here.

5
00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:20.805
You'll scroll down the instructions and see the command to install it.

6
00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.287
Run that command in the terminal,

7
00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:26.193
and then you should be able to use nvm to install Node.

8
00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.983
Run nvm install node to install the latest version of node.

9
00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:35.016
Then you can check the version that you have on your operating system.

10
00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:37.796
In this case, we want another version of Node,

11
00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:42.272
so we'll try using nvm use and entering in that version number.

12
00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:46.602
As you can see, if we haven't used nvm to install that version already,

13
00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:49.970
we're going to need to do that with the nvm install command.

14
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.560
You can do this now.

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.515
With the 6.

16
00:00:52.515 --> 00:00:52.833
10.

17
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.537
3 version of Node installed, and the corresponding version of npm,

18
00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.840
we can go ahead and install the serverless framework.

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.856
Let's do this now with npm install serverless -g.

20
00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:08.205
This will install the serverless framework globally.

21
00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:09.297
With the installation complete,

22
00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:13.971
you can check your version of the serverless framework using serverless -v.

23
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.741
You can also use the sls command for shorthand for

24
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.649
any other serverless commands.

25
00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.210
If for some reason nvm isn't an option for you,

26
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.971
you can also download versions of Node and npm from the nodejs.

27
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:28.905
org website.

28
00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:31.480
You can do this by going to the website,

29
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.936
clicking on the downloads page,

30
00:01:32.936 --> 00:01:36.662
and then proceeding to download and install Node on your operating system.

31
00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:40.014
You'll need to go through the provided installation guide after

32
00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:42.433
downloading and double-clicking on the file.

33
00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:47.502
You can use pip3 or pip install awscli with the upgrade and user

34
00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:50.512
flag in order to install the aws command-line.

35
00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:54.848
If this is your first time getting set up with the aws cli,

36
00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.774
you'll also need to run the aws configure command,

37
00:01:57.774 --> 00:02:01.120
and enter in credentials from the aws console.

38
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:10.000
You should have these credentials from the earlier step on creating an AWS account and getting your access keys.
