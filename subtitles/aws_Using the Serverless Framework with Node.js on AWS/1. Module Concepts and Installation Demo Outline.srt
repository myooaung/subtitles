00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,070
Hello, I'm Fernando Medina Corey, and welcome to module two,

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,176
Up and Running with the Serverless Framework on AWS.

3
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:11,973
In this module,

4
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:14,890
we'll cover some of the installation steps for the serverless framework,

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,014
some differences you might see between operating systems,

6
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:20,936
and how to get set up with an AWS account if you haven't already.

7
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:23,937
Then we'll look at the serverless framework's application model,

8
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:26,900
where we will learn about functions, events,

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,552
resources, and services, and how they work within the serverless framework.

10
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:33,940
After that, we'll review some serverless development basics,

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,027
including required configuration, how to deploy our code,

12
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,792
and how we can think about testing it in the future.

13
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,395
Toward the end of the module, we'll deploy our first project,

14
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:50,000
a scheduled email reminder using AWS SES and Cloud Watch. So let's get started.
