1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:03,290
Now let's get started on installing our dependencies on Ubuntu.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,768
The first thing you'll do is use Bash to run the Ubuntu install -bash script.

3
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:11,505
That should set you up with nvm, the Node Version Manager, on Ubuntu.

4
00:00:11,505 --> 00:00:13,280
Once you're done with the install script,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,517
you'll close that terminal and open a new one.

6
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:19,194
Now we can use nvm to install the version of Node that we want,

7
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:20,510
using nvm install 6.

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:20,840
10.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,169
3.

10
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:24,322
Then you can check the Node version with node -v.

11
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:27,268
You can also check the npm version with npm -v.

12
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,290
When you see the version shown here, go ahead and continue.

13
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,575
Now we can install the serverless framework with npm install

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,662
serverless -g to install the serverless framework globally.

15
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,777
When the process completes,

16
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,449
you can check the version of the serverless framework

17
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:42,613
that you have with serverless -v.

18
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:46,352
You can also use the sls command to substitute for the words serverless

19
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:48,697
and any of the commands you use with the framework.

20
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:50,606
Try it now with sls -v.

21
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,516
Now let's install the AWS CLI.

22
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:55,255
The easiest way to do this is to check first if you

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,396
have PIP installed on Ubuntu.

24
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:58,518
You can do this with pip --version.

25
00:00:58,518 --> 00:01:00,872
It should come with most installations of Ubuntu.

26
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:05,229
If you do have it, you can use pip install --upgrade --user awscli,

27
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:11,045
and this should install the most recent version of the AWS CLI for you.

28
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:11,974
After it's installed,

29
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:21,000
you should use aws configure to set up the AWS access keys and AWS secret keys that you got in the earlier part of this module.
