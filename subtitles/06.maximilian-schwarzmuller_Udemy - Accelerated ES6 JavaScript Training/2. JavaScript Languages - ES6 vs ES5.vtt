00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.640
One this is five that you're.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.580
Well if you're watching this course you probably do that.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.450
But just to give you a quick refresher.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.760
E s stands for ECMAScript.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.720
Which kind of is the language in the end though of course we say javascript all the time but few radically

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.750
.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.050
ECMAScript is the language and Charles script is more like a dialect which follows ECMAScript.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.990
But of course javascript is the most popular language using ECMAScript and therefore you can kind of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.310
think of your six just being the next javascript question but what are those five and six to begin with

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.880
.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.490
What is five is the word and of which currently runs in the browser and iOS 6 is the next generation

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.570
cell with new features and so on.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.340
Has five has just mentioned to support all browsers but for iOS 6 you will need some POLLI falls over

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.740
trends Pilar's which basically takes your iOS 6 code and rewrites it.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.480
He has five styled way which kind of sounds strange but it allows you to use six Futurists today and

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.620
kind of does what you have to do in the past to do the same and iOS 5.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.680
It does that for you and so you were able to run your six code today even though browsers don't fully

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.150
support it yet.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.260
This course of course will focus on iOS 6
