00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.900
Pay and the last lecture you saw the form and I'll use for this course.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.870
So I will use a spin a web page to show all the features and how it works and I explain why I do it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480
like this in a last video.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.810
However if you build your own applications and you want to use ESX you'll probably do that on your local

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.860
machine right.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
So you need to know how to set this app how to set up a development environment which allows you to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.150
use ESX on your local machine because remember browsers don't support all the ESX features right now

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.350
.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:45.120
So therefore you need a way to run it on your machine on Bless and code or work with iOS code in order

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.590
to do this you basically need three things.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:56.940
The first thing is a package or a tool which compiles your six code to use five.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.660
Now you might say How does that work.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.970
Well basically it finds some hacks some more difficult ways to achieve certain E-6 behaviourists with

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.190
iOS 5 code.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.660
And keep in mind that is only a temporary solution until iOS 6 is natively supported by all browsers

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.000
.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.760
That's the first thing a compiler.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.110
The second thing is a MUCH.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.420
YOU WILL SEE years later on in the modules module or a section of this course that you're working with

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.190
modules so you have a lot of javascript Faltu want to load it dynamically.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.640
You need a package to do that because this behavior also isn't supported natively by browsers yet.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.770
So you need the module or two.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.710
And lastly you need a little server serving your application because even though it is static since

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.700
you're working with modules those modules need to be served dynamically and therefore a little lightweight

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.260
server is needed for it.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.970
Well development to now you can't install all these things were multiple options for example as a compiler

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.710
you might use Babel as a March loader you might even use WEP pack kind of or system chiasmus a pure

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.240
loader and for servers there are tons of options attached to this which you will find a document leading

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.290
to some example set ups or boiler plates on get have which you could simply clone to get started and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.350
where you can dive into to learn more about how they are set up and which compiler and so on they use

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.580
.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.920
For example here I have this Vanel that is 6 chairs PM package you open which always uses Cheras PM

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.000
Chalis package manager to load all those packages needed to work with the ESX and you could simply follow

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.060
the instructions on this page to set up a local ESX development environment quickly.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.040
Of course you will find a length of that repository in the video or in the document attached to this

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.750
video.
