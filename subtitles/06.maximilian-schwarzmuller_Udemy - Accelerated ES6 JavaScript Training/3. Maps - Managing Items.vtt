00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.320
Well first let's analyze our set.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.810
So I'll start by printing out the whole map here excuse me the whole deck here.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.250
So what do you think we'll see if Heidrun well.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.880
See it's kind of an object but notice that it's not like a real object a javascript object where it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.130
would see the key value Paris when logging into the console so you'll immediately see it's kind of a

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.140
different object here.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.560
What I can do is to log the size of the stack.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.110
Now what do you think we'll see here.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.930
Of course we get to because we store two key value pairs here.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.140
And if I just said and number one show I said is a Esky again.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:57.000
And then I run the stack size console lock here again remember that I said that I would override the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.340
existing keep all the pair.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.670
So we should still see a size of schewe.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.040
Let's see if that holds true.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.020
Yes.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.470
So the size is still too we're not adding and you could be a key value pair your were overwriting the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.060
old one and therefore the overall size here doesn't change.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.310
OK so that's the size and that's how we can override or set of values.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.300
But it would be nice to extract them too.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.930
Right.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.480
So how can we do that.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.930
It's really simple.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.200
I used to get my thought and then I passed the cue for which I want to retrieve the value.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.760
So I asked for example and if I now which run well of course we get the ace of spades object a created

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.520
here.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.600
So that's how you work with maps.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:47.280
You set the values with the set method and you get vollies with the get method and unsurprisingly you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.960
also got another method.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.370
The deck delete method.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.490
And if I pass A's here what do you think we'll now see in the console.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.800
What we see undefined because I'm removing the key value pair and that's of course important with delete

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.180
key name.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.890
I'm removing the whole pair of course not just a key or something like that because the two belong together

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.260
key and value.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.650
So with the bleed I can clear certain items or if I want to cleared the whole map I can use the clear

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.420
method.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.470
While that would get rid of all the key value pairs in the deck.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.180
And therefore if I run now I still see and you find because I deleted all the key value pairs
