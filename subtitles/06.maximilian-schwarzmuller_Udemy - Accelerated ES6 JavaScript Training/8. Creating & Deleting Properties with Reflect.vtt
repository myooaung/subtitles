00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.530
Now what if you want to add a property since you got all those methods for getting or setting existing

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.060
properties reflect probably also has some ways to define new properties.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.700
Right.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.250
Yes of course it does.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.720
And basically it works the same way as object defined property works which you probably might already

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.120
know it was there and he is 5 and it's a static method on the object object which allows us to define

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.360
new properties and give them some configuration like for example making them read only if you're not

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.010
aware of what I'm talking off.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:46.290
You might check arge chess and non-chess object fine property and you'll find an article in the end

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.690
the end and as I said this this is five that's not E6.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.020
And here you will learn how this works.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.960
Basically it allows you to add a new property and configured a property as I explained for example to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.540
make it read only.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.280
Well let's say I wanted to add a new property to my instantiated person object your.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:13.560
Well then I could call reflect divine property as my object so person in this case passed the name of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.820
the property I want to create.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.510
Let's say it's hobbies and then the first argument is a Chalis the object in which I configured this

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.770
new property.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.660
Now there are a couple of available keys I can set here and just check out the article I showed you

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.170
before.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.370
For more information on those keys but I'll give you some examples here too.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
For example by default this property will be read only.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.040
Which means you can't change it.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.160
We did find this here once but there are three you won't be able to change it in order to change this

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.220
.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.750
You can make it writable and said this to true.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.910
You also can provide de-value field which is especially you board and if you don't make it right to

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.460
Bill because you set the value of this property the default value.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.560
Now for example here I could set this to an array of my hobbies like sports or king.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.780
You also could set the configurable the this would allow you to specify if one should be able to change

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.370
this configuration here after the property has been created and that defaults to false.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.240
So if those keys here I'm creating this new property and therefore I can simply print that out and I'll

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.790
use dot notation.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.610
But this president or hobbies.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.330
What do you think we'll see if and how he'd run

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.820
sports and cooking because no I created this new property and I initialize these values.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.690
And as I said it's ridable.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.680
So I can also access hobbies instead of equal to just nothing because I'm a very hobby less man.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.920
So if you know have run what we see nothing because I was able to overwrite it.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.970
If I remove ridable here though.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.950
Well what do you think will now help.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.870
My guess you know the answer while we still see sports and cooking so we still see the default values

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.400
so that call didn't throw an error but it didn't do anything to it.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.720
So it's just there but doesn't change anything because it's not rideable.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.830
But as I explained the configuration you can pass here didn't change it's the same as an East fifes

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.900
.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.980
Definitely check out the article I showed earlier.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.700
Now sometimes you also want to delete a property and not just define one.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.410
You were already able to do this with the delete key word here but let's say if I wanted to the leads

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.730
to age of the person and then I try to access it for print this I would see undefined because I deleted

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.670
the age property.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.990
Now if I remove this we see twenty seven again.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.290
Now the bad thing about the delete key word is of course.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.260
Well it's a keyword.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.140
We define a property with in the past object defined property or reflect defined property now.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.590
But if we delete it with a keyword that's very inconsistent.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.270
And therefore it's no wonder that we also got the refl. API Meffert eat property and it's really straightforward

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.030
to define which is sort of which object person.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.900
And in the name of the property like H.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.840
But for now it's run well we all know what we expect right.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.410
We get undefined because age was deleted but now we have this clean method call on the reflect the API

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.370
and not the key words you have to remember.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.430
And that really is what this refl. API is all around all about getting stuff together and not having

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.880
it scattered around scattered out for the script language environment.
