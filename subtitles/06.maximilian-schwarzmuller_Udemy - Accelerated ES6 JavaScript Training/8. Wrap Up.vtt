00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.160
So that lost a lot about proxies and the refl. API.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.870
But I hope you saw how both work together and how both allow you to inspect your own code during runtime

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.390
and change the behavior of your code during runtime because of course a lot of the things you learn

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.670
here are more easily done with direct dot notation to X properties for example.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.460
But that assumes that you know all the objects and property names at the time you write code that might

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.220
not always be the case in more complex programs.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.670
And here are d reflect and proxy AAPI are great tools to help you with that and to write more dynamic

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.200
code and react to changes in your application state with that which you create.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.780
So you know videos by
