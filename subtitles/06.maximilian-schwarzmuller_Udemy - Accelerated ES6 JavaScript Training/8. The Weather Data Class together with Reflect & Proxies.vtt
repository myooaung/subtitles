WEBVTT

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.630
Time to handle the data we actually get back.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.690
Of course it could just retrieve the temperature and so on and printed to the screen and yet everything

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.850
would be fine.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.280
But we learned about those classes and proxies self-reflect and so on.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:24.150
Some probably want to use that to and as Project here as it really fits in nicely.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.330
So you learn to trade and you fall and naming it wherever data.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:43.320
Chaz let's say and this fall I want to create a class all name and whether they that it does class should

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.980
have a constructor and it will store the data fetch from the server.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.660
So I want to have a city name field here which should be city name being passed to the constructor so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.760
lets add city name.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.870
I'll also need the description so I'll add this right away.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:16.920
So this description should be the description I pass here and then the temperature and I will set this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.410
to an empty string for now and you'll soon see why.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.450
So I don't read the properties my web or data class should have and I want to export this class of course

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.780
to make it available outside of here.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.360
Now what I plan to do is the this class should be instantiated So I want to create an object using this

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:46.260
class as a blueprint and then I want to wrap the object like I did with a proxy.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:55.200
This proxy should then have a get and set method which will allow me each new trends for each temperature

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.540
I assign Tudor's class into Fahrenheit.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.770
That's the automatic conversion I was talking of earlier.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.410
Now I will export this proxy handler in this Faltu Well of course you could create a separate fault

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.640
for this too.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:20.520
So I'm just going to name it whether proxy could type a proxy handler.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.380
And this won't be a script Optik of course because the proxy handler is a javascript object.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.340
I will demonstrate how to treat a function get function here a get trap which will take a target and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.510
the property as input.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.700
And then I will just return and reflect got Target properties of course that wouldn't be necessary just

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.660
once to remind you of how to use this refl. API conjunction with proxies.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.370
With the trap you are to get trap but of course very important will be set trap here where I will get

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:10.530
a target property and Avali when these are just the default arguments set up expects to get check out

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.960
the new proxy API I'm not sure.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.990
For more details on that.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.810
And then here I will calculate a new value actually based on the old value of course which you would

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.740
want to multiply with 1 8 and then add 32.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.480
This turns out to be the conversion formula or to convert Celsius or degrees Celsius to 4 at night.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.510
So I'm converting this here that I'm using the two the method to prevent any floating point errors and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.530
also to fixed this to two decimal places and then all at D.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.030
Well the unit at the end Fahrenheit here.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:59.150
Then I want to return refl. set of course no target property and here not value.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.500
But of course my new value which I want to set and with that I treat the handler for the trap.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:13.050
Usually for the proxy which I will later on create and also as I'm already doing it this should be exported
