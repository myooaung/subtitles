WEBVTT

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.350
I want to start by hooking up this show where we're putting some kind of went listeners so that we can

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.740
actually trigger something if we click the button for this I need to fetch my button from the well dorm

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.680
through so that I can interact with that.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.790
No I could do all that in my app chest file but that too would not really be that modular so it would

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.160
create a new file which I will name elements dot chess.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.660
No.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.410
Or you have to delete that aliments one to be precise here of course name it whatever you like.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.030
And here I went to fetch my elements two elements with which I will work for this module and I want

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.330
to export those.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.540
I will store them in constants using the Conte's keyword and export them to be able to use in other

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.370
files.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:00.340
Now which elements HCM elements do I want to fetch and well make available to my application.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's look at the next time I'll fall.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.370
I certainly need this search button here because I want to be able to handle the click event.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.180
Now here I can't just use a very select virtual select selected with the button tags since this is the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.090
only button I got on my page here I also of course need to fetch my input field here.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.910
And I also could use decrease electret fetch the only input on this page would work but all use Corrie's

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.640
lecturer to fetch it by ID.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.720
I also need to loading text to conditionally height or show ID and the same is true for this weather

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.880
day of year.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.350
So for this whole block with Lebert information and then I also need the city name dweller description

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.600
and the weather temperature because I need to set the text of all those elements.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.970
So I'll start by fetching the button and the input field here in the elements chust file.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.050
Therefore I use the export keyword to make it available outside of default.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.300
You just going to Sumant a little bit more so that hopefully everything is clearly readable and then

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.300
icons key word and then I'll get an uppercase name Chester to follow this convention of naming Constans

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.700
uppercase Elliman Serge

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240
.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.260
And as I said I'll use the query selector queries selector

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.050
unselected by Putnam Of course I'll just make this a little bit smaller here so that we can see the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.400
code better.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:49.140
And I'll also export my Alamo and search city.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:57.750
So this input field also with the queries selector and here as I said I'll use these city ID which does

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.470
out element has as you can see here to select it.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.380
Also you could of course use the input field as mentioned before.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.370
So that Erde each You kind of use or input related elements I want to get next.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.010
Also export de Allaman loading text to this loading text element that I want to conditionally hide or

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.980
show.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.730
And here also use a query selector and I'll use the load ID which does aliment has if you solve that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.240
it has to load the vector box and fetch next we'll have to wait.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.840
I have never ending the virtual items of which I need to set the tax that which I will therefore also

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.220
need also have ideaspace which will fetch them.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.870
So I'm just going to copy the loading text element here.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.790
The next one will be my let's say weather

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:06.900
box you're all selected by the weather ID and then I have my weather or city name here which can be

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.920
found in the ID.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.410
But now that I think of it I could also use number way.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:24.630
I could also just use my palm and Babbar box and then the first element child because in my web reports

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.040
this part here.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.490
Well actually the first element child is exactly the city name which I'm retrieving right now.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.360
So no need to use to Chris Lechter even though you could of course do that.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.770
Instead I'll use the first element child.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.770
And of course therefore I can also fetch the temperature with the last element child Meffert right.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.510
Cause a property because it is to last at about a child in the overall Benvar box here.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.110
So therefore for Dad I'm also using my work box just copying.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
It's written correctly.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.930
And then of course the last element shop though I also need the Weber description here and I'll go fetch

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.970
it with a query selector again.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.820
Of course there are tons of our ways to get there.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.220
Q But you choose whatever you like.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.830
Oh well you should also be Weber preacher.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:26.840
And here I'll have blubber corruption and I will again use my query selector fetch it with the beverage

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.940
description ID which is either of course has.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.940
As you can see here.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.740
So I hope I don't have any typos here that I'm fetching all the elements I will need for up by application

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.210
.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.920
So that's of course the very first important step.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.490
And with that let's continue in the next lecture.
