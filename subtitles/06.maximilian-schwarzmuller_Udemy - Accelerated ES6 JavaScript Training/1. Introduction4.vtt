00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.120
So after having the look at symbol's walk onto the next model is course it's about iterators and generators

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.470
.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.490
So what are iterators and generators.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.870
A nice question the beginning of each module isn't it.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.080
Raiders are basically all objects that know how a tree access values in a collection of one at a time

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.470
.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.050
So for example an array is such an iterator.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.390
It's incredible.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.290
That means you can loop through it and has a collection of objects and it knows how to output them one

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.820
after another.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.040
Now you can also create your own objects with your own iterator logic which doesn't necessarily mean

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.070
that you only have a race where to use or interesting numbers or whatever he wants to output one after

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.630
number you might have an object where you have a completely different logic for that which you value

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.600
should be returned in let's say a form of loop or whenever you use it with the iterator syntax which

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.690
I will show you.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.130
So that is an iterator an object through which you can loop kind of a generator is closely related to

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.760
that.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.330
A generator is a function which doesn't necessarily run to the end when we execute it.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.910
Now that certainly sounds strange.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.170
Specifically a generator is a function which yields certain values.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.760
Each time you call it it yields the next value and you may your 5 10 and unlimited or only one value

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.940
.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.260
And that of course closely resembles the behavior of iterators where you also yield or get one value

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.770
after yabber a generator is a function which yields different values and especially powerful combinations

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.350
of course if you use generators and iterators together and you will see all of that throughout the course

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.670
of this module.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.600
So let's dive in
