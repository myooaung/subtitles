00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.000
Soffer symbols iterators and generators in this module I'm coming back to something you might already

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.720
know.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.740
Promises now promises have been all over the place with Chello script in the last couple of years.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.250
So you might almost think they already were built in but they actually weren't.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.190
There was no native promis support in Chalo script is fine.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.380
And you were oftentimes simply using POLLI falls or other libraries like Cheikh where your q famous

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.290
promise library to work with them but what are promises in the first place.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.030
They are a useful object a helper to work with asynchronous tasks like they are.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.150
Name well implies they give us a promise that they will give us back some data sometimes in the future

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.210
.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.550
The data isn't there yet.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.180
That's the nature of asynchronous tasks right.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.250
And we know we will get back data so we can continue with our code and we specify a function on our

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
promise to do something with the data whenever we get it back.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.120
And one reason why promises were so popular or are so popular is that it was to escape call hell which

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.300
basically means that the other way to handle asynchronous tasks is to nest thousands of coal bags within

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.170
each other.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.240
But with prominences you simply specify what you want to do if something comes back and then you continue

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.870
anyways and you can also change promises very conveniently without having to nest everything 1000 levels

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.060
deep.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.330
So thats a theory.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.350
Lets have a look at them.
