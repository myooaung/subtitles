That we finished this first module on the syntax changes and additions decor syntax changes and additions

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.150
.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.440
IOS 6 brings where to look at Latin concepts.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.380
We had a look at the new function defat functions and default arguments.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.430
We had to look at the additions to the literal notation of objects where we could use strings as names

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.030
for our object methods for example we also had a look at rest and spread and at template literals.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.120
So multiline strings with values very good values being output right inside of them if you want to put

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670
it like this.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.180
And we also had a look at destructuring all of that a very important dish which make Chappell's grip

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.000
more powerful and give you more flexibility.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.530
And I really hope that floats Marchal I was able to show you how all of that works and how you use it

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.280
what the limitations are and why it might be useful.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.720
With that it's time to continue to the next module which will actually itself be about modules Xolair
