00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.230
And this in the next lectures I'll use Plunker instead of chair spin because I need to work with multiple

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.330
files and chairs and doesn't offer that functionality.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.240
So head over to blanker dot C-L dad's P.L. and K.R. dot SEO and then click on launched yesterday you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.570
well create new editor you should end up with something like this.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.600
And this is just fine.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.200
You can write your Create your follow through on the left edit them here in the middle and the under

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.560
right.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.210
If you click on the eye here you'll have a preview of your aged him or Page or if you know I don't want

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.720
to leave.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.590
Thank you.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.250
Or if you click on this green refresh button your it will manually trigger a refresh of the preview

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.670
.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.630
However since we work with the console a lot we don't really need that page here.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.760
So what I will do is all open up my developer tools here in Chrome which also has a Charvis cons. of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.600
course you're not cleared for now.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.480
So you're on the right bottom.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.790
You'll see what actually happens with our code.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.380
So to get started we have this script that chiasmus just the one being run by Plunker here.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.440
So this is our starting point.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.670
But since we're working with modules I'll add number fall because that's the new thing.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.850
ESX has Marchal support built in and you probably used Martial's before in your bigger projects but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.730
you always needed some help to do so right.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.750
With ESX you got machos as a set built into the language.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.540
Now since ESX of course doesn't run natively in browsers yet I still need some help to actually work

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.870
with those modules so I need to import some.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.390
Well the additions here or some other scripts in my index that aged him of five precisely I will need

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:04.290
Tresor that as a tool by Google which basically compiles E6 code to erase 5 code so that the browser

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.350
is able to run it but will still be writing 6 code.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.790
And so in the future you'll hopefully be able to write that without needing a compiler to creating ear's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.510
five could offer it.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.000
And in order to use it we basically need to get a link to imported from a CDN.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.600
Now we can do this easily in plunker.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.570
Boy I am just making this a little bit wider.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.610
For now finding an external library disk book I can.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.860
And then if I type tracery here search for it to see it here.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.930
And if you click this magic wand here age get added to your project like this.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.350
So this hopefully will work and I'll also need System cheapass which is a module loader because they

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.950
serve will basically just compile iOS 6 is 5.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.880
And then we will have all those ears 5 modules you might know from your bigger scale projects.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.620
So basically they are we will have modules which to browsers still won't be able to interpret because

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.550
about the browser just can't do that right now.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.460
So in order to also simulate this all together since last.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.580
And I'll also add this with the magic wand.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.530
So with that I'll go back to the preview.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.770
Now if you when you're having problems with the package just edits here like I seem to have.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.820
You can also replace this manually.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.740
Can leave the bench tray searches part here but you can replace the first one with a link to Google's

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.730
get hub account IO then its tracer piler and then bin tracer.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.480
And with that you should be able to get it and actually use its in effect clear my console load this

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.690
page.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.910
I it looks good.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.050
Don't get any 404 errors anymore.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.270
So that's important and you have this compiler tracer and system checks to load your modules.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.900
And after they have been compiled after your code has been compiled.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.250
So there are preparations for that.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.790
Let's dive right into writing some modular code so that we're almost there by now or we'll get rid of

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.470
his script import we don't need that because we're using System chest for dead.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.900
That is what we have a much lower fourth.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:29.700
And therefore instead in my body here I will add script tacks to just type script and then hit tap and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.420
hirable use system checks and then the import method to point to the script for where it should start

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.620
importing everything.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.270
This will be the script Dutchesse file.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.260
Now what do you mean with start importing everything.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.500
This will be the file system checks will load for us.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.560
The Scripter chips fall and then look which modules this fall requires to also load those.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.170
That is what the march loader here does and that is what the browser in the future will do natively

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.250
.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.920
So if that all cleared the console and we're get to go
