00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.210
Of course the problem we have right now is we're not fetching the user input or anything like that.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.440
So let's do this next.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
All stored in a constant name city name.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
And I'm just using concept old constants all over the place because I'm actually never changing those

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.660
values so therefore it certainly is a good practice to use a constant in the first place.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.710
So the city name should be whatever the user entered into this input field in order to get this I can

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:41.190
use my elements and then access them or access the user input from this aliments searched said the constant

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.640
here which queries or which selects my input field.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.460
So here it's whoops.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520
You'll let me type here.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.000
Thank you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.680
Element

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.480
search city should be is.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.580
And then the value property the property value to get whatever the user enters here and can actually

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.020
see this by outputting data an hour earlier.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.180
So if I enter a London year and click show whether Well I see London in my effort.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.400
So that works perfect.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.520
Of course if I enter let's say with something really long look of whitespace is here and then London

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.790
I also see those white spaces and I don't want to have that I don't want to search for whitespace as

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.630
later on.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.670
I just want to have the city name without any leading whitespace or whitespace at the end of the word

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.170
.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.280
Therefore what I will do is I will write a way trim it by just changing the trim method here.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.290
So now if I hit enter a lot of whitespace is it an entry and then again you see the egg white spaces

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.200
are gone and I just get the name.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.120
I also want to check if the user does enter something because if the user doesn't enter something into

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.390
this field while I don't don't want to reach out to my web servers and try to get a city which wasn't

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090
entered in the first place right.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.350
So therefore I will check it said the name dot length because it's a string and can therefore be treated

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.040
like an array.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.180
In this respect I will check if the length is equal to zero.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:30.190
And if this is the case I will return another word or I'd just say Please enter it a city name.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.920
Now if I add to this we get police enter a city name but if I enter London I get London.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.750
So the second alert.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.050
So this check works great.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.280
If that were fetching the user input and we're able to use it that or application
