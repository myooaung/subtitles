WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.240
With the elements being fetched here in order to use them in my app just fall I need to import them

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.250
therefore or import them from my elements class file.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:25.050
Now I could import them by using parentheses or as the curly braces here and that I could import Allaman

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.890
to web or box and so on.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
And I think you're where you'll where this is leading writers would be annoying.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.870
So instead of me using the syntax very import everything as elements let's say

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.280
from in a yes and I'm done.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.420
Now I'm getting a new object elements which will hold Boob's all those elements here.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.770
So it will kind of group all those elements together in one single object that can access them as properties

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.210
in this object.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.230
Have a look at the much old section where I also explain this.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.170
If this is unclear to you so that I have access to all my elements and therefore I can use my elements

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:20.370
object here to then access my allemande Terje then sell the button on which the user can click here

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:30.300
but then add an event listener to this like so of course I want to listen to a click event and I want

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.750
to do something well once the user clicks on it.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.300
I want to execute a function which is a whole search whatever.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.850
Now I could also create a new module for does search function.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.320
And then what be fine.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:53.550
But for now I'm going to place it in this search or it does app chest fall but you of course are free

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.070
to change and this might be a good exercise to modularize.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.040
this code even more.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.520
I'm going to find the right balance here between while showing code in one file and using the modular

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.890
approach which of course is great to use especially in real applications.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:17.010
And so here I'll create my search Weber function which should get executed once the user clicks the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.890
button to see if this works.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.710
Let's just open an alert will we say click and then once is reloaded if you click on show whenever.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.180
Well we see that doesn't work.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.260
So something went wrong.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.500
Let's see what it is.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.470
Well unfortunately that's problem really annoying.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.300
I hate to see the muchall section these imports here.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.540
The Tresor imports here don't work.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.790
So that's too bad.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.130
It has to be replaced with import from Google duds.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.770
Get her that IO slash Tresor compiler slash been slashed research chess.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:02.400
So the length you're seeing right here if you use this import and of course the still use to system

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.630
chess import that this all right doesn't have to be replaced in my case here.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.810
Also there is a mistake.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.520
The chips fall in a chair.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.140
Of course it needs to be elements Chaz.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.820
So that was just a little mistake on my site with that additional work.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.950
I'm really sorry about that.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.390
Especially this important thing is really annoying.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.640
I had it work sometimes sometimes it doesn't.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.860
If you were getting error makes errors make sure to use this import here.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.410
If we're getting arrows with System js to Google for a system check acedia and grab a link from there

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.880
to get a better acedia.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.260
But it should work.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.020
The first one was the annoying one though.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.230
So if that digital work elements chest here of course instead of in a chest.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.360
And now if you click this button we see the clicked alert.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.470
With that we hopefully should get to go and we get our working eventless snow here.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.610
So that's great.
