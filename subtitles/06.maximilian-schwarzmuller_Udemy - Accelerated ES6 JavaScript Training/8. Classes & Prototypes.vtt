00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.310
Now an interesting question is what is the prototype off this person we created here.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.430
Well let's have a look.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.120
I will use the Dunder produ property with Andrusco underscore produ underscore underscore to immediately

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.580
see this.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.100
If and now it run well we see it some kind of object so it doesn't seem to be person.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.120
So let's check if the prototype is equal to object dot prototype.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.620
Let's see what happens if I had run we get false said.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.960
This doesn't seem to be the case.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.030
Is it just the object.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.140
No it's all false.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.640
Is it person dot prototype

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.850
that looks better.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.530
And with three equal signs still.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:04.440
So the prototype off our person is present a prototype and if you think about the constructor functions

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.330
we already had an is 5.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.570
That's exactly the same behavior.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.960
If we then had a constructor function named person then the person object we create using this constructor

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.580
function would have person a prototype as its prototype.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.720
So that's exactly the same behavior.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.290
The class Cuber just gives us more flexibility when it comes to setting up this class and not having

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.320
everything inside of this constructor function here.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.410
It also gives us some other nice features to which I'll come next
