00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.970
Strings also got some new interesting methods which I want to show you.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.310
And again here I'm only presenting some of those new additions and you may look up the other ones on

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.190
the and Mozilla developer network.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.710
So if I create a string let's name it name and it's my first name.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.820
And of course pick yours.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.840
You don't all have to use mine.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.270
Of course you are free to.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
And then I will log something and what I will log is my name.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:39.270
And then one of the new methods starts with efforts now starts with I'll pass Max.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.780
And what do you think I'll get if I had run I get true and you probably figured that out starts with

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290
basically checks as the name implies.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.730
If distrain starts with whatever I pass here.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.280
So if I pass Max with 2 x I'd ever get false because yes it starts with Max but not with Max x.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.970
So no extra X here.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.860
That's what starts with us.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.690
And of course we are not only have starts with We also have ends with.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.540
So here if we just enter a and then my name of course does and with a N and I run.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.670
Surprisingly I get true.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.670
So that's ands with and starts with.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.150
Interesting question of course this is this case sensitive.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.560
So if I now enter a n uppercase you're thinking like a true or false I get false.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.880
So it actually is case sensitive.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.120
It does care if you well used to write cases.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.630
Therefore if I enter Max all lowercase and check if it starts with that I also get falles of course

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.050
.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.500
And we had starts with an answer with some can't check at the word begins with something where it ends

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.160
with something.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.670
Can we also have a look if it includes something in between.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.360
Yes we have the include Smethurst as well.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.300
Now let's first check if this includes max which of course is the same as we checked with starts with

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.810
.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.850
Do you think we'll get true because it includes checks everything.

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.710
Or do you think we'll get false because includes all checks everything except the first last character

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.920
.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.150
True because checks everything.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.890
So therefore I can also check if I have I am I.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.950
This part here and I'm confident I do have this in this name.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.950
So let's see if if if Java script sees it the same way.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.830
Yes you get true.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.780
Of course this is case sensitive too.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:45.750
So if I know increases or make this an uppercase am and I run this again I get false starts with ands

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.730
with and includes And yes you could do that before Riffe regular expressions of course and probably

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.970
you would still do it this way if you knew how to write regular expressions.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.920
But these are nice handy little methods which quickly allow you to well basically do just that check

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.200
if something is included in a word or if it starts or ends with something
