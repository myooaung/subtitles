00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
So that was destructuring on both arrays as well as objects.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.840
A really powerful tool to quickly Well the structure of a certain object or erate to get certain values

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.450
.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.770
Keep in mind that a you're not changing the original objects or race or race and B that basically you

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:31.560
can do the same for arrays and objects but there is this important difference that for object destructuring

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.640
you pull out elements by either property name for every destructuring you pull them out by position

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.810
.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.270
That is really key to understand and to take away here.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.270
And with that you're of course free to play around with that and see what else you can do with structuring

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.070
and use that syntax to be useful for you which a lot of fun with that and I'll see you in the next module
