00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.280
Well we covered a lot for this course I hope you were able to pick up on all the new features.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.110
ESX introduce us and learn how they work and why it might be useful to use.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.540
You also saw how to use iOS 6 today.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.440
Check out the respective lecture in the first module if you still have questions about that.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.920
With Dad you should really be able to start diving deeper into iOS 6 and playing around with all the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.520
new features try out where outway want to use them try out where it might be helpful and simply pick

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.380
some example applications you want to build.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.140
Pick some old applications you already built with E.S. 5 and convert them to iOS 6.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.790
That would be all great steps in order to use iOS 6 and get better with it.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.370
Now regarding next steps iOS 6 will be supported by more and more browsers during the next weeks months

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.390
and years.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.380
It is the future of Chalis script in the end and you should now be well prepared to use that future

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.730
and ever use it today.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.070
By using compilers and so on.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.750
Or wait a couple of months and then use it natively in all browsers.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.880
I hope you enjoyed the course and I'm happy to see you in any other Course Lectures or whatever wherever

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.610
you meet.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.630

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.150
