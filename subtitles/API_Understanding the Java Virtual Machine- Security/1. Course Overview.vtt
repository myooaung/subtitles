Hi,

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.170
everyone. My name is Kevin Jones, and welcome to my course,

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.650
Understanding the Java virtual Machine: Security.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.250
I am a developer and owner at Rock Solid Knowledge,

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.970
a software development company based in the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.680
One of the original selling points of Java was its code

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.870
security model and how it allows you to load code from

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.330
anywhere but limit what that code could do.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.410
You can base the security on the location the code was loaded from

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.010
or on who created the JAR that you are loading.

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.930
Some of the major topics we'll cover in this course include

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.280
understanding how the Java SecurityManager and AccessController

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.020
work together to secure your code,

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.380
examining how and why the stack is walked when security decisions are

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.710
made, see the classes involved in code security, and learning how to

16
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.610
limit the stack walk if necessary to always allow certain code to

17
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.310
run. By the end of this course,

18
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.790
you'll understand how Java can limit your code's privileges based

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.640
on security information. Before beginning the course, you should

20
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.410
be familiar with the Java language.

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.310
I hope you'll join me on this journey to understand code

22
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:26.000
security with the Understanding the Java Virtual Machine Security course, at Pluralsight.
