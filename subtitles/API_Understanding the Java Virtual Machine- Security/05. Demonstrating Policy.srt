1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,940
So this is the demo we saw in the previous module.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,950
And here we're grabbing the version and then we're trying to

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,540
write to some random file in the temp folder.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,350
So what I'd like to do is make use of the property

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,400
expansion in the policy file and use those properties to

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,940
apply permissions to this project.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,730
So instead of getting the version, let's get the home value first of all.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,610
So we'll change this to home,

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:32,570
we'll change this to user.home. And then when we write the file

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,800
we'll write this rather crudely to home +,

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,860
and then simply say, out.text.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,840
And again, we're going to write Hello, World into the file.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,840
So let me build this.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,890
If I go to the command window, so again we have a security.manager present,

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,330
and try and run this, the first thing to note is that by default

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,840
we're not allowed access to the property user.home.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,740
So the first thing we have to do is to set that permission.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,080
So in our policy file, we can now add this permission.

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,840
So I go into here, I'll copy the version permission here.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,610
So here we want to say, user.home.

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,220
I save the policy file, go back to the command prompt, and from here,

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,040
run the code again. Okay, so now we have permission to read the

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
user.home property notice we print out my home folder,

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,300
which is users.kevin in this case, but I don't have

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,780
permission to write into that folder.

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,300
And this goes back to where we were yesterday,

27
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,340
but now we can use the property expansion in the file.

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,000
So we're again grabbing this error and going back into the policy file.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,980
So here I can say permission, and I'll copy in this, the

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,580
error we saw, make sure put the comma here,

31
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,860
the semicolon at the end, and remove the quotes that we don't need here. At the

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,810
moment here, I'm certainly going to hardcode my location.

33
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,110
I need to remember to change this to forward slashes.

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,300
And then again, I'll save the policy file,

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,880
go back to the command prompt and here run the code again.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,820
And now it works.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,790
But I've hardcoded me, my user, my user.home folder.

38
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,200
So back in the policy file,

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,330
we can use property expansion. So rather than saying

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:38,450
C:/Users/kevin here, I can say $(user.home), and then

41
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,220
rather than the forward slash here,

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:48,600
I can say $(/). And again, if I save this and go back to the

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,630
command prompt and run the code, again the code works. We're

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,140
now writing into my home folder.

45
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,440
If we think of this as the equivalent of a unit test,

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,110
the unit test has gone green before I've seen it go red.

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,740
So I'd like to see this unit test fail before I let the code out.

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,940
So I'm going to make another edit to the policy file.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm going to take out that property expansion,

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,340
save the file, go back to the command prompt,

51
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
run the code again, and it should fail.

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,870
And indeed it does.

53
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,530
So it is reading that property file.

54
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,780
It is expanding things correctly.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,740
So I go and put that back in.

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,240
Again, save it, and then run the test again.

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,920
Again its working, so we are are writing into that folder.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,370
So the next module, we'll see that rather editing the

59
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,600
default policy file, there are ways to augment or indeed

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,800
replace that default policy file,

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,730
which makes sense, as we don't want to edit the global policy

62
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:52,000
file. We'd sort of rather carry the policy file along with us that's required for this application.
