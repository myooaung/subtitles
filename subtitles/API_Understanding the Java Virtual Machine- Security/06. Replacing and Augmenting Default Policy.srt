1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,840
So the Java policy file is the default policy file that applies to

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,830
all Java applications running in this environment.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,970
So if we go and edit that, that edit applies to every

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,070
application that will be run under a security manager in this

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,540
environment. We prefer not to do that.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,060
So Java provides us away such that we can either override

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,790
completely the default policy file or we can augment it.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,340
And the way we do this is by adding a custom policy file from the command line.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,760
As we said,

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,930
we can augment the standard settings, or we can replace the standard settings.

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,040
And the way we do that is by saying,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,070
â€‘Djava.security.policy either equals some policy file name or

13
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,840
double equals some policy file name, so a subtle difference.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,340
Equals means augment the current policy file, the default policy

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,690
file, and just add these changes.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:08,000
Double equals means overriding completely the default policy file, so just use my policy file as a replacement. So let's see how we do that.
