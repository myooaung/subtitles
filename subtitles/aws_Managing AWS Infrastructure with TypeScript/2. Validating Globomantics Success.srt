1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,040
So what about Globomantics?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,340
Did Ellen take the right course for her organization?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,740
Would you have done anything differently than Ellen?

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,420
As it stands,

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,080
Globomantics has now successfully fully integrated TechStream into its

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,690
organization as Ellen intended. They now build applications that run on

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,100
mainstream reusable CDK‑driven environments,

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,240
and now their development cycles are faster than ever.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,620
As a result of the well‑organized principles in use by the CDK,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,600
many of the TechStream developers are participating in building

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,640
IAC as well for their respective teams.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,620
Josh is an architect who gets to evaluate and prescribe

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,490
cutting edge processes and technologies that have made his

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,610
job as enjoyable as it's ever been.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,470
Instead of having conversations about complex modulus,

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,940
discussions center on building more reuse into future projects with the CDK.

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,430
And since they've been pressing hard on the CDK best practices,

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,620
Globomantics has acquired that new development shop as promised

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,980
by the now highly confident CEO. Bring it,

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:09,000
Ellen tells her CEO every day when they talk about potential future acquisition. Would you do anything differently?
