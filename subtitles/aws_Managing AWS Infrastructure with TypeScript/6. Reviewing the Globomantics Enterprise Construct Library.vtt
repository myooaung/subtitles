00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.090
Before we depart and start talking about security, let's take

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.550
a look at the decisions at Globomantics around custom

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.870
constructs and their Enterprise library,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.130
which,

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.870
proverbially speaking is just breaking ground at this point. Ellen has faced

6
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.540
the challenge of her CEO's acquisition strategy straight on.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.630
As a result of all the requirements set forth and after many

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.010
discussions with the architects at Globomantics,

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.670
the decision's been made to build all future assets into

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.840
and from an Enterprise construct library.

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.740
The architecture team has also decided that all future development at

12
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.720
Globomantics would be serverless, albeit they haven't yet decided on a

13
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.840
serverless SAM or other framework at this point.

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.570
As a result,

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.530
all non‑serverless systems are targeted for IAC makeovers using

16
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.140
the new layered custom construct library.

17
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380
Josh's team is already in the process of building all the

18
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.640
low‑level custom constructs for the company,

19
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.940
such as custom S3 buckets, custom VPCs and custom database constructs.

20
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.510
Once built,

21
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.870
a second higher‑level layer will be built consisting

22
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.160
of groups of layer one constructs.

23
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.110
Early examples of these include LAMP stack environments

24
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.540
and higher‑level preconfigured VPCs,

25
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.300
including multiple public and private subnets, as well as API Gateway

26
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.490
Lambda constructs. As a new forward strategy, all new systems built

27
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.790
greenfield will include IAC built entirely from the Enterprise custom

28
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.710
construct library following the testing standards now set forth by

29
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.940
the organization.

30
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.240
There you have it.

31
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.880
At this point,

32
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.330
we now have the complete knowledge and skills to maximize reuse in

33
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.190
our applications by building them out into custom construct

34
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:42.000
libraries and ensure their fully tested. We now take a dive into principles of security with CDK applications.
