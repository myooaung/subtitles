1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,050
Similar to VPC characteristics,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,740
both subnets and AZs can be retrieved dynamically as well.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,270
Now this is inevitably something you will run into in your CDK career,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,890
so it's worth showing briefly.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,250
The concepts are all similar here, that the goal is to

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,510
dynamically assign attributes to the correct VPC with the

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,110
correct subnets in the desired availability zones. So we can

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,440
take the previous example of it further.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,980
As you know,

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,600
we set some VPC values from context using the ternary in

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,220
the prior example. We can also retrieve a list of subnets

12
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,870
using this selectSubnets method, in this case,

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,840
looking for a public subnet in the VPC.

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,330
In addition,

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,280
there are a handful of properties we can use as well to

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,050
retrieve a list of availability zones in our current target

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,240
region for our current stack.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,000
This makes it very easy to evaluate how many AZs are in a region and deploy accordingly.
