00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.690
blessings.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.450
This is Berhard.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:10.370
This is Luna se I.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.610
I've spent over 50,000 hours successfully training thousands of dogs and humans in areas

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.550
ranging from behaviour modification,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.630
personal defense dogs as well a service dogs.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.650
I am so happy to be here to announce my new online dog training system that I've been

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.420
cultivating for the past 10 years during my professional dog training career.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.350
What's unique about the down dog is I explained everything from the dog's perspective,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.290
and I only require a leash on calling.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.530
This creates simplicity.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.470
It gets straight to the point without confusion.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.930
In other words,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.120
I'm going to be teaching you how to become the loving Alfa or leader with your dog as well

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.890
as in your own life,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.380
without the need of treats or bribes or fear tactics.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:11.140
Did you know that dogs and wolves are 99.8% genetically the same thing?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.440
This is important because understanding of dogs instinct,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.040
basic nature will help us understand how to connect to them much more deeply and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.650
effectively.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.580
I've dedicated my time,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.880
effort and resource is understanding and learning from dogs as well as wolves and what

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330
she'll get from this program is a much,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.360
much better way to understand your dog.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.350
From their perspective,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.800
your relationship will turn from one of possibly chaos and confusion to peace and harmony

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.250
by understanding them in the way that will be going over.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.990
It'll make it that much easier for you and your dog have the most fruitful relationship,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.410
and in addition to this,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.630
the more you're going to be learning about your dog more.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.160
You're gonna learn about yourself.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.500
Let's go on that journey together.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.650
Thes.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.850
