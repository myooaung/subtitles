00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
blessings.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.920
Thank you for joining me with Dow of Dog Dog Psychology 101 Let's get started and let's go

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.750
over the five best practices in approaching this course number one have an open mind.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.190
We're going to be learning about the dog from the dog's perspective so we can open our mind

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.590
to new possibilities.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.760
Number two,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.990
take a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.130
I want you to write out what your intentions are and owning your dog being a loving leader

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.100
of with your dog what you're gonna be training and why you bought this Siri's as well as

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.930
going over where your commitments are going to be.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.610
How much time you want to put into this,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.340
how much effort you want to put into this and how much energy you're willing to put into

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.140
this in your new relationship with your dog.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.450
Very important.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.750
Number three.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.080
The best thing that weaken Dio is take away distractions,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.150
get comfortable and continue enjoying the rest of the videos.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.350
The fourth is finding out what resonates.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.550
We've watched number 12345 and I recommend you do that in order.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.010
After that,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.200
you can come back and forth as you wish for whatever is most resonant with you in your

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.060
current situation,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.970
and then find out how we can apply what the tools are and what the ways are that have been

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.360
going on where the confusion may have been lying.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.090
But really take your time and figure out how we can apply.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.070
The fifth is we want to make sure that we give ourselves a dog training calendar or a check

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.740
off list.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.050
I recommend this being a daily,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.320
weekly and monthly list.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.040
This is where we can put together our amount of repetitions.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.350
What our goals are,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.310
what activities will be in doing so it will help us stay much more organized,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.980
and it will help us keep ourselves accountable.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.960
And that way,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.940
if you ever thinking when my dog isn't learning,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.630
I don't know what's going wrong Here we go back to the calendar and see exactly what we put

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.900
into it and what we haven't that will help us stay much more clear.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.450
I look forward to you enjoying these videos,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.150
learning from these videos and connecting to your dog that much more.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.990
I'll see you Day one blessings
