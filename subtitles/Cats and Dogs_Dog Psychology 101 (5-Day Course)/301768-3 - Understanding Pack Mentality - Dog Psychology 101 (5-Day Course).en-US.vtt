00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
blessings.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.160
Thank you for joining into the five day course today.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.210
We're gonna be going over his pack mentality.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:31.430
A pack mentality.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.700
Have you heard this before?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.260
In my 10 years of professional dog training career?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.070
It was one of the most common questions.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.160
What's pack mentality?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.650
How did my dog really think?

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.010
Where do I fit into this?

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.320
Those air,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.840
all extremely valid.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.570
And if we don't understand those,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.950
we will never truly understand our dogs.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.820
Luna biggest.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.610
Having multiple dogs in an area at a time creates a pack.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.010
Your family even having one dog in many family members.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.530
To the dog,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.160
That's a pack.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.110
We moved together.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.800
We eat together,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.580
we sleep together.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.210
At times,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.100
we fight together.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.850
We love together,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.630
we show affection.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.500
We show discipline,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.100
everything we do together.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.090
That's what makes a pack.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.690
And in order for the pack to feel safe and to understand,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.260
there has to be a leader,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.740
and that leader typically ends up being a dog.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.970
Humans are very catering by our basic nature.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.070
We love and console and forgive and want to make excuses.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.570
So on and so forth dogs come much more straight and at times bring that dominance much

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.230
faster than what we're able to.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.500
And the dominance is really what makes the leader.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.310
It's not the biggest.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.320
It's not the strongest.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.550
It's not the most aggressive.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.650
The leader is the one who doesn't stop.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.030
The leader is the one who,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.110
when it needs to make a point,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.870
it makes the point.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.820
When one needs to be disciplined for the right reason,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.450
they do it.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.970
When the hunt is on,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.470
they go.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.230
They don't ask.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.860
They don't ask anyone to follow them.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.070
They go and everyone follows because they sense that energy.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.800
The leader.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.210
Make sure there's no confusion,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.000
and what will bring confusion is their safety.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.450
Are we protected?

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.900
Is there food?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.160
Those are the three main issues,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.660
and so in a pack they get to figure that out for each other.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.600
They get to figure that out for themselves,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.350
where they're out within that hierarchy.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.560
Typically,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.170
there's going to be an Alfa male and a female,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.290
at least in a true pack.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.830
There's an Alfa male and a female.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.030
You have the Betas,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.410
you have subordinates and you have omega in our pack in our homes.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.150
Usually there's an Alfa and their subordinates and the dog takes that position.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.850
So it's our time now for us to understand how that happens,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.880
where we can eliminate confusion when we don't have confusion.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.810
We don't have a struggle.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.260
When we don't have a struggle,

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.510
we don't have an imbalance.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.050
And if that's what we're going to be doing,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.470
is not having an imbalance.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.430
Well,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.250
then we have to know what their minds are thinking.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.660
And in doing so,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.490
am I safe?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.390
And can you,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.020
as the leader,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.730
keep me safe?

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.780
Can you as a leader,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.150
protect me when there's a lot of distractions around and you as a leader,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.630
can you bring food to the table?

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.070
Do you show me affection when appropriate?

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.950
Do you show discipline when appropriate?

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.540
If we could do that,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.620
we get to understand pack mentality much,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.250
much better.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.700
We can alleviate the confusion.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.880
We can alleviate the struggle.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.450
We can alleviate the imbalance that we can come to peace and harmony once again.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.710
And or maybe for the first time ever,

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.350
the leader typically is the columnist one until they need to get into action.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.400
So I suggest until we meet again that where your homework will be is to make sure that we

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.920
tap into ourselves,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.450
We're gonna be moving with the pack.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.480
At times there's gonna be struggles.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.980
And what do we do with this?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.500
How do we show up more is the question How do I beam or consistent as the leader?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.760
How do I bring more love to the pack?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.290
How do I bring more safety protection?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.350
The needs Dogs may want a lot of things,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.040
but there needs air.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.280
Very,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.120
very simple.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.020
Just like humans.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:21.210
So let's go on this journey together toe understand their mentality much more to adopt a

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.000
lot of the philosophy of their mentality and how simple,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.150
simple it is.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.170
Thank you for watching today.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.630
I'm gonna be seeing you tomorrow in the next video.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.350
Have a wonderful day Train Play love as much as you can,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.450
I think.
