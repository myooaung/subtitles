00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:05.003
(upbeat music playing)

2
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:08.005
- [Instructor] Now that we've seen the Java 11 HTTP Client

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.002
and a few cognitive services inaction.

4
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.005
Let's try a programming challenge.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.002
In this challenge, you're going to make an API call

6
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:17.005
to the sentiment service

7
00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.001
within the text analytics API.

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.006
After the API returns a response

9
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.006
you'll work to parse out the sentiment data

10
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.005
in order to create a sentiment analysis object.

11
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.002
Let's take a closer look.

12
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.007
Inside of your working files,

13
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.001
you'll find the Azure sentiment service

14
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.009
where you'll do most of your work,

15
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.004
Inside of this class,

16
00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:43.009
there's a single method named requests sentiment analysis.

17
00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.001
It accepts two parameters of type string.

18
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.004
The first is the text parameter

19
00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.001
which contains the text we'd like to send

20
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.002
to Azure cognitive services for sentiment analysis.

21
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.001
The second is the language parameter

22
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.000
which will have the language code.

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.007
If you're using English, this will be EN.

24
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.001
Now within the body of this method

25
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.007
you're going to make the call to Azure

26
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.003
get the response back.

27
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.006
And then from the response

28
00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:14.006
you'll build a sentiment analysis object

29
00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:18.003
that you're going to return from the method online 36.

30
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.003
Now let's talk about this sentiment analysis object

31
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:23.001
in a little more detail.

32
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.004
It has two fields.

33
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.003
The first is the text document field.

34
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.005
So this is going to store the text

35
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:35.002
that we sent over to Azure cognitive services for analysis.

36
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.001
The second field is the sentiment field

37
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.001
and here's where you're going to store the sentiment,

38
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.003
either positive or negative

39
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.005
that you get back in the response

40
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.004
from the text analytics API.

41
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.002
So you'll have to parse out the sentiment

42
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.002
from the response body

43
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.007
and store in this field.

44
00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.004
Now let's talk over a few things

45
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.007
to get you off to a good start.

46
00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:03.006
First you'll notice we have several constants

47
00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.003
at the top of the class

48
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:08.001
and the Azure endpoint is currently pointing

49
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.004
to my resource in Azure.

50
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:11.006
You need to change this up

51
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.004
to point to your specific resource.

52
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:15.006
You'll also notice,

53
00:02:15.006 --> 00:02:18.009
that the path constant is missing.

54
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.005
So you'll have to go to the API reference

55
00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.009
for the text analytics API

56
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.008
in order to find the path

57
00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.000
to the sentiment endpoint.

58
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.009
Once you have that, put it in your code

59
00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.009
and you can make the call,

60
00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.000
you'll need to construct the response body.

61
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.009
That's going to be sent over to Azure cognitive services.

62
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.001
So to help with that,

63
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.000
I'd recommend using the text analytics request

64
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.007
in text document objects

65
00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:49.000
to build that response body.

66
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.008
When you get the response back,

67
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:55.006
I would recommend using Jackson's ObjectMapper and JsonNode

68
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:57.007
to easily extract the sentiment

69
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:00.005
from that Json in response the body.

70
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.000
Once you've built your sentiment analysis object

71
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.003
from that information,

72
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.001
just go ahead and return it from the method.

73
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.006
And if you'd like to test it out,

74
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.007
I've included this unit test

75
00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:13.001
that contains a test for a positive

76
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.002
and negative sentiment analysis.

77
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:16.009
Just go ahead, execute this.

78
00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.003
If the tests pass, you're in great shape.

79
00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:21.002
So go ahead, give it a shot

80
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.006
and then take a moment

81
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.000
to view my solution when you're ready.
