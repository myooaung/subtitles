00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] To complete the course project,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.006
we're going to add a text messaging feature

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:08.000
to our application, using Twilio.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.003
Twilio is a great addition to any developer's toolbox

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.000
because it enables them to include messaging,

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.005
voice and video into their applications

7
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.009
with minimal effort.

8
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.001
Within Twilio, you'll find over 20 APIs

9
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.004
that unlock communications channels, such as text messaging,

10
00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:29.006
WhatsApp, chat and programmable voice.

11
00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.005
Using these channels, your applications can better engage

12
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.008
with their users.

13
00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:39.008
For our purposes, we're going to focus on the SMS API

14
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.008
and its ability to send text messages.

15
00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.006
We'll use this API to send a text,

16
00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.009
based on the results of the sentiment analysis conducted

17
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.003
on the tweets we receive in our stream from Twitter.

18
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.001
Building an enterprise SMS capability

19
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.004
is out of reach for most developers and organizations.

20
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.007
In order to create this sort of capability,

21
00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.003
it requires negotiation with large telecoms

22
00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:09.005
and most businesses just don't meet the volume requirements

23
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:12.002
that can justify the investment.

24
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.009
When using Twilio, those concerns never cross a developer

25
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.002
or an organization's mind.

26
00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.002
That's because Twilio has built the infrastructure

27
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.003
and networks for you.

28
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.009
They package up these messaging capabilities

29
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.006
into an easy to use API that's readily accessible.

30
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.004
Twilio is enterprise grade and it's used

31
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:39.006
by developers to send roughly 66 billion messages per year.

32
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.001
That's a lot of texts.

33
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.002
Let's hop over to the documentation,

34
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.001
just to take a closer look.

35
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.008
On the Twilio homepage,

36
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.005
you'll just navigate to docs and tools

37
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.003
and then go to API reference.

38
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.009
We're interested in the SMS API,

39
00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.004
so I'll click on that section.

40
00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:02.009
And then over here in the side bar, go to API overview.

41
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.003
This is going to show us how to construct a call

42
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:08.004
that makes a text message.

43
00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:11.008
Now I just want to point out a few high-level things.

44
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:15.001
First, you'll notice the base URL.

45
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.007
The base URL versions by date.

46
00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.004
So instead of having like V2 in here,

47
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:24.003
it's actually going to specify the date,

48
00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:28.005
which indicates the version of the API.

49
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.004
If we scroll down, you will find the security scheme.

50
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:37.000
The Twilio API is protected using basic auth.

51
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So we're going to have to provide credentials

52
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.008
with each request using basic auth

53
00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.009
when we call the Twilio API.

54
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.007
A little bit further down in the documentation,

55
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:52.003
we get an example of a call that uses curl

56
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.003
to send a text message.

57
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.003
Now you'll notice we perform a post

58
00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.006
and the URI is a little bit unique

59
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:05.007
in the fact that we specify our Twilio account SID

60
00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:09.007
as a path variable in the request.

61
00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:13.004
So, we'll need to get our account ID

62
00:03:13.004 --> 00:03:18.005
and then inject it into the URI when we make our calls.

63
00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.004
Now, in order to send the text message,

64
00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:24.000
we have to specify three things,

65
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.006
the body which is the message we want to send

66
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:32.003
in the text and then a from number and a to number.

67
00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:35.002
You'll notice they are data URL encoded,

68
00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:37.008
so we're not sending json here.

69
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:41.002
This is a different mind type that we'll use.

70
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:44.003
And then finally, you just see they include the credentials

71
00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.007
there with basic auth.

72
00:03:46.007 --> 00:03:49.007
So it's pretty simple to send a text message

73
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:52.004
using Twilio's API.

74
00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:55.008
And that really speaks to how APIs are great

75
00:03:55.008 --> 00:04:00.005
at delivering capabilities and making them accessible.

76
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.006
The capabilities behind this SMS API alone

77
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:08.001
would require years from a team of senior engineers

78
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:12.000
and most organizations just don't have the time

79
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.006
to build that or the money to invest in the legal costs

80
00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:21.006
to negotiate with telecoms for this sort of capability.

81
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:25.004
I'll show you how to use Twilio to avoid all those things,

82
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:28.005
so that you can quickly send text messages

83
00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:31.000
from your Java applications.
