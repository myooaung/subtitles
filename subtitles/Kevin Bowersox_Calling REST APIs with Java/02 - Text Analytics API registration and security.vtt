00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Instructor] Before using the text analytics API,

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.000
we need to create a new Azure cognitive service resource

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.006
and obtain credentials to access that resource.

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:15.000
So having an Azure account is a prerequisite at this point.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.002
If you don't have an account click on this button

6
00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:21.009
on the Azure homepage to obtain your free trial account.

7
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.003
Once you have the account

8
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:27.001
then you can navigate into the portal using this link.

9
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.009
Inside of the portal, we can create resources

10
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.002
like our cognitive services.

11
00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.002
To do that, we just click on this button.

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.006
This is going to allow us to search

13
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.001
for the resource that we'd like to create.

14
00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:44.005
And when using cognitive services, we have several options.

15
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:49.000
The first is to deploy the whole bundle of services.

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.008
So if you just search for cognitive here,

17
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.004
you'll see this option in the dropdown.

18
00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.007
And this would allow you to deploy

19
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.004
a bundle of cognitive services.

20
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.002
So this is going to be one end point to access

21
00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.008
the vision, the language search

22
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.002
and speech services through Azure.

23
00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.006
Now we're only interested in the text analytics API.

24
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.003
So we're going to go back to the previous screen,

25
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:17.000
and search for that option.

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.008
There we see it within the dropdown,

27
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.007
and using this approach,

28
00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:26.005
we can only deploy the text analytics API.

29
00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.003
And since that's all we're interested in,

30
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.001
I'm going to go ahead and click on the create button

31
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.008
to start that process.

32
00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:35.000
That's going to require us to complete this form

33
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.007
where we provide information

34
00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:39.002
about the resource we'd like to create.

35
00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.003
The first thing we'll need to specify is the resource group.

36
00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:47.009
This is just a way to organize your resources within Azure

37
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.004
to make them easier to manage.

38
00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.009
So I'm going to name my new resource group

39
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.003
the Landon-hotel-monitor,

40
00:01:57.003 --> 00:02:00.002
and I'll just separate those words with dashes,

41
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.002
and I'll click on, okay to go ahead and create that.

42
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:07.003
You can leave your region as the default, mine is East,

43
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.002
the next part is really important though.

44
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.001
So we need to provide a name for the resource,

45
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.004
and this name is going to be used

46
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:22.003
to create a domain that is used to access the resource.

47
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:27.009
So it has to be unique for each resource within Azure.

48
00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:32.004
So your resource name will be different than mine.

49
00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:37.004
I'm going to use Landon-hotel-feedback.

50
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.005
You might need to use something different here,

51
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:43.002
and that's going to have implications on your domain name

52
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:44.007
and you'll have to keep that in mind

53
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:47.003
in later lessons that you won't be able to use

54
00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.007
the same domain as me.

55
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:51.006
Alright, so moving on from there,

56
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.007
we're going to go go ahead and select the pricing tier.

57
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.002
Now here's the awesome thing,

58
00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.005
you're going to get 5,000 transactions

59
00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.008
over the next 30 for free.

60
00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.001
Go ahead and select that tier,

61
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.000
it'll be fine for the amount of volume

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.003
we're going to be sending in.

63
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:09.005
Then just go ahead, review your selections,

64
00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.000
and if you're satisfied with them,

65
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.006
click on create and Azure will begin to deploy

66
00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.002
and provision our cognitive service.

67
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:20.000
You can see it now action here,

68
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.007
and it's normally pretty quick,

69
00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.009
we can see that it has completed that deployment.

70
00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.009
Let's go check out the resource by clicking on this button.

71
00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:30.003
So here's kind of a console

72
00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.004
that we get to look at the resource

73
00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.001
in different aspects of it.

74
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.005
I want to call your attention

75
00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:40.000
to the keys and endpoint section within the sidebar.

76
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.006
Go ahead, click on that.

77
00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:44.006
Here's where the important stuff is for us.

78
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:47.000
You'll recall that Azure cognitive services

79
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.008
are protected by an API key.

80
00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:51.002
So here's where you find those keys.

81
00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:53.005
And then if you remember the end point

82
00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:56.001
or the domain name we were talking about earlier,

83
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:56.009
here it is.

84
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:59.005
So yours will look different than mine,

85
00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:02.003
and you'll have to use that later in the lessons

86
00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:06.005
when we're specifying this end point to our resource.

87
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.006
Alright, so with all this in place,

88
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:11.000
we can now go ahead and we're going to use

89
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
a tool called postman to make a test API call

90
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.005
over to Azure cognitive services.

91
00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:23.004
Postman allows us to construct an HTTP request

92
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:27.007
for situations where we want to do things like testing.

93
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:31.005
To help us build that HTTP call to the API,

94
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm going to put postman and the console side-by-side.

95
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.007
So let's first grab our endpoint,

96
00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:43.003
and just paste it here, where the domain will go,

97
00:04:43.003 --> 00:04:48.000
and then we're also going to grab our API keys.

98
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.008
And for right now, just navigate

99
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.004
to the authorization section,

100
00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:55.006
and in the authorization section,

101
00:04:55.006 --> 00:05:01.003
click on API key and paste that value right here.

102
00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:05.003
We'll get the name of the API key in a minute.

103
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:08.002
Alright, so that's everything we need from the console,

104
00:05:08.002 --> 00:05:11.001
let's now hop over to the documentation

105
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:14.001
for the text analytics API.

106
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:16.004
If we scroll down in the docs,

107
00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:19.004
we're going to find the remainder of the information

108
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:23.009
that we need to call the text analytics API.

109
00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.002
The first thing we'll pull from the docs

110
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.008
is the path to the sentiment service.

111
00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:34.004
So just go ahead, copy that, and then paste it

112
00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:39.007
after our domain for our resource on Azure.

113
00:05:39.007 --> 00:05:42.006
Okay, if we keep scrolling down,

114
00:05:42.006 --> 00:05:46.009
here we're going to find the name of the API key.

115
00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.007
So we'll copy that it will be applied

116
00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:52.003
as a header on the request,

117
00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:55.003
and this will actually be the header name.

118
00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:59.001
So we'll paste that into postman,

119
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.002
and then scrolling down further,

120
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:05.008
you're going to find an example of a request body

121
00:06:05.008 --> 00:06:07.000
that we can send over.

122
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.009
You'll notice it's JSON,

123
00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.005
so we have an array of documents,

124
00:06:11.005 --> 00:06:13.001
and each of those documents

125
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.001
objects specifies a language, an ID,

126
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.000
and then the text that we would like

127
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.004
to analyze the sentiment of.

128
00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:26.000
Go ahead and copy that,

129
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.001
and now we're going to go over to postman

130
00:06:28.001 --> 00:06:29.007
and click on the body tab,

131
00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:33.006
where we can build our request body,

132
00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:37.008
then click on role and select JSON from this dropdown

133
00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:41.009
that will indicate that we are sending JSON to the API.

134
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:47.008
Then just go ahead and paste the JSON into this text area.

135
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:51.001
Alright, there's one last thing we'll need to do,

136
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:56.002
the call to Azure Cognitive services uses an HTTP post,

137
00:06:56.002 --> 00:07:01.002
so that's the HTTP method that we'll use to make the call.

138
00:07:01.002 --> 00:07:02.008
And now we have everything.

139
00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:03.009
So let's go ahead,

140
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.004
we'll send the call over to Azure cognitive services.

141
00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:09.008
You can see that we do get a response,

142
00:07:09.008 --> 00:07:15.001
and we get sentiment analysis conducted on those documents.

143
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.004
So you can see that in just minutes,

144
00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.006
we were able to access AI capabilities

145
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:23.002
using Azure cognitive services.

146
00:07:23.002 --> 00:07:25.005
Now that we've completed registration

147
00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:29.009
for the text analytics API and made a few secure calls,

148
00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:32.000
we can start building out a Java client

149
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that makes the same request.
