00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Kevin] Thanks for watching this course on working

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.002
with REST APIs in Java.

3
00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.001
Before we wrap up, I want to provide you

4
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.004
with some recommendations about what to explore next,

5
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.001
and give you some information about my other courses.

6
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.000
In the course, we've explored ways to call an API with Java

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.003
and saw the amazing capabilities that can be unlocked

8
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:22.008
through those calls.

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.000
Things like text messaging, AI,

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.005
and integration with social networks.

11
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.001
That's just a small amount of the growing number

12
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.001
of features exposed by public APIs.

13
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.003
So I encourage you to use your new skills

14
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.001
to explore all those other APIs out there,

15
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.006
and to learn what they can do.

16
00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:45.007
Other APIs will expose you to different concepts, designs,

17
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:50.000
and security schemes that will broaden your experience.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.006
As you explore those, take a look at some

19
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:56.005
of the finer details in Spring's WebClient or Feign.

20
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.009
We covered 80% of their usage,

21
00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.003
but you'll find deeper functionality in these projects

22
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.005
that supports features like resiliency patterns

23
00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:09.003
that can be applied in specific scenarios.

24
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.006
If you like my teaching style, I have a few other courses

25
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:16.002
on the LinkedIn Learning platform that might interest you.

26
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.001
In Microservices: Security, I'll teach you patterns,

27
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.003
standards, and best practices that allow you

28
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.000
to confidently integrate security

29
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.002
into microservice-based systems

30
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:30.007
without sacrificing the benefits they deliver.

31
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:34.009
Git for Teams is a course I built that delivers strategies

32
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.009
for teams using Git

33
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.001
that makes their development much more fluid.

34
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:44.000
Building APIs with Swagger covers a design-first approach

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.004
to creating APIs with the OpenAPI specification.

36
00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:52.002
Java EE 8 Essential Training covers 13

37
00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.008
of the most widely used Java EE APIs,

38
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.001
and gives you a rock solid foundation

39
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.001
for building Java web applications.

40
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.004
Spring Batch can provide you with a proven architecture

41
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.000
to construct complex batch jobs

42
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.002
that run on the JVM using Spring.

43
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.004
Finally, Migrating beyond Java 8 will teach you how

44
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.007
to navigate the Java ecosystem

45
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.007
to handle the new release, Cadence,

46
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.002
and newly introduced language features.

47
00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.000
So that's it for now.

48
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.002
Congratulations on finishing the course

49
00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.001
and thanks again for taking it.

50
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:30.005
Now, go out there and call some awesome APIs,

51
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.005
then drop me a message on LinkedIn.

52
00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.000
I'd love to hear about it.
