00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] The first API that we'll integrate with

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.009
is part of Azure Cognitive Services.

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.008
Let's take a deeper look at the AI capabilities

4
00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.003
provided by the services.

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.007
Artificial intelligence has gone through a few hype cycles

6
00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.002
but in the past five years

7
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.003
practical capabilities have emerged.

8
00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.008
Tools like image recognition and sentiment analysis

9
00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.007
are now found in many developers toolboxes,

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.006
and not just Sci-Fi movies.

11
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.003
Azure Cognitive Services

12
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.009
makes these types of AI capabilities

13
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.006
accessible for companies and developers

14
00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:39.000
that would typically find them out of the reach.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.005
The services found within the catalog

16
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.008
are built on top of pre-trained AI models

17
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.001
that can deliver search, language,

18
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:51.003
speech, vision, and decision capabilities.

19
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:54.003
In just a few minutes, and a few API calls,

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.002
developers can add AI capabilities to their apps

21
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.002
that would take years and a data science PhD

22
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.002
to develop on their own.

23
00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.003
The APIs within Azure Cognitive Services

24
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:10.001
are divided into five major categories.

25
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
Services in the vision category

26
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.001
provide the capability to analyze pictures and video

27
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.007
and other content for things like tagging

28
00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.000
or facial recognition.

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.001
The speech service can do conversions

30
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.009
from speech to text and text to speech

31
00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.001
and language translation.

32
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.005
These capabilities are great

33
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.006
if you're doing things like

34
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:35.000
voice interaction with your application.

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.009
Decision services provide capabilities such as

36
00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.004
anomaly detection, personalization, and content moderation

37
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:48.001
that can replace or aid manual human reviews of content.

38
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.009
The search family of services

39
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.005
embeds Microsoft Bing's search capabilities into your apps.

40
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.001
And here's where we're going to focus the language services.

41
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.001
These services allow you to extract meaning

42
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.003
from unstructured text that can power capabilities such as

43
00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:11.003
chat bots, question and answer panels, and text analytics.

44
00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:15.001
Our application will use the text analytics service

45
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.000
to detect sentiment within a text.

46
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.008
Let's learn more by hopping over to the Azure site

47
00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.005
and checking out the docs.

48
00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:24.009
So here are the docs

49
00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.000
for all of the Azure Cognitive Services.

50
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.004
You can see the language family here

51
00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:33.001
and specifically our text analytics API

52
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.009
that we're interested in.

53
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.007
Let's go ahead and click on that,

54
00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.007
and then over on the left-hand side bar

55
00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:42.002
you're going to see these example user scenarios.

56
00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:45.003
And these are going to outline common use cases

57
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.008
things like looking at survey results,

58
00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:51.004
analyzing inbound customer calls to get sentiment,

59
00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.001
looking at support incidents

60
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.004
and deriving sentiment from them.

61
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.003
And then finally you get to our use case.

62
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:01.009
We're going to look at monitoring a social media feed.

63
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.008
So it's exactly what we want to do.

64
00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:08.002
When a tweet is made on Twitter regarding land and hotel,

65
00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.003
we're going to send that text

66
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:15.004
into Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis.

67
00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:18.001
All right, let's take a look at the details now.

68
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.001
So over on the left-hand sidebar,

69
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:25.000
go to the reference and then expand text analytics API

70
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.008
and let's take a look at version three.

71
00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.000
So here are the detailed API docs

72
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.009
and this is where we're going to find

73
00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
all of the information about the call

74
00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.001
that we need to construct.

75
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.003
You'll notice we have the sentiment resource here,

76
00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:42.007
let's go ahead and click on that

77
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:44.008
because it's the one we'll be using.

78
00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.008
And if we scroll down a little bit

79
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:51.000
you'll see the identifier for the service.

80
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.005
So that's where we'll be sending the request,

81
00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:56.005
it needs to be an HTTP post.

82
00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.003
Now within the request body

83
00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:03.007
we need to provide some JSON that represents

84
00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:06.000
the text we would like to analyze.

85
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.009
So here you can see the structure but

86
00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.005
it's a documents array, and within that array

87
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:16.002
we have a documents object that has an ID,

88
00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:20.000
the language and then the texts that we would like

89
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.007
the sentiment analysis to be conducted on.

90
00:04:22.007 --> 00:04:26.001
Now, once we fire off that call to the service

91
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:28.004
we're going to get a response back

92
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:30.006
and we'll have to parse that out.

93
00:04:30.006 --> 00:04:34.008
Within the response, we get an array of documents

94
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:38.003
and then inside that array, we have an object.

95
00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:41.000
It will contain a specific property

96
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.008
that shows the sentiment,

97
00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:46.007
and then it also has a breakdown of the confidence scores

98
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:49.009
that shows positive, neutral, or negative.

99
00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.004
Now you can see it's an array of documents,

100
00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:55.001
we're only going to send one document at a time

101
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.008
so we can always assume there's only one object

102
00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:00.007
within that array.

103
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:04.003
So using this service, we can get some insights

104
00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:07.001
into the feelings of the author of the text

105
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:09.007
at that time and use them

106
00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:13.009
for our purposes of alerting the land and hotel manager.

107
00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.000
Now there's a little bit more

108
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.002
to making this API call that we'll need to discuss.

109
00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:22.002
But at a quick glance, you can see the power of APIs.

110
00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:25.001
Most developers couldn't build this quickly,

111
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:28.009
it would be too costly or they wouldn't have the skillset.

112
00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:34.002
But an API can act as a bridge to this pre-built capability

113
00:05:34.002 --> 00:05:37.006
that we'll find within Azure Cognitive Services

114
00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:40.000
that can deliver the AI that we need.
