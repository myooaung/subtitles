00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.003
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.002
- [Instructor] Now it's time

3
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.004
to put your new skills with Twilio and Feign to work

4
00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.000
in a programming challenge.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.007
So here's the challenge.

6
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.003
The monitoring application for Landon Hotel

7
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:16.007
is almost complete.

8
00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.001
There's just one last feature.

9
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.007
This feature will send a text message

10
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.001
whenever a tweet is made about the hotel.

11
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.002
In the text message,

12
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.001
we want to tell the manager

13
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.008
whether the content of the tweet is good or bad

14
00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.003
based on the results of sentiment analysis

15
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.009
conducted by Azure Cognitive Services.

16
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.008
To see the details of how to send a text message with Twilio

17
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:46.007
navigate into the SMS API section of the documentation.

18
00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:51.000
On the left-hand side bar, you'll see the message resource

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and here's where you're going to find all the details

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.003
of how to send a text message with Twilio.

21
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.008
Now, the call looks very similar

22
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.003
to when we use the voice API.

23
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.002
So if you have any difficulties,

24
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:08.000
go take a look at our work in that area to help you out.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.005
Once you've taken a look at the documentation,

26
00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:15.005
I'd recommend just using our Twilio client interface

27
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.002
that already exists

28
00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:20.009
to build the method that's going to send the text message

29
00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.000
over to Twilio.

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.001
Once you have the method on the client

31
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.001
the remainder of the work will take place

32
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000
in the Landon monitor application class.

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.007
Now, a few things here,

34
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:36.000
you'll notice that I'm injecting the Twilio SID,

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.003
the Twilio auth token,

36
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:39.006
the to number,

37
00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.004
and then I have Constance for the from number

38
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.008
and the Twilio API domain.

39
00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:46.003
So you'll want to make sure

40
00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.003
that you have environment variables

41
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.009
that include this information on your workstation

42
00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.008
and then you'll need to update the from number

43
00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.009
to your from number that Twilio provided.

44
00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.008
If you have all that configuration established

45
00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:04.003
you'll be able to use the new method

46
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:08.006
you put on the Twilio client within the run method

47
00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:13.000
to send the text message containing the sentiment analysis.

48
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.004
So take a shot at it.

49
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.000
And once you're ready, you can view my solution.
