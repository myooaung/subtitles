00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.002
- Before we take a closer look at calling APIs in Java,

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.008
let's talk a bit about who the course is for

3
00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.005
and what you should know ahead of time.

4
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.009
Senior Java developers are expected

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.008
to provide advanced solutions

6
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:18.001
that go beyond writing simple logic or working with objects.

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
These solutions often require systems to

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.009
exchange information,

9
00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.004
which is commonly done through an API these days.

10
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.004
APIs are one of the best ways to pass data

11
00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.003
or share capabilities between systems

12
00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:37.002
so it's a skill that advanced Java developers must have.

13
00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.008
So if you're a beginning Java developer

14
00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.003
who knows the basics,

15
00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.006
this course will teach you how to call APIs

16
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.006
which will prepare you for the integration problems

17
00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:51.004
that you're going to face as you advance in your career.

18
00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.003
Also, if you're just interested in what's possible

19
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.002
with an API, this course can also benefit you.

20
00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.000
There are a couple technologies and concepts

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.009
that kind of layer on top of each other

22
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.004
throughout the course.

23
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.008
I can unpack most of that information

24
00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:09.002
but you're going to get the most from this course

25
00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:12.006
if you have a little background in a couple of areas.

26
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.004
The only things you must know to get

27
00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:17.004
through the course is how to work with an IDE

28
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.003
and some basic Java.

29
00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.003
I'll be using Eclipse but you can use any IDE

30
00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.009
of your choice.

31
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.006
If you've never worked with Java

32
00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.008
or you want to understand the basics,

33
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.004
there's better courses in the LinkedIn learning platform

34
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.005
for that.

35
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:35.006
Go check those out, then come back and watch this course.

36
00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.008
There are some technologies in the background

37
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.008
that will help us throughout the course.

38
00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.004
But you don't have to know those upfront.

39
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.005
There are bits of Maven, Spring, Jackson

40
00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.006
and Project Reactor sprinkled throughout the course

41
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.001
but nothing that you must know ahead of time.

42
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.008
Also, if you know a little bit about HTTP

43
00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.008
it'll go a long way in this course.

44
00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.009
The course does require you to sign up for a few accounts,

45
00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.007
all of which are free or free with a trial.

46
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:05.006
So you'll need to register for Azure, Twitter

47
00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.007
and a Twilio account.

48
00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:10.007
The Azure account will require a credit card

49
00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:13.001
but they're really good about not billing you

50
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.000
past the trial.

51
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.005
These accounts will come with some credentials.

52
00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.009
So it's important you store them securely.

53
00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.000
But for the demo purposes, I'm going to store them

54
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in an environment variable on my workstation.

55
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.007
So make sure you know how to create that for your system

56
00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.007
and whatever operating system you're using.

57
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.002
Throughout the course, we'll be using these credentials

58
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:38.000
and other information that's associated with the account,

59
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
so make sure that you use your information and not mine.

60
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.009
So for example, we'll be making calls to Twilio

61
00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.002
and there's a phone number associated with the account.

62
00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.000
The examples will not work

63
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.008
if you use my Twilio phone number.

64
00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:54.002
That's all there is to know.

65
00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:56.008
I can guide you through the rest of the materials from here.

66
00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.000
Let's go ahead and get started.
