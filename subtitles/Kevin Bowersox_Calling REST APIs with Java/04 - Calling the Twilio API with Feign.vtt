00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] To further explore Twilio and feign,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.009
we're going to send ourselves a phone call

3
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.009
using the voice API.

4
00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.005
Now, one important thing to note about Twilio's API

5
00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.006
is that it doesn't use json.

6
00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.005
It's going to use form data

7
00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.008
to send things like phone numbers or the strings

8
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.005
for a text message.

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.001
To support that in Feign,

10
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:26.006
I've had to add another artifact into our palm dot XML file.

11
00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:27.005
So here you'll see

12
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.009
that I've included the feign form dependency,

13
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.001
which is going to allow us to work with form data in feign.

14
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.005
Now to get started with feign,

15
00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.008
we can build a client

16
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:43.002
within the comm dot LinkedIn dot API dot Twilio package.

17
00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.007
So just open up the new dialogue

18
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.004
and we'll create an interface

19
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:52.007
and we'll name that interface Twilio client.

20
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:56.005
Inside of this interface, we're going to create a method

21
00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.007
that returns void.

22
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.003
We're not going to be interested

23
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.006
in the response we get back from Twilio.

24
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.006
We just want to send the call out.

25
00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.007
I'm going to name the method, send voice message.

26
00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.007
And then from there, I'm going to go back

27
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:17.001
to the Twilio documentation and I'm going to scroll down

28
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.002
within this sidebar and click on the call resource.

29
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.008
And then we can just put these side by side

30
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:30.002
and it will be helpful as we build out the call to Twilio.

31
00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.003
Now, the main part of this documentation is found

32
00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:38.009
in the section where we create a call resource.

33
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.003
So, here you can see the full URI for making that call.

34
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.002
Go ahead and copy it.

35
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.003
And then we're going to use that information

36
00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.008
to establish our request line with feign.

37
00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:57.002
So it takes a post method and then we're going to specify

38
00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:58.007
that full URI.

39
00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.009
Now remember, we only want the path for feign,

40
00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.009
so let's go ahead.

41
00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.009
We'll take the domain off.

42
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.000
And then I want to draw your attention

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.001
to this part of the path.

44
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.005
It is using a template expression.

45
00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:15.000
So we're going to have to provide

46
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.002
that value within the method arguments.

47
00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:22.002
Let's just go ahead and get started on that.

48
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.008
So it's going to be the account SID parameter

49
00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.001
that will need to be provided.

50
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.002
And I'm just going to make that a type string

51
00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:34.006
and I'll name it, account SID.

52
00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:38.008
Okay, we're going to be doing this for a number

53
00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:42.006
of other parameters and we can see those

54
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.005
within the documentation.

55
00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:49.004
I'm just going to go ahead and set us up.

56
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:52.003
Okay, so those parameters include the two parameter

57
00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.005
and the from parameter.

58
00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:58.007
So let's add those into our method signature.

59
00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:02.004
The two parameter is going to be the phone number

60
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:04.006
that you're sending the call to.

61
00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:07.004
And from will be the phone number

62
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:09.003
that you're sending the call from.

63
00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:13.009
And that must be your Twilio phone number.

64
00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.002
All right, the final parameter is going to be known

65
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.007
as twim ML.

66
00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:22.007
And let's take a closer look at this.

67
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:26.008
This is the Twilio mark-up language.

68
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:28.007
So what Twilio has done

69
00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:33.004
is they've created a markup language that we can use

70
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:38.002
to provide instructions for the call we're going to make.

71
00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:41.002
And if we scroll a little bit down in the documentation,

72
00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:44.002
you see an example of this markup language.

73
00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:47.000
So you can see we open it with the response tag.

74
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.007
Then we have the say tag.

75
00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:53.007
Then we actually have the content of the call

76
00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:55.005
and then we close out our tags.

77
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.004
I'm going to go ahead and copy this for later.

78
00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:03.005
And we'll just go ahead and set up our string to be TWI ML.

79
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:06.005
All right, there's one last thing that we need

80
00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.006
to do for our client.

81
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:11.009
We need to set the client up with a header

82
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.008
that will indicate we're passing form data.

83
00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:18.009
So that's going to be the content type header

84
00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.004
because it indicates the mind type of the request body.

85
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:27.004
And in order to use form data that's application,

86
00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:34.008
X-WWW-form-urlencoded.

87
00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:39.000
All right, so now we're indicating to Twilio

88
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.008
that we would like to apply the content type header

89
00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:48.001
and we have added the form data mime type.

90
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.004
Everything is set with our client.

91
00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:53.005
Now we're going to head over to a unit test

92
00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:55.006
and we're going to use this client

93
00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:57.006
in order to send the call.

94
00:04:57.006 --> 00:05:00.009
Now, a couple of things to point out in this test.

95
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:04.006
I am dependency injecting the Twilio SID,

96
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:08.008
the Twilio auth token and the to number.

97
00:05:08.008 --> 00:05:11.004
So that's going to be my phone number.

98
00:05:11.004 --> 00:05:15.003
These values need to be set up as environment variables

99
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:20.006
and you can find the Twilio SID and your Twilio auth token

100
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:22.009
within the Twilio console.

101
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.006
You'll remember we saw those when we registered

102
00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:28.005
and then obviously, you know your phone number.

103
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:30.002
I set up Constance two here.

104
00:05:30.002 --> 00:05:33.000
One is my Twilio phone number.

105
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.008
This is the phone number Twilio assigned to me.

106
00:05:35.008 --> 00:05:38.005
And then the other is the Twilio domain.

107
00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:40.008
All right, let's go ahead and build this call out

108
00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:44.000
with our feign client.

109
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.007
The first thing we're going to do

110
00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:48.002
is take care of authentication.

111
00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:50.006
You'll remember that Twilio uses basic auth

112
00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:52.002
and to help us with that,

113
00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:56.007
feign provides the basic auth request interceptor.

114
00:05:56.007 --> 00:06:00.005
So I'm going to go ahead and declare a variable of that type

115
00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:02.003
and name it interceptor.

116
00:06:02.003 --> 00:06:04.006
And then we'll just use the constructor

117
00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:10.001
that accepts the username, which will be our Twilio SID

118
00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:15.001
and then the password, which will be our Twilio auth token.

119
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:17.006
Okay, so we have this interceptor.

120
00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:21.007
Let's start to build out our Twilio client and to do that,

121
00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:25.003
we can use the feign class and its builder.

122
00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:27.000
And the first thing we'll do

123
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.006
is register the request interceptor.

124
00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:33.008
So essentially, by adding this interceptor,

125
00:06:33.008 --> 00:06:36.008
every call is going to get our credentials added

126
00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:38.006
to it via basic authentication

127
00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:43.003
and that will satisfy the security scheme for Twilio.

128
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:45.009
The next thing we'll do is specify the encoder

129
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.004
and we're not going to be using json,

130
00:06:48.004 --> 00:06:50.007
we're going to be using form data.

131
00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:53.007
So I'm going to supply the form encoder

132
00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:57.009
and that will serialize our information

133
00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:02.006
into form data to be placed into the request body.

134
00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:05.001
Then finally, we'll use the target method

135
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:10.006
to tell feign we would like to create a Twilio client

136
00:07:10.006 --> 00:07:16.004
and the domain for Twilio is there in our constant.

137
00:07:16.004 --> 00:07:19.008
Okay, from here, we just invoke

138
00:07:19.008 --> 00:07:22.005
our send voice message method.

139
00:07:22.005 --> 00:07:25.006
We pass in our Twilio SID.

140
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:27.000
We already have our two number

141
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.003
and our from number established

142
00:07:29.003 --> 00:07:33.007
and now we need to specify the content

143
00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:36.006
of the call using Twilio markup language.

144
00:07:36.006 --> 00:07:40.000
So I'm going to paste those tags I copied earlier

145
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.008
and then I'm going to replace the content

146
00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:47.003
and say hello from LinkedIn learning.

147
00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:49.005
All right, excellent.

148
00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:51.009
So at this point, we're set up to make the call.

149
00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:58.006
Just right click, then go to run as, J unit test

150
00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:02.007
and that will fire off the test.

151
00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:03.007
Can you hold on a minute?

152
00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:06.000
I'm getting a call, I got to take this.

153
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.004
I'll be right back.

154
00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:11.000
