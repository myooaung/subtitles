00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Kevin] These days,

2
00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:05.004
users just expect innovative features in their applications

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.006
and they demand smooth experiences

4
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.005
between different systems.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:10.009
So if you're a developer,

6
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.007
how do you meet those expectations

7
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:16.002
without five PhDs and working around the clock?

8
00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:18.006
Hi, I'm Kevin Bowersox.

9
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.006
I've led the development of various Java applications

10
00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.006
that use REST APIs to integrate systems

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.007
and deliver cutting edge capabilities

12
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.008
that excite their users.

13
00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.009
As you advance as a developer,

14
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
you'll be asked to build these solutions too.

15
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.003
And knowing how to call an API is crucial.

16
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.009
This course is exciting

17
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.006
because we'll build an application

18
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.001
that mashes up artificial intelligence,

19
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.007
social media and text messaging

20
00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.000
while you learn to call REST APIs.

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.002
By the end of the course,

22
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.008
you'll know the best strategies

23
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.001
for calling an API with Java

24
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.008
and you'll have a cutting edge application

25
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.008
that will amaze your friends.

26
00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:02.005
I know AI, social media integration, text messaging,

27
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.003
those are bold claims for a single course but I deliver.

28
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.008
And I can show you how using APIs.

29
00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.005
So join me on my LinkedIn learning course

30
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.009
to learn how APIs will help you

31
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.000
deliver better Java applications.
