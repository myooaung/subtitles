00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] To start working with Twilio,

2
00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.005
we'll need to register a client.

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.006
We can start that process by clicking

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.005
on the Signup button on the homepage.

5
00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:13.001
From here, just go ahead, enter your name and your email,

6
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:18.004
and then establish a password for this account.

7
00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.009
Next, you'll have to accept the Terms of Service

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.004
and then just click on, Start Your Free Trial.

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:28.004
From here, you're going to receive a verification email,

10
00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.002
so you'll need to click

11
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:35.002
on that email within your inbox, and then sign in.

12
00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.000
So I just received my verification email.

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.003
I'm going to go ahead and enter my email and then hit Next.

14
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:47.004
And from here, I'll type in my password.

15
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.009
The next thing that will happen is that you'll

16
00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.003
be asked to enter your phone number

17
00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.007
in order to perform a text message verification.

18
00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.007
So go ahead, enter your phone number

19
00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:02.000
into the text box and hit Verify.

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.001
You should then get a text message

21
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.009
and that will contain a code that you'll need

22
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.005
to enter into this text box.

23
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.002
Okay, once you enter the code and hit Submit,

24
00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.004
they're going to ask you a couple questions.

25
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.006
They want to know what product you're going to use.

26
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:21.009
We're going to use the SMS API.

27
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.008
And then they want to know what we're going to build.

28
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.000
Our toll is all about Alerts and Notifications,

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.003
so we'll select that option.

30
00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.004
We're going to be building it

31
00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:35.000
with code and that code will be Java.

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.002
We will host the code ourselves,

33
00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.001
so we don't have to indicate we're interested

34
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.002
in Twilio hosting our code.

35
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.009
Okay, go ahead, click on Get Started.

36
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.008
And now we have an account.

37
00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:50.002
There you see the account SID and the Auth Token.

38
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.003
Those are the credentials that we will send

39
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.007
to satisfy the basic OAuth authentication.

40
00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:59.002
Now, it's important that you establish a trial phone number.

41
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:03.002
So click on this, Get a trial phone number button.

42
00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:06.006
And they're going to propose a phone number to you.

43
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:07.008
If you like the number,

44
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.001
go ahead and click on, Choose this Number.

45
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.008
And then, once they confirm that you have the number,

46
00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:18.004
go ahead and copy this into notepad

47
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:22.002
or some other tool, so that you have it handy,

48
00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:26.000
we'll need that later.

49
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.005
Okay, so we have a phone number,

50
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:29.001
and we have our credentials.

51
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.004
That's enough to make a test call.

52
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:34.007
Let's head over to the documentation.

53
00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:38.000
So we'll navigate into the API Reference.

54
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.004
And from here, just go ahead

55
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:44.000
and click on the Send SMS and MMS Messages.

56
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.009
And this is going to describe the call

57
00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.006
that we can use to send a text message.

58
00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:51.005
I'm going to go ahead and click on CURL,

59
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:56.003
so that I can see the parts of the HTTP message.

60
00:02:56.003 --> 00:03:02.004
Now, let's copy the URI,

61
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:06.002
and then we're going to take that over to Postman.

62
00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.004
And for now, I'm just going to paste it in here.

63
00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:14.007
And you'll notice, it was a POST that we needed to perform.

64
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:17.007
The next thing we're going to do is head back

65
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:24.001
into the portal, in order to grab our Account SID,

66
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.008
because you'll remember that is part

67
00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:32.002
of the URI that we need to construct.

68
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:35.000
We can put that in the URI,

69
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.008
here where the path variable would go.

70
00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:42.001
And then in order to establish the authentication,

71
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.004
we can click here on the Authorization tab

72
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.000
and then select Basic Auth.

73
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.008
You'll see the option about midway through the list.

74
00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:55.002
And here we'll need to enter the Account SID

75
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:59.000
as the username, make sure you don't have any spaces.

76
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.002
And then, we'll go back over here to grab our Auth Token,

77
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:08.003
and we'll put that in as our password.

78
00:04:08.003 --> 00:04:09.005
Okay.

79
00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:14.009
Now, if we go into the Body of the message,

80
00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:19.007
we're going to check the x-www-form-urlencoded,

81
00:04:19.007 --> 00:04:22.002
it's not JSON, remember that.

82
00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:24.002
Then we're going to specify the Body.

83
00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:29.005
We'll just say, "Hello, LinkedIn."

84
00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:32.002
So this will be the text message.

85
00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:35.001
Then you'll need to specify a To number

86
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:37.002
as well as a From number.

87
00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:39.003
You'll remember that our From number,

88
00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:41.007
we should have squirreled that away somewhere.

89
00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:43.005
And we can drop that in.

90
00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:47.002
And then, I'm going to go ahead and enter my phone number,

91
00:04:47.002 --> 00:04:50.005
in order to send the text message to myself.

92
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:54.000
Okay, so we have a sample call constructed.

93
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.004
Just go ahead and hit Send.

94
00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.007
So did you get a text message?

95
00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:00.008
I did.

96
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.001
Pretty amazing, right?

97
00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:04.006
If you haven't used the Twilio API before,

98
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:06.009
you're probably having an aha moment.

99
00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.006
Our simple HTTP call built with Postman on your laptop

100
00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:13.006
just traversed major telecom networks

101
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.003
and probably a couple satellites

102
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:19.001
to travel a couple inches to the phone right next to you.

103
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.000
It's really easy to see the power that's delivered

104
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.002
by REST APIs and Twilio in the scenario.

105
00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:27.000
It just took a few minutes.
