00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,540
[Autogenerated] So what have we done?

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,840
We've written an application where we code mostly to logical layers.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,730
We tried to break out the components.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,320
We've broken out security.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,010
We've broken out articles.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,810
Anything else you regard is component.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,570
Should have broken out in the same way we've added testing.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,950
We've done integration testing.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,740
We've done unit testing.

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,440
We've also integrated security into the application as well.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
To even a security is a cross cutting concern.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,140
It cuts across all parts of the applications.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,040
We can still isolate security into its own project.

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,120
So thank you for listening.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm watching. And I hope you enjoyed this course.
