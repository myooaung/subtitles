1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,050
[Autogenerated] So I want to add a new project here on the project.

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,410
I'm going to ad will be our first component when we go in to

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,140
add a component that manages the articles.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,640
I'm going to do most of this from insides Intelligent idea.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,260
It's gonna be a great URL project,

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,770
so I need to create a greater bill file on import that

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,200
bill file in to idea sort of do that.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,340
I'll do new directory here.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,160
I will call our directory jacket articles and then in here I'll do new far on.

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,510
I'll call that build our cradle on this will obviously be

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,240
the bill file for this particular project.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,840
So much of this bill file will inherit from the base project.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,940
We'll see that fall in the moment,

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,880
but within here we need to specify a few things I

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,280
specify in the repository musing, which is J center.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,580
I'm enabling the building of a jar file on giving that a name.

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,650
I'm turning off some of the spring features here's are not allowing

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,440
this particular project to build a boot jar file.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,640
We only want to do that within our web project.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,740
So once I have this bill fall.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,940
I can now configure the root project.

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,540
And if I go into setting stock cradle,

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,930
you can add jacket articles as a project here,

24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,940
a project to be included in our route project.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,540
And then I also need to make some changes to the root build grade URL file.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,040
So I need to specify dependencies here.

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,740
So currently, Jacket web is dependent on jacket repository,

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,220
so that's going to change.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,210
Jacket web will be dependent on jacket articles and then,

30
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,840
for now, jacket articles will itself be dependent on jacket repository.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,540
As we go through this particular module, we will get rid of Jackie Repository.

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,880
But baby steps also in here.

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,690
I have some integration around integration, testing.

34
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,970
We haven't talked about this yet.

35
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,790
We'll come back and cover this later in the course,

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,040
but I just need to add jacket articles to this.

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,840
Okay, So given that if I refresh grade URL on reimport all the greater projects,

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,540
then jacket articles is now seen as a project,

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,840
so the import hasn't created the source file structure for us.

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,540
Let's go and do that now.

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:20,620
So in here I want to create a new directory called SRC on.

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,710
Then underneath there.

43
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,040
I want to create all the appropriate sub directors.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,560
So integration test Java integration test resource is main Java

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,240
Main resource is test Java and test resources.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,610
Okay,

47
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,670
so one of the points of having this component is that this component will

48
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,550
contain it's own service code on its own repository code.

49
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,160
But the moment the repository code is in jacket repository on inside main.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,900
Here we have calm.

51
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,440
Pluralsight jacket, data repository, and then article repository.

52
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,840
I want to move that repository code into the jacket articles project.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,940
So inside Main Java, I create a new package.

54
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:13,490
This package will become Docker Pluralsight jacket article repository and a.

55
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,430
I'll move the article repository code into that package and it

56
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,650
will update the package name for me as well,

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,990
so that make sure it's in the right place on if I

58
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,340
do this and a rebuild the code.

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,000
The code still compiles as idea is smart enough to have updated

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
all the usages off this repository as well.

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
So remember we were using this in this controller,

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,270
so in here it now imports com Pluralsight jacket,

63
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,140
article repository.

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,340
So everything is compiling as it should be.

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,000
So now that we've added the repository to this component, let's go now to service to it
