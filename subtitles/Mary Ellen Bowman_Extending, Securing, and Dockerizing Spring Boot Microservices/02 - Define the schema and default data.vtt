00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] In software development,

2
00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.005
many times the best choice when writing code

3
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.006
is to not write the code at all.

4
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.002
We are constantly standing on the shoulders of others

5
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.002
to advance our own application.

6
00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:13.008
Don't reinvent the wheel for crying out loud.

7
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.005
An example of this is how explorecali

8
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.005
initializes the in-memory database.

9
00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.006
It instantiates and saves all the tour packages

10
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.003
in explorecali application.

11
00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:28.003
Then it opens a .JSON file

12
00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.009
and marshals each entry into a Tour object.

13
00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.003
And then saves the Tour package.

14
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:36.004
This was done in order to demonstrate the

15
00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.005
Spring Data repository save and find methods.

16
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.000
But there was a better way.

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.006
Thanks to Spring Data repository initialization.

18
00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.001
Let's go to the resources folder

19
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.008
and schema.sql.

20
00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.002
This is a file that has SQL commands in it.

21
00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:56.009
And it will create the schema.

22
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:57.007
In other words,

23
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:01.006
it will actually create the database tables.

24
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:08.006
And then data.sql.

25
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:14.007
This is where we insert rows into those tables.

26
00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:19.006
And then in application properties,

27
00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:24.006
we set spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl

28
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.006
- auto equal to none.

29
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.006
So with those three settings,

30
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.009
Spring Data repository initialization

31
00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.001
will initialize all of our tours and tour packages.

32
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.006
So because of that,

33
00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:41.006
we can go ahead and delete some code.

34
00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:49.002
First of all, let's go to our ExplorecaliApplication.

35
00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:54.009
We no longer need this code

36
00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.003
within the run method.

37
00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:04.005
We don't need this TourFromFile private class.

38
00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:10.001
And so we don't need the run method at all.

39
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:10.009
And because of that,

40
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.006
we don't even need to implement CommandLineRunner.

41
00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:22.008
or Autowire these services.

42
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:30.000
we can actually delete these services.

43
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.008
We can delete TourService.

44
00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:52.009
And we can delete TourPackageService.

45
00:02:52.009 --> 00:03:02.004
And we can delete the JSON file.

46
00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:12.008
There's something in here that's complaining.

47
00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:15.008
Let's build it and see if we've got any other bugs

48
00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:21.009
we need to take care of.

49
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:27.001
Ah, so we have a static import when we can remove as well.

50
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:30.001
Ah, now the compiler's happy.

51
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.002
Now to make this work.

52
00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.006
There is one thing we do need to add.

53
00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:38.008
So you see that there is this enum region.

54
00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:42.006
And we have the Central_Coast

55
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:48.005
which maps to a string Central space Coast.

56
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.003
As well as Southern_California,

57
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:55.001
which maps to Southern space California string.

58
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.001
And region is a VARCHAR of 20.

59
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:01.009
So I need to have a converter class

60
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.007
that when the import of the data from the data.sql

61
00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.000
is read,

62
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.007
we need to convert that string,

63
00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:12.007
Central space Coast

64
00:04:12.007 --> 00:04:15.003
Into the proper Region enum.

65
00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:19.000
So within the domain folder,

66
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I'll create a new class.

67
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.002
Let's call it RegionConverter.

68
00:04:34.002 --> 00:04:42.003
So RegionConverter implements

69
00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:50.000
AttributeConverter.

70
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.008
And we're going to convert a Region enum

71
00:04:55.008 --> 00:05:00.007
to a string.

72
00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:02.005
And now that we've implemented that

73
00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:10.006
we need to implement the methods.

74
00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:13.006
So we need to convert to database column from a Region

75
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:18.000
and we need to convert to entity attribute from a string.

76
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.004
So let's implement that code.

77
00:05:19.004 --> 00:05:21.003
So passed in a Region.

78
00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:28.009
So you want to return region.getLabel

79
00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.007
And we're passed in a string.

80
00:05:30.007 --> 00:05:32.003
We want to say

81
00:05:32.003 --> 00:05:38.007
Region

82
00:05:38.007 --> 00:05:41.000
findByLabel and passing in the string.

83
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.005
And then lastly,

84
00:05:43.005 --> 00:05:46.000
we need to

85
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.006
have a

86
00:05:48.006 --> 00:06:01.002
annotation.

87
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:06.001
So now whenever I run the application,

88
00:06:06.001 --> 00:06:11.006
the Spring Data will run the schema.sql,

89
00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:13.009
import the data.sql,

90
00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.009
and automatically convert the strings

91
00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.003
to the enum.

92
00:06:22.003 --> 00:06:27.003
So let's rebuild it to make sure everything is just right.

93
00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:36.007
Build successfully and now let's run it.

94
00:06:36.007 --> 00:06:41.003
So Tomcat started successfully.

95
00:06:41.003 --> 00:06:44.001
Did the mapping.

96
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:45.008
And let's go to Tomcat

97
00:06:45.008 --> 00:06:48.000
and make sure we can still see the tours.

98
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And we call a GET of all the packages

99
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.008
and we see all the tour packages.

100
00:06:52.008 --> 00:06:56.005
And send it again.

101
00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:58.008
And we got all the tours.

102
00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:00.000
So it still works.
