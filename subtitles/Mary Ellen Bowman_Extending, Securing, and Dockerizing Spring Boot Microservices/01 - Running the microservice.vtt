00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] So now that we understand the project,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.006
let's start up the application

3
00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.009
and exercise some of the APIs by launching the application

4
00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.006
and invoke them via Postman.

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.005
So on explorecaliApplication, I'm going to right-click it,

6
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.007
and say run

7
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:22.003
and we'll watch the console.

8
00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:27.004
So we see it started with Tomcat on port 80 80.

9
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.002
Now I've launched Postman

10
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:33.008
and I'll show you that you can import a set

11
00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:45.000
of collection API calls.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.009
This API demo1postmancollection.json file

13
00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:53.002
if you click that and open it, I've already got it opened,

14
00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.005
it will launch and then it starts

15
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.003
with this explore California APIs collection.

16
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.000
And this is just a shortcut I've added

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.008
so you don't have to type in each one of the API calls.

18
00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:07.001
So within the introduction folder, select the first one,

19
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.006
which is, get all tour packages.

20
00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.001
So here's the HTTP call to get all the tour packages,

21
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.003
click send

22
00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.008
and we see there's our tour packages for Backpack Cali,

23
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:27.000
California Hot Springs, et cetera.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.003
Now let's get all of the tours.

25
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:36.009
Here's all the details of my Big Sur Retreat Tour,

26
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.002
Death Valley,

27
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.007
Mount Whitney Climbers Tour.

28
00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:48.005
Now, if I want to look up a tour by a tour package

29
00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.008
in here I provide the code equals BC,

30
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.008
which is Backpack Cali.

31
00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:58.002
So that's going to fetch just the Backpack Cali tours.

32
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:02.007
Next let's create a rating.

33
00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:06.009
In the body of that I'm sending a JSON string.

34
00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.009
The score is five, the comment was, I thought it was okay.

35
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.001
and the customer ID is eight,

36
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:19.000
and this would be for tour with the ID equal one,

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.006
send that post method and let's see,

38
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.008
the results was that that was created.

39
00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.007
Now let's look up a rating.

40
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:31.007
Let's call the tours/1/ratings API,

41
00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:36.004
which will get all the ratings for tour one.

42
00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.005
And there's the one we just created.

43
00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:44.007
Let's get the average score for a tour.

44
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.006
And the average score was five.

45
00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:49.007
And let's update a rating with the put verb.

46
00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:55.000
So we're going to update the tour rating,

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.001
have customer four who thought it was not that great

48
00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:03.009
and a score of one.

49
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:06.003
This has been a very quick overview

50
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:09.001
of our starting point code base.

51
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.002
If you have access to the exercise files,

52
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:13.002
I really encourage you to take the time

53
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.009
to familiarize yourself with it.

54
00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:19.001
Good developers are always looking to improve their code.

55
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.001
So, developer, we know this is not production ready.

56
00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:24.000
How can we do better?
