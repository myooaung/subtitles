00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Mary] Are you read to graduate

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.070
from coding simple demos to writing real applications?

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.060
We'll start with a basic Spring Boot Microservice,

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.010
then elevate it to a production-ready application

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.010
employing standards of quality,

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.040
security, persistence and deployment.

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.040
I'm talking about external databases with schema versioning,

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.060
secured APIs, progression test coverage

9
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.080
and application delivery with Docker.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.090
Hi, I'm Mary Ellen Bowman.

11
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.050
I'm a senior job developer

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.060
and I regularly employ these standards

13
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.070
when creating solutions.

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.000
If you are up to the challenge,

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.010
then I invite you to join me on this learning journey.

16
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.000
So let's go!
