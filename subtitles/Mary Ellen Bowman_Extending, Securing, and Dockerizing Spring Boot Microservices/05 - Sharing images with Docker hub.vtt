00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] Docker Hub is a primary

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.040
Docker image repository,

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.010
similar to Maven Central with JARs.

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.090
I'm gonna demonstrate how to upload and share

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.020
images with the world.

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.020
This is my Docker Hub account.

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm logged in at hub.docker.com and my Docker ID

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.000
is mellenbowman.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.020
If you wanna follow along with these exercises,

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.050
you'll have to create your own Docker Hub account

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.060
and you would use your own Docker Hub ID

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.040
through the steps.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.080
So looking at my dashboard,

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.030
I see that I don't have any repositories.

15
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.040
So this is a empty dashboard, there's nothing in here.

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.060
So we're gonna actually add a Docker image to it.

17
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.070
So going to the command line,

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.050
first of all, I need to log into Docker on the command line.

19
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.090
And I put in my own personal Docker ID,

20
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.010
and my password.

21
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.040
And I'm logged in.

22
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.050
Next, I need to get the image ID of the

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.010
explorecali default image.

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.050
So I've removed all the other images

25
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.070
except for the explorecali default,

26
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.080
which just interacts with an H2 database, it's standalone.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.050
And I get the image ID.

28
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.020
Now I need to tag that image.

29
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.040
Using that ID.

30
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.010
And now I'm going to cite my Docker ID,

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:59.050
and give it a repository.

32
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.080
Now let's take a look at our images.

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
And we see that I have a new image

34
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.050
with a new repository path,

35
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:28.060
and now let's push it up to Docker Hub.

36
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.050
So it says it's pushed, let's go back

37
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.070
to my dashboard,

38
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.010
and see repositories, and there is my image,

39
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.020
uploaded to Docker.

40
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.060
Now let's actually try to run a container

41
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.030
off of that remote image.

42
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.080
Let's clean up the screen a little bit.

43
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.070
And now we're going to actually make sure that

44
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.060
there are no explorecali default images

45
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.060
to prove that what we're doing is remote.

46
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.020
So I'm going to

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:19.000
remove image

48
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.070
so that mellenbowman image is gone,

49
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:32.080
now let's actually remove the explorecali default image.

50
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.040
So that image is no longer there,

51
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.010
and let's make sure that our containers are clean.

52
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.050
So the only container we have is a local MySQL,

53
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.090
which we're not even going to interact with anyway.

54
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.090
Now we can manually, via a Docker command,

55
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.010
pull down that mellenbowman/explorecali-docker image,

56
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.060
or we can just run the container,

57
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:11.050
and the image is downloaded automatically.

58
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.040
So we're going to create a container

59
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.030
called ec-app-default, publish it on port 8080,

60
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.010
and we're going to reference the image up on Docker Hub

61
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:31.000
with the path mellenbowman/explorecali-default.

62
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.030
So it couldn't find it locally,

63
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.020
it's pulling it down,

64
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.010
and it's created the image locally,

65
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.070
and we can actually look at that.

66
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.060
So there's the local image now.

67
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.040
And now let's look at our containers.

68
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.090
And we have a container called ec-app-default

69
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.040
off of our container we created on Docker Hub.

70
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.090
And now let's actually interface with it

71
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.070
and access the tours to prove it works.

72
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.050
And it does.

73
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.020
This same pattern can be repeated

74
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.090
for the MySQL and Docker Spring profiles,

75
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.050
but you have to make sure the database container

76
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.040
is up and running, but this is just a very simple example

77
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.010
of how to use Docker Hub.

78
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.090
Like I said, if you want to do this on your own,

79
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.090
you need to create your own Docker Hub account

80
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.000
to interface with it.
