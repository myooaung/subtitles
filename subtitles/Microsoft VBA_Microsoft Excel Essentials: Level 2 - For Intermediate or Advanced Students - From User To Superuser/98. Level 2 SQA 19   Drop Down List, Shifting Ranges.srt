1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Okay,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:02,750
guys.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,500
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,880
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:06,460
Lecture.

6
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,990
Now,

7
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,690
this questions from Raymond on what Raymond says is I'm looking for a conditional look.

8
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:11,960
Awful.

9
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,450
A couple in index match,

10
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,820
which uses a drop down list of sorry,

11
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,380
which uses a drop down list.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,950
Look up values query values in different columns.

13
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,220
So basically,

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,930
what we have is a front sheet that looks something like this.

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,360
And this is a drop down list here on this drop down.

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,310
This is access in this range or this range.

17
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,430
All this range on what we want to do depended on what we've selected in this drop down list

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,690
is pull the data from either this range here or this range here.

19
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,250
All this range here and on and on and on all the way across.

20
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,450
So basically a drop down list,

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,350
and then we want to pick either This data set this data set all this status set.

22
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,820
Now we look to name ranges in level two of the course on.

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,370
We've also looked at indirect on What we're going to do is use the indirect function toe,

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,340
actually change which range we're looking at.

25
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,840
So it's just another way of doing it.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,970
So let me show you how that works.

27
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,720
Okay?

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,040
So you'll find two downloadable Resource is from this for this lecture and now called level

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,830
two sq.

30
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,560
A 18.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,750
Drop down list shifting range before Andi after.

32
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,780
So we have three sheets.

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,170
We have a summary sheet.

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,320
We have a data sheet,

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,280
and I've just cobbled this together and we have four data ranges.

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,400
We have this one here.

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,190
Fergie One.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,190
This one here.

39
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,950
Fergie to this one here.

40
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,360
Fergie.

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,490
Three on this one here for G four.

42
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,650
Obviously these Congar go on and on and on and on and on over that.

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,700
Now we have the dates stand the side.

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,720
I've just used February randomly on.

45
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,510
We have lists and their ranges.

46
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,030
And one of them in here is off.

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,160
Added these headings because we're going to use a V look up to find out what this range

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,380
actually say's so here of type G one G two through G four,

49
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,140
which is the heavens across here and in here.

50
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,570
I've put be three to e 17 which is this range in here.

51
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,400
I've just hoped F three toe 0 17 which is this range just here.

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,730
Start to odor.

53
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,110
Or I should say I they go.

54
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,350
That's not paying attention.

55
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,140
And then we have J six toe m 17 have been a make sure that that's right.

56
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,470
A J three to m 17.

57
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes,

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,050
a J three.

59
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,370
I'm really not on the ball this morning,

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,070
asshole.

61
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,770
And n 32 Q 17 Let's make sure we got that one right.

62
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,510
And 32 q 17 Absolutely.

63
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:42,950
OK,

64
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,610
so here,

65
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,360
we're gonna do is I'm gonna create a drop down list across the top.

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,640
Actually,

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,890
I'm just gonna grab those Helling.

68
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,260
So date is going to be a constant on.

69
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,340
They will be the heading.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,380
So I'm just gonna paste that into here and across the top here.

71
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm gonna add a drop down,

72
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,830
so I'm just gonna come back to home.

73
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,100
Hit.

74
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,150
Merge in center.

75
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,500
Back over to data data validation.

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,290
My screens A bit small,

77
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,350
but it's in the data tool section of the data menu.

78
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,210
I'm gonna come here to data validation.

79
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,340
Data validation.

80
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,850
I'm gonna allow list on gonna no point to this list just here.

81
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,990
So that's released.

82
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,020
Hit.

83
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,280
Enter the Nobel to pick G one g two G three or G for that's the first thing.

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,680
Next thing I want to do is grab all of these states here,

85
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,750
control and see and just drop them in here.

86
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,640
Now,

87
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,450
the next thing I want to do is I'm gonna get the construction of looking at another cell.

88
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,160
So just randomly over here,

89
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm just going to type equals on dpoint to our data.

90
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,340
Just gonna point to that one there so we can see that if we click back in this cell,

91
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,640
this is what it looks like.

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,090
I normally do this because whenever use in directs,

93
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,060
I can never remember where the exclamation points go.

94
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,460
So this is really an aide memoire.

95
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,230
More for my benefit than yours.

96
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,120
So what we're gonna say here is equals.

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,350
They look up open rackets and we're going to be looking at this cell here now.

98
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,320
My f all was playing up earlier.

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,590
No,

100
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,060
it's good.

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,940
So we're gonna look up this cell here,

102
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,570
comma.

103
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,380
So we're looking a G one,

104
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,090
and what we want to get is that range just there.

105
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,870
So this is our dates table.

106
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,570
I'm going to return the value from column two comma to calm a false and a better absolute

107
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,900
cell reference those.

108
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,500
So if my at four works,

109
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,090
there we go F four and F four and enter groups of miss something common to Okay,

110
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,610
Mr Commoners.

111
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:39,950
There.

112
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,160
Okay,

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,830
and enter.

114
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,980
So now we get be three to eat 17.

115
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,380
Now,

116
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,900
what we want to do is get that data bit in before they're so what we're gonna do in front

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,120
is we're going to say data.

118
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,830
Exclamation point exclamation point.

119
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,410
Close crew.

120
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:55,930
It's on.

121
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,440
And so there we have data on D B three to E 17.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,570
And look what happens when we stick an indirect right in front of it in direct open rackets

123
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:07,570
.

124
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,260
Close brackets there.

125
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,620
Hit,

126
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,110
enter.

127
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,750
And that then populates everything from the G one section here.

128
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,370
This over to this range just here.

129
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,830
So on the third of February,

130
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,400
we should have six on on the 5th February.

131
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,660
We should have five,

132
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,830
and we certainly have.

133
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,470
But look,

134
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,810
what happens when we change the drop down list.

135
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,990
We can pick G two on.

136
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,510
We get a totally different data sets.

137
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,280
So now on the ninth of February,

138
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,880
we have seven in our second data set,

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,450
and they can see that's that.

140
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,930
So that's a very useful way of pulling ranges by a block,

141
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,550
and you can just use a drop down.

142
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,150
You can have as many of these as you want,

143
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,000
and you may find it actually easier if you just hope the cell ranges into a look up and use

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,850
that construction.

145
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,630
Okay,

146
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,570
I hope that helps.

147
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,650
And as always,

148
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,780
if you have any questions,

149
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,920
do let me know and I'll be happy to help.

150
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,500
Have a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.
