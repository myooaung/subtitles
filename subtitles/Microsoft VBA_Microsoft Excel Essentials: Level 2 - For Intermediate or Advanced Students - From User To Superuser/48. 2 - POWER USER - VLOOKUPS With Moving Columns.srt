1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
Okay,

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:02,770
guys,

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:02,950
um,

4
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,030
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:04,230
Now,

6
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,970
technically,

7
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,090
this is a student.

8
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,010
Questions answered video,

9
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,220
But as it sits so nicely within the V Look up section.

10
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,800
This is where I'm going to post it now and not asked an absolutely brilliant question.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,230
Now we know the V.

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,420
Look,

13
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,620
it's very straightforward to you.

14
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,110
So here's a very simple data set.

15
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,650
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say Andi,

16
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,750
Hey,

17
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,140
I don't just going to write a quick V look.

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,710
Upset equals we look up open brackets.

19
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,600
Someone will look there,

20
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,190
Comer.

21
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm just going to say I will look in the whole of a B and C and I want to look for hair

22
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,310
collect,

23
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,160
which is column two comma,

24
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,780
False,

25
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,480
Fantastic.

26
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,660
So we can see the Andy just like me is bold.

27
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,350
But what happens if I insert another column just here?

28
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,920
You can see that this fails because it's looking for column to,

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
but there's actually nothing in Column two,

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,490
so let's just undo that there.

31
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,120
Similarly,

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,020
what happens if we cut here on?

33
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,990
We insert the cut cells here.

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,430
Now.

35
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,150
We were looking for hair color,

36
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,670
but now we have Aikawa because eyes is now a column,

37
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,130
too.

38
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,340
So if you've got a bunch of complicated V lookups But someone say's Hey,

39
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,260
can you insert a column or actually,

40
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,310
can you change the data set so that the columns appear in a different order?

41
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,750
Then V look up in its native form Doesn't cope with this Well,

42
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,970
so let me,

43
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,400
let me let me just copy that down for a second.

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,100
But what we want to do is change this to here to a match formula.

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,810
So we're going to say,

46
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,790
match over brackets,

47
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,220
open quotes and we're looking for hat.

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,760
And I am gonna close the brackets.

49
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,460
I am going to be looking in the whole of Rome warm,

50
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,080
So I'm just going to double click the left click with one comma,

51
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,680
and I'm gonna look for an exact match sense.

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,930
Type zero and hit Enter.

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,430
So we still get the same answer.

54
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,250
But now look what happens if I insert a column here.

55
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,860
This fails because it's looking in Column two.

56
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,590
But this has used the match function to find hair on realize it's no column three.

57
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,550
So we retain on set off bold,

58
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,000
no,

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,920
similarly just undoing that if we decided to change the column order on.

60
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,670
We went,

61
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,250
say cut and then we insert the cut cells here.

62
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,560
You can see that the first formula is still looking at Colin,

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,840
too,

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,020
but it's no pulling Brown because it's looking at column to which is now eyes.

65
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,150
But this called this formula.

66
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,940
It's still looking for hair,

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,570
regardless of where hair now appears.

68
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,530
So that's a really clever way to dynamically build your V lookups.

69
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,900
So even if you change the column order or insert or delete cells,

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,480
it will still work for you.

71
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,190
Okay,

72
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,570
that was a great question.

73
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,560
I let so thank you very much indeed.

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,070
On.

75
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,510
I'll see you in the next lecture.
