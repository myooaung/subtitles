00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:06,720
Hi, and welcome back to another student questions and select j.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,520
Now this question is from Dylan,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,429
and in essence it's a fairly simple question,

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,820
but there are a few literally moving parts in it.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,910
And I thought it was, it was worth doing this video to

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,415
walk you through the process that are used to build the formula.

7
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:24,860
So this is basically a mockup of the dataset that Dylan has.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,170
The original dataset is much larger,

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,030
has many rows, many columns.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,085
Now, it's a simple function.

11
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,105
It's just an average.

12
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:33,620
Actually it's an absolute average,

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,770
but we'll forget the absolute path is just an average function,

14
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,290
but it could just as easily be a sum function or

15
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,785
any other function that you use mathematically in Excel.

16
00:00:42,785 --> 00:00:47,045
And then the interesting part about this is the way the data is laid out.

17
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,370
So what we have is iodine,

18
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,210
A1 dies and then some function performed on this,

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,505
some calculation that gives us this answer.

20
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:58,145
And this, and this gives us this answer.

21
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:02,480
Now what we want to know is the average of all of this for dataset.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,645
But we also want to know that for dataset B,

23
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:08,210
the problem being we don't know

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,215
which column dataset I lives in and which column date set B lives in,

25
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:17,525
or C, or D, or E. So we need to find a way to capture that dynamically.

26
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:20,930
So the one thing that we do need to do to make a manual adjustment

27
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,409
is give us something to look for that unique.

28
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,410
So we called this diff I,

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,500
instead of just if we would be able to look for that in row

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,970
two and then find out that we're in column F. And similarly,

31
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:40,565
if they said DEF B will be able to look for that in row to find that it's column i,

32
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:44,640
and then use this date says it's as the first dynamic passed.

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,570
Second dynamic parties, although all the data points begin at row three,

34
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,345
they don't necessarily end on the same row.

35
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,945
So rather than saying, Actually I've worked out it's in column F.

36
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:58,990
So look at F3 to 14.

37
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:04,540
That's great, as long as every other dataset finishes at line 14, but they don't.

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,390
So that's our second dynamic part.

39
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,420
Okay, so I put together a very simple spreadsheet with the bare minimum of data,

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,055
but the format is same.

41
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:18,100
So our headings divide if bait, if say R,

42
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,260
m rotate the first night sets in F,

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,610
secondary datasets in I,

44
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,945
third datasets in our,

45
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:24,460
and they're all different lengths.

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,320
So we have four, we have nine,

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,585
and we have two over here.

48
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:30,430
So I'll show you the formula,

49
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,505
which looks absolutely monstrous.

50
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:36,610
But basically, it's a really simple formula.

51
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,405
All it is is a string that we've built dynamically.

52
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:44,020
We're going to use the indirect function to tell Excel.

53
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,575
This is actually a data range rather than just a bunch of letters and numbers.

54
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:50,665
And then we're just going to slap an average around and it's,

55
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,555
it's really as simple as that.

56
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:54,040
So the first thing today,

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,140
and the first thing I always do is I just started

58
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,180
the formula as it would normally appear.

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,085
So the amine row a,

60
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:03,535
so this is the average I want to get 4.5.

61
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:09,630
And for B, I would say equals average open brackets come here.

62
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,315
Select the data for b,

63
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,580
which is a different length to the data for a

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,595
close brackets his aims at Lego and 0.33c, right?

65
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:19,610
That is what we're trying to get to, that is the answer.

66
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,690
And then the elements of this that we're looking for is this path.

67
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,910
And this is what we need to build.

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,885
We need to know where we're looking, which Sheets spill.

69
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:35,945
Ioc type, something wrong where my I forgot to take the heat off they go.

70
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,340
That's what we're trying to get it say.

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,785
So for rho a and that's what we're gonna be looking at for dataset B.

72
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,225
That's what we're gonna be looking at.

73
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,400
How we can see by looking at this,

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,655
that most of it is exactly the same model.

75
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,510
The sheets is always the same.

76
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,380
So we can hard code that the apostrophes at the beginning, I'm sorry,

77
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,700
at the beginning and the end of the sheet name constant,

78
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,740
the exclamation point constant,

79
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,755
lesser f, i is dynamic.

80
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:06,919
So we need to be able to capture that three is constant.

81
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,530
We can hard code that coulomb standards separator for Arrange, hardcoded the lessor,

82
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,340
again dynamic and the row number where we finish

83
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,765
needs to be dynamic to based on how many data points we have in that particular range.

84
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,790
So this is what we're trying to build.

85
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,855
And if we can make Excel gives us something that will display

86
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:31,370
exactly those letters and numbers and exactly those letters and numbers,

87
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,505
we can just say in direct, therefore Excel,

88
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:38,480
this is IRange and you should perform a calculation on sleep,

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,915
an average rammed it or resume and voila were all done.

90
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,810
Okay, so the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to find

91
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,735
out the column number of dif i.

92
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:50,300
So this is just a simple match functions.

93
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,770
All I've said is match.

94
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,785
Look at death and the value in R3.

95
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,390
So look for D.

96
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,730
If I look in mile the sheet,

97
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,850
look at row two and return an exact match,

98
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,370
and we can see the result is six.

99
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,465
So if we come over here,

100
00:05:05,465 --> 00:05:08,195
we can say 123456, they go.

101
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:11,165
So dif i appears in column six.

102
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:19,595
If I change that to be if b appears in column nine and we can see 6789, there's diff Bay.

103
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:21,995
So we know that that part works.

104
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:28,100
And it's only partly useful because we express a ranges with letters, not numbers.

105
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,870
So what we need to do is find a way to convert that six to F.

106
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,870
Now, I have coded this next section

107
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,870
in the level three parts of the course, the VBA coding.

108
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,600
And I've showed you how to do this with VBA code,

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,170
but I could honestly couldn't think of an application for this until

110
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,940
this question came from Dylan to include it in Excel as a formula.

111
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,525
So to find out which column lysate six is,

112
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:57,425
we're going to combine two functions, the addresses, substitutes.

113
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,480
And just so you understand each element of that,

114
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,385
I'm going to take you through step-by-step.

115
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:03,905
So the address is a really simple function.

116
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,695
Or you going to say with the address three arguments.

117
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:08,780
The first one is, what's the row number?

118
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,520
We're going to say it's row one.

119
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,020
What's the column number?

120
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,360
We know it's six or I've just typed six.

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,250
And then we want the return type.

122
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,290
And the return type is basically z,

123
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,940
the absolute, absolute, relative,

124
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,800
relative, absolute or relative.

125
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,110
And we're just gonna say for relative.

126
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,175
So now we know that the cell dessert row one,

127
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:31,085
column number six is F1.

128
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,920
But the elements of that that we're interested in is the f,

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,735
We didn't really care about the one.

130
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:38,165
So now we're just gonna have substitutes.

131
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,355
And what you do with Substitute is you say,

132
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,200
look at this, find this,

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,430
replace it with this.

134
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,884
There the three arguments.

135
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:46,385
So for this one we're saying,

136
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,770
Look at age 11, F1,

137
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,410
look for one, replace it with nothing,

138
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,285
therefore, giving us f,

139
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,010
That's the substitute part.

140
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,390
And when we put them together,

141
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,430
we say substitute address,

142
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,565
row one, column six type for F1,

143
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:05,540
remove the one, replace it with nothing gives us f. So now

144
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,620
we can dynamically capture which column wherein, okay?

145
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,095
Obviously we can't say sakes because it will vary depending on whether it's stiff or not.

146
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:20,720
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this formula where we got the answer of six.

147
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,395
And we're going to replace the six here with that formula from here.

148
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,720
So this is completely dynamic.

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,460
So if I change that to be,

150
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,395
this changes to I,

151
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:36,155
if I change it to see it changes to L.

152
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,224
So that's perfectly dynamic.

153
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,870
So we use that F part more than once.

154
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,115
We use it here.

155
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:45,905
If you can say, and we use it here.

156
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:50,120
And then the other thing that's constant is that the star rho of three.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,350
So we can take this formula and how do we turn f into f,

158
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,560
x3, we say, and three.

159
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,255
Now we have the start point.

160
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,069
And then we also have a colon.

161
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,755
And we also have another F or

162
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,980
l or whatever lecture it was dependent on where you look at.

163
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,900
So this, we can also take this formula and just build it up a little bit more.

164
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,620
So we took the formula F3 ADA colon,

165
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,855
and then repeat the f part of the formula.

166
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,955
So now we have F32,

167
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:23,525
f something, and this is the last dynamic path.

168
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:27,365
So we need to know how far down that column we need to go.

169
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:29,840
And this is just a simple Kansas.

170
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,750
Kansas I looks for non blank cell.

171
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,435
So as we're actually looking at a tough, I'm going to look at f.

172
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:40,535
And they sentence. So we have five non-blank cells.

173
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,385
Now, obviously, we have a blank row at the top.

174
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:47,134
So an actual last ITA points is on row six.

175
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,945
So how do you get from five to six?

176
00:08:50,945 --> 00:08:51,995
You add one.

177
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:56,150
So they go. Now we know that the data point for this ends at six.

178
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,630
If it was B, o is hard-coded. Ignore that.

179
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,670
No, we know we have F32,

180
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,425
f something out now we know how far down the column we have to go.

181
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:10,745
So what we need to do is tag this on to the end of this,

182
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:12,890
and that will give us F32,

183
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,220
F6 and as our last fall, last formula.

184
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,050
But it's not always Column F. So sometimes it's going to be Column F,

185
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,030
Sometimes it's going to be column i.

186
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,940
So we need to replace this part of

187
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,990
the formula with something dynamic that we've already worked out.

188
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,585
How to find out the f value.

189
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,995
Whoops, it's escaped.

190
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:36,380
So here, let me move down one.

191
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,205
We're gonna use that can tie formula to get the number six.

192
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:44,810
And then we're just going to tank this counter a formula as bicycle in this formula here,

193
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,030
we're going to tack it onto the end of this.

194
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,090
So now we have this and it looks monstrous,

195
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:55,715
but it's all those other elements just built up an F32, f something.

196
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:58,265
And now we've dynamically captured number six.

197
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,645
So that goes at the end.

198
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,145
So that's our formula,

199
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:04,100
F32, F6, perfectly dynamic.

200
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,960
And when we change it, It's a b,

201
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,360
it becomes I3 to IE 11,

202
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,755
which is exactly right.

203
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,300
And when we change it to c,

204
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,399
it becomes L three to L4,

205
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,735
which is exactly right.

206
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:17,195
So that's the hard part done.

207
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:20,135
The next part is we just need to add the constant,

208
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:22,220
which is the apostrophe,

209
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,655
my other sheet, apostrophe exclamation points.

210
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:30,095
And that really is just as simple as typing milder sheet, sorry,

211
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:35,390
open quotes, apostrophe, milder sheet, apocryphally, exclamation points.

212
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,110
And the formula we have just an there into,

213
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,120
that is our dataset,

214
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,650
that is our range.

215
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,390
Now, at the moment this is just a bunch of symbols and capital letters,

216
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,405
lowercase letters, spaces, and numbers.

217
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:53,480
And to excel at means nothing other than that.

218
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,335
So to make this into a range that Excel can actually perform a function on,

219
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:01,580
we need to wrap it in an indirect and that's really simple to do.

220
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,535
You type equals in direct,

221
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:08,885
open brackets, sticky formula in closer brackets, and you're done.

222
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,285
So, and that's what we've done just here.

223
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:15,140
So here we've taken the formula that we've just written.

224
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,920
We've said indirect and we close the brackets around is.

225
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,700
So now all we need to do is choose which function we want to use.

226
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,040
So here we're going to say average in

227
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,560
direct calculation we've just built here that gives us that string and hit enter.

228
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,630
And they go, we get 4.5 and we can copy that down, and we get 9.33.

229
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,660
And we can copy that down and we get 75.

230
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,060
And now, because it's completely dynamic,

231
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,560
we can come back here and we say,

232
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,550
actually we don't want 14 in there and hear the answers

233
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,690
go much further down than they ever did before.

234
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,640
And come back here,

235
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,010
you can see that answers have changed.

236
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,050
So that's how you do it.

237
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,935
It looks like a monstrous formula.

238
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:01,445
It looks like a monstrous formula to me and I wrote it,

239
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,305
but it's actually really simple.

240
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:08,914
It all hangs around being able to build something that looks like that with a formula.

241
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:13,700
And we can do that by using the match to find the column letter at column number,

242
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,840
using the address and substitute to convert the number to a letter.

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,145
And then we just use Camtasia to find out how far the data goes down.

244
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:25,310
And we just stick all those little elements together,

245
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,880
rapid up in an indirect and then wrap them up in

246
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,840
an average or a sum or whatever function you want to use.

247
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,970
Hopefully that was helpful.

248
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,080
It's a lot to take in,

249
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,270
but you can watch it as many times as you like.

250
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,280
And as always, if you have any questions,

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,325
do let me know and I'll be happy to help have a great day.

252
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,660
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
