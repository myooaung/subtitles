00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
Okay,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.220
guys up to know we've used the name box to name on named Rangers.

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.300
But there is another way of doing it now.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.080
What we could do is we could highlight this section just here and use this as the name of

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.600
our named range on.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.720
Have this actually be the named range.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.250
So I'm just going to highlight Apple Danto apricots on drag across that I'm gonna come to

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.900
formulas and then I'm gonna hit in this section defined names create from selection.

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.360
When I left quick that you can see what happens is we get this little box that pops up on.

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.560
We can see that top row is not being ticked,

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.090
but left column has so well that's going to do is take Apple Onda.

12
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690
Apply the name Apple to this cell.

13
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.940
It will take the name oranges on the play too.

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.650
They sell coconuts to their cell and so on so forth.

15
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.350
So when they hit Okay,

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.470
Uh,

17
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.650
nothing a parent has happened before.

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.680
Click up here.

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.600
I can no click apple and see that that is this cell.

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.550
I could click bananas and see that That's this cell I could click markup and said that's

21
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.200
this cell or I could click my first range and see that it's that entire cell.

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
So what we can do with that now if we want to know the price of apples?

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.180
Remember that apple?

24
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.420
Where's that apple?

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.800
Is this cell we could literally just I've equals apple and hit Enter and there you go.

26
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.210
Tent where the four matins wrong on that one.

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.520
So let's just change that to format and they go.

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.960
Apples are 10 p.

29
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.070
Oregon type equals oranges on oranges are 11 pay.

30
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.950
So there you go.

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.490
That's another way to create a named range there.

32
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.170
Just so you know how to do this,

33
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.390
I'm also going to show you how to get rid of named Ranges.

34
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.430
So we're going to go back to the formulas were going to come to name Manager,

35
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.420
and there you can see we have All of our range is defined here.

36
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.300
So Apple holds the value of 10 which is there on it refers to static named range is one

37
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.810
which is the name of the sheet on its absolute be absolute six.

38
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.030
No,

39
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.950
to get rid of that,

40
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.630
I'm just going to hit,

41
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.150
delete,

42
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.270
hit OK and delete it.

43
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.590
So I'm also gonna delete apricots.

44
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.250
I'm gonna delete bananas,

45
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.050
and I'm gonna delete coconuts along and delete oranges.

46
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.910
And in the next lecture,

47
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.340
I'm gonna show you another trick.

48
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.150
So see you in the next lecture.
