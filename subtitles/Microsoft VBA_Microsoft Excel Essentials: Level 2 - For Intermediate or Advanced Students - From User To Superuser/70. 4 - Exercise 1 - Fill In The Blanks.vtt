00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Okay,

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.470
guys.

3
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.890
Thin there.

4
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.350
The next three lectures are not lectures as such,

5
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.780
but they are practice exercises,

6
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.580
so they're comparatively short.

7
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
And in each one,

8
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm just gonna describe the three tasks that you need to practice.

9
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.060
Okay,

10
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.810
The 1st 1 is fairly straightforward and should be fresh in your memory because we've just

11
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.290
covered it.

12
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:32.170
What I want you to do is recreate these high pollings for each of these cells here,

13
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.260
link into the appropriate cell that's detailed,

14
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.290
then the left hand side and modifying it.

15
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.270
So when you actually click the thing,

16
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.350
it does actually work.

17
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.060
So there's your practice.

18
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.810
Exercise number one complete,

19
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.140
entering all of these values.

20
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.120
Just here.

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.130
Okay,

22
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.050
I'll see you in the next lecture where?

23
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.740
I'll tell you what your next practice exercise will be.

24
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.350
I'll see you in a few seconds.
