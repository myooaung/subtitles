1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
OK,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,750
guys.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,130
Now we're gonna build our third simple database screen.

4
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,060
So I'm just going to copy this one again,

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,380
just like we did before.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,900
I'm gonna create a copy and again move it in front of the HR file.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,440
So it appears just here,

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,700
so Okay,

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,660
simple database three.

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,070
Now,

11
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,640
what we have at the moment is in this file,

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,130
we have the employee number as the first column.

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,750
And in this file or this tab,

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,640
we also have the employee numbers.

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,540
The first column,

16
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,060
But in the new one that we want to look up from,

17
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,800
we don't have the employee number at all.

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,810
But we do have the national insurance number,

19
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,740
which is appearing in our H R file somewhere there.

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,250
Mega.

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,530
So what we're gonna do rather than use this cell,

22
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,170
just hear the employee number to pull the data through?

23
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,700
What we're going to use is a national insurance number to pull the data through.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,460
So I'm gonna do what we did before.

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,080
I'm just gonna flip to address is I'm gonna leave national insurance on because we've

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,850
already reported on that it's going to copy these cells,

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,340
so I'm just gonna hit copy,

28
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,980
flip back to database three.

29
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,250
And I'm gonna transpose those in here just like we did before.

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,500
Now we're gonna do exactly the same form,

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,650
and so it's very look up,

32
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,530
open brackets.

33
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,630
But instead of points into this cell,

34
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,070
we're gonna point to this cell because this is the national insurance number,

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,680
which is the first column in this tab.

36
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,350
Okay,

37
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,840
so again,

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,140
we want an absolute cell reference so we can happily drank the formula anywhere we want by

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,050
hitting F four.

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,770
So that gives us a dollar signs before the e on the full comma.

41
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:39,570
Now,

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,990
I'm gonna come to the address is on the national insurance numbers in our first column.

43
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,180
So I'm gonna select column a hold down shift away over to the end Whole control on.

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,950
Go down.

45
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,320
Hit F four because we're dragon.

46
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,490
This formula around,

47
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,870
we don't want this data terrible to drag around.

48
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:04,560
So we have absolute a absolute one to absolute f absolute to one comma now,

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,370
one of Paul address one which we can seize in the second column.

50
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,160
So I'm gonna hit two for the second column.

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,640
Come a false because he wanted exact match.

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,490
Close brackets Andi intact Now what we're gonna do a drug that formula down and then just

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,620
change the column numbers.

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,450
So we have column to here.

55
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,590
The next one,

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,920
we're gonna have column three in the next one will have column four,

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:38,150
and the next one will have column five on the post code or ZIP code.

58
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,790
Will be in column six,

59
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,230
in fact.

60
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,030
Weaken,

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,820
Enter.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,530
We can change that and call it post code.

63
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,660
Okay,

64
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,360
let's stick these where we want them to go.

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,390
So I'm gonna put on we've addressed one their dress.

66
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,180
I'm gonna put the country.

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,250
I think I put the postcode over here postcode country in drug these things that any way you

68
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,670
want them.

69
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:13,100
So just insert move down on D We'll have another space that and said move down and then

70
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,410
just pretty up the formatting.

71
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,150
And so I'm just gonna copy the formatting from here.

72
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,480
Pasted over there.

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,170
Andi,

74
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,380
I think these were bowled before,

75
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,950
so we made those bold actually changed address for two country.

76
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,370
Okay,

77
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,640
so there you go with we've no successfully managed to build a simple database using a

78
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,660
single V look up to populate this on this from here,

79
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,140
we've also used exactly the same look up to pulled different data from a different source.

80
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,430
The department structure aan den,

81
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,720
using a value that we've looked up.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,690
You using this?

83
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,390
We've no pulled all of this data from 1/3 source,

84
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,670
so hopefully you can see that you don't always need to look up from exactly the same value

85
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,670
.

86
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,750
As long as you have a single common element you can always use that to look up from.

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,290
So let's test this out.

88
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,120
So let's let's go to our first employee.

89
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,640
Who we can see is Kama Phillips on this.

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:25,650
Fulham's common comment Phillips and his national insurance on that is JT 590548 b So e M

91
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,020
column.

92
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,140
Phillips is definitely our first employee department struck chat groups missed that one

93
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,420
department structure.

94
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,170
He is the ease in the directorate,

95
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,260
and he is the CEO and he used the directorate in the use the C O.

96
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:39,800
Then,

97
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,950
if we look at addresses,

98
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,790
we can see that comma.

99
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:53,050
Let's roll all the way up or more to the point national insurance on that JT 590548 b,

100
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,230
which is exactly what it is lives at number one anywhere road.

101
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,330
And that's exactly what this is returned.

102
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,870
So if we looked at number two,

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,590
we can see that all of these things update.

104
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,940
And we are now what to anywhere Road.

105
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,940
So we can flip through any of these.

106
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,510
And the user just needs to slight one value,

107
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,960
and everything here will update on.

108
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
Everything here will update.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
So there you go.

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,250
That's Hey,

111
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,010
you build a multilevel,

112
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,280
simple database using Excel.

113
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,090
Okay,

114
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,450
See you in the next lecture.
