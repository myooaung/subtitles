00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
Okay,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.740
guys.

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:02.850
Um,

4
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.640
welcome back.

5
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.240
And they were gonna have a look at how to create gang chart using excels built in charting

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.960
tools.

7
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.410
Now,

8
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.370
to use the built in charting tools,

9
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.510
what we're going to need to do is add another column of data.

10
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.110
So what I'm gonna do over here in Collin de is I'm gonna add the duration.

11
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.920
So what we're gonna say for the duration is the end eight minus the start date.

12
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.470
And there you go.

13
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.380
We can see here that because we change the date of column cut comment.

14
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.980
Phillips kind of Philips only lasted seven days in our employment.

15
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.480
So now what I'm gonna do is click off.

16
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.090
So I am not in this day to set.

17
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.120
I'm gonna come up to the insert menu,

18
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.140
and I'm gonna come over to the chart section and I'm going to choose this little drop down

19
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.440
box right here.

20
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.150
And what I'm interested in is this second option,

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.730
the stacked bar chart.

22
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.910
So I'm just going to click that.

23
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.720
And here is our chart just contract that I was a little bit There we go now.

24
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.610
The next thing we need to do is to add some data into our chart.

25
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.510
So he's going to right Click on DMA,

26
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.770
choose select data a woman do here in the legend entries Siri's is Click add on here.

27
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.790
The Siri's name is going to be start date and in here I'm just going to delete that and I'm

28
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.880
gonna highlight or select from here down to the bottom and click.

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.460
OK,

30
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940
so may we have start date?

31
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.710
The next thing I do is click add again.

32
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.380
And this time the Siri's name is going to be duration some skin click on D one.

33
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.570
Come in here,

34
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.250
delete that.

35
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.670
I only click from D to on That is our generation.

36
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.340
So no,

37
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.540
we have start date and duration,

38
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.310
but we now have 12345 down here and that's not what we want.

39
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.440
So what we're gonna have in the horizontal category axis,

40
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.780
we're going to click edit on.

41
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.970
We're going to come up to here.

42
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.810
We're going to skip full name and we're gonna start straight out a to and come all the way

43
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.900
down and then I'm going to click OK on,

44
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.620
then we're going to click.

45
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.560
OK again,

46
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.420
Andi.

47
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.730
Wherever charges come,

48
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.250
they go there's our charts.

49
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.150
Little squished up at the moment,

50
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030
but there it is.

51
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.390
Now,

52
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.670
the one thing that you notice immediately about this especially doesn't look very tired.

53
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.030
And the other thing is that we have two bars in there,

54
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.890
a blue one on an orange one,

55
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.910
and also all the people there in reverse order.

56
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.460
So our very first person is common for lips yet on the charts.

57
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.020
And very last person is Connor Philip.

58
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.980
So what we're gonna do here is we're going to right click in this legend.

59
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.360
Where the names are we going to say format access on this little window here is going to

60
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.800
pop up?

61
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.120
No,

62
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.430
in this option,

63
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.940
the Axis options we're going to scroll down on,

64
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.850
we're going to say categories in reverse order.

65
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.170
And now Kama Phillips appears at the top,

66
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.450
and then we're gonna close that.

67
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.100
Okay,

68
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.800
so far,

69
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.320
so good.

70
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.770
So at least we have them in the right order now.

71
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.270
Now,

72
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.190
the next thing we want to do is we want to right click on one of the blue bars and what

73
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.200
we're going to do is say,

74
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.870
format data Siris on this time what we want to do is come over toothy Phil Andi line

75
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.430
section.

76
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.320
So I'm just going to click.

77
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.350
They're not gonna click No,

78
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.820
Phil,

79
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.830
And then I'm just gonna close that.

80
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.550
And when I click off,

81
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.990
you can see it's starting to take shape a bit.

82
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.200
Now,

83
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.780
at the moment,

84
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.960
you'll notice we have this huge gap over here where we have absolutely no data are little

85
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.410
guns.

86
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.620
Lines are appearing far over to the right with a load of dead space just here.

87
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.850
So what we need to do is change this axis to begin somewhere near the beginning.

88
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.240
Now,

89
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.830
to do that,

90
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.350
what we need to do is calculate what the smallest state in here is.

91
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.510
So just temporarily in F one I'm just gonna say equals small,

92
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.630
just like we did before on just choose the whole of that and I want to choose.

93
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.660
The smallest dates have gone K one.

94
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.480
So for 0186 now,

95
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.750
what we're gonna do is right.

96
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.050
Click Onley dates at the top.

97
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.830
We're going to choose format access.

98
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.460
And here where we have bounds,

99
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.900
we're going to change that to that value there.

100
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.470
So full 0186 Andi close on There you go.

101
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.340
That is a gang charter.

102
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.620
Cono,

103
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.140
delete that.

104
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.000
Okay,

105
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.930
so there you go.

106
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.870
That's how you create gown chart.

107
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.700
Using excels built in charting tools.

108
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.530
Personally,

109
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.260
I find this a little bit fiddly.

110
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.490
I know much prefer this method,

111
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.650
but it's entirely up to you.

112
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.750
Which one you use?

113
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.510
Okay.

114
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.050
I'll see you in the next section.
