00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
again.

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.880
Guys,

3
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.120
here we are with the new template there.

4
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.520
Locally,

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.920
this is an Excel spreadsheet,

6
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.670
so it's going to be very easy to deal with now.

7
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.540
What I've done is all the cells that we need to populate of Colored in Yellow on.

8
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.730
Then,

9
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.730
as we've dealt with them,

10
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.320
we're going to change them back toe white.

11
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.640
So we know that they're done.

12
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.080
So my name here is a constant.

13
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.180
That's nice and easy.

14
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.410
Something Just type my name in there A j consulting that will be a constant.

15
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.260
My assignment will be a constant.

16
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.890
The week ending is a data entry.

17
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.440
So we're going to hear equals.

18
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.370
We're gonna flip back to our data entry screen.

19
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.250
Let me just bring that up.

20
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.960
So it's nice unclear on we're gonna hit the date Andi hit,

21
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.190
enter and that's going to populate the date.

22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.630
Now,

23
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.740
the week starting,

24
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.860
we can see is already a formula which basically say's reference cell I six,

25
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.870
which is this one here the week ending and subtract for so that's going to take us from the

26
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.590
Friday back to the Monday So all these have done so I'm just gonna change the thing back to

27
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.290
white these have done so I'm gonna change these back to white and they're these air the

28
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.300
next ones that we need to deal with.

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.550
Now,

30
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.710
these are hours and minutes expressed as decimals.

31
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.110
So instead of seven hours and 30 minutes,

32
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.590
we haven't expressed to 7.5 all the way across on the same without some over here.

33
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.170
If we look back at their data entry screen,

34
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.310
we can see that we don't actually have anything here that's going to allow us to do that.

35
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.980
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna have another calculation section just over here of

36
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.450
just narrowed that screen.

37
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
So narrowed that column just so we can have a little bit of a separator.

38
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.940
And here,

39
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.510
firstly,

40
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.840
we're gonna work out what the full hours are.

41
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.400
So we're just going to fall.

42
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.600
There was Excel as a really quick way of working out for hours.

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.210
Now,

44
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.510
I'm just gonna on highlight that because that's not the cell that we're looking at.

45
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.860
Someone's gonna put no film.

46
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.640
We're gonna actually be looking at this column here,

47
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.090
which is our payable hours,

48
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.150
because that's what we want to report some.

49
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.150
So I'm just highlighting that so I can see which sell it is that I'm gonna be referencing

50
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.440
and to work at the full hours from that cell over here.

51
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.970
The seven hours and 30 we just there equals type hours.

52
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.830
Sorry.

53
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.130
Type our open brackets and click the cell that we want to have a look at and then closed

54
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.860
brackets.

55
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.550
And you can see that Excel is converted seven hours and 30 minutes into seven.

56
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.350
So I'm just going to send to that and then copy it all the way down.

57
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.070
Okay,

58
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.740
so now we worked seven hours,

59
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.480
seven hours,

60
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.230
seven hours,

61
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.940
eight hours,

62
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.010
seven hours on its ignoring the minutes.

63
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.550
Ignore,

64
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.910
in fact,

65
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.900
on delete that one.

66
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.940
That was because we haven't changed the format in two square brackets on the hours eso.

67
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.640
The next thing we want to have a look at is how many full minutes did we work?

68
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.840
So,

69
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.540
full colton,

70
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.560
enter minutes.

71
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.810
That's all.

72
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.240
Four month,

73
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.130
That one the same way.

74
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.270
So full delete off.

75
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.940
Enter four hours,

76
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.740
four minutes,

77
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.000
and it's just sent to those other.

78
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.140
What?

79
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.850
Nice and pretty on.

80
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.840
It wouldn't surprise you to know that to work out the minutes as we worked out the hours we

81
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.550
typed our to work out.

82
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.530
The minutes we type equals millet.

83
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.270
Andi,

84
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.340
open records on we'll click this one which have highlighted so we don't click on the wrong

85
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.550
one.

86
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.110
Closed brackets hit,

87
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.130
enter and just copy that down and then you can see that it's no extracted the minutes from

88
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.030
each of these cells here on drop them in here.

89
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.750
So again,

90
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.950
what we're gonna do is just send to that.

91
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.160
Now,

92
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.050
the final thing we need to work out is what the decimal is.

93
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.540
So to work out,

94
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.950
the decimal is we're going to say equals.

95
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.770
We're going to say a total payable hours on this one's nice and simple.

96
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.890
We're going to multiply it by 24 because that's family hours during the day on when we hit

97
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.510
enter,

98
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.570
we can see that we get 12.

99
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.760
No,

100
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.090
don't worry about that for a minute.

101
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.420
That's because we're still on this custom formatting or we gonna do is click general format

102
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.640
in,

103
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.940
and that's going to change the 7.5.

104
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.530
So I'm gonna center that double click,

105
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:22.140
and there we have 7.57 point 57.75 which is exactly the format that we have in our expenses

106
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.800
sheet just over here.

107
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.350
So,

108
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.800
no,

109
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.750
I can click this cell and say equals.

110
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.380
Flip back to the data entry screen and say reference that cell his enter two equals.

111
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.750
Flip back to the data entry sheet on do that one.

112
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.710
And then so on the so forth,

113
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.290
all the way across until I captured all of those.

114
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.850
And l'm on the 3rd 1 hit.

115
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.830
Enter now on the 4th 1 Copy.

116
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.490
Hit.

117
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.360
Enter on.

118
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.080
That's the fourth Andi hit the fifth equals that I'm not gonna do sat in some because we're

119
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.590
not gonna work Saturday and Sunday.

120
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.700
But if you were doing Saturday and Sunday,

121
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.460
obviously that's where you would where you would add them in Andi here.

122
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.300
It's just a plain some,

123
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.610
and that works perfectly well.

124
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.190
So 38.25 hours.

125
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.270
Okay,

126
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.630
so that's how we convert time to decimals.

127
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.860
These are a special case,

128
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.730
so we'll come back to those last No,

129
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.850
this is the next area that we don't have populated.

130
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.310
Let me just make those white.

131
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.200
So we know that we've dealt with them background white.

132
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.250
Okay,

133
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.920
now,

134
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.260
these are gonna be new things that we need to look up.

135
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.020
So we'll have a look at how we enter that into our data entry screen in the next lecture.

136
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.670
See you then.
