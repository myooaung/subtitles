1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:03,030
guys.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,830
And welcome back Now,

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,500
technically,

5
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,460
this is a student.

6
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,980
Questions answered.

7
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,670
Lecture.

8
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,700
Technically,

9
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,400
it's a student question that I completely miss Red and answered,

10
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,460
I haven't said the actual question,

11
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:15,730
too,

12
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,490
but that's gonna live in level three.

13
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,700
Now it relates to bar charts.

14
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,490
Got sorry,

15
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,340
Gant charts.

16
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,900
So it lives perfectly at the end of this section.

17
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,920
What the actual question was,

18
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
What do I do if I have the same primary key or the same person,

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,920
name or store number in the list and I actually wants And they have different starting end

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,190
days?

21
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,150
How do I display that separately?

22
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,970
Well,

23
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,170
the solution to that one,

24
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,650
though it possibly could be done in formulas,

25
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,550
is much simpler in VBS.

26
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,190
I'm gonna cover that in level three.

27
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,020
So this is the question I miss read the romance trim,

28
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,070
but equally useful.

29
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,970
So I thought I would drop it in the here.

30
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,320
So the question I thought I read was,

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,810
how do I color in the bars and began chart in different colors due to different reasons.

32
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,370
So that's the question I'm going to ask on.

33
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,180
Suggest here.

34
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,630
So here's a downloadable file for you.

35
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,300
It's called Gan charts with different calls for different reasons.

36
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,910
And it's just a butchered version of the one we've been using in this section.

37
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:22,630
Now this is the data table as a modified version of the data table.

38
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,300
No,

39
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,900
Previously,

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,600
we had start dating column,

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,120
too.

42
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,210
An in Dating column three but now inserted this reason code column in column two.

43
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,710
So where we were looking for the Star DATING column two.

44
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,490
It's now going to be column three on we look for the In Dating column three is now gonna be

45
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,670
column for So that's our data set on.

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,510
We have three different reasons for the absence.

47
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,610
We have an annual leave.

48
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,770
We have poorly when we have on authorized.

49
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,350
Now here we go.

50
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,420
This is what we had before.

51
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,410
Just to recap.

52
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,240
We have some conditional formatting set here that says,

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,860
If either of our responses is zero,

54
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,370
that is,

55
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,690
there's a blank in this column or a logical test evaluates to false.

56
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,250
Then return zero on the conditional formatting for zero sets,

57
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,600
the text toe white so it's not actually visible in the gun chart.

58
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,630
Now what we also have is an onda a logical test.

59
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,650
Saint Andre V look up.

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,720
And this is just to evaluate the dates.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,650
Is the start date my data?

62
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,310
Three.

63
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:35,200
Less than or equal to this self And is the end date No column for greater than or equal to

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,920
this.

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,530
So what we're gonna do is we no need to evaluate 1/3 criteria and all three criteria need

66
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,540
is a criteria or criteria.

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,220
Who knows?

68
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,900
All three need to evaluate.

69
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,080
True for this.

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,560
On statement to return one.

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,930
So what?

72
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,490
I've been different.

73
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,150
I'm gonna delete everything open to the one.

74
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,450
I'm on a laptop on Windows Tank.

75
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,890
He's kicking in that stupid menu on the side X driving me mad.

76
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,990
So my apologies.

77
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,730
If that happens,

78
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,270
I'm just going to copy the first part on way out front.

79
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,230
I'm just going to pace it in and hit comma.

80
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,390
So now I have three tests.

81
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,530
The first s is the same as the second test,

82
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:25,150
but I'm now going to butcher that and look for that annual leave in Colin teasing the saint

83
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,070
on.

84
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,490
Do you?

85
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,740
Well,

86
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,540
leave on.

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,120
They go.

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,920
But I'm looking in column two for that.

89
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,960
So now logical test has three on statements that must evaluate true just calling to equal

90
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,640
annual leave on a day check on Column three and column for And if all that is good,

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,950
return one.

92
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,400
Now that's our first check for annual leave,

93
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,660
and I'm going to copy air within rice,

94
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,480
Open toothy if and copy.

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,360
So if those three Stamets a true returned one when we hit old and intact to give me a new

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
line it control of a on paste that in again.

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,860
But this time I want to return to I'm no looking for annual leave.

98
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,540
I am looking for poorly because that's another one of our categories.

99
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,640
I'm gonna come to the end on the hit control on D V whips meant it all turn into their

100
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,360
ultimate.

101
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,850
They go and here's our third test.

102
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,610
But this time I'm looking for Savva.

103
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:33,950
Look,

104
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,990
own or authorized.

105
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:45,890
So there are three Andi tests are three if tests each having three checks within the and

106
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,560
brackets.

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,210
So we're looking for annual leave on a date check.

108
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,170
And if all that's good,

109
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,970
return one.

110
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,390
If not come to our second logical test.

111
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,290
And again we're looking for are poorly on our date checking.

112
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,510
If those three evaluate to true returning to.

113
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,510
And finally we have the whips windows.

114
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,330
We have the final one,

115
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,660
which is unauthorized,

116
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,620
and the date check.

117
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,660
And if all that evaluates to true return three.

118
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,250
If none of those evaluates true return zero comma comma.

119
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,420
So your brackets,

120
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,980
brackets,

121
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,550
brackets,

122
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:27,170
brackets onda enter So the the the the formula looks quite formidable.

123
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,370
It's actually quite simple when you follow the process.

124
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,900
So we're gonna do is copy that down and I'm gonna copy that across.

125
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,060
Let me just delete that last column there.

126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,250
So now you can see nature see that we have some twos and we don't have any threes,

127
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,770
which is incredibly unusual.

128
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:51,410
So I've obviously got a typo in there somewhere on a misty I excellent it and I or Thor

129
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,770
rise control,

130
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,220
Andy Controlling.

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,020
Ah,

132
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,280
they go now we have twos and threes.

133
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,870
So the only thing that remains his first change the conditional formatting to give us

134
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,190
different colors for two on three.

135
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,290
So I'm gonna come up.

136
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,760
So here,

137
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,750
come up to conditional formatting and I'm going to come to new rule.

138
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,720
What I want to do is use a formula to determine which sells to format now,

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
in cell C seven.

140
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,450
So I'm literally just going to type in here equals C seven.

141
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,860
Ah,

142
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,260
equal C seven equals two.

143
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,430
And I'm gonna choose a format if we want to.

144
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,160
So hit in formats at the world slows laptop.

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,820
It will wake up any minute now.

146
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:43,390
I really owed this wakes of anyone in that early go eso we want to have Let's have let's

147
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,070
have a delicious green cause I'm gonna say green for the funds on a fill of green because I

148
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,750
don't want to be able to see them on battling once it say OK,

149
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,850
and I'm going to say OK,

150
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,110
okay.

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,520
And I most will do number three while I'm here.

152
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,910
So again,

153
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,260
I'm gonna say new rule.

154
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:08,620
Use a formula on hearing to say equals C seven equals three,

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,450
and I'm going to pick another color.

156
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,920
So for mass,

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,380
and I'm gonna have a fill of red this time.

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,790
I'm gonna have a fun color of red so you can't see the number against the background.

159
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,880
Okay,

160
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,060
Okay.

161
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,410
And knowing in a copy that and paste over the whole of this area just here.

162
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,960
I've always went like Barry white there.

163
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,170
So there you go.

164
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,780
So now you can have different colors for different reason codes.

165
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,300
I hope that was useful to you as ever.

166
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,780
If you have any questions,

167
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,050
just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

168
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,550
Have a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.
