00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,790
guys.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,690
Now we've added the conditional format into this range of cells.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,330
To pace it to the others is really simple.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,080
We're just going to highlight from seven down to 20.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,780
Hit double click the former painter.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,120
Click on Spragg ball,

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,330
drag over the same range.

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,110
Click on chicken salad,

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,130

drag over the same range over to move over a little bit of cottage pie.

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,930
Move over the same range on Shepherd's pie on,

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,620
move over the same range.

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,530
And there were completed when just hit the escape key.

16
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,840
And that will get rid of the conditional formatting from our format painter.

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,450
Okay,

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,160
so now we have a very clear list of what does appear on what doesn't appear in our list.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,080
So all of these appear now list on here.

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,560
We have Oregon.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,810
Oh,

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,520
which we're gonna copy on.

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,740
We're gonna flip back to here and add it to our ingredients,

24
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,960
Master and just paste special at the end.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,810
We also have spaghetti,

26
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,950
so we're gonna copy ingredients.

27
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,340
Master on pay Special At the end on the Mir.

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,120
We've done that one.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,400
They were going to do this and copy on Put to the bottom of our ingredients.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,970
Master,

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,660
I'm just going to carry on doing that until we get to the very end on.

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,070
I'll see you in a few seconds.

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,280
Okay,

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,470
here's our full list.

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,000
This is every item that we have listed in all of our recipes and then just click through

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
them all and see instantly that every single one of them is in wise.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,850
So everything matches something in our list.

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,050
So we just didn't come back to the ingredients,

39
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,620
master,

40
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,320
and we're just going to sort that alphabetically,

41
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
so sort Ater said.

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,640
And they know we have our list.

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:49,870
Now,

44
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,610
what we're gonna do is come back to the index on Dad.

45
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,400
Ever drop down boxes?

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,070
Okay,

47
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,230
what we're gonna do is select our first cell.

48
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,150
We're going to come to the data tab.

49
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:06,380
We're going to come to data validation and in our settings were gonna allow list on.

50
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,290

So we're going to say equals my list and hit Enter,

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,840

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,350
We have all the ingredients for all of our items.

54
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,990
So what we're gonna do is copy that on Pace it.

55
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,250
They're on board.

So there we have our five drop down boxes where we can pick our items.

59
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,690
Okay.

60
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,690
In our next lecture,

61
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,130
we're gonna have a look at building the formula that we need here to calculate which recipe

62
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,110
we have all the ingredients for.

63
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,770
