00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
Okay,

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.730
guys,

3
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.120
we're just going to step out from the normal laters for a second just to have a look at how

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.070
Excel deals with dates and times.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.580
Now,

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.960
set this spreadsheet up,

7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.750
which you condemn load from the resource is section on.

8
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.770
All I'm gonna do is have the exactly the same date entered in here.

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.370
I'm just gonna reference this cell in all of these cells on then reference this.

10
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.490
So in this cell in this cell now,

11
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.480
I've already formatted all these cells up here with the formats that you can see over here

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.480
.

13
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.560
So this one we can seize 25 dash December,

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.750
which is formatted as dd dash m m.

15
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.470
So,

16
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.080
if I were to reference that cell,

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.040
just know you can see that if we formatted the date as just d d,

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.170
we would get 25 because 25th is the day of the month.

19
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.210
So if I reference to sell above it,

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.480
you can see by using the format d d d.

21
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.860
We get some the abbreviated day for suddenly.

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.670
If I formatted it as four days,

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.200
you can see that we get the name in full surround insane some.

24
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.500
It's a Sunday,

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.680
and similarly,

26
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.380
when we apply the format M m m,

27
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.170
we get the abbreviated day for the month on.

28
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.100
Then when I format is as m M.

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.010
M m.

30
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.200
Four day four,

31
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.700
EMS,

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.550
we get beat months name.

33
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.000
We get the month name in fault.

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.450
Okay,

35
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.590
Now,

36
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.240
similarly,

37
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.590
we conform at it is why?

38
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.410
Why on we can see that we get 2000 we can see that we get 16 which is the abbreviated year

39
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.790
for 2016.

40
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.790
Or similarly.

41
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.680
We can have 2016 my type in four wise in the format in just so you clearheaded that works.

42
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.330
Let's just choose the format cells up.

43
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.270
She can see there that we've entered a custom formats of four wives that so you change the

44
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.630
formatted now in this cell,

45
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.840
it's formatted as four days,

46
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.420
so we'll get the full day name de de.

47
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.160
So we get the two digits of the monthly day number four EMS,

48
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.570
so we'll get the full month name and four wise.

49
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.560
So we get the full year name so they can see that the 25th of December 2016 is actually

50
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.880
some day 25 December 2016.

51
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.430
Now is the interesting thing.

52
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.850
This cell is formatted as a number with no decimal places so willing it's enter there.

53
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.080
You can see that we get the result of 4002.

54
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.390
Sorry,

55
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.350
42,000 729.

56
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.500
You may be wondering what 42,729 has to do with Christmas Day 2016.

57
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.030
Well,

58
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.530
that's because when Excel deals with dates,

59
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.590
it counts on each day after the turn of the century 1900.

60
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.230
So 42,729 is heavily.

61
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.380
Days have elapsed since the turn of the century in the ninth in 1900.

62
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.010
So if it just changed that there,

63
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.320
too the first of January 1900 you'll see that we get one because that's the first day of

64
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.280
the last century.

65
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.230
Is that last century?

66
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.490
I think it's the last century.

67
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.090
Eso Consequently,

68
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:26.120
if we went to the several 25th of December 1900 you can see that we have 360 days since the

69
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.430
turn of the century.

70
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.360
So they go,

71
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.860
you can see that That's the way the Excel uses dates.

72
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.790
So if we put today's date in,

73
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.610
which is the fourth of the 8th 2016 We're now 42,586 days from the turn of the first

74
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.250
century.

75
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.430
That sorry,

76
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.710
the turn of the last century first centric,

77
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.960
OK name similarly at below are formatted this cell to a number of game,

78
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.410
but this time to five decimal places.

79
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.680
So it's just reference that soul there.

80
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.660
We can still see that we have 42,000 586 but we have a bunch of decimals after its or a

81
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.780
bunch of zeros after it on.

82
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.920
That's because what we're actually looking at in this cell just here.

83
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.180
If let me let me just have one more in there.

84
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.390
Let's just say day they cash move off.

85
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.310
This year it was Taylor's minutes,

86
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.590
minutes on second group's second seconds.

87
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.380
So let me just copy that format in their copy on the plate,

88
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.190
this self using the form that sells custom and hopefully we can type it now.

89
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.830
Okay,

90
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.650
so now we just need to reference that self.

91
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.440
Okay,

92
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.860
so now we can see that we have the fourth of the 8th 16 0000 on.

93
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.060
That's because when you enter a date into excel by default,

94
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.700
it knows it to be midnight on that particular day so far to come in here and hit a space

95
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:09.520
and put 09 30 00 you can see that our number has actually changed to 42,508.

96
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:19.640
6.39583 That may straight strike you was out until we have a look at her Excel actually

97
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.950
deals with time.

98
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.950
Okay,

99
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.610
so over here,

100
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.940
I'm just going to be reference in this cell,

101
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.450
this e five cell,

102
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.160
and this time I'm gonna have a look at it in five decimal places.

103
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.560
So this particular cell here has been formatted to a number format with five decimal places

104
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.560
.

105
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.680
So let's just go ahead and reference that cell and we can see that that 1700 hours five

106
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:50.160
oclock in the afternoon is where talented 0.70833 Now the reason for that is that Excel

107
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.690
deals with time as fractions of days.

108
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.150
So if you have to change the time here,

109
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.760
it's a midnight.

110
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.510
You can see that we have a zero fraction of a day.

111
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.040
If I want to change it to mid day,

112
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.880
you can see that it actually deals with that as 0.5 with lows is a does occur in so half a

113
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.180
name.

114
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.190
Similarly,

115
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.980
if we were to type 6 a.m. we can see that that's course of a day.

116
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.450
So it 0.25 Oops,

117
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.160
too far.

118
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.340
And if I went to six o'clock in the afternoon,

119
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.990
you can see that we have 3/4 of the day s o.

120
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.120
It will work that out to lose and lose the decimal places,

121
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.440
depending on which time you entered.

122
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.720
And also it will go to the detail of having seconds calculated.

123
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.250
So if we said 07 a.m. at 40 minutes past on 55 seconds,

124
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:52.150
we can see that that is 0.30 to 03 off a day of a whole day.

125
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.790
Now the interesting thing Let me just have a look here.

126
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.560
Let's just check This is chance at like six am for a second,

127
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.830
we can see that we have quarter of a day at 6 a.m. Because course of the day has gone by

128
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.060
six oclock in the morning.

129
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.650
But if we actually have a look at that formatted as a date,

130
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.450
so this.

131
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.800
So here's for matters.

132
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.180
Dee dee dee dee Dash or space DD dash Mm mm.

133
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.040
And on and on.

134
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.660
And why,

135
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.920
Why,

136
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.160
Why?

137
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.520
Why?

138
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.420
So we have a Saturday,

139
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.770
the zero with of January 1900 at six o'clock in the morning.

140
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.760
And that's because when Excel deals with time,

141
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.630
not dates,

142
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.550
just time,

143
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:39.330
it actually assumes that all times on the zero with of January in the turn of the century

144
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.560
1900

145
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.880
So all of your times will be dated on a date that doesn't actually exist,

146
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.860
which is 00 January 1900 s.

147
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.010
Oh,

148
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.560
there's a curious fact for you.

149
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.070
So that's the My Excel deals with dates and times.

150
00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:01.500
Dates are always whole numbers or call numbers with a remain that if you enter time to.

151
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.500
So the dates came some from the turn of the Century 1900 which is why you get a peculiar

152
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.790
answer like 42,586 for the Fourth of August,

153
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:20.050
and time is always recorded if you only enter a time as the zero with of January 1900.

154
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.960
Okay,

155
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.420
there's one.

156
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.880
You can thrill your friends with the cocktail parties,

157
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.720
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
