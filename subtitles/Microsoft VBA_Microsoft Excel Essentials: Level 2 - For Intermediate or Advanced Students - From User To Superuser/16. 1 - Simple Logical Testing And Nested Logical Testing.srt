1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Okay,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,870
guys,

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,810
let's have a look at this range of cells just here.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,410
Now,

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,280
what we need to do is establish if we're out of the house but foot for between five and 10

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,070
hours a day,

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,370
we need to return a value of five.

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,530
And if we're out of the house from more than 10 hours a day,

9
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,180
we need to return a value off 10.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,180
OK?

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,510
No,

12
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,510
let's have a quick look at a simple,

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,280
logical test.

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,840
So in here,

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,420
I'm just going to type five on Dhere.

16
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,510
I'm gonna type our thirst.

17
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,100
Logical test Neurological tests will begin with if on there are a few different versions of

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,850
this is if if era And if an I was just going to stick with it for now,

19
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:45,460
we're gonna open our brackets and we can see here that it tells us our first argument is

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,520
the logical test itself.

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,200
So I'm gonna do is say that cell psychological test is going to evaluate so n 44 if it

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,030
equals five?

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,990
So that's our testers n 44 equal five hit a comma and there it says,

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,640
What value do you want to return?

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,520
If it's true?

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,580
and we're going to return a simple text entry that says Yes and texts entries are going to

27
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,630
go in quotes,

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,880
so I value,

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,840
if true,

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,510
is going to say yes and comment on now.

31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,630
Our value of false open quotes is going to be no.

32
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,400
And then when the closer brackets hit enter so we can see that logical Tests has looked at

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,520
this and says,

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,340
Does that sell equal five?

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,640
Yes,

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,230
it does therefore return.

37
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,670
Yes.

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,850
So if I put anything else in here,

39
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,050
it will say no.

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,170
Okay,

41
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,110
now we can make it little more sophisticated.

42
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,670
And what we can say is,

43
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,930
if n 44 not just equals five,

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,060
but we could save and 44 is less than or equal to five.

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,590
Return?

46
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,080
Yes,

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,560
on if it isn't less than or equal to five return?

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,870
No.

49
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,310
So let's have a look at that.

50
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,150
10 still evaluates to new five Silly valley rights to yes,

51
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,980
zero also evaluates to Yes,

52
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,600
because it's less than five.

53
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,450
OK,

54
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,240
nice and straightforward stuff,

55
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,530
then.

56
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,190
Okay,

57
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,160
now what we need to do first,

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
because remember,

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,310
we're dealing in time on excel expresses.

60
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,220
Time is fractions of days.

61
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,260
We need to know what five hours looks like as a number as a fraction of the day on.

62
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,750
We also need to know what 10 hours looks like it's a fraction of the day.

63
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,780
So over here,

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,360
just for now,

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,670
I'm just gonna type 05 double zero.

66
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,050
And that's five oclock all five hours.

67
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,490
A 0 10 double zero on,

68
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,030
mate.

69
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,380
And that is 10 hours expressed as time.

70
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,060
No,

71
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,210
no.

72
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,860
Just referenced these two cells on.

73
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,450
But this time I'm going to change these answers from custom formatting cause we're in time

74
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,240
to a general format,

75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,140
and I'm just going to make them a little bit wider.

76
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,060
So they go,

77
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,220
you can see that fire there was evaluates to 2.8333 and loser threes.

78
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,870
Onda 10 hours equates to 0.41 Loves sixes on a seven.

79
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,860
No,

80
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,940
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy those and pace over a special.

81
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,870
So we actually get the full number up here in the formula ball when we select to eat cell.

82
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,280
Okay,

83
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,660
Now we're gonna build our first simple,

84
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,900
logical test,

85
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,440
and they were just getting a little bit more complicated,

86
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,930
but still very straightforward.

87
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,350
So the first thing we're gonna do is say,

88
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,010
does this cell equal less than 10 hours?

89
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,420
So woman do For knows.

90
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm just gonna copy that answer for 10 hours by hitting control ones Say his escape.

91
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,780
Now I'm gonna come over here.

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,070
So I've now got the decimal value for 10.

93
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,830
There was 0.41 lives of sixes in a seven in the clipboards or Macey's equals.

94
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,790
If open brackets.

95
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,130
This cell,

96
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:54,330
because this is the time out of has on Monday is less than what?

97
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,720
I'm gonna just pace that number.

98
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,230
And they're so d 41 is less than 10 hours,

99
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,970
which is a decimal 0.41 blows a six isn't a seven,

100
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,430
then what I want to do.

101
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,270
If amount of the house for less than 10 hours is,

102
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,480
I want to claim £5.

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,070
So our values true is going to be five and no comma.

104
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,780
Our value,

105
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,680
if false,

106
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,600
is going to be 10.

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,740
I'm gonna close the brackets and hit,

108
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,490
enter and they go.

109
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:26,840
We can see that all of these control on right will evaluate to £5.

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,410
So far,

111
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,010
so good.

112
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,470
Now,

113
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,330
let's just check that that does work.

114
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,000
So if we said on Tuesday,

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,650
we traveled 100 miles,

116
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,020
that gives us a three hour and 20 minutes travel time each way on.

117
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,050
That does indeed evaluate Sam Pound so fantastic.

118
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,270
We worked out to pour out the house for more than five.

119
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,060
There was all less than 10 hours.

120
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,650
Give us a fiver on if we're at the house,

121
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,560
but for between five and 10 hours,

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,590
give us a fiver.

123
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,560
Fantastic.

124
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,430
Now,

125
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,020
the more issues among you will notice that there are three possible outcomes to this test.

126
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,040
If I'm out of the house for between five and 10 hours,

127
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,150
I claim a fiver,

128
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,670
if I may answer that has for over 10 hours,

129
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,700
I claim a tenner.

130
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,190
But the 3rd 1 is,

131
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,080
If I am entered the house for under five hours,

132
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,610
then all I can claim is zero because the only two things that actually pay are between five

133
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,130
and 10 hours or over 10 hours,

134
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,380
£5.10 pounds,

135
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,150
respectively.

136
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,580
So what we're going to do here is we gonna nest?

137
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,950
Another logical test inside the logical test we've already built it sounds more complicated

138
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,300
than it is So now we've already worked out what fire there was.

139
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,060
Looks like is a number on that Looks like 0.2833 threes and again,

140
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,960
woman do is I'm gonna copy that number on.

141
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm gonna come into our formula here.

142
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,950
The woman to someone drank the formula bar down.

143
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,520
Andi,

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,350
I am going to come immediately after the equals and hits old and enter.

145
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,020
And that makes it a lot easier to read.

146
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,810
Nested if statements.

147
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,730
And that's what this is.

148
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,320
A nested if statement.

149
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,270
So again,

150
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm gonna write the formula.

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,790
So if open brackets this cell here,

152
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,050
exactly the same as you did before is less land.

153
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,970
And now I'm gonna pace the value in for five hours,

154
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,240
which is zero point to await on blows of threes.

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,530
So they were going to say,

156
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,390
if d 41 is less than five hours comma value,

157
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,340
if true,

158
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,060
zero and then come out value if false,

159
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,420
and then it will move on to our second logical tests.

160
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,070
The one that we built it earlier.

161
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,740
So we're going to say if d 41 is less than five hours,

162
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,820
tell me zero.

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,620
But if it isn't less than fire.

164
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,170
There was Move on to our second logical test.

165
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,260
So now it's going to say is D 41 less than 10 hours.

166
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,280
And if it is less than 10 hours,

167
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,350
tell me five.

168
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,350
And if you listen less than 10 hours,

169
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,690
that is,

170
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,070
it's more than 10 hours return 10.

171
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,350
Then at the end,

172
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,490
I'm just gonna close the BRAC itself and you can see that both brackets went black.

173
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,930
If I hover over them and move,

174
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,810
you can see that encapsulates the entire argument on hit.

175
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,310
Enter.

176
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,500
Okay,

177
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,280
now I'm gonna copy that all the way across.

178
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,130
Control Andi are now.

179
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,730
At the moment,

180
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,170
we can see that we definitely have an answer off.

181
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,300
Five in here and 10 in here on Day five in him,

182
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,750
five in here and five in here.

183
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,860
But we don't actually know if that works.

184
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,010
So for now,

185
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,180
let's just delete that on.

186
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,330
We can see that yet.

187
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,070
Where's the house?

188
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,800
A lesson Five.

189
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,620
There was just deleted the value.

190
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:41,130
So now we can claim no money control and are Let's fill that back in.

191
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,060
So they go.

192
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,940
You've now built your first nested logical test.

193
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,650
So what?

194
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,430
It's done is It's said here,

195
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:55,960
look at D one and tell me if it evaluates to less than five hours and if it does,

196
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,870
I'm gonna claim nothing on.

197
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,030
Then,

198
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,150
if that's not true,

199
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,940
move on to a second logical test on.

200
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,510
Have a look at D one and see if it is less than 10 hours.

201
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,730
So therefore between five and 10 hours and if it is returned the value of five.

202
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,260
So we claim our £5 and if none of those two are true,

203
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,630
it must be over 10 hours.

204
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,330
And therefore,

205
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,350
I can claim £10 enter on.

206
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,850
There you go.

207
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,920
It's a simple has that you've no built.

208
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,830
Your first complex nested if formula.

209
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,600
Okay,

210
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,860
See you in the next lecture.
