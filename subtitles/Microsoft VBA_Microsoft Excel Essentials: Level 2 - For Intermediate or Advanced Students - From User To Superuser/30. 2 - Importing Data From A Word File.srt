00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,780
Okay guys, let's have a look at how you import data from a Word document.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,475
Now it's very straightforward.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,800
Again, we're going to need somewhere to put the data.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,715
So I'm just going to hit the little plus button to add a new sheet.

5
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,135
And then what we'll do is open the Word file,

6
00:00:18,135 --> 00:00:19,995
which is this one just here.

7
00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,185
And you can see that in this one we have

8
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,450
national insurance number or address one, address two,

9
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,225
address redress for address five,

10
00:00:27,225 --> 00:00:29,670
and something else over the n there.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,135
So all I'm going to do,

12
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:35,525
he's hit Control and I try to highlight everything.

13
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:38,540
Hold Control and C to copy it.

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,210
Then I'm just going to come into cell A1,

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,110
right-click and Paste Special.

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,120
And I'm just going to auto size,

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,650
not call it those columns that and they go now we have

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,720
a new file and it looks like we have national insurance number address one,

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,660
address two, just re-adjust fall address five,

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,670
which looks like the postcode.

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,425
And you'll notice creatively,

22
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:05,780
everyone lives in exactly the same streets.

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,300
They all just live next door to each other.

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,070
Okay, so that's how you import data from a Word file.

25
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,100
Now what I'm gonna do just to make this uniform is I'm going to flip back to the HR file.

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,655
Highlight row one, double-click the Format Painter.

27
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,660
Come back to the department stroke chat and just hit lie on one there.

28
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,390
So that gives us the same green highlighting.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,890
And when it come to sheet 2,

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,100
the one we've just done and do exactly the same thing again.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,840
Now I'm going to hit to Skype.

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,225
So we're back into normal mode.

33
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,060
And now we just need to rename this.

34
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,505
So I'm just going to right-click choose rename.

35
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:49,085
And this looks like It's addresses and enter.

36
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,860
So there you go. Now we have a base data file

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,935
which have already created a simple base, the base off.

38
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:57,230
We have our department stroke jet,

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,510
which tells us which department folks are.

40
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,090
In fact, let's just freeze the panes there.

41
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,370
So we're going to go to I'm just

42
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,910
highlighting row two because I want to freeze the panes of both.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,235
Go to View, Freeze Panes,

44
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:13,115
Freeze Panes and that way we can happily scroll.

45
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:17,000
And we have addresses and we'll do the same thing without some highlights,

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,775
HER2 Freeze Panes, Freeze Panes.

47
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:22,895
And here we have all of our addresses.

48
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:28,970
So fantastic. We now have three data sources and a simple database already built.

49
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,250
Now in the next lecture we're going to have a look at how

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,440
we make this a little more powerful.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
So see you in the next lecture.
