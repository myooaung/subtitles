00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Okay,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:03.700
guys.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.100
And welcome back to another student Questions Amazon lecture.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.660
Now,

5
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.600
this is a little bit more of a deeper dive of something that recovered in level two of this

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.200
course in the first project where we built an excel template.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.350
It's all about protecting worksheets.

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.790
Then there are two elements to protecting the worksheet,

9
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.050
something we can do with cells.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.000
Hair on.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.940
Then also in the review tab,

12
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.620
we have this option of protect sheet.

13
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.270
Now,

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.550
by default all of the cells in excel when you right,

15
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.170
click them,

16
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.820
choose format cells.

17
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.540
If you come over to this little box here,

18
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.950
the protection tab.

19
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.170
This is a default setting for all cells in every sheet ticked locked until EQT hidden.

20
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.610
Now what?

21
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.040
What we're going to do is just for now,

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.130
I'm gonna show you what the hidden does.

23
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.670
So I'm just going to click hidden and quick.

24
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.150
Okay.

25
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.660
Here,

26
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.190
now,

27
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.360
in the form of about just say equals one plus one and enter.

28
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.080
So,

29
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.330
no,

30
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.770
When I select cell a one,

31
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.370
you can see that we get the result of two.

32
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.020
And in the formula bar,

33
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.920
you can see that we have one plus one.

34
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.880
So you can see the formula.

35
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.770
But when I hit protect sheet and click OK,

36
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.240
notice that you can no longer see the formula very useful if you want to hide your formulas

37
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
or where yourselves appointing to in the formula bar.

38
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.910
So use that hidden option.

39
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.890
So I'm just gonna un protect sheet.

40
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.760
I'm not using passwords just to speed things up format cells.

41
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.790
Andi,

42
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.650
There we go.

43
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.520
So never know.

44
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.050
Minute date.

45
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.030
Let me just delete that.

46
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.950
I'm gonna pick a couple of cells at random 12 and three and imagine these are way you want

47
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.060
the users to be able to access,

48
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.380
but nothing else.

49
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.860
So I'm going to right click format cells,

50
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.990
choose unlocked a minute,

51
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.590
uncheck the locked box and click OK,

52
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.080
and now I'm going to come up to protect sheet.

53
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.960
They remember this list.

54
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.600
Here's what we want the uses to be able tow access.

55
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.660
So what we want to say is what will believe that the default settings?

56
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.000
No.

57
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.920
So we'll allow the users till select locked cells and select unlock cells.

58
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.970
So here I can click on any celeb once.

59
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.380
But if I try and type anything,

60
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.400
it's locked so he can't so un protect and protect.

61
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.230
This summer,

62
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.630
I'm gonna own check the select locked cells.

63
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.340
So know what that means is I only want the user to be able to select the unlocked cells.

64
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.380
So when I click OK,

65
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.350
notice where the cursor jumps two weeks sell selected.

66
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.780
It's the 1st 1 that we unlocked in the right click in the format cells,

67
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.540
and if I hit the tab,

68
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.780
you can see that it was just cycle through those three cells that I clicked the unlock on.

69
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.550
So that's how you unlock individual cells.

70
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.920
So let's just wish through these.

71
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.910
If you want to check everything,

72
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.690
the use won't be able to do things little,

73
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.880
and they won't be able to click or change anything.

74
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.310
So what we can do is we can say,

75
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.450
select lock cells,

76
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.540
which obviously leaves the uses to select the lock cells.

77
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.740
So,

78
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.940
like the unlock cells,

79
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.190
which you've just seen format cells means it allows the users change any of the formatting

80
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.730
of the cell.

81
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.870
So the font color or the background color or the borders.

82
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.430
Same thing with columns,

83
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.410
but doing it for a whole column on the same thing with Rose insert columns obviously will

84
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.820
allow the uses to insert columns,

85
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.250
probably one that you don't want to use that often if you're using V lookups,

86
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.710
because inserting columns,

87
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.450
particularly if you're using V lookups in code that could really mess your code of

88
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.080
generally Excel will work out and change or formulas if you insert a column.

89
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.030
But encode not quite so insert Rose obviously exactly the same thing.

90
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.530
If you chick tech.

91
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.030
This,

92
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.180
it will allow uses to insert Rose on is quite straightforward stuff,

93
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.530
really.

94
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.980
It's insert hyperlinks.

95
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.330
If you check this,

96
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.020
they can insert hyperlink.

97
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.880
Delete columns.

98
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.620
Delete Rose.

99
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.000
Obviously,

100
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.850
if you click these,

101
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.180
you will allow users to delete rows and columns of data.

102
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.660
Probably not something that you want to do or use.

103
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.850
The sort function the auto filters pivots on these objects and edit scenarios.

104
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.530
Now,

105
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.140
if you want a little more data and you want to read Microsoft's version of this,

106
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.370
I've posted the links to their websites against this lecture.

107
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.170
Okay,

108
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.290
have a great day,

109
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.980
and I'll see you in the next lecture
