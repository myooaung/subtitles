00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
OK,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.750
guys,

3
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.800
Now we know how to look up backwards.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.460
Let's put that into practice.

5
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.920
Now.

6
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.820
What have done in our H R file is I've dropped a car registration number into the end

7
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.680
column here,

8
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.480
and this is what we're gonna be looking up from.

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.140
So we're going to find a car registration number and we're gonna tab across and we're gonna

10
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.720
have a look at the full name to see who actually owns that particular car.

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.540
Okay,

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.800
so let's do it.

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.860
That's add a new sheet by clicking plus on Contract that over there.

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.510
And I'm gonna call this rename.

15
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.920
Come range.

16
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.090
Look up.

17
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.860
Although technically it isn't actually look up.

18
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.630
So what,

19
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.860
we're gonna dio let's say there were gonna answer a car registration number on Dhere is

20
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.540
where we're gonna have our formula.

21
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.240
So what we're going to do firstly,

22
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.100
so we know that we're looking up something that actually exists.

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.540
I'm just going to copy the value from here on pasted in here.

24
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.450
It's just changed that tl again.

25
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.950
And that's gonna be the car registration that we're looking up.

26
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.710
So now we know what we're looking up.

27
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.360
Let's set,

28
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.940
Let's have a go.

29
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.170
That index and match,

30
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.370
so we're gonna type equals index open brackets.

31
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.750
Now,

32
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230
the array is the full data set.

33
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.590
Remember?

34
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.510
That's the full data set.

35
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.290
So what we're gonna do,

36
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.800
we could start over here or we could start here because this is a sfar across as we

37
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.100
actually want to read.

38
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.990
So for now,

39
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.400
what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to highlight the whole of column D.

40
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.050
I think on the whole of column I Andi,

41
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.610
that means that no matter even if we have add new data to the bottom of this,

42
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.810
it will still keep readings.

43
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.360
Is looking at the whole of column D on the whole of column I that entire data set is there

44
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.360
.

45
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.920
Array.

46
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.940
So now we have 123456 columns of data in our data array.

47
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.760
Okay,

48
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.190
so there's our full data set.

49
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.010
Come on.

50
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.660
Now,

51
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.960
what we want to do is find a match open rackets and have a look at value is going to be

52
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.360
this here on.

53
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.100
That's our car registration.

54
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.610
Okay,

55
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.650
so now we're gonna hit comma,

56
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.110
and we're going to tell it where to look for that particular value.

57
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990
So we're gonna flip back here on.

58
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.110
We're going to click Column,

59
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.950
I because the car registration appears in column I So I'm gonna make comma.

60
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860
Now I want an exact match,

61
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.980
some a type zero that I'm gonna close enough on.

62
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.640
That's the row number of our formula sorted out comma and that we want to return the column

63
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.040
number.

64
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.200
So this is six.

65
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.100
This is five.

66
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.940
This is for this is three.

67
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.850
This is two,

68
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.550
and this will be one.

69
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.850
So one close brackets and enter.

70
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.850
So they go.

71
00:02:50.850 --> 00:03:01.320
Now we can see that Comma Phillips drives car registration que o or u Q 065 space J W I.

72
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.370
So it's just stir cheat and copy another one here.

73
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.280
So I'm just gonna copy that.

74
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.760
Come back to our car rage,

75
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.550
look up and paste it over.

76
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.380
There you go.

77
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.770
We can see that Toby Richardson drives y g 53 if we have a look Toby Richardson.

78
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.990
Obviously,

79
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.910
we've looked back to the first column,

80
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.380
but we could just as easily look back to the second columns of Pull the national insurance

81
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.610
number.

82
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.040
So here to modify our formula instead of looking at column one,

83
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.900
we could just say,

84
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.380
Let's have a look at column to on that would know pull the national insurance number.

85
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.450
So nice and simple.

86
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.540
I shall pretty that up before you download the file.

87
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.850
So at least you can see what this particular data based us on.

88
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.370
I'll see you in the next lecture.
