00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:02.760
guys,

3
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.660
welcome back.

4
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.150
Now,

5
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.770
in this lecture,

6
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.900
we're gonna have a look at adding a conditional formatting test to all of the ingredients

7
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.420
in each of our subsequent recipes.

8
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.410
So what we're going to do first is fashion the formula that we're gonna then use in our

9
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.390
conditional formatting test.

10
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.940
So what we want to do is have a look to see this value.

11
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.800
Beef appears in our dynamic named a range,

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.980
which is this one just here that lives in the ingredients master sheet.

13
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.520
So what we're gonna do is just click over here just to create the formula and we're going

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.860
to say equals match open rackets.

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.220
Have a look at this cell comma.

16
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.160
Have a looking my list,

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.300
which is our dynamic named range comma.

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.750
Returned an exact match and close the brackets.

19
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.210
Andi,

20
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.800
enter.

21
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.880
So there we go.

22
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.350
We can no see that we have no match for beef in this list.

23
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.540
So so far,

24
00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.170
so good.

25
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.600
And then we'll just track that down on.

26
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.270
We can see that we have errors.

27
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.180
Absolutely.

28
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.650
All the way down now to use a conditional formatting.

29
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
What we want to do is return either true or a false value.

30
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.520
So what we're gonna do is modify this formula to return a true value.

31
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.230
And that's very simple to do.

32
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.860
We're just going to click in between the match and the equals on we're just gonna type is

33
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.810
era open brackets Now the match function.

34
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.180
The match formally we've just written is what's going to be evaluated.

35
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.070
So just going to skip straight to the end and close the brackets so that what we're saying

36
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.020
is is this match function a seven in my list Exact match,

37
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.700
an error and if it is returned true.

38
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.640
So there you go.

39
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.390
That's how we get our true value now because that one works perfectly here in the

40
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.220
spreadsheet.

41
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.330
We're just going to copy it his escape.

42
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.250
I'm gonna click on the cell that we want to evaluate,

43
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.350
go to conditional formatting and new rule.

44
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
We're going to use a formula to determine which sells to format.

45
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.650
Just gonna click there and in here I'm just going to pace the formula that we've just

46
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.210
written.

47
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.830
Now what I'm gonna do is change the format him by hitting the format,

48
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.650
but I'm gonna choose the fill color as red and then click OK,

49
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.030
and OK,

50
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.410
again they go.

51
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.910
We can see the beef has gone red because the conditional formatting formula evaluated to

52
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.300
truth,

53
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.410
and it does not appear in this list here.

54
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.570
So what we're going to do is just copy that format in a way down There we go.

55
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.900
We can see that none of these items appear in our list.

56
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.710
So what we're gonna do now is copy all of these copy,

57
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.770
flip back to here and just pay special underneath.

58
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.360
So they go.

59
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.600
No,

60
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.740
we have all of Alice in there on our dynamic named range Will have expounded.

61
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.110
Now we've added these items in.

62
00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.470
So no.

63
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.350
When we click back to Chilli con Carney,

64
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.030
these cells no evaluate to white cells without conditional formatting.

65
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.930
But these air still read Now that's because thes air blanks on Blank's do not appear in our

66
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.370
ingredients Master list.

67
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.500
So what we're just going to do quickly is modify conditional formatting by adding another

68
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.060
rule.

69
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.980
So what we're gonna do is go back to conditional formatting.

70
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.020
Click New rule user formulated,

71
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.990
determine which sells to format again.

72
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.420
And this time we're going to say equals is blank open brackets now,

73
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.770
because I'm on this cell.

74
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.680
I'm gonna click this cell again.

75
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.160
I'm gonna hit F 43 times,

76
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.440
so it's not an absolute cell reference at all.

77
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.410
So it's a 13 Onda close.

78
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.750
The brackets on the format I would like to set is white.

79
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.960
No,

80
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.850
no color.

81
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.440
I want to apply a new color formatting on.

82
00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.880
Then click.

83
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.480
OK,

84
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.950
And then just gonna copy that over all of those.

85
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.230
So they go now,

86
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.290
we've successfully added a conditional format into all of these cells that will instantly

87
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.080
tell us if we add denies him in.

88
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.480
That isn't in our ingredients,

89
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.930
Master.

90
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.070
It will go red,

91
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.500
and we know we have to add it.

92
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.940
So if for argument's sake,

93
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.610
we said we needed to add peas instantly,

94
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.420
we can see by looking at it the peace doesn't appear in our list on.

95
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.030
We need to go and add it to our list over here.

96
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.850
Okay,

97
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.470
I'm just gonna do that for the rest of the sheets and I'll see you in the next lecture
