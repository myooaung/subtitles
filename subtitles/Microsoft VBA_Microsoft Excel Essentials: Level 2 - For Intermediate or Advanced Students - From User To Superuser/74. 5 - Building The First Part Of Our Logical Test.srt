1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
OK,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,760
guys.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,180
Now what we want to do is build a complex formula in here that takes this value here using

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:09,950
a simple V.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,550
Look up.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,850
And it wants to read this start date and then compare that against the date in this row

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,680
just here.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,990
Now we can begin by doing a straight V look up,

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,230
just like we did earlier.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,490
So we're just gonna say equals V.

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,050
Look up,

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,160
open brackets.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,740
We're going to choose this cell,

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,810
and we're going to hit F four because we want this cells always Reference column A but not

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,680
always rose six.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,610
So we're going to hear therefore once and twice and three times.

17
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,200
So there were always going to look at a but the six were very depended on where we drank

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,850
the formula.

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,680
So I've already set up that data table in sheet one as a dynamic named ranged cold.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,530
My data comer.

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,710
The start date appears in column two so column to comment on.

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,750
I want to find an exact match,

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,050
so I'm just gonna hit.

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,160
Enter on.

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,530
There you go.

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,350
Now we can see that when we drank this formula down.

27
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,480
Come on,

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,580
my Lancelot bottom.

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,610
We're going to get a bunch of different dates entered in here.

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,680
Don't worry that these are just numbers at the moment.

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,370
Because we know if we if we right click on we apply format cells on,

32
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,330
then we go to date.

33
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:29,450
We can see that is actually the 9th 19th of the 4th 2010 This is just expressed as a number

34
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:29,450
.

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,290
Okay,

36
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,560
so so far so good.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,140
But what we want to do is convert this into a one or a zero.

38
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,200
So what we're gonna do is add a logical test in front of it,

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,190
just like we had before.

40
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,700
So we're gonna say if open brackets this V look up returned value,

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,810
we want to say,

42
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,150
is less than or equal to this cell.

43
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,990
Now again,

44
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,150
we need to hit therefore a few times because this cell is we're going to drag this formula

45
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,780
around.

46
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,560
But we always want to look at Roe five.

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,120
So I'm gonna hit F four twice.

48
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,920
So I get see absolute five comma.

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,270
The value to return if that is true,

50
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,810
is one common.

51
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,740
The value to return if that is false,

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,730
is zero close the brackets on hit enter.

53
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,060
So now we can see when we copy that Down on we carpet whips the days until the show.

54
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,170
What?

55
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm doing that.

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,610
Okay,

57
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,920
so let me just put a freeze pain on there so we can we can see where we're going.

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,710
So view free pains free.

59
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,590
Spain's at the top.

60
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,500
We're just going to copy that formula all the way over.

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,130
So we're gonna copy all the way down and all the way over to hear control on our so they

62
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,380
Now we can see that we've got a load of zeros on Dhere on this one.

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,690
We start on the 22nd of the fourth.

64
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,390
We can see that that is our 1st 1 against collar Phillips.

65
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,540
And if we have a look,

66
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,750
Cano Phillips started work on the 19th of the fourth.

67
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,480
And you can see that that's the 1st 4 week because you'll remember that.

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,970
Let me just take off that freeze panes for a second,

69
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,380
scroll up and then apply for his pains on.

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,330
You'll see that because we're working in increments of seven.

71
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,540
That will be the first week that collar started work.

72
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,650
If we change that to three,

73
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,410
his zero jumps.

74
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,910
Although my overs here because,

75
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,320
no,

76
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,150
this is the first date that is less than or equal to Collis start date.

77
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,010
Okay,

78
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,580
so far,

79
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,250
so good.

80
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,250
But let me just turn on change that to seven.

81
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,830
The problem we have now is that what we're looking at is the start date,

82
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,020
and that's great for telling us where to start our bar.

83
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,510
But what we actually need to know is where our bar should finish,

84
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:52,030
so we can see a distinct gallant line in our chart that shows us a start date on the end

85
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,400
date.

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,580
Now,

87
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,280
what that means is that we need to compare two different results.

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,610
So we've already created a V look up to pull the start date and then applied a logical test

89
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,220
with that if But what we also need to do is add second logical test from another V.

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,730
Look up.

91
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,220
Using the end date on.

92
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,820
What we're going to do for that is we're gonna introduce the function of Andi,

93
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,870
which we're gonna look at in the next lecture.

94
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,960
So I'll see you there
