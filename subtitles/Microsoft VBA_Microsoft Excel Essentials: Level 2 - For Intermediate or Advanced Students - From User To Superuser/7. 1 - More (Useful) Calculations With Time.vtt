00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
OK,

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:03.450
guys.

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.260
Now we're gonna have a look at how you round time to specific increments of time.

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.070
Specific blocks of time.

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.640
Now,

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.000
in level one of this course recovered fully the three round functions.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.110
They were round,

8
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.740
round,

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.450
down and round up.

10
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.770
Now we're just gonna have a quick play with the round function here just to see what it

11
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.250
does.

12
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.610
So I'm just gonna tie round.

13
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.510
Just let me just capitalize that so we can see that it's the round function.

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.300
We're going to do that,

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.630
will.

16
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.820
That will make it a lot easier when you download the file and you can see exactly what they

17
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.040
do.

18
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.730
There happened to look at the formulas.

19
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.310
Okay,

20
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.520
so I'm just concerned the round function in here on.

21
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.730
I'm gonna look at the total hours because that's what we want to round now.

22
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.910
We could argue because we're working in hours and minutes.

23
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.050
We probably wanna work to two decimal places,

24
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.250
so I'm just gonna hit too close brackets hit and then copy that formula down with the drag

25
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.770
handle.

26
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.450
Okay,

27
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.480
so now we can see.

28
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.630
Let me just have it like that for a second just so we can see that That's the so we're

29
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.850
going to be referencing.

30
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.600
Okay,

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.130
so here we can see that seven hours and 30 minutes,

32
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.710
which is exactly what we worked,

33
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910
has rounded to seven hours and 26 minutes,

34
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.060
which is quite peculiar there.

35
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.160
There's a specific reason for that which we're gonna come to in the next lecture.

36
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.940
When we look at how Excel copes with dates and times on its perhaps know exactly,

37
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.120
do you think it would bay?

38
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.660
But don't worry.

39
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.390
We'll cover that fully in the next lecture.

40
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.260
Okay,

41
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.980
just so we can get some variety.

42
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.370
I'm just going to change the hours that we work in here.

43
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.680
So let's certain let's say we worked till a minute past five on that day on 12 minutes past

44
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.470
five groups,

45
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.030
along with them their and 12 minutes past five.

46
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.850
On that day,

47
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.900
let's finish at 5 26 They're fine.

48
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.280
31 man on.

49
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.910
Let's finish dead on five oclock on Friday,

50
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.360
which is a very good thing today.

51
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.050
Okay,

52
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.580
so we can see if we finish it.

53
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.250
17 01 which is at a minute past five.

54
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.220
We've actually worked seven hours and 31 minutes,

55
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.240
but the railed functions given us announcer seven hours,

56
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.570
26 minutes.

57
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.530
So clearly that's not right.

58
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.890
So what we need to do is find another function or another group of functions that will

59
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.250
perform the same thing as rounding but actually work with time.

60
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.750
They look like those nice folks that Microsoft have already thought this through on They

61
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.340
have given us the Emmett Round function.

62
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.480
So let's have a look at what our payable hours would be yourselves type able analyst Gulf

63
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.890
and enter to force a new line on.

64
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.560
We're gonna be working hours a minutes.

65
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.260
Just so it's nice.

66
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.360
Implant Bolton enter on were no looking at em.

67
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.060
Round they go.

68
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.830
Let's just tidy that up.

69
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.270
Well,

70
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.630
pretty up the format in,

71
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.360
um,

72
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.500
a little later on.

73
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.080
But for now,

74
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.230
let's just let's just hope in the m around function again because it's,

75
00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.510
ah,

76
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.020
formula.

77
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.260
We're gonna type equals we're going to tell you I m around because of highlighted that so

78
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.650
we don't pick the wrong cell.

79
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.760
We're gonna be looking at our total hours.

80
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.110
We're gonna hit comma.

81
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.140
We can see here that we've got a clue as to what we need to tighten next.

82
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.990
Just that says multiple.

83
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.200
Now the way you express the multiple when you use the M around is you hit the quotes.

84
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.920
We want to work in hours.

85
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.010
Colon.

86
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.370
On this time we want to work in 15 minute increments.

87
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.240
So we've said no air was colon on 15 minutes.

88
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.680
Then we close our quotes closer brackets on hit,

89
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.260
enter.

90
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.410
Don't worry about the way that so that results is displayed just at the moment.

91
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.880
That's because we have a general formatting on just up here.

92
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.310
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna copy the formatting from this cell by hitting the

93
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.050
former painter and just paint over.

94
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.210
So there you go.

95
00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.940
You can see that the M Round has rounded seven hours and 31 minutes to seven hours and 30

96
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.400
minutes.

97
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.140
Fantastic.

98
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.460
That's exactly what we wanted it to dough on.

99
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.350
We can see that all of these answers are in multiples off 15 minutes.

100
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.710
So there,

101
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.920
in 15 minute blocks now that's fantastic.

102
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.570
But when we work seven hours and 42 minutes on Tuesday here,

103
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.500
Andi,

104
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.840
it's highly unlikely,

105
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.210
certainly in the UK that you're going to get paid for seven hours and 45 at their Generally

106
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.210
,

107
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.570
employees will only pay you for 4 15 minute blocks that you worked.

108
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.600
So Ram is a very useful later rounding to the nearest increments of 15 minutes or whatever

109
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.230
minutes you set just up here So you can have this to anything.

110
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.530
You can have it in blocks of one minute to minute three.

111
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.800
Anything you want it all.

112
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.790
So because we have around function and around,

113
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.240
down,

114
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.410
on,

115
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.920
around,

116
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.190
up,

117
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.330
we have also the same correspondent.

118
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.930
Things similar to em round so em around is the equivalent of round on their The next

119
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.240
function that we're going to look at is the floor.

120
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.790
So I'm just gonna company that sells over there.

121
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.850
But I'm gonna change the bottom word to floor.

122
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.800
So that's nice and clear what it is that this particular column is gonna work with that

123
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.170
inward.

124
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.550
Well,

125
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.810
uh,

126
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.470
that's better.

127
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.380
Okay,

128
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.230
so here we're gonna use the same formula.

129
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.830
Almost.

130
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.370
We're gonna type equals floor.

131
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.930
And it's exactly the same for Mattis before.

132
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.590
So we're gonna look at the total hours hit comma,

133
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.980
open the quotes 00 because we're working in whole Alice on.

134
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.400
We're gonna look at 15 minute blocks,

135
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.500
so enter and again.

136
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.060
Don't worry that we've got a peculiar formatting on there.

137
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.300
We're just gonna copy the formatting from here.

138
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.090
Paste it over.

139
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.150
Okay,

140
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.930
let's just narrow that up a little bit.

141
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.550
Now we get.

142
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.560
So now we can see using the floor function that was still moving in 15 minute blocks

143
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.940
because all of these results are in 15 minute increments.

144
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.590
So we have 30 minutes and 30 minutes and 45 minutes in the whole hours and 30 minutes again

145
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.590
.

146
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.140
But this time we can see that seven hours and 31 minutes has been rounded down to the floor

147
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.010
of seven hours and 30 minutes,

148
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.020
which is what we'd actually get paid for,

149
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.940
saying with seven hours and 42 even though we were nearly there,

150
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.970
passed that mark and almost got to the seven and 3/4 hours will still only get paid for

151
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.650
seven hours and 30 minutes.

152
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.410
Similarly,

153
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.540
with seven hours and 46 minutes,

154
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.390
which you concede just here as Randi to seven hours and 45.

155
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.660
And even though we've just gone over the eight hours,

156
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.460
we're still going to get paid for the eight hours.

157
00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.450
Okay,

158
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.900
so now we've worked out what the equivalent of round is using the em around function on

159
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.460
wood worked out.

160
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.710
What the equivalent of around down is using the floor function.

161
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.570
Now what we're gonna have a look at is the round up equivalent which may not surprise you

162
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.880
to know as round down is floor,

163
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.300
that round up is ceiling.

164
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.540
So let's just use the ceiling function.

165
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.840
Eso Let's go.

166
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.450
Ask s say,

167
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.950
Hey,

168
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.170
I l i n g open brackets select our total hours.

169
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.690
Type in a increments.

170
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.470
Let's work in 15 minutes.

171
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.320
Close on.

172
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.250
Let's just copy that down.

173
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.720
Okay,

174
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.910
now,

175
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.210
again,

176
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.750
we've got the peculiar former thinks it's just formatted.

177
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.690
Generally,

178
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.730
let's change the format so they know we have a very kind employer.

179
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.210
And if we work one minute over 7.5 hours,

180
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.900
they're gonna pay us for seven hours and 45 minutes and so on and so forth all the way down

181
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:34.900
.

182
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.540
OK,

183
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.660
so that's Hey,

184
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.280
you convert time into units of time switches 15 minute blocks.

185
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.870
Obviously,

186
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.970
if you want to work in 10 minute blocks rather than token 15 just here,

187
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.470
just change its 10 or 25 or whenever it is that you want to work in.

188
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.400
So they go.

189
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.870
That's how you ran the time.

190
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.530
In a more useful way.

191
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.580
In the next length,

192
00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.920
you were gonna have a quick look at how Excel actually deals with time on dates on.

193
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.520
It may not be,

194
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.340
as you think,

195
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.050
OK on to the next lecture.
