1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,960
guys,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,920
in this later,

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,450
we're going to address some of the common issues that most uses at some point or other will

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,620
have when using v lookups.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,300
No,

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,180
generally these air down Teoh,

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,280
data heiress,

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,950
And I'm just going to clarify that they fall into two distinct categories normally.

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,250
And they are words or numbers,

11
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,660
so we'll cover words first.

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,780
Now,

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,320
at the moment would have done is I've created this little data entry cell,

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,480
so I've colored in yellow.

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,150
This is where we're looking up from,

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:38,110
and I have a very simple data table here with names down the first column and ages down the

17
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,360
second column on Built A simple V Look up here.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,650
If I hit F two,

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,200
we can see that a 13 hour look at value is looking here.

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,670
Data Array is a one through B 11 which is this area here were reeling from the second

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,130
column,

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,420
which is age on.

23
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,950
We're looking for an exact match,

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,860
which is false.

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,060
So when I type Tracy,

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,970
everything's hunky dorey and we get 24.

27
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,600
If I type David,

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,550
we get 29 which is exactly what we expect.

29
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,430
And if I type John Uh we get in error there.

30
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,560
One of two things has gone wrong in this instance.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,710
Now you may be looking at this and think I know exactly what that is.

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,400
The John in here is a capital J on the John.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,450
Down here is lower case of the first thing you'll probably try is capitalizing the J.

34
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,380
But you'll still get exactly the same era on DVI.

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,610
Lookups are case insensitive,

36
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,840
so it doesn't matter whether it's all upper case or lower case.

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,750
Proper case.

38
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,480
Total case.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Any case,

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,850
it doesn't make any difference to the You look up,

41
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,890
so a relies in one of two places.

42
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,960
It's either here with the value we're looking up or it's here with John in this data table

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:54,960
.

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,520
And the most common mistake that people make with these kind of things is that if they look

45
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,240
at this cell,

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,110
they'll say how that,

47
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:02,390
says,

48
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,550
John and I look at this cell and that says John to so what could possibly be wrong?

49
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,170
Well,

50
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,940
if we click into the formula Bar on our data entry,

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,150
that's this cell here.

52
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,370
We can see that specifically and exactly this cell says J O H N and nothing else.

53
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,820
OK,

54
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,950
so that's good.

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,320
But if we have a look at John here and click in the formula Bar,

56
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,680
we can see it's actually different.

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,580
It says J O H n.

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,190
And then we can see that we have a space between the M on where our curses blinking on.

59
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,750
That's because we have a spare space,

60
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,200
a trailing space at the end of the name.

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,710
Now because we've told Excel to look for an exact match,

62
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,340
it hasn't actually found an exact match.

63
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,790
The 1st 4 letters are exactly the same,

64
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,550
but in the data table we have an extra trail in space which essentially makes it a

65
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,790
different entry.

66
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,650
So all we're gonna dio is delete that and press enter.

67
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,540
There's a very quick way of getting rid of all of these problems.

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,760
If you have them on,

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,610
that's always My first check is Do I have any trail in spaces?

70
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,150
So here we go.

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,110
What we're gonna do is use the trim functions.

72
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,750
I'm just going to say equals trim,

73
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,320
open bracket.

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,160
So I'm gonna point to this cell just here on I'm gonna close the brackets.

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,200
So now I have Allen,

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,030
and I'm just gonna copy that all the way down.

77
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,550
So now I have what appears to be exactly the same data in here on exactly the same data in

78
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,040
here.

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,750
So if I was to type Allen,

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,010
we can see that Allen also heiress,

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,570
because Allen also has a trail in space.

82
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,250
So we've used trim.

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,630
We've pointed to this cell,

84
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,870
and this data set here will have no trailing spaces.

85
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,770
All we're gonna do,

86
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,840
right click copy,

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,670
come over.

88
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,080
Original data,

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,350
right Click pay specials.

90
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,510
Values on that will no load all of the names in here.

91
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,340
But all of the trailing spaces will have been removed.

92
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,910
So now I can safely delete that and they will have a data table that works.

93
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,690
So let's just check that with John again.

94
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,150
They go and John's 27 years old.

95
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,740
Okay,

96
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,300
that's the normal problems that you would encounter with words.

97
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,960
Now let's take a look at numbers,

98
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,810
okay?

99
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,880
With numbers.

100
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,370
Normally it's a formatting issue.

101
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,620
So at the moment,

102
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,340
have created a simple data table here that says 123 all the way through 10 and bunch of

103
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,450
colors at the side.

104
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,740
This is the value.

105
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,800
We're looking up and This is RV.

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,860
Look up formula.

107
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,750
So we're looking at a 12 Zoellick of value.

108
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,590
That's this one.

109
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:47,040
Our data ranges a one through B 10 which is here we're looking at from the second Column

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,690
and we're finding an exact match.

111
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,860
Now,

112
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,510
we could look at this and say,

113
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,660
Well,

114
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,330
I have a number five in here and I have a number five in here s O That really should work.

115
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,320
But this is a formatting issue.

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,300
What we actually have here is the number five on.

117
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,600
If we look at the data in this cell,

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,350
what we actually have is apostrophe five.

119
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,780
Now it's also being right aligned,

120
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,630
so it does look like it's a number,

121
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,720
but Excel will actually treat that as text,

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,740
which is completely different to a number.

123
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,590
So we have the text five in a data file on the number five is our look up value.

124
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,270
Now,

125
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,510
if this is if your source data is something that refreshes and your important,

126
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,950
it it,

127
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,380
it expounds as you're working through it.

128
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,500
The last thing you want to do is go through and removal these little apostrophes because

129
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,350
there could be thousands of entries.

130
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,090
The simplest way to solve this one is just go to your look up value and change that to the

131
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,020
format in your data table.

132
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,680
So I'm just going to introduce a little apostrophe before the number five and hit Enter.

133
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,560
And now RV.

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:56,760
Look,

135
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,860
it works perfectly.

136
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,890
OK,

137
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,400
I'll see you in the next lecture.
