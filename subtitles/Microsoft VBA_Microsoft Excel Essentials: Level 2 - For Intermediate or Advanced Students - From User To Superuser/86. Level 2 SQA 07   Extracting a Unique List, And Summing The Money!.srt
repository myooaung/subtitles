1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Okay,

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,430
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,830
Questions answered on this one's from Doug V.

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,230
Now dubbed these problem is that he has a column with loads and loads of data on at the

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,340
side of that column.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,400
We have a dollar remain until actually got pound immensity.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,040
But it's essentially the same thing on what Doug wants to do is extract a list of all the

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,230
unique items on,

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,170
then do a total against each off those items.

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,080
Says a couple of steps involved here.

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,380
I've got a completely random set of data just here.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,300
So what we're gonna do is copy all of these company names,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,850
which I randomly made up.

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,950
I'm gonna add a new sheet,

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,790
and I'm just going to paste them directly into here.

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,190
Now,

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,620
the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come up to data to remove duplicates on.

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,950
I'm just gonna hit OK on that's now gonna reduce this to just the unique entries.

20
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,330
If we want to weaken,

21
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,570
just highlight over that.

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,890
And if we want to make them alphabetical,

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,700
just come back to home sort and fills that and go eight said So there are 123456789 10

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,930
different companies.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,430
Now,

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,930
the next thing we want to do is find out what the total sales were from this column just

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,480
here against all off these individual companies.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,460
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say,

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,160
equals some if open rackets and they're the range is gonna be where we're gonna look for

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,570
our criteria,

31
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,690
the criteria being the company name.

32
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,800
So the range I'm just going to click the whole of column A.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,530
That's where we're looking,

34
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,420
comma.

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,220
The criteria is the name of the company,

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,750
Which is this one just here,

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,490
comma on the some range is where the dollar a Mansell The pound amends live on That's

38
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,700
column B here.

39
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,260
Closer brackets on hit Enter.

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,550
I'm just going to copy that all the way down.

41
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,830
Control in D Change that currency,

42
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,170
obviously minus pound seals will be dollars.

43
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,030
Doug on.

44
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,580
There you go.

45
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,480
That's how you do it.

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,830
That is your unique lists from the however many we've got down here.

47
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,580
200 lines of data on the Somme against each of those companies.

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,320
Hopefully that helps you out,

49
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,860
Enjoy.

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,630
And as always,

51
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,020
if there any more questions,

52
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
just let me know.

53
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,960
Have a great day.

54
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,650
Thank you.
