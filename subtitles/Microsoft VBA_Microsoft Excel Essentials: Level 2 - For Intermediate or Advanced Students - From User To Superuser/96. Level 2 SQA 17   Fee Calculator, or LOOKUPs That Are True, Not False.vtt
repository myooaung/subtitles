00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Okay,

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.740
guys.

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.270
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.380
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.950
Lecture.

6
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.710
Now this question came from Roberto.

7
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.740
Roberto says,

8
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.270
Hi.

9
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.120
I am trying to set up a model to automatically calculate fees that follows different bands

10
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.840
or blocks,

11
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.640
which is the best way of doing this.

12
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.870
Thanks in advance for your help.

13
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.160
Well,

14
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.420
this is actually really straightforward utilize in a function that we used extensively in

15
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.510
the database section of level two and that is the V.

16
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.690
Look up now where you can download this file,

17
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.610
it's called a level two sq a 17 fee calculator or lookups that are true,

18
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.520
not false.

19
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.080
And that should give you a clue as to what we're gonna do to see it.

20
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.690
So we have two sheets.

21
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.720
I'll come to the second sheet next.

22
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.300
That's a just a bit of a bonus.

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
So what we have is a simple table here that tells us what our threshold is.

24
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.530
We begin at zero notice,

25
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.500
very important.

26
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.400
And then we go up in bands of 102 155 100,000,

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.700
2000 500 all way up to nine nines,

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.270
whatever that number is.

29
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.180
And here is the feet percentage that we're gonna calculate depending on what our sales are

30
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.180
.

31
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.310
So we have three salespeople Rita,

32
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.150
Sue and Bob just like the film.

33
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.100
So what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna randomly put in a couple of numbers,

34
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.460
which just happened to correspond with the first numbers.

35
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.630
So here,

36
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.540
I'm just going to use a straightforward V Look up,

37
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.490
just like we've used many times before.

38
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.170
I'm gonna look at that number,

39
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.800
and I'm gonna look for that number here.

40
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.860
I'm gonna f four because that's an absolute cell reference.

41
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.850
When we drag it down,

42
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.130
I am looking at column,

43
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.550
too.

44
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.150
And for now,

45
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.450
I'm just going to say false in his center.

46
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.050
So,

47
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.620
you see,

48
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.590
at £100 we get a fee off 2% and if I just copy that down,

49
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.140
that works perfectly.

50
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.480
So 250 gives us three on 500 gives us four.

51
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.310
Now.

52
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.950
What happens if we only make sales of $99?

53
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.600
We get an error because 99 is not in this table at all.

54
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.580
Now,

55
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.540
if you'll remember from the from the section on databases,

56
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.430
that false gives us an exact match.

57
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.980
In fact,

58
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.480
the clue is even here.

59
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.600
False exact match.

60
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.320
What we're gonna choose now is true and notice what happens.

61
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.300
£99 gives us a band off one because 99 is less than 100.

62
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.240
So it doesn't qualify for the 2% and it's between zero and 100.

63
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.690
So qualifies for one.

64
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.150
If we had let me just copy that formula down if we had sales of 251 will still be at 3%

65
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.420
even at 499 was still a 3%.

66
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.420
If we got to the 501 we get to 4%.

67
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.710
Even if we got to 501 on one P would still be at 4% safe.

68
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:06.560
You in 2565 you will see that is over the 2500 but below the 5000 on,

69
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.610
we get a fee off six.

70
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.130
So here we can calculate what is actually payable so we could say equals this multiplied by

71
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.690
this percentage divided by 100.

72
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.680
So the fee payable to retract for ourselves of 99 Pete that £99 would be 1% which is 99 p

73
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.680
.

74
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.760
We can copy that down and we can see the fees that are payable depending on the band that

75
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.810
that particular cells person has hit.

76
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.820
Hopefully,

77
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.300
that makes sense now what we could do rather than hope these in is we may have a data table

78
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.710
that catalogs all of the sales there.

79
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.650
Different sales people have made.

80
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.750
So here,

81
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.800
what I'm gonna do I'm just going to introduce a simple some.

82
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.030
If Onda se equals some if open brackets the range where we are looking,

83
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.520
we are going to be looking for the name comma.

84
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.920
So we're looking for the name on.

85
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.750
We are looking for the name that appears in,

86
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.130
uh,

87
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.620
this Selfridges and they were hidden by the formula,

88
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.730
which is e four.

89
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.630
So that's where reads his name of years come out and we're gonna some the range back to the

90
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.560
sales were going to some column C.

91
00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.850
We're gonna close brackets.

92
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.210
So all of retail sales total £222.

93
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.890
All of sue sales totaled 540 on a lot of bumps sales.

94
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.200
They're all very poor sales people,

95
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.050
by the looks of it.

96
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.650
So Rita at £222 falls between the 102 15 so she gets 2%.

97
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.270
Su at 540 is between the 501,000.

98
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.910
So she gets 4% which is £21.60 on Bob.

99
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.790
Bob gets 130.

100
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.570
Let's Let's,

101
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.150
UM,

102
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.270
let's make Su an exceptional sales person.

103
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.990
It's finding entry for Sue and give her $6000 or pounds worth of sales at a go at £6000

104
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.020
Sue or £6512 Sue will get 7% which is between the five on the tent.

105
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.050
So she gets seven on her commission will be Fight 455 84.

106
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:26.170
The key thing here when using this true is you must have this sorted Alfa numerically that

107
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.700
is the very lowest at the bottom on the very highest at the top and as long as you that

108
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.240
that should work out perfectly.

109
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.820
I hope that helps Roberta,

110
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.130
but is always if anyone has any questions,

111
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.050
just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

112
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.580
I'll see you in the next lecture
