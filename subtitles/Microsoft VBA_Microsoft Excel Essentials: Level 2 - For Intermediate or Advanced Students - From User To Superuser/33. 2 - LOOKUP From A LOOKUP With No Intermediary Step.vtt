00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay,

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.890
guys.

3
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.110
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.170
we looked at using a value returned from one V Look up to use in another V.

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.820
Look up.

6
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.240
So we use this cell here.

7
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.900
The national insurance number to pull the address is over here.

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.480
Now,

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.150
it may be that sometimes you want to do exactly the same thing,

10
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.120
but without having this intermediary step just here.

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.500
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add another line down here.

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.650
Control in D.

13
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.430
I want to call this no into me,

14
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.950
dearie.

15
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.740
If I could spell it E r e.

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.050
Okay,

17
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.760
let's make that bold.

18
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.240
So now what we're gonna do is we're gonna pull exactly the same thing,

19
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.500
really?

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.590
Pull three anywhere road from this after looking up this.

21
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.220
So what we're gonna do is look at this and then use this as a look up to return this where

22
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.350
there's actually having a separate formula.

23
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.200
Okay,

24
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.340
now,

25
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.140
this is fairly straightforward to dio,

26
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.000
or we're gonna do is copy the intermediary step so control and see for his escape.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.940
I'm gonna paste in here the and his center.

28
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.840
So there's our intermediary step that we used before.

29
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.440
But now what we're gonna do is we're going to wrap that up in a bracket and that is now

30
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.850
going to become ever Look up value.

31
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.500
Call it on.

32
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.810
DNA.

33
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.500
Never gonna say equals V.

34
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.960
Look up.

35
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.670
Open rackets.

36
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.850
Here's the value that we're gonna look up in another look up.

37
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.050
Coma.

38
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.040
No,

39
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.770
We want to have a table array.

40
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.120
And if we flip over,

41
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.050
it was in the addresses,

42
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.880
and we're gonna highlight all of this just here.

43
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.830
Control shift.

44
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.200
Andi down on.

45
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.720
We want to return the second column,

46
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.020
which is addressed one.

47
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.550
So comma,

48
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.450
two comma,

49
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.730
false closed brackets on hit.

50
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.310
Enter.

51
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.270
So they go.

52
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.920
That's how you build a V look.

53
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.490
Abusing intermediary within it.

54
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.750
Actually return in the intermediary separately.

55
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.540
Okay,

56
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.140
so we've nested one V.

57
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.100
Look up inside another V.

58
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.630
Look up.

59
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.490
Okay.

60
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.760
See you in the next lecture.
