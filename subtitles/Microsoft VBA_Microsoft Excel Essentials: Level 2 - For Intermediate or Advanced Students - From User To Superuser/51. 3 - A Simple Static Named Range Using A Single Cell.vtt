00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
Okay,

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.260
guys,

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.130
in this section,

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.190
we're gonna have a look at named Ranges.

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.710
Now,

6
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.320
there are essentially two types of named ranges in Excel in.

7
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.430
We're going to cover them both.

8
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.350
In this section,

9
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.270
we have static named ranges which essentially mean that they are always set.

10
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.420
So where whenever you set that name range to be,

11
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.270
it will always be on.

12
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.920
We have dynamic named Ranges and dynamic Named Range is,

13
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.990
as the name dynamic suggests,

14
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.570
expand and contract.

15
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.050
Depending on the data set that uses thumb,

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.650
the name was suggest being named range that it would only refer to a range of cells,

17
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.590
but it could equally refer to a single cell.

18
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.280
So what we're gonna do first is have look a single cell named range.

19
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.770
Now you'll remember that if we drank a formula around,

20
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.150
but we always want to reference exactly the same cell.

21
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.670
We have to hit F four to make the cell reference an absolute cell reference.

22
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.850
Orefice ID equals this multiplied by this the first time we interest.

23
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.930
It's fantastic and it works beautifully.

24
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.130
If we copied it down and hit f two,

25
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.990
we can see that this cell has also moved down one.

26
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.650
So we've drunk the formula down,

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.400
so we're now looking at this cell.

28
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.950
But this has moved in to now the way around.

29
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.020
That obviously is.

30
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.240
We could absolute cell reference by hitting,

31
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.490
therefore on control on D.

32
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.130
And that works perfectly well.

33
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.950
But at some point or other,

34
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.590
you may well forget.

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.140
Actually,

36
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.370
when you look at that formula,

37
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.970
what actually is in cell absolute be absolute three.

38
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.370
It tells us exactly where it is,

39
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.280
but it doesn't tell us what it is.

40
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.410
And that's what one of the uses for unnamed range.

41
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.040
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna click on this cell and name in a range is very simple

42
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.040
.

43
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.670
You just click in the name box.

44
00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.110
No names of ranges must always begin with the letter or another score,

45
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.580
I think,

46
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.260
but I usually start with the letter,

47
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.770
so I'm just gonna call this markup on hit.

48
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.350
Enter.

49
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.730
So now when I click off,

50
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.080
you can see if I'm here.

51
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.320
The name boxes,

52
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.450
um,

53
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.360
in cell e seven here it system in a five.

54
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.790
But when I click back on here,

55
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.890
it no say's markup.

56
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.550
So what it can do is say equals this cell multiplied by Mark.

57
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.340
And as I start to type it,

58
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.150
you can see the Excel has already identified.

59
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.750
We have a named range called markup,

60
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.480
so I can just double click that and you can see the yet absolutely it's reference in that

61
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.830
cell that we just named Hit Enter.

62
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.930
Now I don't have to absolute sole reference that I can just copy that formula and every

63
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.130
single time it will look at that named range markup and always get the right target and

64
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.200
feel the useful thing with Markup says.

65
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.000
When I click onto another sheet,

66
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.700
somebody could say,

67
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.090
Hey,

68
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.480
I've got some blackberries that you can buy at 50 p.

69
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.980
I may want to find what my markup is,

70
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.300
but not remember the percentage that I've entered over here in our markup self,

71
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:12.050
but I can call that value from anywhere so I can say equals that multiplied by markup.

72
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.010
Onda,

73
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.270
40 p is the markup on a 50 p products and if I just wanted to see what the market wants,

74
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.390
I could literally just type equals,

75
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.540
mark up and hit an intact and see they go 80% his own markup,

76
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.050
so by name in the range over here.

77
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.620
We can call that by its name and use it in any former that we want to anywhere within the

78
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.340
spreadsheet.

79
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.060
Okay,

80
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.820
That's how you do a single cell in the next lecture.

81
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.230
We're gonna have a look at how you do a range of cells.

82
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.540
I'll see you in the next lecture.
