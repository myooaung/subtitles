a gay.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:03.980
Guys,

3
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.560
Welcome back now,

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.010
I mentioned in the last lecture that we actually to evaluate to logical tests Our 1st 1 We

5
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.540
use the V.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.000
Look up to find this start dates from our data table over here on evaluated that against

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.280
the date cell in row five on what we said is is the start date less than or equal to the

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.670
date?

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.880
Sell immediately above What we also need to know is the end date less than or equal to the

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.710
cell immediately above on one,

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.850
over to the right.

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.090
And to combine two logical tests,

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.370
we need to use the an function now up to their review.

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.820
Simple,

15
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.170
logical tests such as equals.

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.660
If open rackets,

17
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.910
this cell equals red,

18
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.100
Let's just keep it uniform.

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.260
Red close brackets,

20
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.290
comma value.

21
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.860
If true,

22
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.850
let's just say true comment value of false.

23
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.060
Let's just say falls.

24
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.630
Enter.

25
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.360
So they go E three does indeed equal reds and therefore we get a return value off.

26
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.880
True,

27
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.750
But if we covered the formula down,

28
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.000
we get returned value of false because e four doesn't equal Read.

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.560
It equals green until we turn it red.

30
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520
In which case it will equal True again.

31
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.030
What we need to do is have a way of incorporating both of those logical tests into one

32
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.120
single formula.

33
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.370
So we get one returned results.

34
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.820
Now,

35
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.060
the way we do that is by using the excels built in function.

36
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.880
Andi.

37
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.570
Now,

38
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.130
unlike the spoken English,

39
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.530
where Andi would appear in between the two tests So this cell equals read on and this cell

40
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.460
equals green.

41
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.130
We have to put the and way up the front not immediately at the front will immediately after

42
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.540
the if so,

43
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.550
if open rackets.

44
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.960
And here's where the and goes We're gonna open brackets again on that will now give us

45
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.340
multiple logical tests or one after the other.

46
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.490
You can have dozens of these things,

47
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850
but we only want to evaluate to finance.

48
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.850
So what I'm going to say is this cell equals bread.

49
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.870
Onda,

50
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.800
Comma.

51
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.500
This is now my second logical test on this cell equals,

52
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.780
let's say green because it does close quotes,

53
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.880
close brackets and that finishes a logical tests.

54
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.380
So you can see immediately after the end we open a bracket.

55
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.410
We put all of their logical tests which are separated by a comma,

56
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.830
so e three equals red and E four equal screen.

57
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.930
Then we close the brackets that finishes logical tests comma value.

58
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.750
If both off those statements are true,

59
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.830
returned true comma.

60
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.600
And if both of those statements are true,

61
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.010
that means both could be false or the first could be true.

62
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.770
And the second false or the first is false.

63
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.790
And the second is true.

64
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.060
Anything but both of those being true return false hopes I wish could spell falls and enter

65
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.060
.

66
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.270
So there you go.

67
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.720
E three does indeed equal Red Andi E four equals green,

68
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.150
so therefore we return a value off troops.

69
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.960
If this said Blue,

70
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.540
for argument's sake,

71
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.710
would get a return value of false because the second Andi the second logical test fails.

72
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.370
Obviously,

73
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.910
unless we change that to,

74
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.050
say blue,

75
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.850
in which case it would return true again.

76
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.530
OK,

77
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.330
so simply that's how you used the and the important thing being that you put it at the

78
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.530
front and not in between your logical tests says I'm just type Onda.

79
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.700
Open your brackets,

80
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.830
you can have multiple logical tests,

81
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.490
just separate them with the Kama and then wrap your if statement around it.

82
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.910
OK,

83
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.110
so escape Now,

84
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.600
let's have a look at sheet to and see how we're going to incorporate that into here.

85
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.360
So,

86
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.130
firstly,

87
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.710
the if is good,

88
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.760
We can leave the if I'm just going to scroll this down a bit so we can see this on multiple

89
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.340
lines.

90
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.290
So if so far so good now I'm gonna insert my and open brackets.

91
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.090
No,

92
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.830
I'm into my first logical test.

93
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.940
Now.

94
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.840
I'm just gonna delete these bits off the end here because that is our first logical test V

95
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.370
Look up.

96
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.180
Absolute A six.

97
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.490
My data to our start date comma falls return an exact match.

98
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.530
And if that is less than or equal to see absolute five comma on next logical test,

99
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.890
it's going to be almost identical to the fair.

100
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.080
So what we're gonna do is we'll just copy that all the way across come a copy on pay,

101
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.830
so I'm just gonna stick that on a different line,

102
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.270
so it's a little easier to read.

103
00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.750
So our psychological test if v look up a absolute a six,

104
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.610
my data.

105
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.370
But this time we want to look at column three because that's the end date.

106
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.320
On this time,

107
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.140
we want to know,

108
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.690
Is it greater than or equal to?

109
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.320
And it's not gonna be this cell.

110
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.990
It's gonna be this cell.

111
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.250
So instead of having that there,

112
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.620
what we're going to say is this one.

113
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.140
But we wanted in the same format.

114
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.360
So we want d absolute five.

115
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.730
So I'm just gonna hit f or a few times,

116
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.580
so we get ribs.

117
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.270
Missed it,

118
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.560
d absolute five close brackets.

119
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.990
Andi,

120
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.420
that encapsulate both of biological tests.

121
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.430
So now we can come back to what do we want to return?

122
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.280
If it's true,

123
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.300
Will want to return a one on what do we want to return if it's false and we want to return

124
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.980
a zero so close brackets hit center and then let's copy that down Control and D on this

125
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.630
Copies across control Andi are so near.

126
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.300
Let's see if we can find one where it actually does start and finish in the same date.

127
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
In fact,

128
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.390
what we're gonna do is we'll butcher the days and now,

129
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.650
just so we can see this in action.

130
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.200
So I'm just gonna change that toe 1/8 of January 2010.

131
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.410
I'm just going to change that to 812010 on.

132
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.460
Let's have him just work in for a week.

133
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.360
So it's a finishes on the 18th of January 2010.

134
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.340
So now we're looking at Connor Phillips.

135
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.550
We can flip over here,

136
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.700
and here's common Phillips and they go.

137
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.670
He does indeed start work on the eighth of January,

138
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.550
which we can see just here.

139
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.340
And he finishes on the 15th of January,

140
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.920
which is bum bum bum bum bump.

141
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.150
That is his last working day.

142
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.040
So now we have ones all the way over here and zeros everywhere else.

143
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.750
So that's how we build our formula.

144
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.860
So the next thing we're gonna have a look at,

145
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.950
in fact,

146
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.230
there's one thing to watch out for when you do this,

147
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.400
let me just play right the way over to the end.

148
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.900
You'll notice that the last cell value also evaluates to one on.

149
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.410
That's because this cell is actually because it's empty.

150
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.590
It's evaluating to be in Excel speak the first of January in the year 1900.

151
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.180
So we do need to add one more thing way up the front,

152
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.550
just so we can get rid of that stray one right at the very end.

153
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.370
Okay.

154
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:20.560
Now,

155
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.080
to get rid of that stray one,

156
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.840
what we need to do is add another logical test way up the front.

157
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.580
So what we're gonna do you say,

158
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.780
if open brackets this cell here and we're going to go bump bump on the F four because it's

159
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.900
going to be de absolute five.

160
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.610
So it's not always gonna become on Davis.

161
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.140
Always going to be in Line five equals double quotes.

162
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.750
That is,

163
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.210
it is blank than the one users.

164
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.650
10 0 comma.

165
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.780
No,

166
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.890
if it isn't blank,

167
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.770
I went to carry on,

168
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.370
evaluate the rest of the formula,

169
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.290
So I'm just gonna come to the end,

170
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.480
and I'm going to close the brackets on his enter,

171
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.390
and then we're gonna copy that down Control and D on.

172
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.920
Copy that all the way across Control on our When we look over here,

173
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.440
we now have a zero.

174
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.090
And that's because that first logical test that we added in there.

175
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.880
Okay,

176
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.610
so that's how we get our ones and zeros a game on next.

177
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.330
We're gonna have a look at the conditional formatting to change that into a gallant bar.

178
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:21.830
