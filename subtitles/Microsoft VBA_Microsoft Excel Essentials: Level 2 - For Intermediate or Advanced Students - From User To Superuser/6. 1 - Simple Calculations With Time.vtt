00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
Okay,

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.650
let's start adding in some simple calculations there.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.690
The first thing we want to know is how long did we have full inch.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.620
So I'm just going to type the head in there off lunch.

5
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.660
Andi,

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.070
subtract in time is is very straightforward.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.230
Exercise and excel.

8
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.050
So what we're gonna do,

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.100
is it equals?

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.730
Tell Excel.

11
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.520
It's a formula.

12
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.000
We're gonna look at what time we started back in the afternoon,

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.980
and we're going to subtract what time we finished in the morning and hit.

14
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.380
Enter.

15
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.620
So they go.

16
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.670
You can see very quickly that we had 30 minutes for lunch,

17
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.840
and I'm just going to copy that formula down.

18
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240
That's nice and easy.

19
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.060
We worked out what we have one we had for lunch,

20
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:49.310
That's where cut how many hours we worked in the morning on and how many hours we worked.

21
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.240
I really wish I could type how many hours we worked in the afternoon on bond.

22
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.850
What were total there was for the day.

23
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.660
Okay.

24
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.440
On again,

25
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.170
just that straightforward calculations.

26
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.230
We're gonna work out what time we finished in the morning.

27
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.250
We're going to subtract what time we started in the morning.

28
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.690
It ends actually go.

29
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.230
We were three hours in the morning.

30
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.350
Let's just use the drag handle.

31
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.010
Double click,

32
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.650
and they can see all of them.

33
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.520
A MLS PM Eris is exactly the same,

34
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.010
but we're gonna look at what time we finished in the afternoon on.

35
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.900
We're going to subtract what time we started in the afternoon.

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.510
Hit and they go.

37
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.360
We worked 4.5 hours to walk.

38
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.570
Click to copy that down.

39
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.190
It looks like we need to take lunch a little later in the day to split it up.

40
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.680
Message on there.

41
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.090
We're gonna do the total hours.

42
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.510
Now,

43
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.520
you may think that this is a simple as subtracting from your finish time.

44
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.640
Your start time groups hit Enter.

45
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160
But you can see that that that saves.

46
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.810
We actually worked eight hours a day because we had often there will lunch.

47
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.750
We actually worked 7.5.

48
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.580
So what we need to do is utilized.

49
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.190
Am There was a PM hours.

50
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.480
So what we're gonna do is say in the morning.

51
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.200
We worked three hours on in the afternoon.

52
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.190
We worked for 1/2.

53
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.500
So we're just gonna add those two together hit ends at Diego.

54
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.250
That's a true reflection of the hours that we worked.

55
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.940
Okay,

56
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.020
so now we can see we have 1/2 hour lunch,

57
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.070
which was calculated.

58
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.650
We've worked out how many hours we worked in the morning by subtracting our started time

59
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.060
from El Fringe time.

60
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.330
Same in the afternoon.

61
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.230
And then we ended our am errors and PML was together to work out total hours.

62
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.760
What?

63
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.090
Okay.

64
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.850
And the next lecture?

65
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.090
We're gonna have a look at some more useful calculations using time.

66
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.450
So you in the next lecture.
