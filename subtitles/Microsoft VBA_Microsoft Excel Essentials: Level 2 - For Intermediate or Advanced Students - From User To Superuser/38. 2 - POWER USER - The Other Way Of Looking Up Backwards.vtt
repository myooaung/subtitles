00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.670
guys,

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.010
before we get onto the next lecture where we'll see the backwards V look up in action,

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.820
I just wanted to show you another method of doing exactly the same thing.

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.190
Now,

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.830
personally,

7
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.340
I use the other method,

8
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.680
the one that we've just looked at much more frequently.

9
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.970
Mainly because I learned that one a long time ago on this one is comparatively new to May.

10
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.210
But try them both out in whichever one works best for you.

11
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.110
Stick to that one.

12
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.100
They both do exactly the same thing.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.920
This method does use the V.

14
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.390
Look up.

15
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.090
But we introduce another one of excels built in functions,

16
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.680
and that's the choose function.

17
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.080
So let's just take a quick look at choose first.

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.540
So equals choose index number.

19
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.990
For now,

20
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.210
we're gonna type one,

21
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.550
and that will become clear why,

22
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.920
in just a second I'm gonna hit calmer and then into our second argument,

23
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.800
which you can see from the tool tips A's value one.

24
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.680
So I'm just gonna type the word first,

25
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.090
close the quotes it comma,

26
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.900
and you can see our next argument is value,

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.240
too.

28
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.640
So I'm just gonna type second and close quotes when I close the brackets and hit Enter.

29
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.160
You can see that we get the value first returned because of our value arguments.

30
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.450
This is value one.

31
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.670
This is value to and we've chosen to return the 1st 1 the index one so free to choose to

32
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.780
and hit Enter,

33
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.450
we get second.

34
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.010
Now we've just used that.

35
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.480
And we've actually typed the values in here as the argument.

36
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.280
So let me just committed so that for a second,

37
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.620
actually,

38
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.840
let me just type over that for a second and tight first,

39
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.850
second third here.

40
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.170
And just to I can't type third at Rip,

41
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.460
right?

42
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.130
That's right.

43
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.740
Okay,

44
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.870
so never let let's have a look at the same thing again.

45
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.440
So choose open brackets again.

46
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.800
From there,

47
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.650
we're just going to say Index one comer and they were gonna load the values by pointing out

48
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.390
of the cells.

49
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.360
Are never going to say this cell comma this cell comer this cell and then close off the

50
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.040
brackets.

51
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.130
So there you go.

52
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.540
My returning index.

53
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660
One of our three values,

54
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.150
G three,

55
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.590
g four,

56
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.210
g five.

57
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.290
We returned first because that's exactly what's written in G one.

58
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.450
So if you wanted to return the third value.

59
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.200
We would just type three as the index number Andi hit.

60
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.800
Enter.

61
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.560
Okay.

62
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.890
So,

63
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.920
fundamentally,

64
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240
that is how the choose option works.

65
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.820
So let's take a look at that Inaction and incorporating it into the V.

66
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.350
Look up.

67
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.050
Okay.

68
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.740
So equals the look of a turn.

69
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.100
Them right?

70
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.420
Yes.

71
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.230
Equals for he look of open brackets just as we started before.

72
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.520
We're gonna look at this as I'll look up.

73
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.710
Value common.

74
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.860
There were going to introduce the choose option.

75
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.860
Open brackets there.

76
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.140
The index number.

77
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.450
This is where it gets a little more tricky.

78
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.770
Dead straight forward.

79
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.680
Once you follow it,

80
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.000
you'll have it forever.

81
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.460
What we're going to do first is open the curly brackets,

82
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.020
not the normal brackets,

83
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.150
the curly brackets.

84
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.290
Then we're gonna tie one comer to for now on.

85
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.670
Then we're going to close the curly brackets.

86
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.930
So what we've said is choose the index number one on day two.

87
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.820
So now what we need to do is add values into those index numbers one and two before we

88
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.060
pointed to the world's 1st 2nd or third on their what we're going to do rather than

89
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.180
introduce a single value,

90
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.260
we're going to introduce a range of values.

91
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.920
So our first index,

92
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.660
our first value range,

93
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.000
is gonna be where our look up lives.

94
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.190
And we're looking for green on that piers in this column.

95
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.790
So our first value value one is gonna be the range C three through C seven the case and

96
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.240
there were satisfied number one of the choose option.

97
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.870
So one will be C three to C seven comma there.

98
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.080
We need to loathe second range or value to their depend on which column we want to look.

99
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.180
Oh,

100
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.380
well,

101
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.580
just point to which everyone.

102
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.210
So let's say,

103
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.960
for argument sake,

104
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.840
we want to find the name of the person,

105
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.470
so the second value or the second value range will be a three through a seven.

106
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.290
Okay,

107
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.700
so they are two values that we're going to choose from with our choose.

108
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.750
Want to again coma.

109
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.060
Now,

110
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.760
unlike the lookups where we go?

111
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.880
Column on column to column three COLUMN two is going to be the second of our choose options

112
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.880
.

113
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.430
So even though it's in column A,

114
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.470
it's actually going to be column index to because it is the second of our choose options

115
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.010
here.

116
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.180
So come to will return something from a three to a seven newcomer and then false,

117
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.320
just like we did before and hit.

118
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.760
Enter.

119
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.220
So they go.

120
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.820
If you want to know who has green ice,

121
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.420
it's Katie on its red From column to which you know,

122
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:08.330
Formula column Index number two second option is a three to a seven.

123
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.020
So if you want to change that and drag that over to here and then hit enter,

124
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.000
we haven't changed the column number,

125
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.880
but we do get a different result.

126
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.240
We know Get blonde because we have no moved column index to arrange B three to B seven.

127
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.070
So now we get the answer blonde because that is in column B.

128
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.080
So let's just expand that for a second.

129
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.910
Just for fun.

130
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.330
Eso We could have three and you can keep out into these.

131
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.350
It can keep going up.

132
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:44.950
So now our first option in the choose section of this formula is rain C three to C seven.

133
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.520
Our second option is B three to B seven.

134
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.650
So s at our third option,

135
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.750
calmer as a three to a seven.

136
00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.960
So now we have one C three C seven to B three to B seven c a three to a seven.

137
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.110
And if we turn from number two,

138
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.310
we're going to be true to return in the value from the second column,

139
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.870
which is the B column So hitting Enter still returns Blonde.

140
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.550
But if we wanted to return from column A,

141
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.130
that is the 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd we will know,

142
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.900
say column Index number three,

143
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.890
which will read from column I.

144
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.920
So when I hit enter,

145
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.470
we know find that Katie has green eyes.

146
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:38.460
So if we were to say brown and so we can know see that Paul house brown eyes eso they go

147
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.290
play around with both of them.

148
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.290
Find out which one works best for you.

149
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.100
Whichever one you most comes to war with,

150
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.040
Use that one.

151
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.810
OK,

152
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.380
I'll see you in the next lecture.
