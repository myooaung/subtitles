00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
Okay,

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.010
guys.

3
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.610
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.720
Questions answered.

5
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.250
Lecture.

6
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.910
Now this question comes from Phillips Speeds,

7
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.690
and Philip Possess has a workbook with a couple of sheets,

8
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.520
and there are three columns of data spare part number one,

9
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.460
spare part number two apart description.

10
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.260
And now,

11
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.390
sometimes there's gaps in the data,

12
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.910
so either part number one or part number two is missing.

13
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.140
But basically what we want to find out does either part number one or two in sheet one

14
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.470
exist in sheet,

15
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.990
too,

16
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.270
and vice versa on then to wrap that,

17
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.020
all of that the end.

18
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.550
What we want to see is a count of how many times that parts being used.

19
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.290
Now.

20
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.170
I actually think that each of the entries each of the roses,

21
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.920
a unique use on going after butcher The data have created for this,

22
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.280
but anyway,

23
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.850
that lets the task.

24
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.450
So it's really straightforward to do.

25
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.980
Actually,

26
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.290
it's just a simple count.

27
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.340
If so,

28
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.450
let's crack on.

29
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.770
Okay,

30
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:03.660
here's the data.

31
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.320
No,

32
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.000
I've mocked this up on what I have a partner was one partner was to description in sheet

33
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.560
one and then cheating have pardonable one part number two on description Onda counts.

34
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.780
Is that the final sheet where we're just gonna do a count of how many's homes?

35
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.030
Everything has been used.

36
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.550
Now there is perhaps a more simple explanation to this because from looking at the data set

37
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.360
that said that Philip provided,

38
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.060
I think the unique value is actually the description from the screen caps.

39
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.670
This part number corresponds to this description.

40
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.430
This part number corresponds to this this description in both sheets.

41
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.800
So actually,

42
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.590
the unique identify is neither of the part numbers.

43
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.970
But the description on that's going to make it easier for us in the count as well.

44
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.850
I'll show you very quickly how to do it if it's both,

45
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.050
but it's just basically a duplication of the first test.

46
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.420
Now what I'm gonna do here,

47
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.300
because I had just unique entries for everything,

48
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.250
just copy that down.

49
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.250
So we have at least till interest for one thing.

50
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.020
Okay,

51
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.030
so this is a really simple camped if I'm on sheet one of the minutes,

52
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.960
so I'm just gonna say count if open brackets and the first argument is the range,

53
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.620
this is where we want to look.

54
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.730
Now again,

55
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.160
I'm assuming the description is unique.

56
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.790
So I'm coming to sheet to I'm just going to highlight or select all of column C comma I'm

57
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.650
gonna flip back to she won,

58
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.510
and I'm gonna point to the description in C two.

59
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.900
So I'm looking in sheet two columns,

60
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.250
See for a match to what is in column C to closer rackets and enter.

61
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.110
And they go.

62
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.100
We can see that screw one does not exist in sheet,

63
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.600
too.

64
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.310
Now,

65
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.050
I'm just going to copy that formula down.

66
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.230
So they go.

67
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.310
You can see that screw one does not exist in sheet to.

68
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.210
Neither does it,

69
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.650
isn it?

70
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.060
Does this need those extra screw five?

71
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.650
Most definitely appears once somewhere down here,

72
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.200
Screw five.

73
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.750
There you go.

74
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.350
So it's a simple count I where we are looking on what we are looking for,

75
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.740
this will give us the count that we may even want tohave.

76
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.220
Just a simple yes or no response here.

77
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.550
And that's fairly simple.

78
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.670
We just need to wrap a logical tests around.

79
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.550
So what we're gonna say is,

80
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.790
if open brackets all of this,

81
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.050
this count if evaluates to zero,

82
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.480
that is the wasn't a match.

83
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.450
We want to return the value off no comet.

84
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.240
And if it does,

85
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.390
then return a value of yes.

86
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.110
We're not really bothered about whether it appears more than once.

87
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.900
We just want to know that it appears.

88
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.670
So we're no or yes will do its lips.

89
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.620
Yes,

90
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.070
let's accept that.

91
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.190
So let me just stick that in the centre.

92
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.100
Copy that down with stomach like they go.

93
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.890
So we get No.

94
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.330
Yes.

95
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.520
No,

96
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.680
no,

97
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.830
no,

98
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.980
no,

99
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.130
no,

100
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.270
no,

101
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.420
no,

102
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.560
no,

103
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.690
no.

104
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.910
And all of that coming to think no one would do.

105
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.630
It's just copy that test.

106
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.760
So here's our own says for sheet one,

107
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.630
in fact,

108
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.440
So let me just copy the 1st 1 uh,

109
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.750
copy the formula bump,

110
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.100
and then I'm gonna flip over to shake,

111
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.600
too,

112
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.820
And I'm just gonna pace that in here.

113
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:19.340
But I'm gonna need to change that sheet to to sheet one on that sheet 12 sheet to to get

114
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.910
the reverse ounces.

115
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.970
So there we go.

116
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.440
That is the test.

117
00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.190
Okay,

118
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.460
Test number one.

119
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.470
Right now.

120
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.690
Let me just copy that down.

121
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:30.400
Now,

122
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.770
just for completeness.

123
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.930
What we could have done if we were actually looking for the part numbers was do something

124
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:36.730
very simple.

125
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.500
Similar.

126
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.310
We're going to say equals If now let's let's forget a logical sense Let's just say cans if

127
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:55.500
open brackets Range column A B comma and the criteria we're looking for is part number one

128
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.500
,

129
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.120
and then we get a camp for that on all we're gonna do here it's a copy and then come right

130
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.640
to the end and say I'm a in India's plus exactly the same thing.

131
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.750
But this time we're gonna looking column B two.

132
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.410
So we're now looking for part numbers apart number two in the same column.

133
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.210
So I'm just changing that to be on enter and that way we can see Let me just can't copy

134
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.670
that names.

135
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.410
I'm not next,

136
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.130
you Tater they go.

137
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.530
You can see that here.

138
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.180
We've managed to count Emily instances of this.

139
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.180
Plus,

140
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.050
this exist in the other sheets.

141
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.420
I'll leave that in there just in case you want to play with it.

142
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.420
Now,

143
00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.150
back to the assumption that the description is the unique identify or we're gonna do is

144
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.250
we're gonna copy all of these descriptions here,

145
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.800
flip over to the count sheets and just paste them under here.

146
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.120
I'm just gonna pay special.

147
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.650
No,

148
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.170
I'm going to go to sheet too.

149
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.110
And I'm gonna copy exactly the same thing Control and say,

150
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.000
flip over to the count sheets and paste under here A realize you're not going to see all of

151
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.600
that on the screen.

152
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.450
But what I'm gonna do,

153
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.620
select all of that data or come down some groups,

154
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.840
I'll come down so you can see that I have actually hit the bottom of the data not to let me

155
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.330
go up a bit.

156
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.540
So,

157
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.730
Lee,

158
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.610
she was a little bit more OK,

159
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.360
the bottom one slightly out to shot.

160
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.200
Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna come over to the dang attack.

161
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.660
We're gonna hit,

162
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.490
remove duplicates and we're looking a column A We're going to click.

163
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.020
OK,

164
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.690
and 11 Jew pickup values were found on removed.

165
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.820
So all I'm induced.

166
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.610
Click OK.

167
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.240
And then what we should be left with though it's slightly off screen is a list of all the

168
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.850
unique entries.

169
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.790
Now,

170
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.530
I'm just going to talk to that up.

171
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.970
Going back to the home ribbon a making alphabetical Just cause it's pretty to read that way

172
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.630
you can see we have a random hammer in there.

173
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.220
Now,

174
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.780
this is just a duplication.

175
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.550
What we've just done.

176
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:54.830
It's just account if plus another counted so equals can't if open rackets the range is she

177
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.080
One column see the description common.

178
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.180
And I'm gonna come back to here,

179
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.020
and I'm looking at this close brackets.

180
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.960
Plus she two column C comma on again.

181
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.160
I am looking at exactly the same thing.

182
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.870
This and so we're looking for bolt one.

183
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.770
You neither column C of sheet one or Colin Chief seats hip sheet to hit.

184
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.640
Enter and ive obviously missed something.

185
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.610
Can't if a plus,

186
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.920
okay,

187
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.580
obviously have the count.

188
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.650
If in theirs will cans if open brackets and that should do it.

189
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.820
Okay,

190
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.350
so Bolt one appears once between the two sheets,

191
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.540
the use appear to let me just change the data a little bit.

192
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.450
So not three.

193
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.530
Let's have no three in there a few times.

194
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.750
And hopefully when we find not three on here,

195
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.290
they note three appears four times,

196
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.890
it appears,

197
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.440
Appears on here it once.

198
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.180
It appears on here once,

199
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.430
and it's appears on the here three times.

200
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.540
So the count is for hopefully that makes sense.

201
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.700
If you have any questions,

202
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.790
just let me know.

203
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.550
I'll see you in the next lecture
