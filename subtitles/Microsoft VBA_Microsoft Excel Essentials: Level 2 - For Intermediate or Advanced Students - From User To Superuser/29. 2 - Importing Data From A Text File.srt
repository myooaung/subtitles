1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,870
guys,

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,180
let's have a look at how we import some mawr data.

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:06,650
Now,

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,990
if you imagine the scenario of someone's just said who have another file in a text format

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,490
that has our department structure on it on what we're going to do now is create a space for

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,180
that by adding a new sheet by just clicking the plus Here,

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,110
I was gonna drag it over to the end on.

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:31,650
What we're gonna do is we're gonna come up to data we're going to choose from text.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,080
I'm just gonna nervy eight to my desktop and you can see here we have this file department

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,200
structure on.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,840
I'll put this in the download section so you can download it and have a play yourself just

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,580
can double click it on here.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,110
We get this import with it again so we can see that we could We have it set to delimited.

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,170
We can click next on.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,440
We can see that there.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,820
It's pretty much worked as exactly what it should do.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,140
We have employee number.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,110
Then we have the delimit er we have the department on the department name and they're on

20
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,120
the job title.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,860
I think that's the end of the data on we're gonna hit next.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,310
Andi them.

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,440
We're going to say finish.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,020
And this is where we want to pace the days room from a once.

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,850
I was just going to click.

26
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,550
OK,

27
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,010
they go.

28
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,490
So no,

29
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,940
we have a new data table in here.

30
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:28,960
So we have employee number departments and job title on DWI should have that for about 200

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,350
people,

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,050
which is the number of people in our HR database.

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,690
They go on.

34
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,470
What we're going to do is just change the title of this sheet here to say I've just chosen

35
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,210
rename on this is department structure departs meant stroke chow.

36
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,610
Okay,

37
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,890
so that's simply how you import data from a text file in the next lecture.

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,230
We're gonna have a look at how you import data from a word document.

39
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,750
So see you in the next lecture.
