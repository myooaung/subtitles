1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,840
guys,

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,730
welcome back.

4
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,010
Now hold on to your hats because we're going to cover an awful lot of ground in this

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:08,520
lecture.

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,180
Now,

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,390
what we're gonna do appears to be fairly straightforward.

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,880
What we're gonna work in here is this particular area.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:23,260
We conceive that we have 1234 text boxes or four cells that just have text in them so we

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,680
can see in the first cell.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,110
That says,

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,530
I declare that the above expenses are a true reflection of my expenses for week ending on,

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,400
then the date.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,690
Now,

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,340
obviously,

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,650
all of this text needs to remain constant.

17
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,660
But this last bit of text,

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,360
the date needs to change each time for each week that we do this.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,620
And again if we have a look at the second home and see June this week,

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,120
I traveled a total off.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,650
Now that will be constant.

22
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:55,140
60 miles that's going to change depended on the weak women for which I have claimed will

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,220
become sent on 24 pen.

24
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,910
So the value that we're going to be claiming will also change depending on the number of

25
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,120
miles they some my time away from home.

26
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,630
I am took I am claiming that will be constant.

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,780
25 pens will be a variable because that may change.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,400
So my toe total claim for this week is Andi.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
That will be constant and then £49 will change.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,140
So what we need to do is build a formula.

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,210
They will actually populate this,

32
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,660
but change the things that are going to change as they go through to stop you having to go

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,290
in and edit the text every time.

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay,

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,010
so let's have a look at how we do that.

36
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,950
Simply we can see here that we have a total off 60 miles now.

37
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,280
I think before we let me just change that back for a second,

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,810
I think we were traveling 100 miles.

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,480
There were only change that back to six expenses aereo 60 miles.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,950
So I traveled a total of 60 miles and 60 miles is reading from here.

41
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,830
We've got a couple of ways of doing this,

42
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,910
but what we're going to do just for simplicity's sake is demonstrate how we can turn that

43
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,670
from 60 to say 60 miles.

44
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,370
So let's have a look at building a simple formulas to do just that.

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,110
So we have our formula that says equal some of D 31 through J 31.

46
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,340
If we hit F two,

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,760
we can see that's just a straight some on that area there.

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,490
So let's just select that.

49
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,290
And just before the words some,

50
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,520
we're gonna have the word can.

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,450
Katyn eight.

52
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,110
Now all can Katyn.

53
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,530
Eight does is it joins text strings together.

54
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,950
So I've entered Can cattle eight open the brackets which will enclose the arguments And you

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,400
can see here the first thing that we require is text one.

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,190
Now we're gonna let this some be text one.

57
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,700
So I'm just gonna click to the end.

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm gonna hit comma and then I can see that the next entry is text to now I do want Texas,

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,340
so I'm gonna hit the quotes on the tight miles and then we're closed the quotes and close

60
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,100
the brackets.

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,240
So what we've done is we said,

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,290
build us a formula.

63
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,440
It's a concoct,

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,830
innate enjoin that text,

65
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,080
which is the answer six takes its a some of the cells and then add the word miles after it

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,200
in the arguments being separated by a comma.

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,890
So let's hit.

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,390
Enter Okay,

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,750
It's almost good,

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,590
but we have 60 miles with no space in between.

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,270
So let's just go back to the formula.

72
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,770
Just click after the quotes and before the M and hit a space and then it center.

73
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,370
So they go now.

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,650
Our an Assad is 60 miles.

75
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,450
But look what's happened here.

76
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,090
We can see that we now have a value.

77
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,720
Now let me just don't do what we've done already a few times.

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,260
So we can see here that that no saves 27 because it's looking at cell l 31.

79
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,950
But when we redo,

80
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,450
we can see that that no fails because you cannot do a calculation on a text string.

81
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,930
So let me just read you get that one right?

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,140
So we're gonna have to do is modify this formula instead of reference in cell l 31 which is

83
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,800
going to add in the original formula that was in cell 31.

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,160
What we doing equals some move over one equals to some of these cells just here.

85
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,550
Closed brackets and they go.

86
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,080
We've got out Miley's claim back.

87
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,960
So instead of reference in this cell,

88
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,800
all it's going to do is do a some and then multiply it by 4.5.

89
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,130
Sorry.

90
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,130
0.45 which is the 45 p a mile.

91
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:25,810
Okay,

92
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,290
so far,

93
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,690
so good.

94
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,350
So there we have the word 60 miles in there.

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,640
So let's have a look at this one.

96
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,250
So here again,

97
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,380
we can just build a simple concatenation so equals on Katyn,

98
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,900
Nate open rackets,

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,960
quotes.

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,750
Because all of this will be constant.

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,600
June this week I have traveled a total off.

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
I don't believe the space in there.

103
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,190
After the off,

104
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,170
they closed the quotes.

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,660
I leave 60 miles in there just so we can see what we're gonna dio.

106
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,320
Let's just put a comma.

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,590
Ah,

108
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,720
Then we want to space.

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,250
So common open quotes.

110
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,760
Space for which I have claimed space Close brackets,

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,010
comma Andi.

112
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,510
Then close off the brackets.

113
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,500
Okay,

114
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,020
so now the two things that we have to enter are the 60 miles on the £24.

115
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,070
So let's just leave.

116
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,460
I'll put that in quotes for a second,

117
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,650
just so we can remember that.

118
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,860
That's what we've got to do.

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,310
First,

120
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,220
we're gonna have a look at the 60 miles.

121
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,430
So let's delete the 60 miles Come on,

122
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,270
then let's click off and then scroll up until we find a way.

123
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,460
It's a 60 miles just there and hit.

124
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:42,860
Enter.

125
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,050
So there we can see.

126
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,310
Say it's doing this week.

127
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,190
I've traveled a total of 60 miles and 60 miles is reading directly from cell L one

128
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,170
fantastic,

129
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,200
for which I have claimed £24.

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:03,680
Now the £24 we need to change because that's gonna actually no B £2027 yet.

131
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,400
So all we need to do is reference L l 21 at the end for which I have claimed I still eat

132
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:23,350
that now and screw lips stroll up to a mileage claim off £27 and enter.

133
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,680
Okay,

134
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
Now we're almost there.

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
Foot there.

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,510
Would it saves June.

137
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,690
This week I traveled a total 60 miles.

138
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,620
Good for which I have claimed 27.

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,810
But if we look at this sell,

140
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,260
it actually saves 27.

141
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:44,250
It says parents sign 27.0 So what we need to do is change the format in on this sell here.

142
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,280
All this last part just here where it says 27.

143
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
So let's have a look at how we do that.

144
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,300
Okay.

145
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,810
What we need to do is edit this last part of the formula.

146
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,230
Now,

147
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,510
what we wanted to display,

148
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,860
as is text.

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,680
So we're going to now use the text function.

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,470
So I'm just going to type in text on that,

151
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,960
open the brackets,

152
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,550
we can see that the value will looking at l 21 which is exactly correct.

153
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,230
We're gonna hit comma because we no need to enter.

154
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,230
The arguments on the arguments are encapsulated in quotes.

155
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,180
So what we want to do is hit quotes.

156
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,670
We want to it the pound sign because it was formatted as apparent sign on.

157
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:30,720
We wanted to show the number as a current say So pound sign 0.0 on.

158
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,290
Then we close the quotes and then we can squidgy over to the very end on we can close the

159
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,710
brackets on hit,

160
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,920
enter and they go that no looks perfect.

161
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,100
No,

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,880
it's just doing this week I've traveled a total of 60 miles,

163
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,450
which it's red from above,

164
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,080
for which I have claimed £27 which is also captured from above.

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,040
So in here we have no used the concatenation formula,

166
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,560
but We've also built a custom text format,

167
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,670
so our text actually hits escape.

168
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,440
So our techs actually displaced correctly.

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,130
OK,

170
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,240
so we're going to do now is repeat that exercise for these of the cells.

171
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,250
So let's do that.

172
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,250
Okay.

173
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,460
Next up I declared that I that I declare that the above expensive true flexing my expenses

174
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,150
for week ending on then the date which it's going to be reading from up here.

175
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,540
So the game most of the work is done.

176
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,550
We're just gonna come out the front and say equals captain nights.

177
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,910
Open brackets,

178
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,090
open quotes,

179
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,400
I declared the above expensive a true reflection.

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,710
Expenses for week ending will leave the space at the end.

181
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,130
So the format is tightening.

182
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,010
Will hit close quote because that's the text ring that we want comma.

183
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,010
And then we're gonna delete the rest of it because what we want to reference this time,

184
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,910
let's say if I scroll up is keep going,

185
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:57,100
keep going the date and then I'm just gonna close the quotes enter so you can see that we

186
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,650
have the almost the right.

187
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,680
And so we have I declare the expenses blah,

188
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:00,880
blah,

189
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,150
blah.

190
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:08,200
Week ending 4 to 216 on the reason it says 42 16 is It's referenced the date as the number

191
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,580
of days since the turn of the 19 at the turn of the century 1900.

192
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,280
So again,

193
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,140
what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the text format by typing text open brackets.

194
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,640
I six is the value.

195
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,610
So we're gonna come pass that we're gonna tow comma.

196
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,490
Then we're gonna enter our format for our techs.

197
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,920
And what we want is the d d.

198
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,650
The date Month,

199
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,020
month,

200
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,630
months on end 1234 year close.

201
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,270
The quotes moved to the end.

202
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,320
Close the brackets in his enter.

203
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
So they go.

204
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,720
So now I declare that the above expenses are a true reflection blah,

205
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,500
blah blah for week ending 31st of July,

206
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,150
2015 which is no being read from this cell.

207
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,730
Okay,

208
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,620
so we've done that one.

209
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,430
We've done that one.

210
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,190
And there we're gonna do this one based on my time away from home.

211
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,510
I am claiming 25 pens which it needs to read from there.

212
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,590
This is exactly the same thing again.

213
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,060
Equals come.

214
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:14,760
Cats and eight open brackets open quotes because we're gonna keep all of that text I am

215
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,250
claiming will leave the space at the end.

216
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,680
Man closed,

217
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,720
quotes coming.

218
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Delete all that.

219
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,830
Andi.

220
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,410
That is the number we are claiming on closed brackets.

221
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,790
Enter on the game.

222
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,990
We can see that we just have 25.

223
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,650
So rather than saying £25 so we're gonna change the text format by entering text.

224
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,480
That is the value that we're evaluating.

225
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,250
Comer.

226
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,470
No,

227
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,190
we want to tell it in the formula open Quotes,

228
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,530
pound sign 0.0.

229
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,240
Close quotes close.

230
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,430
Brackets enter.

231
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,340
So that we can see based on my time away from home,

232
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,030
I am chained.

233
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,860
Am claiming £25.

234
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,240
Fantastic.

235
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,150
On my total claim for the week is that number there.

236
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,960
So my total claim from the week eagles come Katyn,

237
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,300
It's open brackets,

238
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,230
open quotes.

239
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,020
Because all of this is going to be constant.

240
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,360
Leave the space after the is closed.

241
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,690
Quotes come out.

242
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,890
Delete that.

243
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,860
And then we will point to hear my total claim.

244
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,770
Close quotes enter,

245
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,810
and then all we need to do is tied it at 52 up by changing this to a text format.

246
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,750
So t e X t open rackets.

247
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,420
L 50 is l value comma.

248
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,800
Open quotes,

249
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,610
payment sign.

250
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,030
Suter points inner zero.

251
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,250
Close quote close brackets and enter.

252
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,430
So there you go.

253
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,700
Now,

254
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,460
whatever values we have populated in the date on our mileage claiming our number of miles,

255
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,840
hamli miles have traveled total out of ours,

256
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,580
and our total claim will be easily and automatically built into this text.

257
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,150
A ring without any further need from modification.

258
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay,

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,970
so they go.

260
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,840
That's how you build tech strings.

261
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,120
Using formulas on Haiti can change some of your entries by using the text function within

262
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,790
the concussion.

263
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,060
Eight.

264
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,900
Okay.

265
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,060
See you in the next lecture.
