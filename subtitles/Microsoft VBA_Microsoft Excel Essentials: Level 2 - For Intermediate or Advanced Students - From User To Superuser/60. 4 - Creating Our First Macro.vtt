00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
OK,

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.080
guys.

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.810
Now we've added a hyperlink to each of our tabs.

4
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.700
What we're gonna do is find a quick way to get back to the index once would followed one of

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.750
the hyperlinks.

6
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.780
Now you'll probably know that you can use the back button just up here the undue which will

7
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.740
effectively do exactly the same thing and take you straight back to your index from whence

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.450
you came.

9
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.140
But what we're going to do is have a look at adding a macro to do precisely that.

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.760
Now,

11
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.480
at the moment at the top across your ribbon,

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.210
you may have the developer tab or you may not know if you do fantastic there with me.

13
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.050
A second will come back to you in a second.

14
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.300
But if you don't have the developer tab,

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.870
here's how you add it.

16
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.290
You go to file,

17
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
you go to options on,

18
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.430
then in options,

19
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.200
you'll come to customize ribbon on.

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.640
You will see down here all of the main tabs and you can see here that we have developer and

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.970
it's not being ticked.

22
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.360
So if you have this,

23
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.120
just click developer and click OK,

24
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.210
and now you'll have the developer ribbon.

25
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.070
So we can do is click on the developer ribbon.

26
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.480
That's where we want to be.

27
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.930
Now let's go to our first recipe tab,

28
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.950
which is BLT on.

29
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.300
What we're gonna do is hit record,

30
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.850
Macro.

31
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.040
And we're just gonna leave that names macro one.

32
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.780
At the moment,

33
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.670
we're going to click.

34
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.480
OK,

35
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.290
now what we're gonna do is just click the index tab and then you can see this little button

36
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.690
down the bottom here,

37
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.400
which is Ah,

38
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.630
Square is to stop recording or equally,

39
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.440
you can just hit.

40
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.310
Stop recording there.

41
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.310
So let's just click.

42
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.100
Stop recording and they go.

43
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.760
We've just recorded our first macro.

44
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.380
So to get to your macro,

45
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.350
you can hit bowls and f 11.

46
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.670
And that will open this window,

47
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.720
which I'm just gonna have to dragon two shots so you can see it.

48
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.250
There me just one second.

49
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.740
Here we go.

50
00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.090
This is the visual basic for applications Window on.

51
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670
This is made up of three areas.

52
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.040
Your projects VB a project.

53
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.850
The properties of the sheet you are in on.

54
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.460
If we scroll down here,

55
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.840
you will see a new thing is being added,

56
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.130
which say's plus on a little box and model.

57
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.400
So we're just going to click on the plus on.

58
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.330
We just couldn't DoubleClick module one on.

59
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.930
There you go.

60
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.840
There is your first macro on what that macro does,

61
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.230
and it's called macro one.

62
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.780
Any feeling Green is just a comment on his non execute herbal code.

63
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.510
And that's indicated by this little apostrophe,

64
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.950
which means it's a remark on this is the good stuff.

65
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.350
This is the execute herbal code.

66
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.370
So what we're gonna do is just rename this.

67
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.090
You cannot have spaces in your names for your subroutines.

68
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.080
That's what a macro is.

69
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.050
A subroutine.

70
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:59.700
So what we're gonna say is go to my index on that will be the name of our macro.

71
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.900
Okay,

72
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.510
so now we have a macro.

73
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.600
What are we going to do with it?

74
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.380
Let me just click off there for a second.

75
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.990
We're gonna go to our B l t.

76
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.370
We're going to come back to our macro by hitting Bolt and F 11 and then we're gonna click

77
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.220
in here on the execute civil code,

78
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.820
which is the code in black.

79
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.170
We're gonna press this button the wrong,

80
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.810
the F five.

81
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.240
So what you can see at the moment in this sheet is we're on BLT on.

82
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.550
When we run this macro,

83
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.990
we go straight back to index,

84
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.830
which is exactly what we want to do.

85
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.760
OK,

86
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.450
so now we've recorded a macro.

87
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.710
How do we call it?

88
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.900
Well,

89
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.850
we have two ways of doing this.

90
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.400
So let me just come back to the sheet for a second,

91
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.800
right?

92
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.080
Okay,

93
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.340
so we're back in BLT on.

94
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.550
We have two ways of accessing a macro.

95
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.390
What we could do is go to Mac Rose,

96
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.710
which would bring up macros.

97
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.990
And there's our new one that we just created.

98
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:04.450
Go to my index on what we could do with this macro is select options on what we could do is

99
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.960
add keyboard shortcut key.

100
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.060
So that would be control Andi,

101
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.470
which ever key that you select.

102
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.060
Now,

103
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.510
be very careful when you selected these,

104
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.550
because there are some that are already pre defined,

105
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.500
such as control and be will be bold control and I will be italics.

106
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.100
So if you choose something that's commonly used,

107
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.060
the chances are when they use that uses this sheet.

108
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.900
So it is not you that using it.

109
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.530
They're gonna expect control on D B to make something bold.

110
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.350
But if you've signed control and be to this macro,

111
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.470
this macro is gonna execute.

112
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.780
So be very careful when you choose control shortcuts from there.

113
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.990
What I'm gonna choose,

114
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.900
I'm gonna country choose control and t I'm not entirely sure what control anti does of the

115
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.350
less just says Okay on,

116
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.560
then,

117
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.410
close that.

118
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.950
And now I'm in the sheet.

119
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.960
And if I hit control on t,

120
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.460
the macro executes air immediately.

121
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.350
Go back to index.

122
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.910
Now,

123
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.100
I don't think I can upload files with Macron's recorded,

124
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.230
but just follow those steps in the fall that you download and you'll be able to add this.

125
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.120
It will be nice and easy so we can go to Mac Rose,

126
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.920
choose it,

127
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.850
choose options and assign a keyboard shortcut there.

128
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.360
I'm just gonna delete that because I'm not entirely sure what Control and T does and click

129
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.040
Council.

130
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.680
Andi,

131
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.040
that's the way to access a macro through a keyboard shortcut.

132
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.700
The next thing we're going to do in the next lecture is have a look how we assign that to a

133
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.320
button.

134
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.040
Okay,

135
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.450
I'll see you in the next lecture.
