1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Okay,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,740
guys.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,440
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,730
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,250
Lecture.

6
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,380
Now this question is from Jamala,

7
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,560
and Jim Ellis says I'm using an array formula to build up a range of values in getting the

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,200
average.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,210
How can I use the summits function and not can't blank cells there,

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,120
the head of the questions using an array formula to sum up summits.

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,400
And you don't actually need to use an array formula to do this because in the ifs,

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,430
that s part one of the criteria can be Is the sell blank or not reading further on?

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,060
For instance,

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,040
there are two departments and we're trying to get the every salaries of the first

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,250
department on the second departments are not an average of the whole of the salaries,

16
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,950
but split that out into the average between department one and department to.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,580
So here's a spreadsheet that you can download.

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,090
It's called the Ifs.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,120
Now I'm just gonna walk you through all of these different permutations.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,750
So here we have a straight some.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,470
If what we're going to say is equal some if open brackets with something,

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,460
columns say so.

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,620
Everything in everything in columns,

24
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,050
say,

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,150
And here's the crisis area doesn't equal blank.

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,720
Now you have to enclose this in quotes.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,080
So we have open quotes less than great to them,

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,550
therefore doesn't equal close quotes.

29
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,940
Andi double quotes,

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,510
which is which is blank.

31
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,770
So some columns see if it doesn't equal blank.

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,680
And if I just drag over that here,

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,100
you can see that we get an answer to 81732 And that's the answer that we get here now to

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,500
work out the summits of everything that's in department wanted the or deeper or department

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:45,970
to.

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,040
We're going to use this Some ifs.

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,930
So in the summits were going to say some ifs.

38
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,950
Open brackets was still something,

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
columns say,

40
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,040
but we are wanting to look in column B.

41
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,590
This is our first criteria range.

42
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,980
We want to look at the value one.

43
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,430
So I'm clicking F three so looking column bay for anything that matches one on day.

44
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,970
Then do that doesn't equal blanks.

45
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:18,690
Open quotes doesn't equal close quotes group Mr Close Crude someone Andi blanks in here to

46
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,140
enter and then you go.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,400
Let me just copy that down.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,390
So the sum of all of the things all of the people with a salary in department one is 1 to

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,950
172682 I'm just copy that formula Dam.

50
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,280
But this time I'm looking at to So everything in column B that begins with two is going to

51
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,240
some over here If it isn't blank.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,730
OK,

53
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,430
so just a sanity check.

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,350
Let's see what the sum is are made its to 81 just as it was before.

55
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:55,960
Now I can't if can't if works in just the same way so we can say count if looking all of

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,860
columns say on look for open quote So this is our criteria range and this is our criteria.

57
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,050
Open quotes doesn't equal Andi double quotes,

58
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,370
blank close quotes on enter making.

59
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:16,170
See that we get 16 interest Now We're getting 16 interests because we have a heading of

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,420
salary now.

61
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:17,730
Obviously,

62
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,530
that's not gonna work because salary isn't these air just ahead in.

63
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,050
So we don't want to include those so over to the camps.

64
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,380
If,

65
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,440
since exactly the same as the summits,

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,610
what we're going to say is count ifs range,

67
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,310
BB.

68
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,900
This is where we're looking to Kent.

69
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,700
If the criteria equals F three.

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,300
So if one appears in here and in C C.

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,250
This is our second criteria.

72
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,590
Range doesn't equal open quotes less than great than close quote Andi.

73
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,320
Double quotes blank.

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,950
So B B equals one and Sisi doesn't equal blank and enter.

75
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,370
We can see that we get nine entries for department one that actually do have a salary just

76
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,320
copying that down.

77
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,330
And here we have six entries in department two that have salaries.

78
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,560
So those to add up to 15.

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,200
Whereas if we just did a count,

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,220
if would include that salary and get 16.

81
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,970
So from there we can just divide the summits.

82
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,770
So everyone in department one with salary by the camp tiffs everyone in department.

83
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:34,350
One moment of salary on we get 19,186 89 copying that down for department to we get 18,175

84
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,800
is the average salary.

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,340
But we don't need to go through all those stages to get to Iran.

86
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,350
So what we can do is use the average ifs.

87
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,390
So what we have here is average ifs,

88
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,380
open brackets.

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,210
Sisi is our average rain showing again looking in column C then we come to our criteria,

90
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,370
range criteria,

91
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,080
criteria,

92
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,260
range criteria.

93
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,760
And you can go on and on and on with this.

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,650
I'm not sure how many times per mature.

95
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,560
It's quite a lot.

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,030
Well,

97
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,350
you'll ever likely to need.

98
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,880
So we're gonna be doing an average from column Say our criteria range is B.

99
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,040
And here we are looking for the criteria equals one.

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,970
So anyone in department one is going to be included and then the numbers in columns.

101
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,450
See,

102
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,930
this is our second criteria range.

103
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,070
We're gonna look for exactly that same thing again.

104
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,270
Does not equal blank.

105
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:31,200
So open quotes less than greater than close quotes does not equal Andi that.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,420
So we string it together,

107
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,270
double quotes,

108
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,850
blank.

109
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,380
When we hit enter,

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:42,830
we get the average for department one is 19,186 89 which is exactly the same number we got

111
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,250
when we won't step manually.

112
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:52,240
Copy the formula down and the average salary for department to folks is 18,000 175.

113
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,410
I hope that helps,

114
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,870
but is always if there any questions do let me know and I'll be happy to help Have a great

115
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,990
day and I'll see you in the next lecture
