1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,330
OK,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:02,690
guys.

3
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,490
Now let's have a look.

4
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,300
A short cut to save.

5
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,720
Having to keep modifying formulas to change the column number.

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,640
Now this is that the sheet?

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,120
We were just looking at returning,

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,500
returning multiple values to know,

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,430
Just deleted this thing stuff from over here.

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,680
If you need to have a play with it,

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,030
it still lives in the first sheet on.

12
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,840
I'm just highlighted this area around here where our formulas live.

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,740
So no,

14
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,700
we know that this formula works perfectly,

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,150
but we have not adjusted.

16
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,550
These are the ones yet.

17
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,410
So what we gonna do is,

18
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:34,830
first,

19
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,560
we're going to copy that formula down.

20
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,850
So now that one works perfectly on,

21
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,080
we're gonna delete everything else.

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,560
Okay?

23
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,430
There are two ways that we can modify this formula.

24
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,840
So when we drag it over,

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,310
we just get the column numbers on.

26
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,780
We've kind of already looks at this in an earlier lecture.

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,250
Not so long back where we use this particular function here.

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,850
Row 1 to 1.

29
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,250
There won't row want toe wonders.

30
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,350
You'll remember when we drag it around the first time it appears it's row one toe.

31
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,090
Want them row 2 to 2 in row.

32
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,030
3 to 3 as you move it around.

33
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,210
But it wouldn't surprise you to know that we also have the equivalent version,

34
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,330
which is column.

35
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,470
So if we typed column oh,

36
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,240
from brackets now,

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,520
obviously columns have letter so we say a to I close brackets and enter.

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,370
We return the volume one that returned the number one because column A is the first column

39
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:32,370
.

40
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,650
If we drag it across,

41
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,590
we get 123 So column A is one column B B is two column.

42
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,070
Sisi is three.

43
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:48,070
So all we need to do with this formula now instead of having column one where we're looking

44
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:56,770
column one there will just replace that and say Cullen A to I and closer brackets.

45
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,400
Now remember,

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,180
this is still an array formula.

47
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,970
So we hit control shift and enter,

48
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,060
and we still get Lucas on.

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,050
We're going to copy that all the way down Control and D.

50
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:12,890
So you can see now that although formulas say column A at the end Now,

51
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,760
when we drank this over,

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,990
it's gonna know,

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,400
Say,

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,660
change the A to B B,

55
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:18,970
C,

56
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,330
C,

57
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:26,420
D D e f f control and are And there you go and that's where the magic happens.

58
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,190
So you don't have to go in every time clicking here and change the column number.

59
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,760
Let me just tied up the format in their short thing,

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,050
Let's say so.

61
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,490
They go.

62
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,280
You can no use the column if you use a sequential column number.

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,300
So you're gonna pull dates from 123456 on that all in a row,

64
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,920
that's the way to do it.

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,540
Just use the coal number now.

66
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:47,940
Obviously,

67
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,760
if you want to skip column A and begin straight a column B,

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,570
you just type column B B,

69
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,880
then drag that over and then your pull data from Columns B,

70
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,150
which is 23456 and so on again.

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,540
And there is one of the way that works perfectly well.

72
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,460
If the columns that you pulling up all next to each other and just use this column function

73
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,180
again I want to do for the 2nd 1 is I'm just gonna highlight another area just here.

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,890
Let's color that in a different color.

75
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,210
Let's say that rather distasteful orange.

76
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,960
Let's have that and we're going to copy this formula here,

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,460
controlling seat escape on DPI paste it in their control shift and enter.

78
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,590
So this one still works perfectly well,

79
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,370
cause it's exactly the same formula.

80
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,290
But this time,

81
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,320
what we're gonna do is we're going to use a helper column across the top here.

82
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,920
Now we're sorry.

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,850
Help A row across the top.

84
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,520
We've used help of columns before,

85
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:52,160
when we looked at concatenation for V lookups and the women do here beside 123456 So,

86
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,940
this time,

87
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,680
with this cell instead of looking column A,

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,140
I just couldn't delete all of that in there.

89
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,860
I'm just gonna point to this cell here.

90
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,600
So now when this formula looks for which column to go to,

91
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,430
it's just gonna look here confined the answer one.

92
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:09,950
Now,

93
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:10,440
obviously,

94
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,150
we're going to drank this down.

95
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,780
So we always wanted to reference this particular cell.

96
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,410
So we're gonna change our absolute cell reference in which you'll remember you do by

97
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,400
pressing F four.

98
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,780
So at the moment we have a 28 which,

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,100
if we dragged it around to the right,

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,220
would change to be 28 c 28.

101
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,500
If we drowned it down,

102
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:40,860
it would change from a 28 8 29 So therefore once and it always is a and always 28.

103
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,970
But we do want it to move when we drag it over here.

104
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,570
So what we're gonna do is hit f four again,

105
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,200
eh?

106
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,370
So what we're saying no is that it will always being column.

107
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,040
Sorry,

108
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,230
it won't always be in column A but it will always be at line 28 which exactly what we want

109
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,230
.

110
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:03,550
So you want a absolute 28 control shift and enter,

111
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,490
and that works perfectly well on weaken Drank that down on now,

112
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,510
weaken dragged that across control and are and you can see let me just kind of formatting

113
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,510
upon their short,

114
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,210
bigger.

115
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:24,070
So now you can see that all of these formulas a referencing this sell directly above it in

116
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,990
this line.

117
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,880
So here we're looking at D 28 which is this cell on its return in the fourth.

118
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,830
This is particularly useful if you decide that you don't actually want these to appear in

119
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,960
exactly the same order you could say.

120
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Well,

121
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,520
actually,

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,320
I want to see the first the full name first.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,800
So then all you need to do rather modify all the formulas It's just change this to three

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,340
and then you get look around and you could say,

125
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:48,470
Well,

126
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:48,890
actually,

127
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,760
I want to see the national insurance number.

128
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,450
Next on national insurance number,

129
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,520
we know lives in column four.

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,470
So we'll change that to four said.

131
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,260
Then we get our national insurance number.

132
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,110
Then I want to see the date of birth,

133
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,370
which is six so he can hit six.

134
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,560
Then they get the date of birth,

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,750
which we obviously need to change the formatting up.

136
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,140
General.

137
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,960
Short date.

138
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,450
I hate it when that happens.

139
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,170
Then we may choose to see the first name.

140
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,950
Then we may choose to see the last name on.

141
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,120
Then for good.

142
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,050
It's doing it again and let me just change that.

143
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,150
Okay,

144
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,990
so they go by introducing a helper row.

145
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,170
You can save having to modify all of these formulas,

146
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,200
and it's a very fast and efficient way to change the order in which your data appears.

147
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,790
There's some would argue.

148
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,950
That looks a bit of glee,

149
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,840
but there's a very simple solution to that.

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,270
You can just highlight the entire row,

151
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,320
come up to here and change.

152
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,040
The fund collapsed to white,

153
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,330
so although that works perfectly well.

154
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:46,590
See,

155
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,660
we still have value for in there.

156
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,570
We can still change this toe.

157
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,400
Whatever we wanted to say on it will work perfectly.

158
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:54,950
Obviously,

159
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,290
if you don't want users to play around and daily that you could just hide it so right,

160
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,470
click on hide.

161
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,920
So there you go.

162
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,400
That's one quick way of changing your column number by using the column function.

163
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,940
If the columns that you're gonna pull are sequential like a BBC C and so on and so forth or

164
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,280
using a help a row and just adding the column number in here on referencing that in your

165
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,830
formula Okay,

166
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,000
so you in the next lecture.
