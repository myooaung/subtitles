00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
okay,

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.140
goes now we can have a look at entry in dates on times no.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.230
Everyone knows how to enter a date into Excel on s.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.280
Today is Thursday the 30th of July.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.730
I'm just going to go ahead inside 30 slash seven on when they center,

6
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.030
you can see that excels automatically recognize that as a date and chosen its default date

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.370
formatting options.

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.690
So it actually saves 30 Dash Jewell now,

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.730
because we want to use a week ending rather than the than the actual date.

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.490
Unless today happens to be a Friday and we're choosing our week end as a Friday,

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.700
what we're gonna have to do is do some calculations to work out what it is now.

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.230
We could use Excel to do that,

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.210
or we could just add it up in our head.

14
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.010
So if I didn't know that July had 31 days and have to recite the poem,

15
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.850
30 days has September,

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.520
April,

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.150
June and November all the rest of 31 all that kind of stuff.

18
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.630
But there's a quicker way to do this by changing the format to a custom formatting excel so

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.670
you can instantly say,

20
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.470
actually,

21
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.190
30th of July is a Thursday s.

22
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.310
So what we're gonna do is we're going to right click on here on this cell on.

23
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.630
We're going to choose format cells.

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.900
Now.

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.320
I'm just gonna drag down into shot just there right now.

26
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.350
What you can see,

27
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.000
the moments have look at date is that we have a variety of different dates available to us

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.300
so we could see this and it would say,

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.670
30th of the seventh.

30
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.830
We could say this,

31
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.530
and it would say,

32
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.700
30th or 30 July 2015 sonar so forth all the way down.

33
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.690
But what we're gonna do is we're gonna allow own custom.

34
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.520
So let's just click on the custom,

35
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.800
man.

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.550
We see we have,

37
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.050
ah,

38
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.240
a bunch of different ways of format in this,

39
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.120
and it's very simple.

40
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.700
To change it or we're going to do is highlight the type section just here and delete.

41
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.890
Now we can see that the sample sales for 2 to 15 which probably doesn't mean much to at the

42
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.290
moment.

43
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.690
But we're going to cover that in a lecture in this section.

44
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.340
Right?

45
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:10.160
So what we want to do to see the if we wanted to see 30 jaw or 30 07 2015 we would type D D

46
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.160
,

47
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.400
which gives us the date we could type an M and that would say 07 begin to type space and

48
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.420
hit y y so that we'd have 37 15 or if we wanted to dash in between we would say D d dash M

49
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.140
M dash y Y,

50
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.520
and then we can see 30-7 Dash 15 in our sample window.

51
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.310
But if we hit three days,

52
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.600
we can see that instantly.

53
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.390
It goes to Thursday so that we can say Thursday hitter space d d the 30th on.

54
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850
Then we come on to the months now if we hear em,

55
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.140
we get one digit.

56
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.830
If we eat em em,

57
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.060
it will say 07 because July is the seventh month.

58
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.890
If we hit 1/3 M,

59
00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.350
we can see that it will actually change it to say job eso Let's say let's keep it like that

60
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.350
.

61
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.660
So let's say 30th Thursday,

62
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.900
30th jaw,

63
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.670
let's say yeah,

64
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.180
yeah,

65
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.240
so they go.

66
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.390
That's how we build a custom formats.

67
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.340
So we say D d d space that will tell us the day of the week.

68
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.920
Dee Dee tells us the date on and M shows us the month in a shortened format as a word

69
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.270
rather than the number on 15 is the year.

70
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.330
So let's just hit.

71
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.100
Enter now that's much simpler to do.

72
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.510
So no,

73
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.570
If it's a Thursday,

74
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.250
I can say that.

75
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.500
Look,

76
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.110
just type 30th of July and that's a Thursday and actually wanted to be a Friday.

77
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.400
So it's just add 12 so they go can instantly see that the 31st of July is a Friday because

78
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.400
tell the cell tells me that's on.

79
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.770
Obviously,

80
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.810
today we can work out very quickly every day of the week s.

81
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:55.750
So if we said let's have a look at the 25th of December 2006 or 2016 we can see the

82
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.250
Christmas next year falls on Sunday.

83
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.460
They know sneezy,

84
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.810
so we want the end of the week.

85
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.400
So 37th 215 they go.

86
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.480
So that's how you do a custom format for your dates now.

87
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.810
Time Very,

88
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.810
very similar notes.

89
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.620
Some people mistakenly entered time as a decimal,

90
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.060
so they said 9 30 There was a 9.5 that's nine have nine hours on behalf on our besides,

91
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.420
but all times are separated with colon.

92
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.100
So if we're going to start our day at nine o'clock,

93
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.970
we'll type nine Coolum 00 and hit.

94
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.470
Enter.

95
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.080
Now,

96
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.750
if we wanted to display the seconds to we could also have a look.

97
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.270
A custom format for that.

98
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.760
So again,

99
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.770
we're gonna choose format cells.

100
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.960
We're gonna have a look at the customer.

101
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.220
We can see here that we have hh h Cole on M m on from our sample.

102
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.450
That will give us nine oclock in the morning.

103
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.380
If we wanted to add seconds,

104
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.740
we could just come up to here.

105
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.050
Hit the colon.

106
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.200
Hit second seconds hit,

107
00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.630
Enter.

108
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.420
And there you can see that our entry,

109
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.570
although we haven't actually changed the entry will be formatted a zero knowing coal on

110
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.680
nine hours 000 minutes.

111
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.450
Colon and 000 seconds.

112
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.150
Okay,

113
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.460
so that's how you create a custom format.

114
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.430
Let me just go back and choose hours,

115
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.850
hours,

116
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.260
minutes,

117
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.850
minutes because we're not done interested in seconds.

118
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.580
Okay,

119
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.280
let's let's populate some data.

120
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.230
Just so I retain that formatting,

121
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.430
I'm just gonna copy those cells over and then change the Times.

122
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.100
So Monday we're going to start at nine o'clock on.

123
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.280
We'll have lunch at midday.

124
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.380
We're gonna have half of their was lunch.

125
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.230
So we're going to come back at 12.

126
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:37.490
30 on.

127
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.220
We're gonna finish it.

128
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.450
Five cause five is a fantastic time to finish work.

129
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.650
I'm just going to copy those down.

130
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.720
So there you go.

131
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.360
We've managed to custom for matter of times,

132
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.960
and we've custom formatted every day.

133
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.600
So we have a bunch of data that we can play with.

134
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.610
OK.

135
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.090
And the next let's we're gonna have a look at Do some simple calculations on time.

136
00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.590
Okay,

137
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.760
So you in the next lecture.
