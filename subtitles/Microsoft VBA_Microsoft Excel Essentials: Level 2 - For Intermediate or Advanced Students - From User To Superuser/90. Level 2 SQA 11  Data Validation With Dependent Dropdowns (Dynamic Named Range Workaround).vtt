00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.730
guys.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.330
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.130
Questions answered Video.

5
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.750
Now,

6
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
this question is from prescient pressure notice something that I've never noticed.

7
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.890
In the last video,

8
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.050
we have a look at how to create a dependent drop down list from a primary dropped enlist.

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.510
So here we have five categories we have main category on the data is this we have

10
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.610
subcategory one.

11
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.250
So category 23 on before they're what Prashant had done.

12
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.830
Let me just go to name Manager.

13
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.400
He had set up his dependent drop down lists as dynamic named Rangers.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.070
Now,

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.950
I've only sets up number one here just so I can show you why it is so we have the main

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.730
categories a dynamic named range which,

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.880
if I click in here,

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.750
you can see is going to be this status that just here.

19
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.020
And if I click on this on D do the same thing,

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.920
you can see that this is our second dynamic named range.

21
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.880
But look what happens in here when subcategory,

22
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.170
oneness picks and we go through the same process that we went through previously.

23
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.510
You say data validation,

24
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.550
data validation equals list.

25
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.830
Then we used the indirect function to point to sell G two.

26
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.000
So we're gonna say in direct open brackets point to G to closer brackets and hit.

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.610
Enter on.

28
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.690
There you go.

29
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.880
The source currently evaluates to an error.

30
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640
Do you want to continue now?

31
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.450
The reason for that is you cannot have a dependent drop down list Looking at a dynamic

32
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.910
named range.

33
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.150
If these were static name ranges,

34
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.240
that would be fine.

35
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.180
But there is a way to work around this.

36
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.090
So your dependent drop down lists,

37
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.830
your subcategory 123 and four can still be dynamic.

38
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.200
You just cannot use a dynamic named range to do it.

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.560
So what we're gonna have to do is write formula and use it directly in the data validation

40
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.560
.

41
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.810
So here's how you do it.

42
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.160
We're going to use a lot of things that we've used before and we go introduce something I'm

43
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.460
not sure we've covered in the course,

44
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.770
which is the C H a r,

45
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860
which is the character function.

46
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.780
So I'm just going to step you through these.

47
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.210
The first thing we want to do is we want want to find out where subcategory one lives in a

48
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.780
row one and for that we're going to use the match function so we have match.

49
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.320
Look at the value in G to look it.

50
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.110
Look at one toe one,

51
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.530
which is Row one comma zero,

52
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.700
which is return an exact match,

53
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.740
and we can see some.

54
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.400
Category one lives at Position 12 in Row one,

55
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.710
So that's where we get out to now.

56
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.900
The next thing is the C H a r.

57
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.830
The character function now the character function.

58
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.380
Basically,

59
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.870
if you look at your keyboard,

60
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.920
every every symbol,

61
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.560
every letter,

62
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.260
every number,

63
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.940
the you can see has an ask a character that's the American Standard Code for Information,

64
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.830
Interchange and Excel.

65
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.550
Abbreviate that to the C H a R.

66
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.690
Now what we want to actually get to are the column letters.

67
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.200
So if we said C H a r 64 well,

68
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.490
actually,

69
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.130
if you said 65 we would get toe A,

70
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.220
which is our first column later.

71
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.100
But when we use in our match function,

72
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.550
we want to add to the character number.

73
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.790
So if we said a plus one,

74
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.190
if we said if we started with character 64 we will get to a when we add one because we're

75
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.990
gonna add to to carry to 64.

76
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.700
We're going to get to character 60 five at Sorry 66.

77
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.170
I can't do basic maths,

78
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.300
which is be on subcategory one lives in column B.

79
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.980
So we're going to use the match function to determine determine how many we add to 64.

80
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.080
And in this instance,

81
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.590
it's going to be too.

82
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.120
So using that,

83
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.770
combining those two together,

84
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.200
we're going to say CO 2 64 which I think is the at symbol,

85
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.400
plus the number we return from matching G two in Row.

86
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.190
One exact match,

87
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.980
which we know from here is to so 64 plus two gives us be,

88
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.350
which is the column that are category one lives in.

89
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.770
The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take that formula on.

90
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.480
We're just going to use it a couple of times and build a string that say's BB.

91
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.480
So we're going to use that formula.

92
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.530
The ampersand quotes,

93
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.610
Cohen quotes.

94
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.220
That's going to give us our separator,

95
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.170
Andi,

96
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.160
and we're going to repeat the formula again.

97
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.460
So we get the string B two B.

98
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.250
Now What we want to do is we want to find out how many values we should be looking at.

99
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.730
Ah,

100
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.270
height in column B.

101
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.670
So what we're gonna do is take that formula,

102
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.520
which is here.

103
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.020
We're going to use the indirect function which we've looked at,

104
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.830
which is going to tell Excel that we're actually looking at a range on the spreadsheet and

105
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.030
we're going to use the Count A which is going to return to four.

106
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.220
If we looked at B B,

107
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.030
as you can see down here because we also have the head in and we actually want to subtract

108
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.830
one from that because the data range itself is not the heading,

109
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.560
it's the three Bellow.

110
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.920
So that's where we get out three from.

111
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.560
Okay,

112
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.600
they're just to recap on the syntax of the dynamic named Range is what we have is offset

113
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.740
Start point rows away.

114
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.000
Columnist away the height of the data range in the width of the data range.

115
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.390
So just to quickly run through that,

116
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.380
we're gonna have an offset starting it a 11 road down,

117
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.870
however many rows away that we find subcategory warm,

118
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.150
which is going to be here,

119
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.230
and the next thing we knew need to do is work out the height,

120
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.250
which we're going to use.

121
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.110
The formula that we just looked at the count A of the indirect minus one.

122
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.250
So that's going to give us a date.

123
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.240
A height of three and Hamli columns wide.

124
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.810
We want to go where we just want to go.

125
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.850
One column white because that is all we're looking for.

126
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.240
So this is what the formula will look like.

127
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.370
We'll have offset will begin it.

128
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.320
A one will move one road down,

129
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.300
which has put Mr Road to we use that match function to return the column that this lives in

130
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.300
.

131
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.180
Which is to that we're going to use the county in direct on that function where we looked

132
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.680
and built that string to say,

133
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.480
B b which is going to give us our height,

134
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.790
which is this.

135
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.640
And don't forget,

136
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.530
we subtract him one at the very end.

137
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.660
So we disregard in the category heading on.

138
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.890
We're just going to use one with a wits of one.

139
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.360
So all I'm going to do is copy that entire formula hits escape.

140
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.710
I'm gonna come to this cell,

141
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.340
and we're going to go through the process that we went through before data validation.

142
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.950
Data validation.

143
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.060
We are gonna allow list on this time.

144
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.440
We're gonna type equals and paste out formula.

145
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.950
Then when we hit enter,

146
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.510
we find that we do get a drop down box.

147
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.120
So subcategory one should display 11 12 and 13.

148
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.020
And when we hit that,

149
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.310
it's very small.

150
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.950
But you can see we have 11.

151
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.100
We have 12 on.

152
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:32.350
We have 13 because our dynamic part of the formula now lives in the data validation.

153
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.560
So just test that out.

154
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.160
If we choose subcategory two or three,

155
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.260
we should only have one option,

156
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.520
which is going to give us a lab.

157
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.760
Whatever.

158
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.170
Nice.

159
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:52.150
That teen has 13 I think a type 13 in there or mistyped a 31 year 31.

160
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:58.840
And if we pick subcategory to the writings really small on this new laptop of mine,

161
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.020
you can see that we get 21 21.

162
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.780
And if we chose the bottom option,

163
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.070
we get down to 24 24.

164
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.100
So there you go.

165
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.370
That's how you work around a le.

166
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:17.400
That's how we use a dependent drop down list when your ranges are dynamic.

167
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.300
But you cannot use a dynamic named range.

168
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.040
Just drop it straight into the doubt.

169
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.150
Data validation.

170
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.060
Okay,

171
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.720
as always.

172
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.430
Any questions do let me know,

173
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.950
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
