1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,000
guys.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,170
In this final section on the H R database,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,770
Master,

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,460
I've added a new tab called Christian name Search on.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,160
What we're going to do from here is we're gonna have a single Christian name that we type

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,190
in here on.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,970
We're going to return all of these different values,

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,470
whichever matches we got in the Christian name below here.

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,860
And we can see that we've applied to filter in here too.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,590
So if we do have a large amount of returns,

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,680
we can always use a filter to narrow it down to the ones that we actually want to see.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,670
Okay,

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,300
so let's time path the first part of our multiple return formula.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,420
So we're gonna type small Justus.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,340
We did before.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,470
If open brackets,

18
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,680
they were gonna point to our HR file,

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,980
which is this one just here.

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,820
We're going to highlight the entire day to set and press F four.

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,830
So that is the range that we're looking in equals and we are looking for a match on the

22
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,440
Christian name on.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,030
We're gonna hit therefore again,

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,890
because when we drag this formula around,

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,750
we always wanted to point to this cell we're gonna hit comma.

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,470
Then we're gonna type row because we want to return Which row number from this data set

27
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,570
that particular value appears in.

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,280
So we're just gonna highlight the entire day to set again on hit F four,

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
and we're gonna close brackets on,

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,890
We're going to close brackets,

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,250
then we're going to hit comma.

32
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,240
Then we're gonna save Roe,

33
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,530
and it's going to be 1 to 1 and close brackets and closed brackets.

34
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,130
Okay,

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,540
Now we're gonna hit control,

36
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,620
shift and enter,

37
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,610
and they go.

38
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,340
We can see that comma appears a line to.

39
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,250
And if we drank that down,

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,430
we can see that we get calmer and number 2 114 and 19.

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,380
So let's just check that first.

42
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,550
So where are we?

43
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,160
We have first name.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,100
We have color.

45
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,710
So position one position to and we can see that matches up with road numbers.

46
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,070
So what else did we have?

47
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,980
We had 114 and 119.

48
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,660
Let's just scroll down.

49
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,140
114

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,100
Is Connor on 119.

51
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Is college too?

52
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,470
Okay,

53
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,970
so the first part of our formula works perfectly.

54
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,450
Never we're going to do is wrap our index around that.

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,830
So what we do decide index open rackets and you'll remember that the index is the entire

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,320
day so set that we're looking out.

57
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,690
So we're just gonna copy all of that down his F four coma there.

58
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,000
We've written the road reference number in all of this formula here,

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,060
just like we did before.

60
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,300
So we're going to skip to the end comment on We want to return the full name.

61
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,460
So that will be column 123 Comma.

62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:43,870
Sorry.

63
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,340
Column Four close brackets on control shifting.

64
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,080
Enter.

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,290
So they go.

66
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,810
We now have our first full name returns.

67
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,280
So let's just drank that down a case.

68
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,890
And there we have Connor Phillips come along and Connor Turner.

69
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,970
Fantastic.

70
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,840
Next thing we're gonna do is write out if era in there so we don't have that number at the

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,150
end.

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,150
So if era open brackets,

73
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,500
this is what we want to evaluate.

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,990
And if it is an error comma,

75
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,920
we want to return a blank cell.

76
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,210
So we're just gonna quote,

77
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,740
hit double quotes and close the brackets and control shift and enter.

78
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,560
So there you go.

79
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:25,920
No,

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,100
we have our first column in there,

81
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,650
so just copy that sell down.

82
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,690
So now when we enter comma,

83
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,960
we get three returns,

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,880
we get the full name.

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
Connor Phillips,

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,600
come along on Comet IRNA.

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,470
So far,

88
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,090
so good.

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,520
Okay,

90
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,700
the next thing we want to look at is the employee number,

91
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,350
which also lives in the H R file.

92
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,700
And the employee number lives in column A,

93
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,350
which is column one.

94
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,890
So all we're gonna do here is just copy that formula across.

95
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,750
And instead of looking at column full,

96
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,550
we're gonna look at column one control shift and set,

97
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,190
and then we're gonna copy that down control,

98
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,740
Andy.

99
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,530
Okay.

100
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,020
So far,

101
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,490
so good.

102
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,790
Now we're gonna look at the department on the department,

103
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,720
lives in the department structure,

104
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,160
which is here on we can see that we have to reference the employee number,

105
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,850
which is something we haven't end,

106
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,090
which,

107
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,560
warily,

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,630
something we haven't entered in here.

109
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,850
But we now have returned just here.

110
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,370
So this is no straight.

111
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,830
We look up so equals V.

112
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,270
Look up.

113
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,990
If I could talk,

114
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,450
they look up.

115
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,530
That would speed things up dramatically.

116
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,580
We're gonna look at that cell.

117
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,990
We're not gonna absolute cell reference it because when we drank this formula Damn,

118
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,550
we wanted to look here and here.

119
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,830
So we're gonna look at department.

120
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,310
So equals V.

121
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,900
Look up.

122
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,370
We're looking at this comma.

123
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,930
We're now going to be looking in our department structure and we're gonna be looking over

124
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,570
one.

125
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,790
The department is in the second column,

126
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,420
so it's gonna highlight all of that.

127
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,000
Now,

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,360
you'll notice that this is a named range and we're gonna cover named Range is fully in the

129
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,950
next sections that don't worry about that at the moment.

130
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,780
Because this is a named range.

131
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,240
We don't have to absolute cell reference it cause it's never gonna move no matter where we

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,780
drag it.

133
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,250
Okay,

134
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,920
So comma to because we want to return department comer False Because we want a complete

135
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,950
match or we want an exact match.

136
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,550
So he works in the directorate.

137
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,430
Now,

138
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,700
what we can do now is just copy that across control and are now,

139
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,400
perhaps I should have absolute self reference that,

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,850
but what I'm gonna do is look at this cell.

141
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,580
So we're still looking at B seven,

142
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,400
But this time we want to return from column three.

143
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,450
So his job title is C E O now because when we copy this down,

144
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,580
we're going to get errors.

145
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,020
We also need to introduce our error trapped into this formula.

146
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,040
So just before the V look up on,

147
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
do exactly the same again.

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,030
So if era open brackets and that is what we want to evaluate.

149
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,500
So if it's an error comma return,

150
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,250
nothing.

151
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,540
Which is double quotes.

152
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,500
Andi,

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,240
enter.

154
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,080
This isn't an array formula,

155
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,450
and then we can copy that down.

156
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,200
And I'm gonna do exactly the same with this one.

157
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,460
So equals lips equals against the right place.

158
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,870
First,

159
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,870
if era open brackets,

160
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,540
this formula is what we're evaluating.

161
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,150
Comma,

162
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,420
double quotes returned.

163
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,240
Nothing on Enter again.

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,770
Not Marais formula here,

165
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,550
Control and D.

166
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,750
So let's just also size those for a second.

167
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:36,340
It will click against and there we can return Color Phillips or we can return color and get

168
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,490
color Phillips Come along,

169
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,180
Color Turner,

170
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,010
All their employees numbers there department and their job title.

171
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,560
Next,

172
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,710
we're gonna have a look at where they're based.

173
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,720
And for this we're going to use our location file,

174
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,370
which you'll remember was an h Look up.

175
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,660
So what we gonna do say equals h look up open rackets on.

176
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,420
We want to look at the economy and where it is,

177
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,400
it's the department that goes across it up.

178
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,050
So what we want to have a look at is the department.

179
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:11,030
And I am gonna absolute self reference that the Stones are gonna hit F four F four again

180
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,540
Andi F four again.

181
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,630
So it always must appear in columns,

182
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,160
See,

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,780
But it doesn't have to be in line seven.

184
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,310
So that way,

185
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,320
when we drag it down,

186
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,370
it will move to eight and nine and 10 and so on and so forth.

187
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,050
So that's gonna be Ellicott value.

188
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,940
Come in.

189
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,930
We're gonna point to our location file,

190
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,220
highlight all of our data on we want to return from line to So we're gonna hit groups.

191
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,980
And it's just absolute self reference that wanna hit line to come A To become a false

192
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,450
because we want an exact match hit.

193
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:43,880
Enter.

194
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,100
It's just enter on this one because it's not Marais former,

195
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,250
just straightforward.

196
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,080
Let's auto science and the game we're gonna introduce at every trap just before so equals

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,670
If around open brackets evaluate this section,

198
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,780
the formula and if it isn't era return a blank clothes and enter.

199
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,270
It's copy that.

200
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,650
Damn!

201
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,410
Now,

202
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:10,150
the next one we're gonna have a look at is the car wrench on the car.

203
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:19,610
Reg leaves in the HR file in the 1234567 8/9 column Because we already referenced in that

204
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,370
over here.

205
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,670
What we're gonna do is just copy that cell and pace over here.

206
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,740
But this time,

207
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,460
instead of looking column four,

208
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,910
we're gonna look at column nine,

209
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,420
hit control shifting.

210
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,030
Enter.

211
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,800
And then we're gonna copy that down now,

212
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,730
because we've got every traps in here we can know happily.

213
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,850
Copy this down.

214
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,520
Let's go down.

215
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,500
20 lines,

216
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,900
control and D.

217
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,190
Let's try this.

218
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,190
Have something else.

219
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,360
So we have Connor.

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,290
Let's have a look.

221
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,980
Do we have any Harris?

222
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,000
We have three.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,580
Harris.

224
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,520
Do we have any Millie's?

225
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,900
Yes,

226
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,550
we have two.

227
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,060
Millis,

228
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,010
Do we have any Jones?

229
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,040
We don't have any Jones in our database at all.

230
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,550
Do we have any polls?

231
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,080
No.

232
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,810
Paul's.

233
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,750
Let's have a look at who we do have.

234
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,990
That might be more useful.

235
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,180
And we have little is.

236
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,600
So let's have a look at Lily.

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,980
They go,

238
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,130
we have three Lillis on,

239
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,510
but that's essentially have it works so you can build a very complex database using what

240
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,630
you've learned and search for a single Christian name on return multiple returns.

241
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,550
So you get every single lily in our database in all the information that you could possibly

242
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,950
want.

243
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,510
And if you want to add any more,

244
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,680
you'll find loads of extra data that you can mine in here.

245
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,760
So coming back to hear the finishing touch is going to be this record returned thing.

246
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,680
So what we're gonna do in the next,

247
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,330
like you very quickly is have a look out to return Hemley records.

248
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,830
There are in total on homely records.

249
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,600
We've managed to return from here.

250
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,390
Okay,

251
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,870
so I'll see you in the next lecture.
