00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,410
okay and welcome back to another user question and said this particular one is from

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,730
Jonathan on Jonathan's question.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,530
Waas A.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,700
He has a bunch of cells.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,870
I would imagine there are probably thousands off them on.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,260
Somewhere within those cells is a phone number.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:24,250
Now this is just completely randomized data a just use around between and then appended a

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,470
No.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,500
Seven because the numbers that Jonathan is looking for our mobile phone numbers.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,560
So what we have in each of thes cells is a mobile phone number beginning with 07 that

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,130
always 11 characters long.

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,930
But they can appear anywhere within the string in each of these cells.

13
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,630
So it's a fairly straightforward solution.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,060
What we can do is,

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,360
say,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,120
equals on we're gonna say find open quotes 07 because all mobile phone numbers in the UK

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm assuming you're in the UK Jonathan,

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,790
begin with 07 So the text we are looking for is 07 coma within text.

19
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,110
This particular string here comma and we want to begin at position number one.

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,080
So they go.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,900
We can see in the first instance,

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,970
the 07 appears at the 12 position top position here the 11th here.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,720
First hair fourth here.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,850
Andi know.

25
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,160
What we're gonna do is we're gonna wrap amid function around that song the same mid open

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,850
brackets on the text I want to look at.

27
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,910
I should have actually started out on this cell here,

28
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,290
so come back up here.

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's say in mid open brackets,

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,910
this is the text I am looking at Kama on.

31
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,540
We're gonna use that formula.

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,880
We just wrote that find to tell us where the start number is.

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,080
So that formula that we just written becomes our second argument.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,450
So I'm just gonna come to the end hit comma and the mobile phone numbers.

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,530
According to your question,

36
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,730
Jonathan are always seven characters long.

37
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,230
Sorry.

38
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,410
11 carriages long.

39
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,800
So come at 11.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,460
That's how many characters we want to look at.

41
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,040
Close rackets hit.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,640
Enter.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,980
I'm just going to double click that on.

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,050
Hopefully,

45
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,610
that does exactly what you needed to do.

46
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:22,450
No matter where that mobile phone number appears within the texting in each of these cells

47
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:22,450
,

48
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,600
this will find 07 on returned 11 characters from the point where that's found.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,100
Hopefully that answers your question and enjoy using it on as always,

50
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,150
Any more questions just dropped me a note and I'll be happy to help.

51
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,150
Thanks very much.
