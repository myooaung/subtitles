1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,780
guys,

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,720
welcome back.

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,410
Now we're progressing nicely,

5
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,610
and now we've come to this particular section just here.

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,670
Now I'm gonna split this section over a couple of lectures because we have quite a lot of

7
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,700
area to cover.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,420
Now what we have is a bunch of ticked boxes s so we can see here what type of vehicle to

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,600
use and we have Carte it.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,620
Now that's fantastic.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,950
But because there's a fundamental issue in the way that this templates being set up,

12
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,430
I would imagine the intent behind this particular section is first to be able to choose

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,050
only one of the three options for each of these lines.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090
So I can see there have car,

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,440
Tex,

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,190
before I move over to motorbike on Tick that ideally what we want to do is untech the car

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,640
box automatically.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,120
But the way it's being set up,

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,560
the moment is I can actually take all three or any combination of them and exactly the same

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,630
in the ones below.

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,880
So the first thing you think we're going to have a look at is have you actually add these

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,440
tick boxes on to begin with now?

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,620
Because I want to recreate this Exactly.

24
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,610
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna highlight this section hit control and see to copy it

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,460
on Mangan Dues click over here in the spreadsheets.

26
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm gonna come to the pace special and you can see we get a bunch of extra options just

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,660
here on the bottom one just there.

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,750
Say's picture.

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,310
So I'm just gonna left click Picture.

30
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,530
And now I have a picture of exactly that highlighted area just there.

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,720
So I'm just gonna hit escape to get rid of the down CNN's and there because I have a

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,880
picture selected,

33
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,760
you can see I have a new option.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,130
The top that saves picture tools for matter.

35
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,230
I'm just gonna go ahead and left.

36
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,530
Click that on a choose crop,

37
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,250
because all I'm really interested in is that bit just there.

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,700
So I'm just dragging over on hit crop again and they go,

39
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,070
No,

40
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,000
I can cheat.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,560
I can delete all of this on then build an exact replica because I know what the original

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,150
look like.

43
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,580
Okay,

44
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,250
Now,

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,830
the way to select these things,

46
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,190
Obviously,

47
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,250
if you left click in them,

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,160
you're taking them.

49
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,340
So you need to right click and hit cut on.

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,730
Right click and cut and right Click and cut Sunday.

51
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,750
Go Now we started tabula rasa.

52
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,250
We'll have a blank slate and we can start again.

53
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,920
No way you'll find these little tick boxes is in the developer tab up in the ribbon just

54
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,360
here.

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,950
So I'm just gonna left quick developer on.

56
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,180
You're gonna look at the insert option.

57
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,070
Now you have two options in insert.

58
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,790
You have form controls and you can see you have a bunch of options.

59
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,850
Inform controls 1st 1 being the button and you have active X controls.

60
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,540
And you can also see that the first option you have is a button on.

61
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,850
A lot of these are replicated in both sections that we're going to cover form controls and

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,010
Activex controls later in the course,

63
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,060
but just for no.

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,040
The fundamental difference is that form controls are very basic on access.

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,250
Active X controls gives you greater flexibility so you can change the format in you can

66
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,390
have vb a code behind them and then much more powerful.

67
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,850
But these are just going to be simple check boxes.

68
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:06,590
So all we're going to do is pick the form control check box and click in our first box just

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:06,980
there.

70
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,430
So now you can see what you have.

71
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,160
Check box 123 Now because I find it a little bit fiddly to keep going up to the to the

72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,080
developer time and hitting the uncertain picking at this time that Larrier appear.

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,700
What I like to do is I just do the one that I'm just going to right Click hit copy to put

74
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,640
it in the clipboard.

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,290
I'm gonna hit Control and V and Control and V.

76
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,770
And now I have three boxes that all look exactly the same.

77
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,840
So I'm just gonna left,

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,460
right,

79
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,150
click on the box and drag it up somewhere over here on Move it on the 2nd 1 I'm just gonna

80
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,110
right click groups.

81
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,470
Right?

82
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,740
Click on,

83
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,320
then drag it up there on but it more or less in line.

84
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,220
So move here.

85
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,260
Now it's a line these perfectly.

86
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,520
What you need to do is select all three.

87
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,730
Now,

88
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,230
obviously,

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,120
if you select them,

90
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,090
it just takes them.

91
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,060
So you need to,

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,880
right click,

93
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,980
Hold down,

94
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,290
shift right.

95
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,910
Click the next one and right click the one after that.

96
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,390
You can see we have a new Another new option of the top here in the ribbon called drawing

97
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,650
tools format.

98
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,730
So I'm just gonna left click that on.

99
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,120
What I want to do is choose a line and I want to align them all to the top,

100
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
said they all line up exactly.

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,660
And then I want to distribute them horizontally equally so again a line distribute

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,110
horizontally so they're all evenly spaced on their with them all selected.

103
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,770
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna right click on Choose Group.

104
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,180
So now we have one graphic with three check boxes in it now,

105
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,520
because it's already selected,

106
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,290
I'm just going to hit control and see to copy than control V Control and V.

107
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,970
And now I get my nine boxes whips.

108
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,100
I don't mean to do that escape eso I'm just going to drag that one at the weight move here

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,080
on drag that one at the way groups.

110
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,950
Let's move that out the way they're move here and stick that one back up.

111
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,830
Onda move here.

112
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,370
Never I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select all of them,

113
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,230
so I'm just gonna hold down shift right Click first,

114
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,500
right.

115
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,220
Click second on groups,

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,360
right click the third.

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,630
Choose drawing tools Come back up.

118
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,650
I'm gonna rely in them to the left.

119
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,370
So the first box is always lined up,

120
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,630
and then I'm gonna align them vertically.

121
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,320
And now what I want to do is nudge them all up a bit.

122
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,530
So they line up perfectly.

123
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,870
So I'm just going to right click the 1st 1 hit shift,

124
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,620
right click the next one on.

125
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:27,880
Right.

126
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,140
Click the bottom one on with my arrow keys on the keyboard.

127
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,360
Just move up.

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,630
No.

129
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,610
Wanted to replicate this exactly.

130
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,900
So we can see that the middle one is more or less in line with the e of miles.

131
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,210
So I'm just gonna move over a squidgy,

132
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,610
move up on click off,

133
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,170
and they go.

134
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,140
That looks like an almost perfect representation of this.

135
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,830
The next thing I need to do is just one group them.

136
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:58,200
So I'm just gonna right click on group right click on group on right clips.

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,810
Missed it.

138
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,350
Last one right click on day on groups.

139
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,670
And they go now I have nine individual check boxes again.

140
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,120
The next thing we need to do is change the text.

141
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,520
So we're going to right click this particular box,

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,510
and we're going to choose edit text,

143
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,150
and then I'm just gonna tell you been car on,

144
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,930
delete the text,

145
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,250
it's already in there and hit.

146
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:17,680
Enter.

147
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,680
So we just need to right click each of these and change the text to match the original

148
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,280
documents.

149
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,070
So I'm just going to pause the recording for a second while I populate all of these.

150
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,130
Okay,

151
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,590
they go.

152
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,040
Now we have a version,

153
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,450
a new version that we just built from scratch that looks exactly like the original version

154
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,080
over here.

155
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,240
So now we've recreated that we can happily select the image hit delete on they go.

156
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,910
Now we have something that looks exactly like the original,

157
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,560
and then we're gonna learn how to do something useful with it at the moment.

158
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
This just is exactly what the original those.

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,240
And it allows us to pick multiple options in the same line,

160
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,550
which we don't want to do.

161
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,370
Okay,

162
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,870
So in the next lecture,

163
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,680
we're gonna have a look at how you get these boxes to tick automatically based on a value

164
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,670
in a cell on.

165
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:06,760
We'll also have a look at a clever way of making sure that you only ever populate one of

166
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,700
those boxes.

167
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,450
Okay,

168
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,650
See you in the next lecture.
