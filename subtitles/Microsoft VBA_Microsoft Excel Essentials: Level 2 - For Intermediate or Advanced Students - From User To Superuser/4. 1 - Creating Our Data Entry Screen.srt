1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,950
Okay,

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:06,430
let's have a look at building are simple data entry screen there.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,870
The first thing we're gonna do is we're going to stick a title in for our worksheet on.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:17,550
We're gonna call it Data and Tree Screen on.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,510
And let's just merge in center that Let's have it in green cause greens nice.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,620
I like that green.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,550
Have it old and increased the font size.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,410
If you don't have to do this,

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,730
take a look.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,260
At course one because we recover that fully in course,

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,970
one on all the different for matins for text and merge in central stuff like that.

12
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,690
Okay,

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,830
so we need a few gaps in here,

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,090
selects and set some lines on.

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,120
The first thing we're gonna need is the week ending date service.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,320
Just a week and on,

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,150
and we're gonna be entering that in there.

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:56,390
Now.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,570
What I like to do is some is to format the cells into a different color for particularly

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,010
for data entry screens.

21
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,580
Because that is an indicator to the user of which sells.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,320
It is they should be filling in that we can look a little later.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,460
Hey,

24
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,980
you can local the other cells,

25
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,070
so they can actually feel anything in that you don't want them to.

26
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,770
But for now,

27
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,670
let's just enter a simple data entry with the Four Matic.

28
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:22,430
So there we go.

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,490
We want people to enter stuff in there.

30
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,170
We need assuming no weeks out some Monday.

31
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,640
We need Monday,

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,930
Tuesday,

33
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,170
Wednesday,

34
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,050
Thursday for exactly Sunday Onda We condole it.

35
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,640
Rest of it because there are only seven days in a week.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,120
Now let's insert a little more from the time sheet that were populating.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,610
We can have a look at what entries We actually need to tohave the user enter into here.

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,450
So let's just bring you up on the screen here and we can see what we want to do.

39
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,510
So we need a start time in the morning.

40
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,550
So we're gonna put something in here.

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,250
We need to start time in the afternoon.

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,240
Sorry.

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,200
We need a finish in the morning.

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,930
We need a lunch,

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,390
but we're gonna calculate that.

46
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,130
So what we then need is a start time in the afternoon on.

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,750
We need a finish time in the afternoon.

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,150
Pretty much everything else we can calculate out.

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,240
So let's just stick some hellions in there.

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,430
So we have start on.

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,220
We have finish on bets.

52
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,530
Just copy those.

53
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,430
Stick him over there again.

54
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,530
If you If you're not sure about the copy and paste in,

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,560
check out level one of this coarser because we cover all of the basics in there.

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,270
So what we're gonna do is we're just going Teoh sent to the text over there so we can see

57
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,950
that that style.

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,400
That's finish since the text over there on,

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,030
we're gonna have this merged and centers will call that working hours.

60
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,900
Okay,

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,470
so they go,

62
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,820
we've got a quite Deb.

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,900
That's a little untidy.

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,210
So let's just delete that,

65
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,980
uh,

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,140
a small uniform.

67
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,750
Okay,

68
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,810
so now we have the basics of a data entry screen.

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,760
So in here,

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,830
we can see because the cells are in blue.

71
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,990
This is where we want the the users to enter the data.

72
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,860
We have a weekend in which corresponds to this box.

73
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,660
Over here.

74
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,490
We have our star times on Monday morning,

75
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,250
Tuesday Wednesday,

76
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,940
35% is Sunday,

77
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,460
which we're going to populate into here.

78
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,610
We have a finish time in the morning,

79
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,460
which populates over here.

80
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,300
Andare start time in the afternoon and I have finished time in the afternoon.

81
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:28,910
Okay.

82
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,070
Oh,

83
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,960
I forgot something.

84
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,460
We need also insert.

85
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,650
We need another one over there.

86
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,100
Don't waste.

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,440
So we need to say am Andi.

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,580
Let's just copy that.

89
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,600
Dump that in their on call that p p And so they go.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:45,990
No,

91
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,490
we can see that we have our working hours in this area.

92
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,380
Just here.

93
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,830
This is the morning.

94
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,460
This is the afternoon.

95
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,890
This will be our starting.

96
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,670
My morning.

97
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,580
Finished time.

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,240
Morning.

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,850
Start time in the afternoon From this time in the afternoon.

100
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,810
Okay,

101
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,250
Let's have a look at how we end some data in as time.
