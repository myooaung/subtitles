1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Okay,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,120
guys,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,320
this is the next template that we're going to populate now.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,550
Likely already have this in a separate excel file.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,720
It's all I'm going to do is import this into our document.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,860
They can see that a lot of the data types in here are exactly the same as our original.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,050
So when we have this section down the bottom just here,

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,840
we have time out of house and the times were expressed as as a normal time format.

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,840
So we have eight colon 30 on.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,270
We have 17.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,450
Cool on 30.

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,800
But the difference is here at the top,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,790
where we can see that the hours worked expresses decimal.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,790
So we have 7.5 instead of seven.

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,570
Coal on 30 on,

16
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,480
then this over here to guess if we look at the formula is just a some That's just it.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,040
F too.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,240
Yeah,

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,330
that's just a straight some on these cells across here.

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,070
Okay,

21
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,350
So the simplest thing we need to do is get this into our current working documents,

22
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,750
and that's very easy to do.

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,820
We're just gonna come down to the tab at the bottom where it says sheet one will hit the

24
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,540
move or copy.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,070
So we're just gonna left Click on.

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,050
Then what we're gonna do is we're going to say,

27
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,320
create a copy.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,570
And because we've already got all the workbook open,

29
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,190
we're just gonna hit the little down arrow.

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,820
Now,

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,650
we could move it to a completely new workbook which fall enough would move it to a

32
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,500
completely brand new workbook.

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,260
All we can move it to time sheet and expenses,

34
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,880
Master,

35
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,190
which is the one we working there.

36
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,660
So we're just going to select that.

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,260
We're gonna hit OK on dare we have our time sheet and expenses,

38
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:34,840
Master,

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,200
we have sheet one,

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,900
which is our data entry screen.

41
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,750
Let's just change the name of that too.

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,630
Data rib state,

43
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,900
um,

44
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,980
and treat she to is our time.

45
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,920
She's so we're just gonna hit rename and say time sheet keeps it nice and easy on.

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,280
We're just gonna drag this one,

47
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,540
which is our expenses.

48
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:56,840
Shit.

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,370
We're just gonna left click drag it over and put it at the end.

50
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,010
And we're going to rename that one too.

51
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,250
So I'm just gonna click rename and call the expenses So they go No,

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,830
we have important our data.

53
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,170
We just need to have a look at what we need to change in the data entry screen to make it

54
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,370
populate this,

55
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,590
but using a different format.

56
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,310
Okay,

57
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,550
See you in the next lecture.
