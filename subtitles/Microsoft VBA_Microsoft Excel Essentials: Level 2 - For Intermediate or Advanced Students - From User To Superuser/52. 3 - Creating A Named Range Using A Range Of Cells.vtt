00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.730
guys,

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:02.910
No.

4
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.500
We know how to mark a single cell as a named range.

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.150
Never gonna have a look at using a range of cells as a named range on conduce.

6
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.540
Just finish off these formulas here by hitting that plus that,

7
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.820
then copying that down.

8
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.130
And that works.

9
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.760
Jolly well,

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.420
now,

11
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.120
just as a recap when we did when we did v lookups in the last section Let me just copy this

12
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.360
for a second copy.

13
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.520
And I'm just going to pace it in a couple of times.

14
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.920
Here.

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.930
What happened?

16
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.250
Waas,

17
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.830
we said,

18
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.950
equals we look up.

19
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.000
Oops,

20
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.170
relook oppo.

21
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.620
We look up that comma and then we highlighted our range.

22
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.330
Which would be this here if you wanted to return our sell price,

23
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.290
You say 1234 Coming full coming.

24
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.060
False.

25
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.570
But again,

26
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.510
just as we did in the last lecture.

27
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.410
If we copy that formula down,

28
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.090
we can see that it works perfectly well here.

29
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.530
But by hitting F two,

30
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.160
we can see that that range is moving down in line without dragging the formula.

31
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.270
So what we're gonna do this time,

32
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.280
we're gonna delete all of those and what we're gonna do is highlight all of this range

33
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310
we're going to call it which we call.

34
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.070
Let's call it my first range on hit.

35
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.540
Enter.

36
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.320
So now if I clicked here,

37
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.060
we can see that that say's mark up here just says C three.

38
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.440
But here it no say's my first range.

39
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.580
And just like before,

40
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.610
we can say equals.

41
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.190
We look up from brackets.

42
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.860
Look at this comma,

43
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.030
my first,

44
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.490
and you can see that excels helping us out by saying,

45
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.550
I have a named range called My first range Couldn't double click that.

46
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.290
And here it is Kama Full comer,

47
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.140
false and enter.

48
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.670
And no,

49
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.250
I can copy.

50
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.150
Don't down on every single time and I hit have to.

51
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.340
It's always going to look at exactly the same range because we've named it on.

52
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.980
Similarly,

53
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.420
just like with the single cell reference named Range,

54
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.780
we can flip over here and we could say apples because I equals look up over records.

55
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.030
We want to look at Apple's.

56
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.220
I think it's actually Apple,

57
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.900
so this is not gonna work.

58
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.830
My first range comma full coming,

59
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.240
falls on encircle.

60
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.940
It shines out to Apple that will probably work much better,

61
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.380
and they go so you can call your named range from anywhere on.

62
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.980
The useful thing with name ranges,

63
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.300
obviously is you can call them something useful.

64
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.210
So when you're looking at your formula,

65
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.880
it's much easier to understand what it is it's actually doing okay,

66
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.350
so let's have a look at it.

67
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.750
Another way of name and ranges in the next lecture.

68
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.750
I'll see you then.
