1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
OK,

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:02,880
guys.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,100
Now,

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,600
this is probably the holy Grail of V lookups on that is,

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,610
how do you return multiple values?

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:16,610
So you return an entry for every time your single value that you're looking up appears in

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,200
the list.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,670
So,

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,990
you know,

10
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,710
just going to get the 1st 1 You not gonna change the sort order and get the last one or do

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,340
any sort of manipulation on the sort order.

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,610
What you're actually going to do is return every single instance off that match.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,390
Okay,

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:37,230
Now we're gonna have to combine four of the Excel built in functions on they are,

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,200
if small row and index,

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,370
We've looked at index before,

17
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,380
but let's just have a quick look at the other ones.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,570
So the first thing we're gonna have a look at is the small function.

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,650
So I mean,

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,710
do down here is just fill this down all the way down here.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,020
But I'm going to start that 15 and I'm gonna start to put one in there.

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:07,080
So the way the small function work says you took the function equals small open brackets.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,220
Your first argument is the array.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:17,340
So this is the array that we want to look at and then we hit Comma and K is the smallest

25
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,430
value do you want?

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,450
So if you want in the first smallest value you hit one.

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,700
He want the third smallest value You hit three.

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,110
So if we just hit one and closer brackets,

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,780
you can see that our lowest value is one which is exactly correct before.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,500
To change that to 25 over Lois value now is to And if we look down the list,

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,720
we can see that too,

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,180
is the lowest value.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,230
So similarly,

34
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,570
who wanted to find third lowest value?

35
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,920
We just type three and they go.

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,990
Number four is 1/3 lowest value.

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,890
Okay,

38
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,800
so keep that in your mind for a second.

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,200
That's how we use this small function.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,050
Now,

41
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,260
what we want to do is be able to change that k the this last argument here,

42
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,780
depending on what row were in.

43
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,370
So if we drank the formula down,

44
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:13,550
let me just enter that second I'll absolute cell reference that array by hitting f four eso

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,550
.

46
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,100
If I drink that formula down,

47
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,450
you can see that we always return for because the three elements,

48
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,840
the K element is always the same even when we dragged that formula down.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,050
So no,

50
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,340
What we need to look at is the row function on the road functions fairly straightforward,

51
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,500
or we type equals row open rackets and our road will be 1 to 1.

52
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,420
And hey,

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,000
center.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,080
So there you go.

55
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,450
If here we were looking at the third lowest value,

56
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,890
we could delete that we could no reference this cell here which no gives us our first

57
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,330
lowest enter our first lowest value.

58
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,750
So if we were to drag this down,

59
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:06,160
you can see that we now get row Oneto one which returns one road to 22 which returns to row

60
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,180
3 to 3,

61
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,230
which returns the third on row 44 which returns the number four.

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,610
So all we need to do now is reference this particular cell over here on Weaken Nancy,

63
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,650
that our first lowest value because we're now using the row function to reference here.

64
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,470
Our first Lewis value is number two,

65
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,450
which is correct.

66
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,650
And our let me just hit F two.

67
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,130
There were no second lowest value cause we're looking here for the K K.

68
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,210
A rate a second lowest value is three,

69
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,150
which is probably right on four on five.

70
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,350
So what we need to do is use the small function,

71
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,580
but move the row number based on this formula here,

72
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,930
the road So R k value in a small formula uses this'll toe workout.

73
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:05,580
Which K is 12345 or whatever as we drank the formula down,

74
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,520
Okay,

75
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,170
hopefully with me so far.

76
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,020
Then let's get onto the good stuff.

77
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,700
Okay,

78
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,670
So what we're gonna do is write our first section of this formula using that small and

79
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,390
incorporating that rose so we can drag it down and have the K increase each time we drag it

80
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,790
on.

81
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,940
What we want to find out is what row number does Luca appear on?

82
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,970
And for that,

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,880
in the middle of their a small function,

84
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,630
what we're gonna do is drop in a logical test,

85
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,820
which we've done before.

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:43,710
So what we're gonna say is equals small open brackets if open brackets array,

87
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,500
which is this data just here.

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,090
Ignore this.

89
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,750
We've only used up for the small F four because I'm going to drag the formula around.

90
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,920
So I always wanted to reference this precise data range,

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,350
so f four so that's an absolute value.

92
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,160
Equals because this is a logical test that we're gonna f four gangs.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,430
We always want to look at that even when we dragged the cell around.

94
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:17,310
So if in this range something equals that what we're gonna do is say comer and then we

95
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,150
won't want to do is return the road that that appears in in that data set.

96
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,500
So monotype road on highlight exactly the same data set again can with me so far.

97
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,610
So we're gonna close off that.

98
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,570
I'm gonna close off that because we were not interested.

99
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,890
If there's a false reference,

100
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,820
then we're going to do the the K value,

101
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,600
which you can see when I hit Comma.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:49,520
We're now looking at the K value on what that's going to be is row open brackets 1 to 1,

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,900
just like we did earlier.

104
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,560
And closer brackets?

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,940
No.

106
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,100
If I hit enter,

107
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,750
you'll see that we get a value.

108
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,740
And that's because this is an array formula,

109
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,170
just as we looked at before.

110
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,930
So we know now toe enter an array formula.

111
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,820
We hit control shift and enter.

112
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,120
So they go.

113
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,870
We've now returned the value five because we're looking at the first K,

114
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,980
the first smallest value.

115
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,870
We're looking for the value in a 16 here in this array here on,

116
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,910
we're going to return the row number that that particular data arrives in.

117
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,170
Didn't fall that.

118
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,960
So let's just absolute cell reference that So this will still work when we're dragging it

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,950
around on,

120
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,550
then obviously,

121
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,340
control shift and enter because it's an array Formula five.

122
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,010
So now this is where the magic is going to start to happen.

123
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:46,870
I'm just going to drag that formula down four times and you can no see that here We're

124
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,010
looking at row 11 And just this before,

125
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,650
when we drank that formula down,

126
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,750
Will may look a row to to So we're looking for the second K,

127
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,330
the second smallest and then,

128
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,330
unsurprisingly,

129
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,010
in the next one,

130
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,470
we're looking at the third smallest,

131
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,390
but we're still looking at exactly the same data rate as you can see there.

132
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,260
Okay,

133
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,680
so now we have the answers.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,850
Five,

135
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,590
12 and 14.

136
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,150
If we looked and we have one,

137
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,580
2345 There's our first Luca.

138
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,470
6789 10 11 12.

139
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,710
There's our second Luca Apparent line 12 13 14.

140
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,480
And there's are 14 line 14 where our third Luca appears.

141
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,070
Now,

142
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,270
after that point we've related to Lucas,

143
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,700
look at.

144
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,820
So we get a number error on.

145
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,040
We'll deal with the era trap at the end of all of this.

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,960
But so far,

147
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,880
we've done really well.

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,990
What we've worked out is how many times does Luca appear in this cell on?

149
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,190
We want to return the first instance,

150
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,970
wrote one.

151
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,220
We want to return the second instance.

152
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,270
Row two on.

153
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,230
We want to return the third instance.

154
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,200
Row three.

155
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,620
Now,

156
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,980
obviously,

157
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,640
if you have,

158
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,410
you can drag.

159
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,390
We stand 30 times and for everyone that it finds it will return a number.

160
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,480
So there's our first pass of the formula.

161
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,300
Okay,

162
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,870
So far,

163
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,540
so good.

164
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,460
Now we're going to do is take this element,

165
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,280
and we're going to wrap on index formula around it.

166
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,460
So I'm just gonna copy that hit escape.

167
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,550
I'm just gonna pace that in here.

168
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,820
So now we have exactly the same former.

169
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,740
So if I hit control shifting enter,

170
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,550
you can see that we still get number five.

171
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,700
They weren't going to do is wrap our index around it,

172
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,520
so I'm just going to come after the equals and before the small and say index,

173
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,260
just like we did before on we're gonna highlight our data rate,

174
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,810
which is all of this because you'll remember that the index requires the entire data array

175
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,200
hit f four because we're gonna drag this formula around.

176
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,010
But we still want to reference that exact area,

177
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,070
Comma,

178
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,140
They're what we've already written before.

179
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,740
This small if on dross statement covers absolutely everything else.

180
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,210
So just leapt to the end.

181
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,310
Hit comma on.

182
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,630
We want to return the first column so we won't Luca to be our first returned value.

183
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,960
So I'm just gonna hit comma one closer brackets control shift and enter on.

184
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,490
There you go.

185
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,690
Now we get the answer,

186
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,310
Luca.

187
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,730
Well,

188
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,690
that's great.

189
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,460
As you may think so It's just rang that down on what we'll get is Luca Luca Luca.

190
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,530
But these actually different Lucas because this Luca is the first Luca that it's found at

191
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,300
Row five.

192
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:35,270
This Luca is the second Luca that it's found a road 12 and this Luca is the third Luca that

193
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,710
it's found at row 14.

194
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,150
So just to prove that a what we're gonna do Is your strength that away across here,

195
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,660
then we're just gonna change the column reference.

196
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,380
So we were looking at column one previously.

197
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,650
They were gonna look at column to Sunday.

198
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,380
We have Luca Lee and I can drag that down.

199
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,210
So there you go.

200
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,400
No,

201
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
we have locally Luca Miller and Luke A brand.

202
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,970
We're gonna look at column three in here,

203
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,400
Remember,

204
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,350
Control shift and enter.

205
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,950
So there we have full name of locally.

206
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,110
Copy that down.

207
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,520
This is gonna be column full on control shift and enter.

208
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,740
And then we're gonna copy that on.

209
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,600
Then this will be,

210
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,620
unsurprisingly,

211
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,280
five.

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,230
Oops.

213
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,960
Control shift and ends.

214
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,630
I remember that long because it isn't right.

215
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,630
Formula controlling down on finally column six.

216
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,430
Control shift and enter.

217
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,580
Copy that down.

218
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,220
Let's just change the four.

219
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,760
Messing off that back too long days?

220
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,040
Well,

221
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,310
them.

222
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,510
So they go.

223
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,550
Now we've successfully built a single formula where we can enter one look of value.

224
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,820
Luca on.

225
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,760
We can return every single instance of Luca from our data table and look up all the

226
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,720
different columns.

227
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,830
Okay,

228
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,390
Now,

229
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,040
if we were to copy all of that down one more time,

230
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
control in D you see that?

231
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,830
We've run into Lucas so in now,

232
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,830
get in a number error now,

233
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,240
because we have a number era,

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,650
What we're gonna do is introduce a simple error trap.

235
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,630
We're going to use a logical test to return nothing at all,

236
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,220
if certain,

237
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,710
if an era has occurred.

238
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,510
So what we're gonna do is use the if era test.

239
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:24,830
So we're gonna talk if era before our index open brackets and then we're just gonna flip

240
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,800
right the way over to the end because that is the formerly we want to evaluate.

241
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,070
And if that's an error,

242
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,700
we want that to return Nothing.

243
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,460
So we just sit in double quotes,

244
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,600
close the quotes control shift,

245
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,280
and enter on They go.

246
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,610
Now we get a blank return.

247
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,970
So what I'm gonna do is competent and I want to paste over here on.

248
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,410
I'm just going to drag that down.

249
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,990
So no control and D we now have our error formula in all of these cells.

250
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,750
So if here I want to talk common,

251
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,380
we only have one color.

252
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:58,820
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,360
I beg your pardon.

254
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,430
We have to commerce.

255
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,410
So these have returned the values exactly as they should do.

256
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,650
So every corner is listed in here,

257
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:11,710
but here and here we can see that era trappers kicked in and just returned.

258
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,300
And a blank cell,

259
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,850
which is the double quotes.

260
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:22,420
So I'm just going to copy those all the way across control and that I want to put the color

261
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,780
numbers.

262
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,050
Right,

263
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,350
and we'll have a look at it in action in just a second.

264
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,070
Okay,

265
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,630
there we go.

266
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,010
Corrected all the column numbers.

267
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,610
So this is looking a column One.

268
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,890
This isn't looking at column,

269
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,450
too.

270
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,480
345 and six all the way across.

271
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,930
So,

272
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,280
no,

273
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,880
If we enter color in here,

274
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,390
we can see that this these cells are displaying our results Briefly.

275
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,290
Click here and here every trap comes in and returns a blank cell.

276
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,350
So they go,

277
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,580
Let's have a look at someone else.

278
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,150
Who else have we got in here?

279
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,050
We've got Harry.

280
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,050
So we could look up all the instances of Harry on.

281
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,760
We can see that we only have one.

282
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,610
We have Millie,

283
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,490
and we only have one.

284
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,670
We have Lily.

285
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,030
I think we only have one little e.

286
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,650
There you go.

287
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:14,710
But if we talk Blucher again lips they go the interest but forgot side of that format in

288
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,550
their long date.

289
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,260
They go if we tired Lucca.

290
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,300
Every single instance of Luca in a data table is getting returned on.

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,550
That is how you return multiple values from a single look up.

292
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,300
Okay,

293
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:29,990
Enjoy.

294
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,540
And I'll see you in the next lecture.
