1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Okay,

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,960
guys,

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,230
One of the first things that we probably want to do when creating are simple database is

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,460
ensured that the users always enter the data that we're looking for that we want to look up

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,550
for in the correct format.

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,770
So we're going to be looking at the employee number,

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,850
which we can see we have down here.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,680
There's a very simple way of doing this to ensure that the users only enter the correct

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,190
data.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,720
Just gonna auto size up for a second and color that in because that's the That's the cell

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
we want them to have a play with,

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,640
Right?

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,210
So there's a very simple way of doing this and it's using the data validation.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,990
So what we're gonna do is come up to the top here,

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,750
quick data,

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,590
and then come over to this option,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,370
which say's data validation.

18
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,650
So I'm just gonna left click,

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,270
and you can see at the moment we have a layer any value on a little down arrow.

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,160
So woman do is click the little down arrow on.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,700
What we want to do is limit them to a list.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,690
So I'm just gonna quick the list and you can see in the source box.

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:11,050
Here we have this little colorful box It's gonna left Click that flip over to the HR filed

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,050
.

25
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,690
Now I'm going to ignore the first column head in Someone started line to hit shift control

26
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,470
and down Andi.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:19,920
In fact,

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,130
I'm gonna go all the way down.

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,590
So that way,

30
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,700
when we had Mawr cells in there or more data in there,

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,260
they'll also appear in the list.

32
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,270
So basically,

33
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,850
we've highlighted almost all of column A.

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,830
We've just missed out employee number.

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,480
So I'm just gonna click that little button again.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:46,550
Onda We can have input messages here so we could say Let's say please select from the drop

37
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,650
down menu.

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,950
Oh,

39
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,640
please select from the drop down,

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,730
let's say that's obviously limited s Oh,

41
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,200
yeah,

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,020
so let's say it was Copy that and put it in there.

43
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,750
Police right from the drop down list,

44
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:10,850
I have a raptly keyboard this morning on Let's also do the ever let that say stop on,

45
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,830
let's say in 1,000,000 entry on didn't just have a look at what that does on.

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,050
Then there we can say,

47
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,760
Please select from the drop down list.

48
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,510
Okay,

49
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,740
right.

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,570
Let's Let's have a look what we've done.

51
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,300
So I've limited it to a list.

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
We have chosen the list that we want them to pick from.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,640
We've added an input message with the title Assess.

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Please select from the drop down on.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,700
Then the input message says,

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,550
Please select from the drop down list.

57
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,810
We also have an error relates,

58
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,600
so we're just going to click.

59
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,170
OK,

60
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,760
so now you can see that when we select this cell will automatically get this little pop up

61
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,310
that say's please select from the drop down list.

62
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,530
And that should give the usual indication what they should be doing.

63
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,530
Eso If we try to type something wrong in there like this and hit enter,

64
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,230
will mail get this era May message pop up,

65
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,580
which we've just loaded into the data validation that says invalid entry,

66
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,380
which is what we said.

67
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,880
Please select from the drop down list.

68
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,950
So click council.

69
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,930
And there when we hit the little drop down West,

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,430
we can see that we have all of their options in here.

71
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,760
All of their employees non mercifully dragged all the way down.

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,180
We go all the way down to number 200 so they go so we can just pick one of those.

73
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,900
Let's just also size it.

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,870
Okay,

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,410
so they go.

76
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,470
And that's how you do data validation.

77
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,270
And that ensures that the users only input data in the format that you want it.

78
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay,

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,180
in the next section,

80
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,830
we're going to build our look up formulas and finish this simple database sheets off.

81
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,060
So you in the next lecture.
