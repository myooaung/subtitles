1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,630
guys in the last lecture made a mistake.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,040
I did say there are only two ways to access a macro that are actually three ways of Chris

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,360
access a macro.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,000
Now we look to creating the keyboard shortcut in the last lecture.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,280
But you can also do is click Mac Rose.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,950
Just select your macro and click run,

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,510
and that will also automatically run the macro that you've selected.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,110
So Okay,

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,690
there's the third way of doing it.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,290
Now,

12
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,110
the other way of doing it and the one that I must admit for probably the last 10 or 15

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:32,400
years,

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,520
is the only method I've used is to activate a macro on a change event.

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,970
That is,

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,410
when something in the spreadsheet happens.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,390
Then the macro automatically executes on the button.

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,350
Click is one such event.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,660
So what we're gonna do now,

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,360
we've looked at Activex controls before eso What we're gonna do is we're going to select be

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,540
lt we're gonna be on.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,950
Our developers have just here.

23
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,980
We're going to go to insert,

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,090
and here we can see,

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,010
just like we did before.

26
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,490
We have form controls and Activex controls on.

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:13,460
What we're going to do is we're gonna choose form control and just click the button and

28
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,500
then what we're gonna do,

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,300
Let's say here is we're just gonna add a button on.

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm just gonna left,

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,890
click and drag out on you can see automatically says,

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,940
Do you want to assign a macro to this?

33
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,130
Well,

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,430
yes,

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:26,810
we do.

36
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,610
We want to call.

37
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:34,390
We want this button to go to go to my index macro and we're going to click.

38
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,050
OK,

39
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,720
so there we have bottom one.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,960
If we right click in there,

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,360
we can edit the text on What we're going to do is say,

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,590
it's just little that go to index input anything that you want in here.

43
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,910
So where Button one will may have say,

44
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,880
Go to index hit,

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,490
Enter on Click off And there you go.

46
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,070
So go to index on there.

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,720
When we have an event in our workbook,

48
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,590
such as clicking the button,

49
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,420
you can see that the macro executes on automatically.

50
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,260
We go from BLT.

51
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,170
Let's go back,

52
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,110
hit the button and we go instantly back to our index.

53
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,610
That's not much of a problem.

54
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,870
If you Tubbs a close together,

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,260
you could just click here.

56
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,390
But if your tabs are miles over the way like this one to save you all the scroll in,

57
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,980
you can automatically just jump back to it by pressing this button.

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,990
So what we're gonna do now is just right.

59
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,480
Click copy.

60
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,180
Go to our next tab.

61
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,370
I can't remember where we had it exactly on just paste.

62
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,550
And then when I click off,

63
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,070
I can there be on chilli con Carney hit Go to index and instantly jump back.

64
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,960
So just right,

65
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,550
click a copy.

66
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,570

67
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,980

so now let's go back to our index the old fashioned way.
