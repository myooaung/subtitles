00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Okay,

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.500
guys know we've taken a quick look at conditional format in the next area.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.460
We're gonna have a look at.

4
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.350
Is this area just here?

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.060
Now,

6
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.480
again,

7
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.500
we can do some simple maths toe work.

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.830
At what time we left our house.

9
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.750
They can see that The reason for this particular section is that we can claim some money

10
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.920
back if we're out of the house between five and 10 hours and that there is.

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.490
So if we're out of the house between five and 10 hours,

12
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.270
we can claim £5 per day.

13
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.880
And if we're out of the house for more than 10 hours,

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580
we can claim £10 per day.

15
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.970
So this will be the subject of the next lesson where we're gonna have a look at logical

16
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.550
testing.

17
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.210
But for now,

18
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.430
we're just going to deal with this section just here.

19
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.520
So to calculate this,

20
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.730
all we need to know was one.

21
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.410
Our average travelling time is,

22
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.350
or our average speed in our travelling time is,

23
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.850
so we could come over to the data entry on we're gonna answer in here Average,

24
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.600
or actually,

25
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.350
what we're gonna work out is a travel time.

26
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.920
So traveled looks old.

27
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.230
Open.

28
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.290
Enter time.

29
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.020
Okay,

30
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.170
so let's have a look in there.

31
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.040
We calculate our travel time.

32
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.520
Okay?

33
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.750
We're going to use a very simple formula for this or we're going to say is equals open

34
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.500
brackets and we're gonna have a look at our traveled distance,

35
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.340
which will be six miles.

36
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.290
And if we say we traveled an average of 30 MPH,

37
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.230
we're gonna divide that by 30 and then we're gonna close the brackets and there to get that

38
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.530
two time.

39
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.920
What we're going to do is divided by the number of hours in the day.

40
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.330
So I'm gonna hit divide by 24 hit Enter.

41
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.990
That's gonna going to give us an answer of 0.833 Now we can see,

42
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.780
because this is a general format up the top,

43
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.920
that that's just a fraction of a day.

44
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.970
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna copy the formatting for time.

45
00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.390
From here on,

46
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.910
we're gonna pace it all the way down there.

47
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.070
So now we can see,

48
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.990
then that's evaluated.

49
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.980
Six miles as an average of 30 miles an hour,

50
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.900
which we've put in there.

51
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.290
D 20 divided by 30 will give us a 12 minute travel time each way.

52
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.730
So I'm just gonna double click lips.

53
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.320
And I'm not gonna double click that in there.

54
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.260
Drunk that dome news in the drag handle.

55
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.040
We can see that we have a 12 minute travel time each way.

56
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.270
So we're traveling six miles there and it will take us 12 minutes on.

57
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.260
We're going to travel six miles back home,

58
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.650
and that will take us 12 minutes.

59
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.110
So I told travelling time will be 24.

60
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.850
Okay,

61
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.650
so let's have a look how we implement that in the expenses sheet.

62
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.910
Okay,

63
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.070
So what we already know is what time we start work on.

64
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.120
We now know about our travel time is so this one is just a quick and simple calculation.

65
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.290
So in this cell,

66
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.180
I'm just going to say equals on I'm gonna come to ever data entry,

67
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.360
and I'm going to say our start time less our travel time and hit enter.

68
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.990
And that's going to take 12 minutes from nine o'clock,

69
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.010
which gonna mean we start work at eight.

70
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.250
Sorry we leave home And 8 48 And similarly,

71
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.770
when we arrive home,

72
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.760
what we're going to say is equals.

73
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.320
And remember,

74
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.730
we're in Monday Hit the data entry on.

75
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.340
We finish at 17.

76
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.520
01 And we're gonna add our travel time for Monday and I'm gonna eat enter,

77
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.250
so we finish it.

78
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.850
17

79
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.260
01 We had 12 minutes on.

80
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.830
We'll arrive home at 17.

81
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.230
30 on.

82
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.310
We can see that the time out of houses.

83
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.040
Just a simple calculation.

84
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.710
It's theorized home less the left home Hit the answer and we can see that we have a total

85
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.680
out of out out of home time of eight hours and 25 minutes.

86
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.840
So I'm gonna do the same for all the other soul.

87
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.770
So when choosing,

88
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.270
I'm going to say groups just one equals equals Tuesday,

89
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:15.010
Start time less Our travel time on Tuesday hit the enter on Tuesday afternoon.

90
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.630
We're gonna say equals finished time on Tuesday,

91
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.450
which is 17.

92
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.390
12 plus our travel time home on Tuesday and his enter on.

93
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.510
I'm just going to do that all the way across here,

94
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.880
and I'll see you in the next like to and we get to some more interest in stuff to calculate

95
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.850
this value down the bottom here.

96
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.890
Based on what the answer is up here on.

97
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.140
We're going to use some logical testing to do that.

98
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.500
Which is going to be fascinated,

99
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.000
eh?

100
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.900
So I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
