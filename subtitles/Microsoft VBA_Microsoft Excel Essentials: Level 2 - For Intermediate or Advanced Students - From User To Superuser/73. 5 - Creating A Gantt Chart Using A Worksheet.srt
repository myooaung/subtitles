1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,840
guys,

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,760
welcome to this new section,

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,250
though.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:05,950
In this section,

6
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,040
we're going to be having a look at two ways that you could create gun charge using excel.

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,450
Now,

8
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,650
the two ways to do this are by using a worksheet or by using the chart itself.

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,530
Personally,

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,410
I prefer the worksheets because I find them easier to work with.

11
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,060
But we'll cover both options in this section here.

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,230
So the first way we're gonna have a look at is to do it in a new chart.

13
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,770
So what I've done insect in sheet one here is of just imported part of our HR database that

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,230
we used in an earlier section on have also tagged on an end date.

15
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,050
He s o.

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,020
We can see what our employees name is weak and see the start date,

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,050
and we can see the end date.

18
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,450
Now,

19
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,800
what we're gonna do is out a new sheet on.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,930
What we're gonna do is just call this,

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,820
uh,

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,610
we'll call it gun chart hit.

23
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,640
Enter on,

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,310
Bond.

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,020
Let me just merging.

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,450
Center that while I'm thinking this true now what I'm thinking to do.

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,060
Just so we have a little more versatility in this is,

28
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,320
what we're gonna do is have an increment.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,410
So I'm just gonna put increment in there and highlight that.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:23,500
And that's gonna highlight that this is a cell that we can add value into stick with me.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,270
This is gonna make sense in a second.

32
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay?

33
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,240
Now,

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,740
at the moment,

35
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,390
what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to reference the that the cells in sheet one.

36
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,270
So I'm just going to click on here and click on the first name in his hands.

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,820
I'm just going to drag that down until we get all of our values and they're still a few

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,900
more to go rips today's.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,750
Eat him into that.

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,030
Copy down.

41
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,620
My goodness,

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,320
we have a lot of interest at those.

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,910
We have that money.

44
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,460
There we go.

45
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,250
OK,

46
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,080
so we have 15 9 cells starting itself four.

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,920
So we've got a fair bit of data that we can play with their.

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,970
So we've got family.

49
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,050
If we got got 54 interests,

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,050
okay?

51
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,950
Now across the top.

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,230
What I'm gonna do is have the dates.

53
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:08,770
Now,

54
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,460
what we could to is look back a cheat one andi sticker filled from here.

55
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:21,100
Let me just stick a filter on have liquid are early status and it looks like it's in 2010

56
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,350
January the eighth.

57
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,440
But we there is a much clever way of doing this.

58
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,190
What we're gonna do is used the small function in here.

59
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,920
Now,

60
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,570
what the small function does is it returns the smallest value from a range of data.

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,280
So just have a quick look at it here.

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,420
What we're gonna do is five equals small open brackets,

63
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,190
and I'm just going to highlight this entire array here,

64
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,040
hit,

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,900
Comma and K is the value that you want.

66
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,500
So if we want the first,

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,670
we will put one as the K value.

68
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,310
So that will be the first smallest value from this array.

69
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,630
So his enter,

70
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,590
we can see that we get the answer for 186 which,

71
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,450
if we change to a date,

72
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,170
tells us it's the eighth of the 1st 2010 Okay,

73
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,500
so we're going to use the small function over here.

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,080
So what do you say?

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,550
Equals small,

76
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,050
but I've actually already named.

77
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,410
This is a dynamic named range,

78
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,420
which we covered earlier on.

79
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,880
I have called that dynamic named range end date.

80
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,140
So end.

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,960
Nate and I want to return the smallest value.

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,300
Close brackets on hit.

83
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,890
Enter.

84
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,710
So there we get 4088 It's actually start data want,

85
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,010
isn't it?

86
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,020
Sorry about that.

87
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,260
Start days ago.

88
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,310
So get 40186 I'm just going to change that to the short date on.

89
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,430
I'm going to rotate it round of it.

90
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,390
So let's just hit the format cells.

91
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,330
Alignment.

92
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:00,090
Andi was it ran until it's 90 degrees and hit.

93
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,850
OK,

94
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,800
right.

95
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Okay,

96
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,590
So now we have our small estate.

97
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,850
If you want to have a gap in between this and where the first bar starts,

98
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,220
what we could do is at the smallest state,

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,440
minus one.

100
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,020
So there we have the seventh of January 2010.

101
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,350
Now this is where the increment comes in.

102
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,480
Normally,

103
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,940
what I used to do back in the olden days before I realized there was a better way of doing

104
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,130
it is I used to add one to this day just here.

105
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,960
So I just hit equals one.

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,710
Let me just copy that formatting all the way across.

107
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,910
So they go.

108
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:41,150
So what I would do is I would say that equals C five plus one on.

109
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,040
Then I would just struck that all the way over,

110
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,800
and I would end up with lose and lose and lose dates.

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,010
Let me just go all the way over to there on just resize all of those automatically.

112
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,150
So there you go.

113
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,170
So now I have the seventh of January,

114
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,990
the eighth of Germany,

115
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,150
Ninth a genius so on and so forth.

116
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,070
But that's useful if you want to see everything in days.

117
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,060
But sometimes you may want to see what the count looks like in weekly book.

118
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,540
It's or fortnightly book.

119
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,470
It's or monthly book,

120
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,450
it's or yearly book.

121
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,670
It's depending on what data it is that you're looking at.

122
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,250
So then I happened upon this this technique of introducing an increment.

123
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,100
So what I'm gonna do here instead of saying C five plus one,

124
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,120
I'm gonna sing,

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,490
say,

126
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,750
C five plus increment and I'm gonna hit F for once.

127
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,340
So it absolute cell references be three.

128
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,260
So wherever we come for this formula,

129
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:39,710
it's always gonna look at B three and and they're all I need to do is entrant increment in

130
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,130
here.

131
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,150
So when I hit enter let me just copy that all the way across.

132
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,750
We went that far,

133
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,210
Didn't may.

134
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,880
So no,

135
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,850
we could see we start on the seventh because it is a small estate in our start date range,

136
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,770
which is this one just here,

137
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,810
which is dynamic.

138
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:02,440
So when we had new data in New Zeta will form in here to on we go 8th 9th 10th because our

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,010
increment is one.

140
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,440
But if we wanted to look at it in weekly buckets,

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
we changed the increment to seven.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,850
And notice what happens to allow the dates across the top.

143
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,390
There goes on.

144
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,060
There we go from the seventh of January to the 14th of January 21st 28th.

145
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,840
Similarly,

146
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,580
we can look at it in 14 daily buckets.

147
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,680
And there we see,

148
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,350
we jumped from the seventh to the 21st to the fourth to the 18th and you can put whatever

149
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,220
number you want in here.

150
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,590
So if you want to see monthly,

151
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,570
you can just do that if you want to see year leading typing 365 and so on and so forth.

152
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,560
But that's a useful way of dynamically changing what your increments is what we're gonna

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
dio.

154
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,990
Don't Hamli.

155
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,990
We've gone across that.

156
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,440
How many have we gone across?

157
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,130
32

158
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,530
Let's go across 50.

159
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:54,610
So I'm just going to expand that a bunch more times control on our Onda Hamli have we got

160
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,050
Now?

161
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,100
We've got 50 to 52.

162
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,520
That's good.

163
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,970
That's the number of weeks in the year.

164
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,710
So if I was back over to here and I changed that to weekly,

165
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,510
we will now start 1/7 of the 1st 2010 on.

166
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,300
We should go roughly a year later.

167
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,570
31st the 12th 2000 and 10.

168
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,660
Close enough.

169
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,170
Okay,

170
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:22,140
so that's how we're gonna build our dates across the top using this increment function that

171
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,590
we can change dynamically to whatever we want.

172
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,620
It is whatever it is we want to see next.

173
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,250
We're gonna have a look at how we color these little squares in depending on the dates in

174
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,220
these cells Here.

175
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,060
Okay,

176
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,360
I'll see you in the next lecture.
