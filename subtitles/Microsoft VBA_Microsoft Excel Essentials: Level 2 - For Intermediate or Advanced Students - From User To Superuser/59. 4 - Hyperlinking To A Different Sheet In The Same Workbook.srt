1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,510
Okay,

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:02,870
guys,

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,040
what we're going to create in this project is a spreadsheet solution where we can select

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,900
the ingredients that we have in our fridge or uncovered on have it automatically tell us

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,970
what we could create with those ingredients on rank them according toa likelihood.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,050
So if we have all of our ingredients present on our recipe despite needs,

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,000
all of those ingredients will display 100% on so on and so forth reducing until we get down

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,750
to I have none of those ingredients.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,370
Therefore,

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,250
this will be ranked zero.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,140
So we're going to incorporate some of the things that we've learned before,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,150
and we're going to add some new things in there,

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,710
and we're gonna build some complex formulas to be able to work out what it is that we can

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,150
have.

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,750
Okay,

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,460
so to begin,

17
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,960
we have this basic sheet and all this is is a tub that say's in next.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,840
We're gonna list down meals down here.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,980
We have an ingredients master which we're gonna add to as we go through and build a

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,150
respites and some not terribly attractive but terribly functional recipes that we can call

21
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,950
from in here.

22
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,780
So the first thing we're gonna have a look at is adding a hyperlink.

23
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,110
Teoh,

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,690
Each of these tubs down here now,

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,340
there are a few ways it add a hyperlink on.

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,370
We're just going to choose one of the simple methods.

27
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:15,800
For now,

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,860
we're just going to right click in the cell.

29
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,290
I've just realised you can't see that we're going to right Click in the cell,

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,530
Choose hyperlink on in here.

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,690
We're going to choose place in this document on We're going to choose be lt and hit.

32
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,350
OK,

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,210
now,

34
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,660
in the moment you can see that this hyperlink when I click it happily takes me to the B l t

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:37,660
.

36
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,860
But it doesn't look terribly attractive.

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,140
So all I'm gonna do for now,

38
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,650
it's just delete everything bother BLT.

39
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,300
Okay,

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,630
so that was our first.

41
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,710
So right,

42
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,000
Click inserts hyperlink.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,450
Then choose Chilli con Carney.

44
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:59,440
It's okay that I'm gonna delete everything there and hit Enter.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,670
And then when we click that,

46
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,530
we can see that we go to Chilli Con Carney.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm just going to continue that for all of these.

48
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,500
I'm just gonna be inserting hyperlink next to spank bones.

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Okay?

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,200
That I'm just gonna delete everything up to the last letter and hit Enter.

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,850
Then when I click that we can see that we go back to spank ball.

52
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,950
I'm just going to carry on and do them all.

53
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,330
And then I'll come back to you at the end.

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,540
OK,

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,960
guys now have added all the hyperlinks into each of our sheets.

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,510
We can see that we can click them.

57
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,150
That will take us immediately to be Elsie.

58
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,010
We can select the index again.

59
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,860
We can go to any of these,

60
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,320
and it will instantly take us where we need to go.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,580
I'm gonna commit Index have deliberately left the last one in its full form without delete

62
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,830
in the cell reference at the end.

63
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,180
Or the exclamation point,

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,280
All the apostrophe.

65
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,510
Just because we're gonna need to know precisely have that looks a little way to run now.

66
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,020
For now,

67
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,430
what we're gonna do is I'm just gonna add a free Spain across the top.

68
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,870
So have just selected Line six come up to view hit freeze panes and free Spain's.

69
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,390
And there we can happily scroll around.

70
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:08,840
Now,

71
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,520
one thing that may in or you if you go to something like cottage pie on that's way over

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,220
here and you've got multiple tabs is you have to keep clicking this way to get back to the

73
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,020
index.

74
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,050
So the next thing we're gonna do is have a look at writing a macro that's gonna zoom us

75
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,920
back to the index from a button in each of these tabs.

76
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,690
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
