00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Okay,

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.670
guys.

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.360
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.640
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.270
Now this one is from Michael,

6
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.440
who's a student in the Level three course,

7
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.230
the visual basic for applications cause what Michael wanted was a piece of code that could

8
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.540
use this data set on then do summary in the first.

9
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.800
You know,

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.850
we could do this in code,

11
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.110
but it's just as easy to do it in formulas.

12
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:31.000
And now what we have in this data set is a list of jobs that we want to some Onda add under

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.950
each of these columns,

14
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.020
so all the mechanical jobs will be summed here.

15
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.980
All the mot jobs will be some here in the collection delivery Sunday here.

16
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.700
Now,

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.990
if this state was presented differently,

18
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.570
this would just be a pure some ifs.

19
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.220
What we would say is looking this column to find the M o tease on.

20
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.560
Look in a different column for the dates,

21
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.650
but you'll notice here that the dates go in a different direction.

22
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.790
So depending on the date down here,

23
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.350
it will depend which of these columns that we actually want to some.

24
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.230
So,

25
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.940
as I say,

26
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.780
if there were,

27
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.390
if this was presented differently if the dates we're going top to bottom,

28
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.000
it would just be a straightforward summits.

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.310
As it is.

30
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.640
What we're going to do is modify some if formula,

31
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.580
to do exactly the same job,

32
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.550
and I'm gonna show you how we're going to do that now.

33
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.360
So,

34
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.400
summary sheet,

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.150
the first thing we need to do is find out where this days appears in this row here.

36
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.050
And to do that,

37
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.850
we're just going to use simple match se equals match.

38
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.890
Look at that date comma groups.

39
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
And let me just get the cell reference in right on this So we always want to look in a but

40
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170
not necessarily in row tuks.

41
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.980
We want to drag this formula around.

42
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.080
So that's what we're looking at Absolute.

43
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.020
A two on the flip to here highlight the whole of row one by clicking on the one hand,

44
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.920
hinting therefore cause they always want to look a real one Comma.

45
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.480
I want an exact match.

46
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.330
So therefore zero enter right now we can see that we've got an answer of six and we have a

47
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.990
look.

48
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.500
What was the date?

49
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.850
24th Eso We go.

50
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.150
123456 The 24th appears as the six column,

51
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.450
which is column F.

52
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.840
So what we need to do now is find out how to move from column A to get to column math to

53
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.280
give us some range.

54
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280
And to do that,

55
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.690
we're going to use an upset so you can say offset.

56
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.350
Open brackets were going to come back to here.

57
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.360
We're going to click the whole of column A and hiss at Fort absolute sole reference it.

58
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.130
I'm gonna hit a comma.

59
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.140
And there you see,

60
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.100
you can see saying,

61
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.900
How many rows do you want to offset?

62
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.940
We don't want to offset any rows.

63
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.070
So I'm gonna type zero and comma,

64
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.290
and now what we're going to do is offset columns.

65
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.940
You can see we've got coals here on at the moment and match functions return in six.

66
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.160
But if we have a look from a 123456 is going to take us too far,

67
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.220
what we want to do is subtract one to get us back to this column f here.

68
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.180
So minus one on closer brackets and enter Now ignore the answer 21 for the moment because

69
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.260
what we're going to do is use that as the some rain.

70
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.350
So what we're gonna do is say some if open brackets never the range that we wanna have a

71
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.920
look at.

72
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.060
We're looking for this up here.

73
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.110
Don't forget is in f three and it's always in column D f for absolute de absolute d coma.

74
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.190
The criteria coming back here is going to be this cell,

75
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.790
and I'm gonna hit F for once.

76
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.950
Twice.

77
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.850
It doesn't have to be be,

78
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.930
but it does have to be one.

79
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.140
Yes,

80
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.270
sir.

81
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.700
Be absolute.

82
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.150
One coma.

83
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.610
And now with some range.

84
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.890
Is this one which is going to be captured dynamically,

85
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.750
depending on what date appears in here.

86
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.730
So let me just close the brackets on his center,

87
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.250
and you can see that on the 24th.

88
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.760
Mechanical was 27.

89
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.660
So on the 24th we have mechanical one.

90
00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:22.400
When I read this whole control to mechanical mechanical 27 so that's worked perfectly.

91
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.670
It's dynamically worked out that we should be a column f nowhere.

92
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.990
Me junk.

93
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.150
That formula down.

94
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.350
We should have four should have fought because the sum of mechanical is only four for the

95
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.010
25th.

96
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.200
So when we copy that down.

97
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.670
If we get for we copy that all the way down there.

98
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.930
Now,

99
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.740
these days,

100
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.060
we're going to get around with just quickly.

101
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.180
Sarasota's a if the site half a raw rule,

102
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.740
open rackets.

103
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.850
And if we get an error,

104
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.030
if I could type if era if we get in there,

105
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.540
are we just gonna return the blank?

106
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.270
So comma,

107
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.350
double quotes and close control and day Sago.

108
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.260
So we get 27 45 and six and let's have a look.

109
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.600
We got 27.

110
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.230
We get 45 and six and let's just add another number in their 56.

111
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:19.140
And that should change then Vegas and never get to 62 now because we've done dynamic cell

112
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.510
reference in What we can do is we can happily drag this around.

113
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.520
We know that we're always going to be looking at exactly the right cells.

114
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.750
So if we looked at here collection and delivery on the 27th the answer is 18.

115
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.150
So on the 27th collection delivery we have that one.

116
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.560
We have that one,

117
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.370
which is nothing,

118
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.210
and that's the only one.

119
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.800
So they go,

120
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.360
that's delivered the rise.

121
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.810
Answer.

122
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.640
Okay,

123
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.870
so that's how you do it.

124
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.270
Hopefully,

125
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.620
that was helpful for you.

126
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.520
If you have any questions of your own,

127
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.300
do just drop a note in the Q and A,

128
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.730
and I'll be happy to get back to you.

129
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:52.890
Have a great day.
