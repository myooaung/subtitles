Hello,

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,810
My name's Alan and on the creator of this course Excel Essentials Level two for

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,100
intermediate and advanced students.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,610
Now,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,290
at the moment,

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm assuming that you already have the fundamentals of Excel mastered.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,670
That is,

8
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,210
You know what a spreadsheet is?

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,440
You know how to write a basic formula,

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,050
and you know where everything on the screen is.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,030
No need to worry,

12
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,440
if not,

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,050
because we'll go through things step by step in depth anyway.

14
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,660
Now,

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,800
one of the criticisms I hear when I speak to other students,

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,560
particularly of Excel courses,

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,060
is that they're taught a bunch of formulas,

18
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,100
but they have no context,

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,510
so they think the formulas are fantastic,

20
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,990
but they can't actually see a reason why they would ever want to use them.

21
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,500
For that reason,

22
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,750
I deliberately structured this course into individual projects.

23
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,680
Now you may have a look at the project title and think,

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,210
You know what?

25
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,000
I have no need to work out how to create a relational database,

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,010
for example.

27
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,530
But within each of the sections,

28
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,500
there is some powerful techniques that if you just build it from scratch and you follow the

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,250
course sequentially and complete each of the sections each of the lectures in those

30
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:10,970
sections,

31
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:17,560
you'll see some powerful formulas at work in context on hopefully then you It will be a

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,720
short leap to be able to say I I see how I can apply this in this project that I'm working

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
on that work all this other project that I'm working on it work.

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
So although you may look at the tiles and think,

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,870
I don't need that work through it anyway because there are gems hidden in every section.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:40,460
So the aim of this course is to enable you to build powerful solutions using just the

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,490
standard Excel functions,

38
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,690
maybe combined in a way that you wouldn't think to normally.

39
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,960
But you can achieve things that people generally don't think that you can achieve with

40
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,570
excel.

41
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,300
Okay,

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,320
so thank you again for choosing this course,

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,930
and I'll see you in the next lecture.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,680
Thank you.
