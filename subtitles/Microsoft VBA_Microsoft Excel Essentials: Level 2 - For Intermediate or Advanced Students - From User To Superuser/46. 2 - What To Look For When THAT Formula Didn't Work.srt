1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
Okay,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:02,680
guys,

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,680
this is just gonna be a short lecture.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,240
Now,

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,360
I've taught many people have to do this.

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,400
And normally,

7
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,680
when people come back to me and say your formula doesn't work,

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,050
Alan,

9
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,740
it's for one of two reasons.

10
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,240
The first and most obvious one is they have entered the formula perfectly.

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,550
But then they just hit,

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,590
enter rather than control,

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,010
shift and enter.

14
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,970
And we know that if we just it entered on an array formula.

15
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,490
We get a value era now where you can actually see the error of that because we've known

16
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,750
about this ever trap in.

17
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,590
But to make an array formula work,

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,730
always control and shift on enter,

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,050
then it works perfectly.

20
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,260
And then the next thing they do,

21
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:48,380
what we've what we've actually done with our data is we've started the data up in cell a

22
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,170
one so I've got no headings.

23
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:50,990
We've got headings.

24
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,480
We've got no totals in our spreadsheets.

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,290
We've literally just started the data bump straight a one and gone all the way down.

26
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,830
So when someone looks at this,

27
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,350
if their aesthetic,

28
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,110
they may look at this and say,

29
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,450
you know,

30
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:10,000
I wish had a title in that so they will insert a blank line and there will start their data

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,200
at line two.

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,280
Or maybe they'll insert two lines,

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,910
insert and they'll have a title in there,

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,760
just as we have in previous lectures.

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,780
Now,

36
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,550
if we say it's a line here,

37
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,770
we can see that this formula is adjusted and no starts with road to two.

38
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,670
Then rode 33 then row four for.

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,510
So the first thing we need to do is correct the road number.

40
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,860
So that will still be one toe.

41
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,180
One we can hit control shift in,

42
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,780
enter and there you go.

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,300
So now we have number one and Weaken.

44
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,420
Drag that down.

45
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,470
So we now have 6 13 and 15.

46
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,190
But if we look in our data,

47
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,500
what we actually have is one,

48
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,740
23456 So the six value is actually imaging.

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,740
So then we go 789 10 11 12 13.

50
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,390
We can see that the value now is Kama 14.

51
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,220
15

52
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,650
We now have a blank cell.

53
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,010
So actually looking at the right row because we know we're looking at Row one on.

54
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,450
We're looking at Row two and row three,

55
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,680
but what we've done by inserting this new line is we've moved the sell down one.

56
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,360
So six is actually never going.

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,770
Let's go.

58
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,080
One,

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,150
23455 Where Luca is six.

60
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,770
We've actually added one to each of these values,

61
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,780
and it's no picking up the cell after Luca in each instance.

62
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,690
So what we need to do is make an adjustment at the end because we've inserted one line and

63
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,260
this is returning a row number.

64
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,570
We want to say minus one on control shift and enter.

65
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,190
And then we copy that formula Down Control and D and they go,

66
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,450
No,

67
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,870
we get the right answers again.

68
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,110
So we start on data here.

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:08,470
12345 There's our first Luca 6789 10 11 12 There's our second Luca 13 14.

70
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,580
On there's our third Luca.

71
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,470
So if you insert one line,

72
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,810
you must adjust this section of the formula to subtract one.

73
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,700
If you insert two lines,

74
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,900
you must add a minus two to correct this number here.

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,660
Okay,

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,010
So with our main formula,

77
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,860
what we're going to do is do exactly the same thing because we've inserted one line in here

78
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:32,860
.

79
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,000
What we need to do is just for it and come to the end of our row number.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,320
Just he had this road Oneto one and hit minus one.

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,570
Because our data nev starts on the second line.

82
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,180
And obviously,

83
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,630
if you inserted to blank lines at the top,

84
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,110
you would hit minus two.

85
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,600
So control shift,

86
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,970
Andi intact.

87
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,660
So they go.

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,330
That's Hey,

89
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,180
correct that.

90
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,800
OK,

91
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:55,950
there.

92
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,830
In the next lesson,

93
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,530
we're gonna have a look.

94
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,000
A quick,

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,100
short cut save having to keep modifying those column numbers.

96
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,760
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
