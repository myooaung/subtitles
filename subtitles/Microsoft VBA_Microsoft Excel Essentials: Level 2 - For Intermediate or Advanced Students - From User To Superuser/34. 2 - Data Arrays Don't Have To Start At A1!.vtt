00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
OK,

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.040
guys.

3
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.310
Now,

4
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.380
this is just a clarification lesson when we using v look ups and everything we've looked at

5
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.310
at the moment,

6
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.550
we've always started looking in column A because column A just happens to have have the

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.710
unique index that we're looking up.

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.130
I look up value has always lived in column I now the important thing with the look abs is

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.840
that whatever you're looking up,

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.300
your look of value must appear in the first column of your data table.

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.630
Your data table need not necessarily begin a column.

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.100
A.

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.950
So just to clarify that point,

14
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.550
I'm just going to do another simple the look up here.

15
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.700
I'm just going to copy that cell and paste it in here.

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.040
And this is going to be our look up values.

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.350
So what,

18
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.530
we're gonna look up is five anywhere road on.

19
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.810
What we're going to do in here is,

20
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.110
uh Well,

21
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.000
look up the other added a new column at the end that says door color.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.650
So each of these houses each of these addresses has a different door color down here.

23
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530
So what we're gonna do is gonna right?

24
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.450
We're going to write another simple V look up.

25
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.350
So V Look up,

26
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.530
Open brackets.

27
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.590
We're gonna point at this self.

28
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.950
We're not gonna drag it anywhere.

29
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.370
So we don't have to absolute sole reference it so we can leave it be 13 comma now,

30
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.500
because I unique index,

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.060
I'll look up.

32
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240
Value appears in this column.

33
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.040
What we're gonna do is we're gonna highlight here so you can see we've missed out column A

34
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.020
completely.

35
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.680
Because what we're looking up now appears in our second column on the sheet.

36
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.290
But because of highlighted this area,

37
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
this is the first column in our data table data array,

38
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.300
which is in beat 11 to G 11.

39
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:58.720
So comma now the column index number is 123456 Because that's where our door color lives.

40
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.840
Comma six comer on.

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.970
We want to find an exact match,

42
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.400
so we're gonna type false and hit.

43
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.890
Enter.

44
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.240
So they go.

45
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.200
Now we can see that we haven't used column A.

46
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.790
Our data table has begun a column B,

47
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.070
which is where Index lives on day five.

48
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.650
Anywhere road has an orange door.

49
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.660
So if we just highlight that line five anywhere road does indeed have an orange door.

50
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.810
If we change that to number to anywhere road.

51
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.520
We can see that number to know.

52
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.110
Paul's a yellow road on number two indeed has a yellow front door.

53
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.390
I think I said Road,

54
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.210
then Salah go just for clarification.

55
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.950
As long as the first column in your data array,

56
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.200
your data table has the value that you're going to be looking up.

57
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.430
That's perfectly fine.

58
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.600
It doesn't always have to start in column A.

59
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.070
Okay,

60
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.400
now that's cleared up.

61
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.140
Let's move on to the next lecture.
