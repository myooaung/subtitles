00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
OK,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.820
guys.

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.800
Now let's have a look at how we can control our check boxes using the value from a cell.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.970
So just to explain this quickly,

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.410
what I'm just going to do is just had another one in here.

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.740
What are we on check boxes?

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.970
I'm just gonna hit one there.

8
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.940
So we have check box 135 I'm just gonna highlight this soul just here home highlights so we

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.000
can see which cell we're looking at.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.390
Now,

11
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.340
what we're gonna do is right.

12
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.470
Click this check box and we're gonna choose formatted control from the bottom there.

13
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.930
Now,

14
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.020
what format control allows us to do that?

15
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.610
We can change colon lines,

16
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.560
size protection,

17
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.390
all different things.

18
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.170
But the one we're interested in is the control because we want to be able to control that

19
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.030
particular check box there.

20
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.290
We can see here that we have checked or unchecked.

21
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.660
Sorry.

22
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.530
Unchecked object or mixed.

23
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.050
So let's leave it unchecked for a moment.

24
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.690
And this is the interesting part here,

25
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.890
this cell link.

26
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.830
So what we're gonna do is hit this little box.

27
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.300
We're gonna point to the cell that we've just highlighted and you can see that that cell

28
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.890
reference.

29
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.130
Let me just move that there.

30
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.220
You can see that that cell reference has been populated into the box.

31
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.380
So what we're going to do now is we have linked this check box to sell p 19 on.

32
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.970
We're gonna click.

33
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.630
OK,

34
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.320
now,

35
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.810
that hasn't done anything amazing at the minute.

36
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.120
But what this check box is now doing is checking the value in this cell to decide whether

37
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.500
it's checked or not.

38
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.950
Now,

39
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.120
this is a simple Boolean tested see,

40
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.790
the true,

41
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.460
that is,

42
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.060
it's ticked or it's false and it's not.

43
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.220
So just for a second,

44
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.030
let's just type true hit,

45
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.350
enter and we can see that the check box no is ticked automatically based on the value that

46
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.420
we've entered into this cell.

47
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.520
So if I were to type false,

48
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.070
if I could type false,

49
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.250
that would certainly be a start and hit Enter.

50
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.640
You can no see that the check boxes all ticked so I can just flip between the two on based

51
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.040
on the value in the cell check box are new check boxes automatically ticked or not?

52
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.810
Okay,

53
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.610
so let's have a look at what we do with that over in the data entry screen.

54
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.400
OK,

55
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.200
so we're back in the data entry screen.

56
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.590
And now what we need to do is add a few more options down the bottom.

57
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.410
Just here.

58
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.390
So the options we have our vehicle.

59
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.310
I forgot.

60
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.700
They aren't.

61
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.730
We have vehicle.

62
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.050
We have fuel type of engine sites on the vehicle,

63
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.520
fuel and engine.

64
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.280
Okay.

65
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.160
Now,

66
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.050
what we want to do is link this.

67
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.200
Sell this cell and this cell to the three tick boxes over here.

68
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.570
12 and three on below.

69
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.000
There,

70
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.600
we want to do this.

71
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.250
Sell this cell and this cell to the three tick boxes,

72
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.780
and similarly with the ones below.

73
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.000
We wanna have these cells reference in these bottom three tick boxes.

74
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.530
Okay,

75
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.950
so let's just color those in.

76
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.200
So we know which areas we're working in.

77
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.110
So I've colored those in.

78
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.680
Now,

79
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.220
what we want to do is just For now,

80
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.070
we're just going to type a random selection of true or false is across here.

81
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.850
So I'm just gonna pause while I typed those in.

82
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.030
Okay,

83
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.060
so now we have a bunch of answers in here,

84
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.910
and we have one True and two false is for each particular line tow line up with vehicle

85
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.460
fuel and engine.

86
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.390
So let's go ahead and link those two these particular boxes.

87
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.440
So I'm just gonna flip back to the expenses on the right.

88
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.680
Click our 1st 1 Choose format control.

89
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.870
Hit this little box here.

90
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.420
Flip back today to entry on pick our first cell and hit Enter Onda.

91
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.150
OK,

92
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.700
on there.

93
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.290
We can see the car is being ticked because the value in this cell is true.

94
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.460
So I'm gonna flip back to expenses.

95
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.050
Right.

96
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.900
Click this cell,

97
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.900
choose format control.

98
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.580
Hit this little box here.

99
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.550
Flip back today to entry on.

100
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.310
Choose this cell and hit.

101
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.580
Enter and okay on there.

102
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.960
We can see that that box is blank on.

103
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.040
This box is ticked.

104
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.190
Now,

105
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.110
let's just do the 3rd 1 Format control.

106
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.570
Hit the little box.

107
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.750
Hit data entry on hit that box there.

108
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.860
Enter Andi.

109
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.640
Okay,

110
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.150
so now we can see the car,

111
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.630
Ristic.

112
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.460
A motorbike and cycle are untech,

113
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.530
but let's just go back here and copy.

114
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.500
Fulsome pasted over that one on.

115
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.770
Let's type true in this cell lips are you eat and intact.

116
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.530
Let's have a look at the expenses and see what that's done.

117
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.500
So they go.

118
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.510
That's work perfectly.

119
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.710
No,

120
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.580
we have Karam ticked because the value is false on.

121
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.310
We also have motive icon ticks because the values false but cycle has bean ticked because

122
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.950
the data entry no say is true here.

123
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.840
So again,

124
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.570
I'm just going to pause the recording and I'm going to do the same for the next three and

125
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.730
the three underneath.

126
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.030
Okay,

127
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.030
so now all of these individual check boxes a reference in these particular cells over here

128
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.770
so we can see that we have three.

129
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.660
False is in the first column,

130
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.810
which means we have three unchecked boxes in the middle one.

131
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.710
We have a false a false and the true.

132
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.510
So over here we have UnTech,

133
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.750
unticketed and ticked and similarly,

134
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.360
here we have ticked ticked on,

135
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.090
ticked on.

136
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.820
We have true,

137
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.900
true false.

138
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900
Okay,

139
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.760
what we want to do is limit the user to those three choices.

140
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.020
So what I'm gonna do is select this cell and I'm gonna come up to the ribbon to the data

141
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.290
section on.

142
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.090
I'm going to choose data validation.

143
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.450
So I'm just gonna left click.

144
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.370
We've already We covered this in level one of this course,

145
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.890
but just in case you've missed level one.

146
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.740
I'm just going to show you how to do it here.

147
00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.180
So we've gone to data validation on this box has popped up.

148
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.580
Now,

149
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.890
what we have here at the moment in settings is a low.

150
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.270
Any value on we don't want to allow any value.

151
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.030
What we want to do is have a list.

152
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.760
So I'm just gonna left click list and in here,

153
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.180
I'm just gonna type the options that we want them to have.

154
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.720
So we want them to have car comin.

155
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.700
We want them to have most.

156
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.940
Was it motorbike?

157
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.510
I think it said,

158
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.400
I think said motorbike or cycle.

159
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.740
Andi hits okay on DNO.

160
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.860
Whenever the user selects this particular cell which we're going to color in to match the

161
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.630
other ones,

162
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.780
it's kind of a blue.

163
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.240
We can put that right later if needs.

164
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.510
But whenever the user selects this,

165
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.340
they only have a choice of three answers.

166
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.670
They can either choose car,

167
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.600
they could choose motorbike,

168
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.300
or they could choose cycle.

169
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.660
So we're just going to do the same for the next one,

170
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.360
which is fuel.

171
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.390
So we have petrol,

172
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.950
diesel LPG.

173
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.760
So back today to entry.

174
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.100
Select the screen.

175
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.650
Make sure we're in data hit Data validation.

176
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.500
Onda,

177
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.750
a low list on.

178
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.740
We have petrol.

179
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.510
Come in the zone.

180
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.480
Come in O p g and then hit OK on the game.

181
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.040
We can see.

182
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.080
Let me just call it that in.

183
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.480
So it's the same color on I'll do that with a 2nd 1 Mahlum there.

184
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.210
Ok,

185
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.210
eso here They can only choose car,

186
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.050
motorbike or cycle on.

187
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.180
When they select here,

188
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.210
they can groups.

189
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.780
They can only have petrol,

190
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.740
diesel or LPG on.

191
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.010
We've been to the exactly the same thing in the bottom,

192
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.230
on which is less than 1400 cc.

193
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.300
14 01 to 2000 2000 back.

194
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.520
So I'm just gonna do that now.

195
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.610
I'll pause and I'll be back with you in a second.

196
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.990
Okay,

197
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.010
so now we have all three completed.

198
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.860
So in the 1st 1 they can only choose from these three options in the next one.

199
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.280
They can only choose on these three options on in the bottom one.

200
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.070
They can only choose from these three options.

201
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.620
Okay,

202
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.020
and then that's given us a very useful tool.

203
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.740
Okay,

204
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.840
now what we're gonna do now,

205
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.700
we have our analysis in these cells just here is we're gonna add a logical test into each

206
00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.740
of these cells.

207
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.950
Toe Look at these corresponding cells on report,

208
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.420
either true or false.

209
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.730
Now we've looked a logical testing before,

210
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.430
and we're just going to repeat what we've done.

211
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.690
So in the fair cell,

212
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.410
I'm going to say equals if because it's a logical test,

213
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.350
open brackets on biological test will be.

214
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.280
If this cell equals open quotes,

215
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.370
car close quotes calmer,

216
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:23.820
then we want to report.

217
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.530
True.

218
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.520
If it's then this doesn't have to be in quotes because it's a Boolean value.

219
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.810
So see the true or false on.

220
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.340
We don't even need to add the second value,

221
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.550
the value if it's false,

222
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.660
because if it isn't true,

223
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.790
it must be false.

224
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.550
There are only two outcomes.

225
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.120
So if B 28 equals the text car returned true.

226
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.760
If not,

227
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.230
it will return false now because we have motorbike in here,

228
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.540
you can see that that's evaluated to false.

229
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.860
But if we choose from our little drop down box and pick car,

230
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.510
you can see that he immediately changes to true.

231
00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:02.250
So now we can look in our expenses form on dsi that the car is being ticked because we

232
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.100
haven't done the other one.

233
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.050
We also have cycle takes,

234
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.400
so we're gonna do exactly the same for these ones over here.

235
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.790
So this time we're going to say,

236
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.440
if ribs Sorry,

237
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:12.780
I forgot.

238
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.750
Say if if open brackets,

239
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.990
this cell equals open quotes,

240
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.600
motorbike,

241
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.140
close quotes,

242
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.900
comma return true.

243
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.310
Remember,

244
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.650
the true doesn't have to be in quotes because it's literally a Boolean outcome.

245
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:33.810
True or false.

246
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.790
We don't need to tell it the false because there is no other answer.

247
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.380
It could be if it isn't true.

248
00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:38.960
Hey,

249
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.500
center.

250
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.590
And then we're just gonna do the same with the last one.

251
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.180
So we're going to say if equals open brackets.

252
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:52.350
The logical test look at this cell equals and I think that's a little cycle.

253
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.700
Close quotes,

254
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.680
comma returned true close quotes and enter.

255
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.770
So now we can see that we have car selected,

256
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.740
which has given us an outcome of true in the 1st 1 False in the second and false in the

257
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.260
third.

258
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.250
So now we can see that we only have Kartik on.

259
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.770
We don't have motor bike or cycle takes,

260
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.170
but if we changed car two motorcycle.

261
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.870
We can see that we now have an evaluation of false,

262
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.540
true false on.

263
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.870
We can come back here on.

264
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.500
We can see that only motorbike has being ticked,

265
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.790
which is exactly right.

266
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:32.220
So that stops has bean having multiple options ticked in here because we've limited them to

267
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.090
a list in this cell here so they can only select one on.

268
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:42.120
We have a Boolean test over here that can only evaluate to true or false and therefore tick

269
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.980
only one of the three boxes.

270
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.800
So I'm just gonna pause for a second,

271
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.790
do the rest of them,

272
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.250
and then come back to we can have a look at it working,

273
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.430
OK,

274
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:53.140
all done.

275
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.010
So no,

276
00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.330
If we choose cycle,

277
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.470
we can see we get false falls true on their with who picked the last one,

278
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.320
which is LPG.

279
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:01.880
We have false,

280
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.710
false True on If we pick the last option greater than 2000 See CC's,

281
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.320
we have false,

282
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.350
false true on that has successfully populated the last three boxes over here.

283
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.140
So no,

284
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.780
If we wanted to change this to car on the centre 12 diesel,

285
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.940
we can see that we have true true true.

286
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.390
Go in diagonally on here we have tick,

287
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:24.870
tick,

288
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.560
tick going diagonally.

289
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.410
So there you go.

290
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.380
That's how you use tick boxes.

291
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:35.550
That's how you read values from cells to populate to either tick or antic the check boxes

292
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.190
on that.

293
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.430
Say,

294
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.860
use a limit to list.

295
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.670
So you can only ever get the responses that you want to look for,

296
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.430
and not only of the users to type in anything they want.

297
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.430
Okay,

298
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.710
see you in the next lecture.
