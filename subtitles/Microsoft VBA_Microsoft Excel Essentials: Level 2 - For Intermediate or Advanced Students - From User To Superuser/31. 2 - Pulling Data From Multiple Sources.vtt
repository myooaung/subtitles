00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Okay,

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.770
guys,

3
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.690
welcome back.

4
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.000
Now,

5
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.670
to leave this file intact,

6
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.900
I'm just gonna create a copy of this simple database.

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.880
Eso You'll have multiple tabs when you download the file.

8
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.420
So I'm just gonna right quick.

9
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.360
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.320
That's off shot,

11
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.090
but I'm gonna choose,

12
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.480
Move or copy.

13
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.880
Andi,

14
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.180
I am going to create a copy of this sheet and inserted before the HR file,

15
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.300
which is this one here.

16
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.760
So it's just going to drop in between this tab on this tab and hit,

17
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.300
OK?

18
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.150
And I'm gonna leave that named as simple database to.

19
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.680
So what we're gonna do is we've already ported all the data room from this data file in our

20
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.890
simple database.

21
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.400
Now what we're gonna do is add the data from the department structure file.

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.850
So simple database number two.

23
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.300
Now,

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.880
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy these two hellions by hitting control and see flipping

25
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.190
back to a database.

26
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.170
And again,

27
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650
I'm just gonna transpose that in there.

28
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.090
So now I have department and job title.

29
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.520
Well,

30
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.110
sort the format in a in a bit.

31
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.190
We're just going to do a straight V look up so equals for you.

32
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.490
Look up open brackets.

33
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.430
We're going to reference this cell because we're going to drag the formula down.

34
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.200
We want to make that an absolute cell reference by hitting F four.

35
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.620
Then we're then gonna hit comma and then we're gonna appoint toe are new data source with

36
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.610
which is this department structure now a game?

37
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.480
Because our employee numbers in the first column,

38
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.500
the first column we're gonna select is a We're going to move over to souls.

39
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.760
So we capture column two and three and then just go down to the bottom hit comma hit to

40
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.230
because we want to read the department Comma and false because we want to return an exact

41
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.810
match on hit.

42
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.710
Enter Soleil.

43
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.910
Go.

44
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.980
Department is customer services.

45
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.770
Just drag that down on change.

46
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.460
This column 23 So they go nowhere.

47
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.440
Pulling the were falling.

48
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.030
All of this data from our first tab on We're pulling this new data.

49
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.410
Even though we're looking up from the same cell,

50
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.590
we're pulling this data from the department structure,

51
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.800
so let's just pretty that up a bit.

52
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.680
So I'm just gonna copied the format in on here,

53
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.950
pasted over here.

54
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.070
We need to copy the formatting on this to this.

55
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.600
Okay,

56
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.550
so now we can put these over here.

57
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.260
Perhaps I'm just gonna highlight department and customer services on click in the thick bar

58
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.260
,

59
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.680
left click on D.

60
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.200
Drag over and just auto size those.

61
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.460
So now we have department Christmas services on move those over to their job title till he

62
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.290
sells operative.

63
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.990
Let's just delete.

64
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.970
That's tied it up.

65
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.310
Delete.

66
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.260
So they go.

67
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.490
No,

68
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.850
we still have a simple database on.

69
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.490
We're still looking at this cell,

70
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.690
but this this this Andi,

71
00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.360
these are pulling from one data source The HR file on these are pulling from a completely

72
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.730
different data source.

73
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.090
The department structure,

74
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.590
but still reference in there.

75
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.780
Cell appear now in the next,

76
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.510
like to what we're gonna do is have a look.

77
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.780
A port in the data in from the addresses tab on.

78
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.580
You'll notice something unusual that the addresses tap,

79
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.210
which has been done deliberately,

80
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.650
is that we are currently looking at the employee number,

81
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.990
which is this one just here.

82
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.620
But in the addresses tab,

83
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.380
we don't have an employee number toe look up from Okay,

84
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.150
so So you in the next lecture
