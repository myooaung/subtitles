00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
Okay,

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.830
guys,

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.140
let's polish this section off.

4
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.320
Now.

5
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.170
What we're gonna do,

6
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.910
as you see in all the best databases,

7
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.320
is you're gonna have this little section here that tells you the number of records returned

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.850
out of how many records you have in total.

9
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.910
And then we looked at this before we did text manipulation in section one.

10
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.240
And this is going to be pretty much the same thing,

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.730
but we're going to use a couple of different functions.

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.770
We're still gonna use that.

13
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.710
Can Katyn eight to build the string.

14
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.630
But we're going to use the count a function on the Kent if function.

15
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.160
So we're very quickly.

16
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.250
Let's just nip over to the HR file and let's have a look at how they work.

17
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.020
So the counts a function can't a all The counter you function does is camp the number of

18
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.230
cells with a value in them.

19
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.650
So if I highlight the first column,

20
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.250
remember,

21
00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.150
this goes down to 200 count A when I close enough is going to return the value off 201

22
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.290
because we have 200 records of data on beheading.

23
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.340
So to modify the count A to get to the correct count off records were going to do count a

24
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.950
common BB in Do any column as long as it's a single column and hit minus one and they go.

25
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.340
Now we can see that we have 200 records,

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.020
plus our headings at the top.

27
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.760
So that's how the count eight works on the way.

28
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.660
Ken's If Works is equals cans,

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.270
if open brackets the range and we're going to click the same one again for consistency.

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.240
Comma one Didn't Do Here is just tight with public a corner comma.

31
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.840
So no,

32
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.970
well,

33
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.490
it's going to do is look for the value Connor in column B B.

34
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.630
And when we hit Enter,

35
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.820
we'll get the answer of three.

36
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.570
And that means that Connor appears three times in our database.

37
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.040
If we wanted to test that,

38
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.360
we could issues the filter.

39
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.710
Come on,

40
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.090
on they go.

41
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.980
There are the three Connors.

42
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.250
So these are the two things were going to use and build into our concatenation to enter the

43
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.550
records returned on the number of records.

44
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.520
So the first thing we're gonna do we'll write our count if function so equals Kim's.

45
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.740
If open rackets,

46
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.310
the range is going to be the HR file.

47
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.980
And it's the first name because it's the first name we're checking for.

48
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.070
Comma on the criteria is going to be this just here what we're looking for.

49
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.760
I'm just gonna close the rackets.

50
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.230
So there we get an answer off three,

51
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.780
which is born out by the data.

52
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.650
We've returned here,

53
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.580
so that's the first part of our formula There will wrap our concatenation around it.

54
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:56.150
So calm cats and Nate open rackets so that we get get ruler Now we're gonna can Katyn 83

55
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.390
coma.

56
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.710
Then we're gonna hit quotes,

57
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.900
space we can either it slash or off whatever we want to do.

58
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.980
Let's let's say off off space,

59
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.610
closed quotes Let's just have a look at what that looks like so that we get three off.

60
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.940
We just need to add the last part of our formula calmer.

61
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.950
And there we want account,

62
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.610
I open rackets.

63
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.820
We're gonna point to our HR file,

64
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.380
select column B again and close brackets and close brackets again and his enter.

65
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.490
And there we get three of 201 but you'll remember we have headings in our data.

66
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.170
So there were just gonna hit minus one hit.

67
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.210
Enter on.

68
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.090
Now we can see record returned.

69
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.820
Three off 200.

70
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.050
We could have the word returned after if we wanted to.

71
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.660
Eso Lex just central line that make it bold.

72
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.990
In fact,

73
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.260
let's make it a different color.

74
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.600
Because where Really happy that we've been able to do that.

75
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.890
So they go records returned three out of 200.

76
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.940
So if we typed who we got in there?

77
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.820
We've got Lily.

78
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.470
Let's type Millie.

79
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.260
And here center.

80
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.080
We now have records returned two out of 204 milli on.

81
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.250
If we typed Harry,

82
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.120
we would get three outs of 200.

83
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.620
So they go that makes this database look every bit as funky as a normal,

84
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.170
fully fledged database that you may work with.

85
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.040
Okay.

86
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.450
I'll see you in the next lecture.
