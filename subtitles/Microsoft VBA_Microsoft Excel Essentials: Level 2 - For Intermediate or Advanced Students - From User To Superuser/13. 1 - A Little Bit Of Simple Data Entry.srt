1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Okay,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,770
guys,

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,110
this next part is really straightforward.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,550
All we need to do is replicate these particular fields over here in our data entry screen.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,050
So the game we're gonna have possibly different starting end locations on different days.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,630
So I'm just going to copy the days of the week down here,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,380
and I'm gonna put stars on ultimate enter a location,

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,950
and I'm gonna put and location.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,550
Now,

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,350
this is just going to be for one way.

11
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,430
So all I'm gonna say is we're starting from home on.

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,300
We'll start from home on every day of the week and we'll end at work.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,530
Andi hit that.

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,270
Okay down there.

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,150
The next thing that we need to calculate is Miles traveled.

16
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,830
So you'll probably already know how many miles you travel to work.

17
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,890
So we'll just put miles on.

18
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,670
We'll put it each way because we said from home to work.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,800
So let's imagine for a second we work six miles from home.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,020
We'll just say six and we'll fill that all the way down.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,280
We're not traveling or something.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,960
And something at least not to work.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,730
OK,

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,780
so these are simple data entry fields,

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,850
so I'm just going to change that to the same shade of blue as we have above.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,870
Uh,

27
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,950
let's just send those cells there,

28
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,770
OK?

29
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:30,960
And never will we need to do is read these cells into let's just center that read these

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
fields into our expenses.

31
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,500
So on Monday,

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,340
we're going to hit equals on.

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,580
We're gonna hit data entry,

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,160
and we say on Monday we start him from home on on Monday,

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,860
we're gonna hit,

36
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:50,080
equals and our end location is going to be work on his enter on their total miles traveled

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,170
slide difference here,

38
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,280
we're going to say equals on.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,790
We're going to say data entry on We're gonna look at the miles,

40
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,350
But remember,

41
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,840
this is each way.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,230
So then we're going to multiply,

43
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,460
So I'm gonna hit the multiply by two.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,620
So then when I hit enter,

45
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,910
I get 12 in here because we're doing it both ways.

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,590
So from home to work six miles each way is 12 miles in total.

47
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,500
On the final one is the reason for journey.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,170
So let's just sit equals on go to data entry.

49
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:20,870
Andi,

50
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,890
I haven't put it in,

51
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,990
so we'll just click there on on here.

52
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,150
Will change that will say reason?

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,850
Full journey.

54
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,350
Okay,

55
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,560
We'll make that blue.

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,830
Copy the formatting from there and place it over there.

57
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,410
Now,

58
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:43,100
we're gonna do something a little bit clever here what we're going to do rather than

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,240
display zero,

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,470
because we don't particularly want it to say zero.

61
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,720
What we want to say is,

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,110
if this is zero,

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,730
then actually,

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,180
just explain nothing at all.

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,500
So we'll come to the conditional format in in the next lecture.

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,230
Okay,

67
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,690
So I'm just going to go ahead and I'm gonna reference Tuesday equals Tuesday to our Tuesday

68
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,520
start and so on and so forth all the way through.

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
And I'll see you in the next lecture.

70
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,450
When will cover conditional formatting.

71
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,780
So you in the next lecture.
