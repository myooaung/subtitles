1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
OK,

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:02,920
guys,

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,120
Now,

4
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,070
before we are their traffic lights in,

5
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:09,820
What we need to do is evaluate the percentage in this column just here.

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,160
Now,

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,610
you may think this is a simpler is right in this formula,

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,730
which is equals to some of all of these close brackets divided by the number of cells we

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:19,970
have,

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,510
which is 12345 only by five.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:23,860
Andi,

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,410
enter.

13
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,360
Just copy that down on.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,600
Let's change that to a percentage.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,750
Let's knock off those decimal So they go.

16
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,050
It looks like we have a 60% chance of having a B L t.

17
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,370
Because we have a one here,

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,080
one here on the one here.

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,210
But actually what we have is a 100% chance of having a BLT based on the entries that we've

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,790
put in here because this cell is blank on this cell is blank.

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,040
So what we need to do in our percentage is discount the zeros here,

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,380
or at least discount where we don't have a value.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:06,210
Now we know how to count the values in a particular range by using the count a function so

24
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,660
we're gonna do is delete the five and replace it with a can't a function so I can't a and

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,170
I'm gonna highlight this.

26
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,680
I'm gonna hit f four because when we drag this down,

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,470
we wanted to always reference this range just here.

28
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,170
Closer brackets on his enter.

29
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,200
So they go there.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,540
We have a 100% chance of having a BLT.

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:40,870
We have a 67% chance of having a chicken salad because we have to interest out of the three

32
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,210
values that we've entered,

33
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,440
we have a 33% chance of having a full English breakfast because we have one entry off the

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,200
three values that we've entered up here on.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,720
We've got absolutely no chance of ever been chilli con Carney spanked ball,

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,860
a cottage pie or a shepherd's pie.

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,500
OK,

38
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,880
we've got our percentages now.

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,930
What we're gonna do is at a traffic light system.

40
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,050
So we're the home tab.

41
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:08,500
We've selected the cell where we want to add to our traffic lights,

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,860
and we're gonna go to conditional formatting.

43
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,450
Now,

44
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,040
in the past,

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
we've always gone to new rule.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,470
But this time we're gonna choose icon sets.

47
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,570
Now,

48
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,480
when I'm playing around with these in just a few seconds,

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,190
just pay attention to what happens over here.

50
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,800
So if they chose this option,

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,220
you can see the 100% gives us an upwards green arrow.

52
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,010
Or we can have this or we can have this or this or these or a traffic.

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,560
Actually,

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,650
that's the traffic light or indicators.

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,080
So I'm gonna don't go for this one.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,100
The tick.

57
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,990
So 100% is a take.

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,800
I'm gathering mill percent is across,

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,610
and somewhere in between is an exclamation point.

60
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,470
So I'm just gonna click that I want a copy that formatting and paste it away.

61
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,700
Down on.

62
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,470
There you go.

63
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,400
We have crosses here.

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,150
We have no chance of having either of these meals or any of those meals.

65
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:11,370
We have a 100% chance of having a BLT because we have three items selected on all three

66
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,950
items appear in that recipe,

67
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,750
and we have some degree of a chance of these things,

68
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,390
most likely chicken salad at 67% or 33% chance off full English.

69
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,250
So let's just pick much every house.

70
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,590
You have bread and they go bread.

71
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,670
Now we've dropped down to a 25% chance,

72
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,650
which is below the below the third.

73
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,890
So we've now got across Onda.

74
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,660
We have a 100% chance of having a b lt still.

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,470
Okay.

76
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,920
Now,

77
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,150
in this cell,

78
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,140
we're gonna have a look at in the next lecture.

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,610
We're gonna have a look at the hyperlink formula now.

80
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,630
It's pretty redundant as far as this project goes.

81
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,260
But there are some quirks with views in the hyperlink formula that are absolutely

82
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,860
impossible to work out unless you actually know how to do it.

83
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,080
So we're going to cover that off in the next lecture.

84
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,150
I'll see you there.
