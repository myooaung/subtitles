00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
Okay,

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.120
guys,

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.680
your final challenge on did It's a little bit more complicated still,

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.930
but what you're going to do is use a lot of the things that you've learned already in this

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:12.290
course.

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.650
So you definitely have all the tools that you need to complete this task.

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.780
But it it's a bit of a humdinger,

8
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.800
while when to do.

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.890
Firstly in the same cell on every one of these is add another heading naked at it any way

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.450
you want,

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.980
and what I wanted to call it is description.

12
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.820
And then,

13
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.480
after your description,

14
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.410
what I want you to do is write a simple description that describes the that describes the

15
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.660
recipe that you on.

16
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.440
So for BLT,

17
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.070
you could say description,

18
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.270
a classic sun,

19
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.450
which,

20
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.210
and,

21
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.450
uh,

22
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.880
just couple of words,

23
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.680
just something very quickly that describes If you don't know what the dish is,

24
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.310
just write anything.

25
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.260
So in the same cell on every one of our recipe tabs at the wear description in the cell

26
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.320
next to it,

27
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.350
just type your description of that recipe.

28
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.550
So far,

29
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.970
so good on.

30
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:25.300
What I want to do is build a V look up to look of the description from each of the sheets

31
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.970
in here Now,

32
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.110
it only used to be a short description,

33
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.960
but there's no cheating.

34
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.290
You can't say equals V.

35
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.070
Look up and then type description and then click on here on,

36
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.540
then pick up your description.

37
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.490
A hit comma two comma.

38
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.020
False on enter.

39
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.440
What I went to do is build your table array using the data that you already have in here so

40
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.390
you can build your table array and you can build where you're gonna look using all the

41
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.190
skills that you've developed so far.

42
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.770
So what you essentially going to create is a dynamic V Look up based on the sheet name

43
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.800
detailed over here.

44
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.840
Okay,

45
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.210
good.

46
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.030
Look on.

47
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.020
I will see you in the next lecture.
