1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,610
Okay,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,000
guys,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,720
we're nearly at the end of this particular section.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,310
Now.

5
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,470
The project is a little bit in complete on.

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,820
I've done that on purpose.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,430
So you can see in here that we can enter a week ending.

8
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,230
We can interact,

9
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,720
start times and finish times and all these things.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,260
And these are now automatically populating over here,

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,020
which is all good.

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,350
And we're also automatically populating all the way over here.

13
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,150
But we've missed one.

14
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,210
Okay?

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,340
Now,

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,080
what we've missed on the expenses form is the date.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,530
Now,

18
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,280
we could go ahead and type that in.

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,500
But what I want you to do is a practice exercise is build something into this form just

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,600
here so the user can enter today's date on.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,660
I want you to be able to flip over to the expenses form and have that date automatically

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,150
populate in here.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,080
Now,

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,220
at the moment,

25
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,080
you know that if you automatically reference another cell with the date in,

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,210
it will probably return a number.

27
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,050
So what I want you toe also do is format the date.

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,210
So it appears as the day name in short.

29
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,640
So if it's Friday,

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,440
it will say,

31
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,490
F r I And then I want a space.

32
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,900
And then the date the number of the date,

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,850
the month in short form.

34
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,490
So January would be jam on the year in a two digit format.

35
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,050
So,

36
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,830
for example,

37
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,030
it would say Fry.

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,680
06 Mar 2015.

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,550
Okay,

40
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,960
when you've done that,

41
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,250
just take a screen cap of it and post it in the in the side of the screen.

42
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,800
There s so we can all see that you managed to do it.

43
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay,

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,540
See you in the next lecture.
