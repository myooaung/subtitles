00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.740
John,

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.760
hopefully this is going to help you work out how I put together that formula that I post it

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.150
to you now for everyone else.

5
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.590
Journals question Waas.

6
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.200
He has a spreadsheet with three columns of data headed calls.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.530
Text on data on what we want to do is if there is no value,

8
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.000
they should be.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.290
No,

10
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.940
it has no value in any in all of these cells.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.350
We want to return a blank column day.

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.630
But there's a value in any of these cells.

13
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.540
What we want to do is returned the head in for that particular column in Collin de.

14
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.350
Okay,

15
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.310
so the way Well,

16
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.990
about this Waas will do the simple part.

17
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.380
First it's a nested if formula.

18
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.840
So what we end dues were going to say equals if open rackets which Mr Mitt,

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:06.150
if over rackets the some of these is greater than sorry is equal to zero.

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.460
So that is we have a zero value in every one of them.

21
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.730
Return a blank.

22
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.960
Failing that for now.

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.620
What we're gonna do Say something else So they get something else.

24
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.870
Let me just put that right.

25
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.550
Something else So they go.

26
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.430
So we can see as we have values in these that some evaluates to more than zeros that

27
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.280
therefore we get our false statement or something else.

28
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.910
So let's copy that them.

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.870
When we can see there on the blanks,

30
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.880
it returns a blank.

31
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.580
So it's perfectly fine that that works for our first test.

32
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.190
Now,

33
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.240
our second tests is another.

34
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.850
If test,

35
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.940
we're gonna build individually and then put them all together at the end.

36
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.210
So we're going to say is if open rackets,

37
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.960
this cell value is greater than zero,

38
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.680
then return the value in a two.

39
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.770
So we're just going to click a two and hit F four because we always want to return the

40
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.020
value in a to at least for column A.

41
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.530
So they were going to say,

42
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.140
Come up.

43
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.370
So that's our value for sure.

44
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.670
In the value of its false is gonna be a double quotes,

45
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.490
which is a blank.

46
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.090
So and so they go now I'm just gonna copy the understand So we can see now that for every

47
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.820
time we have a value in column,

48
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.430
I will return in the word calls here on where we don't have a value in column a it's just

49
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.380
returned in the blank,

50
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.210
which is our false statement.

51
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.500
So there's gonna quickly do that for the other One was so equals.

52
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.630
If that is greater than zero,

53
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.150
return the F four because we want to return the absolute value.

54
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.890
Double quotes have not returned like enter.

55
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.950
So there we get the word text.

56
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620
And finally,

57
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.310
if open rackets that is greater than zero return.

58
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.830
See,

59
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.710
too at full,

60
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.330
absolute cell reference because we always one returned.

61
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.750
Absolute See Absolute for Comer.

62
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.490
If it ain't true,

63
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.720
return a blank.

64
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.780
So there you go.

65
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.500
So you can see that that works.

66
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.110
Whips Let me cover that.

67
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.820
Now there is piecemeal met.

68
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.030
What we want to do is join these strings together.

69
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.280
So what we're gonna use here is a concatenation cattle which we have used before.

70
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.480
We're going to say this comma,

71
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.760
this comma,

72
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.730
this close brackets and there we can see that we need to modify our formula slightly

73
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.200
because what we have is literally called text data with no space in between.

74
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.660
So we're going to go back to this cell and we're gonna change our true evaluation.

75
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.170
So we're absolutely going to return the absolute a absolute to sell value.

76
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.640
Andi whips,

77
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.040
miss it quotes space quote so they can see in this.

78
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.090
Formally we get calls with the space between the word text There we Excuse me.

79
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.720
We need to do that on this one too.

80
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.110
So immediately after the true statement and before we get to the comment for the full

81
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.360
statement on day quotes,

82
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.690
space quotes and we don't need to do for the last one because state or is the last word

83
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.380
until aerated.

84
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.650
Then I think I missed it there.

85
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.280
Andi looks like it worked.

86
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.590
Long text didn't know.

87
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.200
Sorry.

88
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.350
Copy that.

89
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.580
Now,

90
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.870
having a eso calls text data.

91
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.010
So they're the individual elements here evaluated.

92
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.680
They're all blank and if so,

93
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.570
return blank,

94
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.020
if not something else and that something else is going to be built out of these.

95
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.080
So if we modified our comm cattle ation formula first,

96
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.160
what we can see is we're looking at e three.

97
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.620
So what we can do is copy the value or the formula out of e three.

98
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.850
So just copy that.

99
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:12.790
Come over to here and replace e three with the formula that was in e three and we can see

100
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.710
that The next one is F three.

101
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.160
So we can go to F three and copy the formula Copy.

102
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.520
That was in three.

103
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.140
So we can replace from both at three.

104
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.590
On.

105
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.120
Finally,

106
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.520
we can see that this G three so we can go to G three.

107
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.170
I think I can delete that bit now because we don't leave the space there.

108
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.270
Hopefully that's the works yet on.

109
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.710
We can copy the formula in G three,

110
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.800
copy and drop That rips its escape.

111
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.910
Alan on.

112
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.220
Copy that where?

113
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.950
It says G three.

114
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.470
So now we can delete thes three cells.

115
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.920
Delete Onda.

116
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.930
Copy that down.

117
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.320
And there we have our something else.

118
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.210
So here,

119
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.040
where are false statement is something else.

120
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.360
We're just going to take that formally.

121
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.460
We've just built up,

122
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.550
so I'm just gonna copy all of that,

123
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.180
and I'm gonna pace it over the false section of the test where we currently have something

124
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.810
else.

125
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.350
Paste.

126
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.070
Hey,

127
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.150
center on,

128
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.370
then.

129
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.440
Copy that down.

130
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.680
So now control it,

131
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.550
Colon e.

132
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.730
And they go,

133
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.750
There's your complex forming with the water posted you on the on the forum.

134
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.440
And that's exactly how I built the formula.

135
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.470
Hope that helps,

136
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.260
but as always.

137
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.460
If you have any questions,

138
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.870
drop me a line and also what I could do to help.

139
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.100
Have a great day and thanks again for the question.
