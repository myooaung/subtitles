1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,380
Okay,

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:02,730
guys,

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,830
welcome back there.

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:10,090
The formula we're gonna use in these cells just hear what we want them to do is evaluate to

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,800
a zero or a one.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,970
So if we get ones all the way across the board,

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:21,100
that means we have every single one of these items in the line that that particular that

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,540
those ones appear in.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,390
So if we get one for broccoli,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,600
one for about a one carat,

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,500
one for broccoli again on one for bacon.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,790
We know we can make BLT if we only get one.

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,010
We only have 20% of the ingredients.

14
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,780
And if we get too,

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,040
we have 40%.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,410
And if we get three ones,

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,280
we have 60% and so on and so forth.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,770
Now,

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,300
what we're gonna need to build is a complex formula using a lot of the functions that we've

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,950
used before or some of the functions that we've used before.

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,870
Andi,

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,910
I think most certainly one that we haven't.

23
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,480
So what we're gonna do in these next few lectures is have a look at the things that we

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,140
haven't seen before on learn what they do.

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,590
Now.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,110
The first thing we're gonna look at is the indirect function.

27
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,250
So what we're gonna do in this cell is we're gonna type the classic hello world,

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,890
and you can see that this is sell E six.

29
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,260
So in e six,

30
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,770
we've just typed Hello,

31
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,580
world on Dhere.

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,260
What we're gonna do is we're gonna type the six.

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,290
So if we wanted to have a hello world here,

34
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,510
we could hit,

35
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,630
equals and click this self and hit return on.

36
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,940
Obviously we get hello,

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,560
world.

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,650
But if we wanted to use the value in this cell to directors to this cell,

39
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,620
all we would need to do is on an indirect formula.

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,450
So we're going to say equals in direct IDs.

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,200
Open brackets click the cell with the indirect reference,

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
and that will be a cell reference in this instance.

43
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,390
Close the brackets and hit enter on their We get our hello world.

44
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,550
So what in directors done is it says,

45
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,410
get the value from this cell and treat it as a location to another cell,

46
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,940
which is E six.

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,270
So if over here we would sit a tub.

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,550
Look,

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,860
if over here with type,

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,250
um,

51
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,950
press thing balloons,

52
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,360
I have no idea why I said balloons on over here.

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,150
We know changed this to say h six instead of what is that?

54
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:36,470
We cannot say that we get balloons so indirect is particularly useful if you have to build

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,510
a string that's going to give you a cell or sheet reference on No,

56
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,380
that's not going to be much you at the moment.

57
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,680
Because we progress in this particular formula,

58
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,550
it will become very clear.

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,210
Okay,

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,060
let's move on to the next lecture where we're gonna have a look at building a string.
