00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.750
guys.

3
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.320
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.660
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.170
Lecture.

6
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.530
Now this questions from Daymo.

7
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.770
What Daymo has is a spreadsheet with to drop down lists in two columns on what he wants to

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.050
do is have a use that pick one of the selections from drop down one a selection from

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.780
dropped down to and depending on those answers,

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.880
return the intersection of those two rows and columns.

11
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.400
This is the question here.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.880
And here's his friend she that have created the mimics his data.

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.920
So what we have is a list here off depth,

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.800
which is very deep,

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.030
deep,

16
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.420
moderate,

17
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.960
shallow,

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.080
very shallow on a list across the top here,

19
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.520
which is very hot heart,

20
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.550
medium cold and very cold.

21
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.490
Now this medium did say moderate.

22
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.210
But because we're going to use named Ranges,

23
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.880
I've changed this to medium because you kind of have to named Rangers with same name.

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.400
So what I'm gonna do for now,

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm just going to delete that word depth,

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.470
and I'm just going to create some some name ranges,

27
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.270
so I'm just selecting that entire section with it.

28
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.600
With the exception of heat on a choose create from selection on,

29
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.500
we already have top row and left Colin lying in a click.

30
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.170
Ok,

31
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.030
now I'm gonna add the word depth back in there just so we can see what it is now.

32
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.530
Here,

33
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.010
you'll see that magically we have cold,

34
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.950
which is being created,

35
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.040
which is this list here on we have We have cold,

36
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.580
deep heart,

37
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.550
medium moderate,

38
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.340
shallow,

39
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.430
very cold.

40
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580
Noticed he underscored because we have two words.

41
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.630
There's an underscore.

42
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.740
Very deep,

43
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.580
very hot and very shallow.

44
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.090
So any of those will display the the range that they refer to FOCAC way of getting named

45
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.910
ranges in.

46
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.840
So here what we're gonna do is we're going to create some drop down list.

47
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.820
So we're gonna go today,

48
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.050
sir.

49
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.100
Gonna get the data validation.

50
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760
We're going to go to data validation on.

51
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.850
Let me just drank that in on.

52
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.120
We're gonna l A list and we're gonna have this groups.

53
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.200
Let me just move that out the way we're gonna have this as the source on.

54
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.920
Then we're going to click.

55
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.910
Ok,

56
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.360
okay.

57
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.780
So now we have a drop down list of all those options down there long and do is I'm just

58
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.550
gonna come down.

59
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.240
I'm gonna copy that all the way down to Day 10 control on D.

60
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.470
So now we have a drop down in all of those here.

61
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.100
We're going to do something very similar data validation,

62
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.590
data validation alot list.

63
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.880
And this time,

64
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.450
we're going to use in the way we're going to use this range over here.

65
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.070
So is the headings Very hard heart medium called Very cold on we're going to say Okay.

66
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.040
And then again,

67
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.150
you'll see that there in our drop down list.

68
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.060
Andi,

69
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.750
I'm just going to copy that away.

70
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.810
D o to number 10 control Andi.

71
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.130
So here we have our options.

72
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.090
So from here,

73
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.370
I could say something is very deep,

74
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.560
and here I could say something is very hot.

75
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.240
Now,

76
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.220
what we want to do here is return the intersection of that rose on that column.

77
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.000
So the answer would be maybe now you'll remember from earlier on.

78
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.090
What we could do is we could say equals very hot.

79
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.960
There we go.

80
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.430
Floatable.

81
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.490
Click it space on,

82
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.930
then say very deep.

83
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.160
And the answer would be when we hit intact.

84
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.040
Miraculously.

85
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.660
Maybe Now what we need to do here is used the indirect because these are words on what we

86
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.130
actually want to do is refer to the those words as their named range.

87
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.870
But we have a problem very deep.

88
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.350
Has a space or one of the first things that we need to do is replaced the space with an

89
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.580
underscore because the named range will have an underscore wherever there is a space.

90
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:15.040
And to do that because I equal substitute open rackets groups.

91
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.670
I'm not typing by my typing,

92
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.150
trying and equals sub sti shoot.

93
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.880
So we're gonna substitute and we're gonna use this text comma on the old text is going to

94
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.890
be quotes,

95
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:37.100
space quote and we're going to say comment on the new texts going to be quote underscore

96
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.500
quote on when I close the brackets and hit Enter will know get very deep now what we want

97
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.450
to do it is used the indirect function just in front of that.

98
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.050
So rather than return the words very deep,

99
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.900
it's actually looking at the named range and very deep.

100
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.300
So I'm gonna say in direct,

101
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.660
we've covered this earlier whips and a high rex.

102
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.560
We've covered this earlier in the course in direct and then close the brackets and hit

103
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.850
enter and get a value.

104
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.750
Don't worry about that.

105
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.430
Then we want to say exactly the same thing.

106
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.550
But for columns,

107
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.130
See?

108
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.500
So I'm just gonna copy all of that.

109
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.320
Except for the in the equal Sign control.

110
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.850
And see,

111
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.430
I'm gonna hit a space just like we did in the earlier example.

112
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.440
On this time,

113
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.810
we're gonna point to see to and I'm gonna hit Enter.

114
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.580
So now we get the answer off.

115
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.460
Maybe so here we could say very shallow on.

116
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.880
Let's pick this one on Dhere.

117
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.610
We could say medium and we should get the answer.

118
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.230
Yes,

119
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.740
we do.

120
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.920
We really something.

121
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.700
Weather is different.

122
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.060
Answer,

123
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.340
I say cold on.

124
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.600
We should now get Maybe now that's gonna work perfectly well.

125
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.550
Let me just copy that damn controlling day.

126
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.910
But if we have no answers in here,

127
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.630
we're going to get a ref error.

128
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:08.080
So we need to do is come to the very front and say if era open brackets come all way to the

129
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.140
end and say comma,

130
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.970
if there's an error,

131
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.490
just returned a blank and enter on Well,

132
00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.310
let me copy that Down Control and D and they go No,

133
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.460
it works perfectly.

134
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.890
So from the next drop down list,

135
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.200
I could choose very deep,

136
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.100
and here I could choose medium.

137
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.930
Can I get a maybe.

138
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.450
Or I could choose very hot.

139
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.200
And then I still get it.

140
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.250
May be a very cold.

141
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.590
I'm gonna get in.

142
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.850
No.

143
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.010
Okay.

144
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.750
I hope that helps is always.

145
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.520
Any questions.

146
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.360
Just let me know,

147
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.100
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
