1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,290
Okay,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,290
guys are welcome back to another student.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,570
Questions answered.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,090
Lecture.

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,010
Now these questions come up a few times from a couple of different students on what they

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,110
wanted to know.

7
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,660
Waas,

8
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,960
how did you extract the last name?

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,470
If the person has a middle name now,

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,410
you can still do this with a formula.

11
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,540
It's quite straightforward.

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,290
Once you understand the steps now,

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,140
I don't particularly want to show you the finished formula because in isolation,

14
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,250
unless you understand the component parts of it,

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,900
it can look quite intimidating.

16
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,470
But once we break it down into the different steps,

17
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,860
you'll find that it's actually fairly straightforward.

18
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,700
So here we go.

19
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,310
What we want to know first,

20
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,000
is how many spaces we have in each of these cells.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,310
And to do that,

22
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,560
we're going to use to of excels built in functions were going to use substitutes.

23
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,070
And we're going to use Len,

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,850
which is short for links now the limb function.

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,550
It just tells you how many characters are in a particular string.

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,650
So if I take that,

27
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,780
we can see that Elvis Presley has 13 characters,

28
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,770
one of them being the space,

29
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,660
so we'll come back to that in just a second.

30
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,850
So what we want to do now is use the substitute function.

31
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,550
It would help if I could spell substitute.

32
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,870
This is the tanks we want to look at.

33
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,190
We want to look for a space.

34
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,210
So that's quotes,

35
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,250
space quote,

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,050
and we would like to replace it with nothing.

37
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,210
So double quotes.

38
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,570
Don't worry about the instant instance.

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,980
Number close brackets hit and tap so they you can see that we get Elvis Presley without the

40
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,570
space.

41
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,910
Now what we want to know is,

42
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,910
how long is Elvis Presley with outer space?

43
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,920
And the answer is 12 characters now.

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,750
This one was 13 characters.

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,150
So all we need to do is so tracked this Elvis Presley from that Elvis Presley.

46
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:58,810
So we're just gonna side a limb A to close brackets minus and enter.

47
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,570
So they go the different stream.

48
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,480
Elvis Presley,

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,570
with the space and over,

50
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,140
especially without a space,

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,750
is one.

52
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,950
So we know we have one space.

53
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,690
Let me just copy that down just to show you that that works,

54
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,500
particularly get my mouse on its pattern.

55
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,090
They go.

56
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,040
So we get 1212 and that corresponds with the number of spaces in each of these cells.

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,670
Okay,

58
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,310
Part one.

59
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,890
Part two,

60
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,290
if this equals one,

61
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,700
will capture this in a logical tests at the very end.

62
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,890
But this is just to break it down.

63
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,370
If this equals one,

64
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,580
get the position of the last space.

65
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay,

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,120
so this equals one.

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,750
We're going to get the position of the last space in that cell and that cell.

68
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,570
Okay,

69
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,000
so here are we gonna do,

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,450
say,

71
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,280
equals if be to Where are we?

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,840
There we go.

73
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:53,980
If B two equals and we're going to say one comma than what we want to do is find the space

74
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,120
comment within this text.

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,580
Start number one helps if you close the brackets.

76
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,690
So here we can see that the space in Elvis Presley is the sixth character.

77
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,340
Elvis has five letters.

78
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,570
And the six character is the space.

79
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,140
Okay,

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,700
So far,

81
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,150
so good.

82
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,830
These are false because we have more than one space.

83
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,180
But don't worry about that for a minute.

84
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,870
Will capture all that at the end.

85
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,200
Extent three is if there is only one space,

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,250
then we just want to capture the right most characters after that space.

87
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,190
So we're going to use the right function.

88
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,900
So we're going to say,

89
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,400
right,

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,040
open brackets eight to this elks.

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,050
We're going to the right of that cell we want to say,

92
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,620
Is the links off a too close?

93
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,510
Brackets minus.

94
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,330
Find reviews.

95
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,810
Find before find the space in A to just typing is in there from position one.

96
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,850
Close brackets close records and enter.

97
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,730
So they go.

98
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,100
No.

99
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,610
You can see that we've extracted Presley from Elvis Presley,

100
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,310
Aaron Presley or Aaron Presley from this one because it's gone after the first space.

101
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,750
But don't worry,

102
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,890
we will capture that later.

103
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,620
Jackson from Samuel Jackson and L Jackson from Samuel L.

104
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,240
Jackson.

105
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay,

106
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,970
so if we only have one space,

107
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,750
we can now extract the last name here and here.

108
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,110
Okay,

109
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,150
get the position in the last space if B doesn't equal one.

110
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,970
So what we're gonna do here is we're going to use to find within a find.

111
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,140
Because if we just did a straightforward find,

112
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,670
sir equals open brackets.

113
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,530
Find text space comma within text.

114
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,040
This comma start number one is going to tell us six.

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Just as it did earlier.

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,650
Okay,

117
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,210
So you got 667 and eight That's where our thirst spaces start.

118
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,570
Now,

119
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:56,030
the problem we have here is we don't actually know where to start after number one to get

120
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,500
to the second space.

121
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,840
So what we're going to do is gonna have to nest that find within another.

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,270
Fine.

123
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,730
So what we're going to say is equal find and think of this as the outer find.

124
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:15,550
We want to find text space comma within this text comma.

125
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:21,080
But we want to start where we found the first space plus one.

126
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,710
So if you found this first base at six,

127
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,880
we actually want to start looking at seven.

128
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Going forward now.

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,660
So when I close that and his center,

130
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,450
that will be an error because there's only one space,

131
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,750
but the ones where we have two spaces will return 12 and 10.

132
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,520
So hopefully that makes sense.

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,020
We've used to find to find where the first spaces that's this one.

134
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,040
We've added one to it to get that number plus one and then have used that as a start point

135
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,450
far out to find.

136
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,170
And that's how we find the second space position.

137
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,030
Okay,

138
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,920
set four.

139
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,700
We're going to use a less a formula.

140
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,430
We've just written in the mid formula?

141
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,770
No,

142
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,730
at a mid function there amid function just extracts the middle bit of a string.

143
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,630
So we just said,

144
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,680
amid open brackets pointed to this,

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,660
we want to start a number two.

146
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,840
We wanna extract two characters and then we get L V.

147
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,180
Because L v starting that number two for two characters is l envy off Elvis Presley.

148
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,630
Okay,

149
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,060
so we're gonna use that with the formula that we've just written.

150
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,730
Remember,

151
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,390
this is only for the two's.

152
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,700
I'm gonna do it here in L era,

153
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
but when we copy it down,

154
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,250
it will answer correctly here in here.

155
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,920
And thats so we will get the last name for anything with two spaces.

156
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,570
So let's take this formula that we've just written,

157
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,570
not with the Eagles coffee eso Let's take that.

158
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,710
And we're gonna say here equals with actually less ideological test.

159
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,650
If these equals two,

160
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,160
then mid open brackets.

161
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,390
This is a text we're looking at on.

162
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,550
We want to go from there on.

163
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,720
We want to go,

164
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,710
let's say 100 characters because no one has less paper.

165
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,570
That's more than 100.

166
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,250
Garrett pissed and his enter for gets closer brackets.

167
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
But when we copy that down,

168
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,030
we can see that here we get,

169
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,830
Presley.

170
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,760
And here we get traction,

171
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,910
Jackson,

172
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,810
these areas.

173
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,280
But don't worry,

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,610
Mandrax will capture that at the very end.

175
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,450
Okay,

176
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,220
And now we're going to combine all of those formulas together in the last step.

177
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,040
So the first thing we're going to go do is take this.

178
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,340
Look,

179
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,840
this test here that tells us one or two on building into a logical test so we can say if we

180
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,510
make a majority a vision that we haven't So we want to say is if the length of all of that

181
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,650
equals one,

182
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:54,400
then I'm just gonna take it the equals so can steal this formula here.

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,550
So it's going to be the rice a two copy escape.

184
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,610
So if all of that equals one,

185
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,230
we're just going to use the right function comma on enter.

186
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,970
There's no equal.

187
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,250
So it's not going to evaluate to anything at the moment.

188
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:15,220
And here I'm just going to take it that that logical test that if we just say mid and

189
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,540
hopefully yeah,

190
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,350
that should work.

191
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm just gonna copy that mean way.

192
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,800
Go.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,350
Copy.

194
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,610
Oops.

195
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,380
Escape.

196
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,070
Copy.

197
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,640
and paste that in there.

198
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,470
So if this length of a to less length of a two without the spaces equals one,

199
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,980
just extract the right if it doesn't extract the middle string started the second space for

200
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,960
100 characters,

201
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,850
assuming no monastic second last name with more than 100 characters.

202
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,630
So now when I put on equals in front of that hate Santa,

203
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,640
we get Presley.

204
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,190
Remember?

205
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,200
Copy it down.

206
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,030
We get presently.

207
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,620
Presley,

208
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,390
Jackson,

209
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,020
Jackson.

210
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,650
It looks a bit complicated,

211
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,300
but if you follow those steps,

212
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,180
you should be able to understand how that works.

213
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,030
Hope that helps,

214
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,630
and it's always.

215
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,720
If you have any questions,

216
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,500
do let me know,

217
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,790
have a great day and I'll see you in the next lecture.
