00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Hello and welcome back to another student.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,650
Questions answered like chap.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:12,650
Now this question is from Irene be and all to do with tiered pricing.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,360
Now Irene says,

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:14,730
Hello,

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,070
Alan,

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,910
Thank you for a truly great course.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,250
You're very welcome Hungry.

9
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,950
Thank you very much for the compliment.

10
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,530
She says I'm currently trying to use Excel to calculate the final payment that certain

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,240
customers would pay on their electricity bills per month.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,560
So so far,

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,630
we're into a straightforward,

14
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,750
tiered pricing scenario.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,350
And there is a slight complication because if you look at the data set,

16
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,860
you can see that what we actually have our to pricing structures.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,870
The 1st 2 loans 0 to 15 51 to 100 presumably lower usage customers.

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,090
And then we have another data set another data set as they grow to 200 all the way up to

19
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,850
over 1000 kilowatt hours per month.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,660
So we have essentially two questions tiered pricing on.

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,180
Then we have the two data sets that we need to compare will deal with the two data set

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,720
thing at the end.

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Firstly,

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,830
we're gonna have a look at the tiered pricing.

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,250
No,

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,750
what I've done is I've just taken that Dacian of pace it straight into excel.

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,100
And what I've done is I've created a simple table.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,640
We have ah,

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:28,130
from column A to column on a price column and all this data is in this text 0 to 50 0 to 50

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,950
22 pence or sense or dollars or euros or whenever your local currency is,

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,340
and so on and so forth all the way down.

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,480
So we have three columns from two on price because we have two data sets.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,460
I'm just going to insert a couple of columns there.

34
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,730
And here is where we're gonna type in our units consumed.

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,050
And I'm just gonna color that in yellow.

36
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,840
Now,

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,660
you can do this in a single formula with some products,

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,140
but I've been using Excel 30 years,

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,830
and if I haven't had enough coffee,

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,700
some products can be confusing s.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,870
So what I'm gonna do is take the simplest solution and use a help.

42
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,870
A column and the beauty of helper columns is that even if your data set changes,

43
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,450
that is,

44
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,640
you decided to introduce a new layer within this at a new break.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,550
A new price break.

46
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,750
It's dead.

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,180
Easy to change the formulas accordingly,

48
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,740
and I'll show you how to do that at the end.

49
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,350
So we're going to use a simple solution off a helper column.

50
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,550
Now,

51
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,140
what we have is essentially we're gonna have to different formulas.

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,110
One formula is for the very first opening gambit,

53
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,930
which is this one here on the second formula,

54
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,870
which we're going to use everywhere else will be a different one.

55
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,930
So,

56
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,550
firstly,

57
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,960
the the opening formula is going to be a logical test.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,880
We're going to say if open brackets our value,

59
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,680
I'm gonna hit her for another.

60
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,710
I'm gonna be dragging this particular form around,

61
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,010
but just good practice.

62
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,720
So if our opening number is greater than our upper limit,

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,160
that is,

64
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,630
if this number is greater than that number,

65
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,400
we know we're gonna have to pay the Hall 200 at that price.

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,070
So B C six multiplied by that 200 by the price.

67
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,830
Because if our numbers more than that we knew the 1st 200 they're gonna have to be paid for

68
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,930
at 36 p.

69
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,190
If they are not.

70
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:32,370
Our false value is going to be whatever Aaron number is multiplied by the price and close

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:32,880
records.

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,900
I should really make that at that sale at me.

73
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,250
Let me just So let me just play called who's all those in the correct format.

74
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:43,580
OK,

75
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,550
so if our Numbers 200 we know we're gonna have to pay the 1st 236 p.

76
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,980
So that part is 72 payments.

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,380
Obviously,

78
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,630
if we put 100 there it will have it.

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:01,290
If we put 500 they're still only the 1st 200 they're going to come out at 30 60 given us to

80
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:04,060
£70 bump.

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,850
There's our first formula.

82
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,470
So now what we're gonna do and you can probably guess is we're gonna have a some in here so

83
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,260
we can work out.

84
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,490
What?

85
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,010
We're actually gonna have a summer in the one above it as well.

86
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,440
So much will write that while I'm here.

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,490
Okay,

88
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,610
The second formula.

89
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,960
Also a logical test.

90
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,630
What we're going to say is,

91
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,610
if our number f four,

92
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,850
because they're going to be dragging this formula around,

93
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,480
is greater than our upper limit.

94
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,610
So if this number is greater than this number,

95
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,060
we know that we're gonna have to pay 70 p for every unit between 200 on this upper limit.

96
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,500
So,

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,120
comma,

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,350
what we're gonna say there is open brackets,

99
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,430
this number less this number.

100
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,700
So that will essentially be 150 units at this price,

101
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,430
if our number is greater than the upper limit with me so far.

102
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,120
Okay,

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,570
Comma,

104
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,780
If not,

105
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,170
what we're gonna have to say is whatever it is over 200 up to our number is what we're

106
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,810
gonna pay at 70 p.

107
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:19,260
So we're gonna say open brackets our number at four minus C six because l Anoma less 200 is

108
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:28,040
going to give us one close brackets multiplied by one at this price and close brackets.

109
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,570
So that should give us if we you consume.

110
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:40,570
201 units were going to pay 36 p for the 1st £272 on the 201st unit will be its 70 pig,

111
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,560
Which is that 70.

112
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,980
Think so.

113
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:48,140
Our total beef 720 and that works absolutely beautiful.

114
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,080
It let me just make sure that I got all of my absolute cell references in I have.

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,570
So they go near,

116
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,700
we have worked allowed,

117
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,590
but Here's the problem.

118
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,500
Look what happens when we dragged down.

119
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,980
Ah,

120
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,710
we get minus numbers.

121
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,980
And that's because if this number is not big enough,

122
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,720
we actually get into negative numbers.

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,550
So we're going to do is we're gonna add a quick test in there to solve that problem.

124
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,230
So I'm just gonna take that entire formula.

125
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,190
Copy.

126
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,120
Andi,

127
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,870
I'm going to say if open brackets,

128
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,890
that entire formula is less than or equal to zero.

129
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,350
Just return zero comma.

130
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,290
Just give me that formula back.

131
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,770
So I've just pasted it back in on and sat on Bom bom bomp.

132
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,600
Copy that down and they go.

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,860
So now we can see that that works out perfectly.

134
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,020
So if we have 201 we get 200 units of 36 p 72 pink,

135
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,130
one unit at 70 p.

136
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,560
70 p for a total of 700 some soup bones and 70 pay.

137
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,250
So she went to 3 51 indented.

138
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:02,740
We get £72 in the 0 to 200 band £105 in the 201 23 50 band on that final one seconds.

139
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,850
3 51 at 90 p.

140
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,310
so that some total is 177.9.

141
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,200
Hopefully,

142
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,220
that makes sense to you.

143
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,450
Now what?

144
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,350
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna copy those two copy and paste them in there,

145
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,150
and they go,

146
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,580
you know,

147
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,060
we can see that we have these two things that these formulas will work here.

148
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,550
Justus.

149
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,000
Well,

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,770
as you can see,

151
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,520
cause it's just a drag herbal formula.

152
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,370
But what we do need is a some of those two numbers.

153
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,250
So now we can introduce a logical test that tells us what this price is going to say.

154
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:46,630
If this number is less than 101 comma used this price otherwise,

155
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,370
use this price.

156
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,550
A simple,

157
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,730
logical test.

158
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,470
Tsarnaev.

159
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,570
We consume 99 kilos,

160
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,480
although sorry.

161
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,780
99 kilowatts hours.

162
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:03,170
Although it would be £35.64 from this day to set because L A number 99 is less than 100.

163
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:09,070
It's actually £25.70 and they can see that £25.70 has been read there.

164
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,110
Hopefully you followed that.

165
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,650
Now what I was saying earlier about it's easy to to change this.

166
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,240
We can insert here.

167
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,570
Just copy down to get along the data,

168
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,290
and what we could say is what we got.

169
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,690
Children.

170
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:33,480
123 50 say 201 to 300 on 301 to 3 15 We could say that that becomes 150.8.

171
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:40,610
And when we yet let me that just put something in hand and they go see conceive,

172
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,180
that you can add as many of these as you want and all you need to do and to the lower limit

173
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,140
the upper limit in the price copy of Formula Down.

174

And it's really easy to modify.

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,000
Hopefully,

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,850
that makes sense.

177
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,080
As always,

178
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,910
if you have any questions just returned,

179
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,240
I'll be happy to come back to you.

180
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,510
Have a great day.

181
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,350
I'll see you soon.
