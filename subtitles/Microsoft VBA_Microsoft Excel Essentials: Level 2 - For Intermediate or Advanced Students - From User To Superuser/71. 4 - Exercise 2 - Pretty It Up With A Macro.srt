1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
Okay,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,140
guys,

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,780
practice exercise number two,

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,050
They're gonna have to thing back to a little earlier in this section,

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,020
I think I may have mentioned as we went through this particular section that these tabs

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,610
here with our recipes in our ugly but functional what I want you to do is change the format

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,810
in on this on their stick with may cause this may sound easy,

8
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,450
but it's gonna get a little bit more complicated in a second.

9
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,580
I want you to emergency center on,

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:38,690
change the color and increase the fund size and make it bold and left line Here went to

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,530
bold this Basically,

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,270
I just want you to prove to this up now,

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,180
one of when you do make this a different color,

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,650
perhaps make it bold.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:56,410
Increased thesis eyes Andi column It's something like that and make it so.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,750
It looks very nice,

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,280
but where I want you to do is recalled that as a macro,

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,820
then automatically flip to these tabs and then execute your macro again.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,670
So every single one of these tabs has exactly the same formatting.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,790
So they go.

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,870
That's your challenge.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,950
I'm just doing that.

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,680
I want you to pretty up the format in on one until you're completely happy with it.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,960
I want to record it is a macro.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,720
Then choose each of these.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,500
Intern.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,780
Execute your macro.

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,200
So that all formatted in exactly the same way.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,980
Okay,

30
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,840
so that should give you some.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,200
Practice it recording macros.

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll see when the next lecture.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,240
Where?

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,740
I'll tell you what your final challenge will be.

35
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,950
I'll see you then.
