00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
again.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.880
Guys,

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.910
welcome back.

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm just going to tell you this up a little weeks,

5
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.960
I normally like to leave a blank line in between.

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.150
Let's just remove those freeze panes auto size that have that They're okay.

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.360
Okay,

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.720
guys,

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.910
No.

10
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.550
We have built out of super complicated formula that returns either a zero or a one after

11
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.190
evaluating the start date compared to this cell on the end date compared to that cell or we

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.050
can do now is apply some simple,

13
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.370
conditional formatting to color this thing in.

14
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.660
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna be on the home tab.

15
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.550
We're gonna choose conditional formatting on.

16
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.040
We're going to create a new rule on what we're gonna do is we're going to say,

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.110
use a formula to determine which sells to format.

18
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.110
So now we want to look at this self just here Now,

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.930
by default,

20
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.280
it's absolute cell references to absolute see absolute seven.

21
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.590
I'm just gonna hit therefore a few times,

22
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.990
so I get it to see seven.

23
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.770
So what I'm gonna say is,

24
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
if C seven equals zero,

25
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.790
then the form that I want to apply because I don't want to see this zero in black text I

26
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.410
wanna have the funds color to white.

27
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.650
I'm just going to click,

28
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.420
Okay?

29
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.850
And then I'm gonna click OK again.

30
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.220
So they got zero is still there.

31
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.220
You can see that the formula still there.

32
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.210
But now we can't see the zero because the conditional formatting as colored the funds as

33
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.700
white.

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.510
So what I'm gonna do is copy that format in over a levar days at so whips and easy.

35
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.400
So we should know,

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.860
See,

37
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.860
is all of those zeros become colourless that is white on all of their ones remain.

38
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.690
So the next thing we need to do is do something with one.

39
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.110
So again we're going to come to conditional formatting.

40
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.510
We're going to create a new rule again.

41
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.160
Again,

42
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.950
we're going to use a formula to determine which sells to format.

43
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.750
We're gonna click this little box,

44
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.200
and we're gonna click on this cell and again we're going to hit therefore,

45
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.050
because we don't want to be on absolute de absolute seven.

46
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.140
So we've slight to our cell were going to say equals one on.

47
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.310
Then what do we want to do?

48
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.210
So we're going to choose format,

49
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.230
and we're going to choose fell because we want to color the cell in.

50
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.350
Let's have it in that rather nice blue there.

51
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.580
But there's one more thing that we need to do Will come back to me in just a second.

52
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.110
But for now,

53
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.020
I'm just gonna hit okay on hit,

54
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.900
OK game.

55
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.050
And you can see that the background of the cell has been colored blue,

56
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.540
but we can still see the one.

57
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.700
So what we want to do is go to conditional formatting.

58
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.020
We want to manage rules and this is the one we want to add it.

59
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.750
So I'm just going to highlight this and hit edit rule So we still want d seven equals one.

60
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.950
But the format We're going to go funds and also color the funds in the same blue and they

61
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.520
have hit OK and then hit.

62
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.060
OK,

63
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.220
and now when we hit OK,

64
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.570
you can see that you can't see them one anymore because it's the same color as the

65
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.250
background.

66
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.980
So again,

67
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.670
former painter,

68
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.640
copy that over a lot of our days and,

69
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.110
well,

70
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.550
we all the way to the end there a way to the end over here.

71
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.580
I think that's all of thumb scroll down.

72
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.350
It's was over this way,

73
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.850
Ugo.

74
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.280
In fact,

75
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.970
let's certainly assuming so you can see a little bit more of that.

76
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.090
So So this has been invaluable.

77
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.670
Obviously,

78
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.520
didn't copy health the way down.

79
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.170
There's couple that formats in on Go all the way over here on a way down to the bottom.

80
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.850
There you go.

81
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.970
So now we can see our Gant lines across,

82
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.780
and obviously we're in increments of one.

83
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.970
So we changed that to increments of seven.

84
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.820
We should be on start to Seymour Data.

85
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.390
There you go.

86
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.170
It's happily colored in all of these things.

87
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.460
So amazing Sullivan started.

88
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.790
Ran about the 14th of January 2010 on left us somewhere around about the ninth and we can

89
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.450
move up here and we can see that Ava Anderson started somewhere in the 28th of the 10th

90
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.690
have finished somewhere and the 23rd of the 12th.

91
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.380
Now,

92
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.690
obviously we can We can change our air in increments of here so we could go in months and

93
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.970
they go,

94
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.490
We can see a lot more data now,

95
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.640
So we know that Oscar Kelly started somewhere around the six of the 11th that sorry,

96
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.800
the first of the 6 2011th Andi finish somewhere and 30 for the seventh,

97
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.350
or we could go to six monthly.

98
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.650
On they go,

99
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.030
you can see that the timeline becomes even more compacted on.

100
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.330
That's the beauty of using this increment is that you're not stuck with heavy.

101
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.720
Set it up to begin with,

102
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.890
and you don't have to keep rewriting your formulas across here just because we added that

103
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.910
increments value in way up front.

104
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.350
It's just change that back to seven.

105
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.310
And there you go.

106
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.150
There's a Gant charts,

107
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.700
and that's how you create again.

108
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.990
Chart.

109
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.240
You can't see anything in the 1st 1 that that's a little better.

110
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.920
Sago.

111
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.470
That's how you create a gun charge using a spreadsheet or a work sheet.

112
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.080
Next,

113
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.620
we can have a look at how you do exactly the same thing,

114
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.530
but this time,

115
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.580
using one of excels built in charts.

116
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.130
Okay,

117
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.550
I'll see you in the next lecture
