1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Okay,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,010
guys,

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,810
welcome back.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,070
No.

5
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,680
Bear with me because we're almost there.

6
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,780
We've built the center section about formula.

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,550
Now what we need to do is convert all of these numbers either a number or an error into a

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,070
one or a zero.

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,100
So if we found a number,

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,940
we want to return a one that means that something has appeared in that particular recipe.

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,220
And if it errors,

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:27,550
that is,

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,810
it doesn't appear in that particular recipe.

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,540
We want to return zero.

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,480
So what we're gonna do is modify the formerly we've done,

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,050
and we're gonna wrap around our final part.

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,580
So what we're gonna do is introduce an if test open brackets.

18
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:48,460
Then we're going to say is era open brackets.

19
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,000
Then we're gonna leap all the way over to the end.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,070
We're gonna close the brackets once,

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:00,450
which you can see encapsulate this section of the formula coma.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,010
What do I want to return if the value is true?

23
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,060
So if this is an error,

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,310
what value do I want to return?

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,700
I want to return zero.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,400
If this formula evaluates to an era that is,

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,950
I cannot find a match comma.

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,840
And therefore,

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,250
if it is not an error.

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,790
I want to return a one.

31
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,110
That means I did find a match and are formula didn't era closed,

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,880
brackets his center.

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,090
And there you go.

34
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,400
We get a one in.

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,620
They're just gonna copy that down,

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,200
using control and D I'm a gonna copied all the way across.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,650
So let's give that a quick ride to see if that works.

38
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,810
So we have bacon,

39
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,230
we have butter.

40
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,170
What would be in a bacon sandwich?

41
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,750
A BLT with a bacon.

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,610
Do we have lettuce?

43
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,050
In this list?

44
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,400
We do lettuce onder t tomato,

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,550
tomato.

46
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,800
So they dio And let's just delete that on.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,650
Delete that.

48
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,670
Okay,

49
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,210
there you go.

50
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,260
So we chose from a list.

51
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,420
Bacon,

52
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,170
lettuce,

53
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,610
Andi,

54
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,590
tomato.

55
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,500
We can see that.

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,270
We get a one.

57
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,880
A one on a one on we get.

58
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,990
We don't have bacon in a chicken salad,

59
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,580
but we do have lettuce and tomato.

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,450
So if in our cupboard we have bacon,

61
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,150
lettuce and tomato,

62
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,400
we absolutely 100% can make a b l t again.

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,830
The next thing we're going to do is have a look at building a probability in here and using

64
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,290
a traffic light system.

65
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,120
Okay,

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,650
I'll see you in the next lecture.
