00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
OK,

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.090
guys,

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.830
Now here's another question that I get asked An awful loss on that is can you do a V look

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.550
up using a partial match or a fuzzy V look up by any other name?

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.460
And the answer is,

6
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.160
you can most definitely.

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.850
So again,

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.390
we're using the same data base that we used in the last section the same day to set.

9
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.450
And again what we're going to be doing is looking at the car registration,

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.690
and we want to pull the full name of the person who owns that particular car.

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.790
So again,

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
I'm just going to start by copying that data and pacing in there.

13
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.130
So we actually have something to look at on what we want to return.

14
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.890
Here is the name of the person who who owns that particular car.

15
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.770
So for now,

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.820
I'm just going to write a dead,

17
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.640
straightforward V look up to do just that.

18
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.000
So we're just gonna say equals V.

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.960
Look up from rackets.

20
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.610
Oops,

21
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.850
a daisy While we don't that V look up.

22
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.550
Look at that F four absolute cell reference comma.

23
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.400
Our first column of data contains the registration,

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.540
so she's going to highlight that make sure that's the first column on.

25
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.950
I want to return the full name of the person whose car that is.

26
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.280
So it's 12345 columns across comment five.

27
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.350
And I want an exact match.

28
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.680
False enter.

29
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.700
So they go,

30
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.690
we can see there.

31
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.190
X l 03 double o inch belongs to look at Lee.

32
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.650
But imagine the scenario.

33
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.140
Someone's on the phone to you and they say someone is blocking me in.

34
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410
I can't remember the full car registration,

35
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.790
but I know it ends in m w.

36
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.400
The So if we talk to him wv in here,

37
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.100
we can see that our formula will era even though we have a value in here that says M w V

38
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.190
somewhere in it,

39
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.370
it's not enough to make this value return an exact match again.

40
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.580
What we're gonna do is we're gonna modify this V look up area just here.

41
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.350
So what we're gonna do in front of RV look up is we're gonna type quotes,

42
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.280
multiplication sign and quotes,

43
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.780
and that is the wildcard character.

44
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.320
So there was going to look for is any character in front of RV look up value?

45
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.590
Then we're gonna add on M percent because we wanted to join ups.

46
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.880
And there we have a wildcard character that is any value in front of over.

47
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.750
You look up and we want to do the same thing after every look up.

48
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.670
So gambling in a 1% open quotes wildcard character,

49
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.490
which is the multiplication symbol.

50
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.870
Close quotes on hit Enter.

51
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.530
So they go.

52
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.070
We can know,

53
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.660
just type in M W V on looking down our table,

54
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.280
the car registration with ends of UV And it does indeed belong to William Turner.

55
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.330
So someone's on the phone and they said,

56
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.740
You know what?

57
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.490
I can't remember the entire registration,

58
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.090
but I know it's got 65.

59
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.600
Jane,

60
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.790
you can just hope 65 j Hey,

61
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.350
center.

62
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.460
And there you go.

63
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.650
If we look down here,

64
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.580
we can see that 65 j appears in this one.

65
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.690
And that car belongs to Connor Phillips.

66
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.530
And it'll work for anything we could say.

67
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.230
Actually,

68
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.620
it's,

69
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.750
I know it starts with Y G.

70
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.730
So why G belongs to Toby Richardson,

71
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.080
which we can see here is exactly correct.

72
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.610
Or we could say the last really is N N.

73
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.050
Zed.

74
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.230
In that case,

75
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.530
that belongs to image in Ross.

76
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.920
Which is that lady just there?

77
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.750
So there you go.

78
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.230
That's Hey,

79
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.430
you do Fuzzy V lookups.

80
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.950
Okay,

81
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.180
See you in the next lecture.
