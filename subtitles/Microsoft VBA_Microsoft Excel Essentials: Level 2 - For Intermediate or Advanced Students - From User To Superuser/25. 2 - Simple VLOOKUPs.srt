1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Okay,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,250
guys,

3
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,140
in this section,

4
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,870
we're gonna have a look at building database use and excel as a front end.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,590
Now,

6
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,250
one of the functions that we're going to use is the V.

7
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:12,970
Look up.

8
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,400
If you've not used the look up before,

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,230
you'll probably certainly have heard an awful lot of things about it and generally is

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,590
considered to be on advanced skill in Excel.

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,110
If you can usually look ups,

12
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,430
we're going to go way beyond V looks in this section.

13
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,640
But just so you can understand them simply,

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,620
I've just created this simple spreadsheets called simple V lookups,

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,750
which you can download,

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,020
and in here you can see that we have a data table.

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,570
No,

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,510
we have Helling's up here,

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,720
which I'll just call a real Let's make them red for a minute.

20
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
So we have names and we have Allen,

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,450
Jame,

22
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:47,750
Bob,

23
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,380
June Harry and Joe Joe on We have a hair color,

24
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,660
which is non for make some bold blonde ginger,

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,720
black brown and multicolored hair.

26
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,160
Because Joe's a very colorful character.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,950
Okay,

28
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:05,390
now what we're gonna do is create our first V look up formula so you can see what it does

29
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,390
now.

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,520
The first thing we need to do is enter a value that we want to look up.

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,810
So over here in this cell,

32
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,110
I'm just gonna color this selling.

33
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,240
So we know this is the one that were entered and value into We're gonna enter the word Joe

34
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,150
and you can see that,

35
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,270
Joe is someone in our list up here.

36
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,910
Now,

37
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,950
What we want to find now using the V look up formula is what color hair just Joe have.

38
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,130
So we're gonna hit equals V.

39
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,650
Look up.

40
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,490
We're gonna open brackets and you can see in the tool tip that's just appeared underneath.

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,380
The first thing we want to look at is the look up value.

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,780
Now,

43
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,420
the look of value is this value just here because that is what we want to look up nice and

44
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,530
straightforward so far.

45
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,950
So I'm just going to click on that cell and hit comma,

46
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,800
separate the arguments.

47
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,020
They're the next description say's table array.

48
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,900
And what that means is the data table where you want to actually read the data from.

49
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,210
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna highlight all of this section here so you can see

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,150
that our index are unique reference,

51
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,570
that is,

52
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,760
Joe appears in the first column on That's absolutely critical to be lookups.

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,730
What you looking up must appear in the first column of the data set.

54
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,650
Okay,

55
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,580
so now we've highlighted this section just here.

56
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,830
That's our table array of data table hit,

57
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,010
comma there.

58
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,320
The column index number is the column we want to return a value from.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,340
So this will be the first column where our index lies on.

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,850
This will be the second column,

61
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,700
so we're going to say is column is number two because we read him from the second column

62
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,840
hit Comma.

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,440
And now here we have another choice.

64
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,990
We can either hit True,

65
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,360
which will give us an approximate match.

66
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,190
So that means if we entered something like Elaine instead of Joe and the Lane doesn't

67
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,310
appear in the list,

68
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,570
it will find the closest thing to Elaine.

69
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,500
Generally,

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,580
you're going to be looking for exact matches,

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,550
so you'll be typing false.

72
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,520
And that means find me an exact match to the look of value,

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,590
which is a nine,

74
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,340
which is Joe on return.

75
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,850
Whatever is in Column two.

76
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,830
So let's hit entrance.

77
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,450
It does.

78
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:23,460
They go so we can see from RV look up formula that it has looked as this cell here it's

79
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,490
gone down all of this range.

80
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,660
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom until you find Joe and then it's going to read from the second

81
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,110
column,

82
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:37,640
and it's going to return the value in there so similarly we could type Jane and it would no

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,400
se blonde because it is now looking at a nine Jane.

84
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,930
It's looking in this range a one to be seven,

85
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,790
which is this area just here.

86
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:51,150
It's reading the second column on its gunned down the list.

87
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,090
It's failing Jane on its reading from the second column.

88
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,090
Exact match.

89
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,150
So if we typed Bob and it doesn't have to be case sensitive,

90
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,240
we can it enter.

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,030
We can see the Bob has ginger hair.

92
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,830
OK,

93
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,610
so simply that's how the lookups work.

94
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,720
We're gonna make them much more powerful than that as we work through this section,

95
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,840
but they get may you have a basic understanding of how they work.

96
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,750
Let's cracker
