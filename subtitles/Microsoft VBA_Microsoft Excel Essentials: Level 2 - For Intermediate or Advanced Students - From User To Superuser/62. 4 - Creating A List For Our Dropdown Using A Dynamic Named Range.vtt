00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
Okay,

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.140
guys,

3
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.580
the next thing we want to do is add a Siris of drop down boxes in these five cells here

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.830
that we can use the select our ingredients from the cupboard.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.470
Eso weaken them,

6
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.810
work out if we have those items present in our recipes.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.270
So what we need to do is have a list that we can drop down from.

8
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.530
So here I've just copied the ingredient saves of BLT on I've pasted them in here on.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.640
What we're gonna do now is just add a dynamic named range because this is going to expand

10
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.990
as we add recipes.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:42.950
So I'm just gonna call this my list on his enter that I'm gonna come to Formulas name

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.480
Manager.

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.460
I have my list selected.

14
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.560
I was just going to come to the front just like we have before it offset open brackets.

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.260
This is where we want tell list to start in Absolute.

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.070
A one common zero comma zero.

17
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.650
We don't want to move away from it.

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.200
Coming cams a open rackets.

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.650
We want to look at all of the data in column.

20
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.790
A closed brackets family only want to look at one column on clothes and enter So now when

21
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.670
we click on here,

22
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.040
we can see that this is our named range.

23
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.750
Okay,

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.720
So in the next lesson,

25
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.180
what we're gonna do is a conditional formatting to the rest of these areas of ingredients

26
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.220
because we want to ensure that absolutely every ingredient we have appears in our dynamic

27
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.620
named range.

28
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.150
Okay,

29
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.540
I'll see you in the next lecture.
