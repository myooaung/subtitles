00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Okay,

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.370
guys.

3
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.350
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.380
we had a look at how Excel deals with dates and times,

5
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.550
and you'll recall that dates are counted on from the first of January 1900 in whole days of

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.720
which appear before the decimal place on anything that remains after the decimal place will

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.950
be Cantil is a fraction of the day.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.860
You'll also recall that time can't some from a day that didn't actually exist,

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.010
which was the zero with of January in the year 1900 as gonna be particularly useful when we

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.940
come to summing time.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.460
Okay,

12
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.660
so let's quickly now,

13
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.510
add in the sum of all these this these worked hours just here.

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.380
Okay,

15
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.720
So if we drank over here,

16
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.510
we can see in the quick song that that totals 38 hours and 45 minutes,

17
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.960
which sounds about right.

18
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.420
And I'm sure it is right.

19
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.660
Eso You may think that the easiest way to just some those is just a click on the cell.

20
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.650
Billy hit the auto.

21
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.900
Some hit the answer on.

22
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.460
There you go.

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.400
And we can copy that answer all the way across.

24
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.700
But we get Absolutely,

25
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.000
perhaps wouldn't expect.

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.350
We get the answer of 14 hours and 45 minutes.

27
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.380
Whereas we look,

28
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.090
if we look at the 1st 2 entries there,

29
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.830
we can see already.

30
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.830
We've got to seven.

31
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.910
So there's are 14 hours on.

32
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.450
We've got another hour and 15 minutes sums up so immediately just from the two first cells

33
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.450
.

34
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.930
We know the answer should be 15 hours,

35
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.760
at least.

36
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.630
And then we need to.

37
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.990
And I ate and ate,

38
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.950
and one of the 7.5 hours.

39
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.440
Now,

40
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.190
the clue is in that zero with of January 1900 So I'm just gonna reference that sell for a

41
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.050
second man.

42
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.470
But on what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change the format into Not was It was,

43
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.140
like certain.

44
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.510
Let's go groups have shown for my dee dee.

45
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.340
Uh mm.

46
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.680
Boy,

47
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.270
Why,

48
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.990
boy wide H h s s.

49
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.430
So there you go.

50
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.900
You can see that now that the results of summing all of these thes results just here,

51
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.530
the actual answer would be the first of January 1900 at two oclock in the afternoon.

52
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.720
And that's because while excels done is it started at midnight on Saturday,

53
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.550
Saturday,

54
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.050
the zero with of January counted forward 7.5 hours,

55
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.830
then seven hours and 45 minutes from 7 30 and added eight hours onto some of those 28 hours

56
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.360
onto the some of those three.

57
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.620
Until eventually,

58
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.120
it trips over from the zero with of January to the first of January.

59
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.820
And by the time you keep out in ALS these up you end up from midnight on the zeroth of

60
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.590
January 22 o'clock in the afternoon on the following day.

61
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.180
Okay,

62
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.600
so that's where you were getting answered.

63
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.550
The prints think shouldn't be correct.

64
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.000
Now there's a bunch of really complicated and unnecessary steps you can take to actually

65
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.800
address this,

66
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.950
but there's a much simpler solution.

67
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.680
Just go to your results.

68
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.960
Come to the format cells option from the right click and just before your H is in your

69
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.630
format.

70
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.640
Just type of square bracket at the beginning on close it with another square brackets at

71
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.150
the end.

72
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.940
It's okay on now.

73
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.900
You can see that the NC yet is actually 38 hours and 45 minutes,

74
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.830
which is exactly what it adds up to in the quick.

75
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:22.920
Some eso.

76
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.120
Let's just copy that across.

77
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.170
Let's just sense that the formatting.

78
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.310
And there you go.

79
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.230
That's a you successfully ad time together without tripping over into the following day.

80
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.910
Okay,

81
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.110
See you in the next lecture.
