00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay,

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:02.970
guys,

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.880
final exercise for you.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.310
In the last lecture,

5
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.110
we looked at defining a working area and protecting our workbook.

6
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.370
So in the file that you've downloaded,

7
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.160
I went to flip to the time sheet,

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.620
and I'm deliberately gonna leave it so it looks exactly like this.

9
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.340
Why don't want you to do is make it so underneath the image that we've made transparent,

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.660
I want all the cells to be white,

11
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.510
so you can't see the grid lines underneath.

12
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.190
So that's the first part.

13
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.400
The task second part.

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.170
The task is going to make all of these rose.

15
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.500
Sorry.

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.780
All of these columns over here on all of these rows underneath,

17
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.590
hidden so you can't.

18
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.230
So all you can see is the area that we're working in on.

19
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.620
Then the final thing is,

20
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.110
I want you to make it so only these three areas just here can have data entered into them

21
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.440
on Then protect the workbook on when you've done that.

22
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.030
Going to hit screen cap print screen on your keyboard and posted in the discussion.

23
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.680
Ok,

24
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.340
I look forward to seeing your results.

25
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.520
See you in the next lecture.
