1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,470
Okay,

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,980
guys,

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,280
um,

4
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,440
welcome back.

5
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,890
This is a student questions answered video except a great question from Karen,

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,670
which is actually in two parts.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,630
One of its one of one of the questions about automation.

8
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,150
But I'll cover that in level three.

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,180
But the essential question is,

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,540
can you use a V look up or something like that to return a picture?

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,770
Now you'll find two downloadable resource is from this lecture.

12
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,570
You'll find the file that I'm now gonna work on called V lookups with pictures before and

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,110
at the end.

14
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,620
I'm going to save the completed version.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,650
Gonna call it v lookups with pictures after how imaginative is that?

16
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,030
So basically,

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,760
what we have is this is our day to file.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,700
And I just got four of my buddies in here.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,630
Ashleigh Claire,

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,160
Clinton,

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,670
Dolly and some father.

22
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,990
Beautiful photographs off each of them.

23
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,510
Now,

24
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,780
first thing to notice,

25
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,670
these pictures fit perfectly within the cells that they're in.

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,760
So Ashley fits perfectly within B one,

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,940
and Danny fits perfectly with him.

28
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,050
Be for now.

29
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,720
They don't have to fit perfectly,

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,770
but they mustn't overlap.

31
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,780
That's the first thing.

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,460
Now what we need to do is a little able to each of these pictures.

33
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,560
So what we could do,

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,590
or technically,

35
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,550
what we need to do is Adul able to the cell that the picture appears in.

36
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,530
We could do this manually by click,

37
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,790
clicking on the seller and growing up here and type in.

38
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,050
It doesn't much quick away.

39
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,300
So I'm just going to select from a one down to be for a micrometer formulas.

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,130
And when it comes to hear this,

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,150
defined names are gonna hit,

42
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,530
create from selection.

43
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,870
And here it's automatically chosen left column,

44
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,250
which is where their names leave soon.

45
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,420
Okay,

46
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,930
on,

47
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,570
that's done.

48
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,050
So now if we have looking here,

49
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,170
we can see Ashley.

50
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,670
Is Selby full sell?

51
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,420
Be full.

52
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,820
Not the picture of Ashley cell before.

53
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,850
And if I pick Clint,

54
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,650
you can see that I get cell B three.

55
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,140
Okay,

56
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,810
So far,

57
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,370
so good.

58
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,820
Now,

59
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,460
the next thing I need to do is copy that,

60
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,710
not the picture,

61
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,560
this cell.

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,220
So it can either hit control and say,

63
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,820
or just right,

64
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,640
click and choose.

65
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,190
Copy.

66
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,230
There will come over to here on this one with the black border is exactly where I want to

67
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:11,950
paste it.

68
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,750
But I need to right click Choose Pay special.

69
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,700
I want to come all the way down to other paste options and choose this option just here.

70
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,090
Linked picture.

71
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,330
Manu,

72
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:23,560
click.

73
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,160
OK,

74
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,190
you can see that we get that picture of Clint Bang in the centre there.

75
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,590
Obviously,

76
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,090
I can move it around now.

77
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:35,800
The important thing to note here He said what we What we have is a picture of the cell,

78
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,830
not the picture that is within the cell.

79
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,580
Now you'll notice with the picture selected the picture off the cell.

80
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,330
It's pointing to the data sheet cell B three.

81
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,450
So for change that to be four,

82
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,070
for example would get a picture of the lovely daily.

83
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,440
Now what we need to do is how something so we can take their name in there on the picture.

84
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,730
Changes automatically.

85
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,500
So woman do for now is I'm just gonna type.

86
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,400
Actually,

87
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,450
Now what I'm gonna do is again come up to formulas.

88
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,780
I'm no.

89
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,420
So I'm just in this cell here.

90
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,710
I'm just gonna come to formulas to come to name Manager.

91
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,500
And then here's that the names that already got the actually clear Clinton deli.

92
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm gonna add a new name.

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,570
I'm just going to call it for now,

94
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:28,150
A mug shot on what I'm gonna do here in the refers to someone type equals in direct open

95
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,720
brackets point to this cell because that's where I'm gonna type their name,

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,680
which also corresponds to the label off the cell containing their picture close brackets

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,090
hit.

98
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,560
Enter,

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,120
then when they hit close.

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,470
Now all I need to do is change this.

101
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,950
Instead of looking at data exclamation,

102
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,950
be full.

103
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,850
I just need to point that to the label that have just created.

104
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,550
So I'm just in a tight mug and you can see that there I get mug shot,

105
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,030
a money hit.

106
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,510
Enter Ashley's picture,

107
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,280
turns up,

108
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
and then I have Claire.

109
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,550
If I can spell Claire and then class picture turns up.

110
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,340
And if I hit Clint,

111
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,380
Clint's picture turns up.

112
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,140
And finally,

113
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,170
the lovely Danny and that's hey,

114
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,520

115
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,070
picture.

116
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,600
Hopefully,

117
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,640
that's helpful to you,

118
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,030
