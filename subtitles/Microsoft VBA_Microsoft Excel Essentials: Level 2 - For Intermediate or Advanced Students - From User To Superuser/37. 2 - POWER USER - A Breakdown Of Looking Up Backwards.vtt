00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
Okay,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:02.740
guys.

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.690
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.710
we looked at the one of the limits of the look up.

5
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.190
Inasmuch as it can only read data from the right of the column you're looking up from and

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.410
they're in.

7
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.670
This lecture is going to be a very simplified version of how you do the opposite thing.

8
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.860
You look up a column in the rice and you read data from a column to the left of it.

9
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.390
Now,

10
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.270
as I said before,

11
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.710
you can actually do this with the look up.

12
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.050
But what you can do is combine to other functions in Excel to make this happen.

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.210
So we're gonna look at those functions very quickly here on we'll look at them individually

14
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.690
first,

15
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.240
and then we'll look at how you combine them to perform this feat.

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.920
OK,

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.710
so the first thing we're going to do is just type of value in this cell here that we want

18
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.760
to find and what we're gonna type is Let's take Katie.

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.950
Yeah,

20
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.670
Kate Inc can't anti.

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.330
I eat.

22
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.020
Okay,

23
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.650
so this is gonna be a look of value now,

24
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.580
the first function we're going to use his match.

25
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.980
Their match does exactly what you would think it would do so We're gonna type equals match

26
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.840
open brackets on.

27
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.040
I will look at value,

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.970
just as with the V.

29
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.800
Look up is the first argument.

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.150
So we're just gonna cook that?

31
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.360
So we're now looking up.

32
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.180
Katie Comma.

33
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.050
The look up array is the column where that value is going to appear in your data Sable.

34
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.000
So that's going to be here in column A.

35
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840
And it sells a three through 87 Okay,

36
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.550
So,

37
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.110
comma.

38
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.850
And the next thing we want to tell it is the match time we're looking for.

39
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.030
They were looking to get an exact match because we want to find Katie precisely in that

40
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.450
column.

41
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.570
So we're just gonna type zero and close the brackets and then hit Enter.

42
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.270
Okay.

43
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.510
Now,

44
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.550
what you can see has been returned.

45
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.420
Is number three on because we only work in a small dates table.

46
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.750
It's very easy to work out.

47
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.620
Why that is what matches done is it's looked for the value.

48
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.250
Katie in this section of data here on what it's done is said 123 I offend the value,

49
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.200
Katie at line three in the data.

50
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.800
So for you,

51
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.780
it's a type pool.

52
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.400
We can probably Yes,

53
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.410
that the answer would be four.

54
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.550
So Okay,

55
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.040
there's the first part of our formula the match function.

56
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.000
So all we're going to use the match section for is to find out the row number in the data

57
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.180
sent that we're looking at.

58
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.820
Okay,

59
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.340
So far,

60
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.860
so good.

61
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.370
Now,

62
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.370
the next thing we're gonna have a look at is the index.

63
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.140
So we're gonna tell you index open brackets on this time.

64
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.340
It says array.

65
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.630
We're just looking at the top one.

66
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.560
They're there to functions for index or two ways to use it.

67
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.600
We're just going to stick with the 1st 1 So array is the data table or the data array.

68
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.870
I have no idea why they don't call it the same thing consistently,

69
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.650
but there you go.

70
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.550
So the array is our full data set,

71
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.040
So we're going to select a three down to be seven.

72
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.450
OK,

73
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.660
so that's our array,

74
00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.540
comma,

75
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.090
that the road number we want to have a look at doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't

76
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.540
exceed our data set.

77
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.710
So,

78
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.060
from there,

79
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.750
what just going to say is I wanna look at rule number one.

80
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.370
Come on.

81
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.050
I want to look a column number one on the closer brackets and hit Enter.

82
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.550
They can see that what's happened.

83
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.120
What this function does is it returns the value from the array,

84
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.180
which is a three through B seven.

85
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.630
This here and it's returned the value found in Row one and Column one.

86
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.050
So the Intersect of Row one and column one has returned Allen now.

87
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.760
Similarly,

88
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.810
if we were to say,

89
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.800
Row three and his center,

90
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.020
you can see that we get Katie because we're on Row three,

91
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.050
but we're still in column one.

92
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.300
So if we wanted to return the value from Row three column to with just enter three comma to

93
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.790
enter on a go would get blunt.

94
00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.890
Now,

95
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.440
the trick in combining these two functions together to be able to look up from the left.

96
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.280
It's so know that the match function returns the row number.

97
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.840
That's this one here,

98
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.240
the row number that we want to use in the index.

99
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.540
So let's combine the two.

100
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.550
So let's say for arguments sake,

101
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.630
we wanted to find out who has Blonde has a look of value,

102
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.340
is going to be blonde,

103
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.870
and I'm just going to call it out in there.

104
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.710
So we know that's the cell we're referencing,

105
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.480
right?

106
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.570
Hold on T hat's because this is where it gets a little more tricky,

107
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.880
but hopefully you'll understand it as we work through.

108
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.140
So the first part of our function is going to be index.

109
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.070
You'll remember from before that the array is the full data set.

110
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.810
So that's a three through a seven.

111
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.220
So now we've covered off our array comma,

112
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.380
that the next thing we want to enter is the row number.

113
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.970
But rather than entering a row number,

114
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.930
what we're gonna do is look up a value using this match function to find out which road

115
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.620
this particular value lives,

116
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.030
that so we're gonna type match open brackets.

117
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.410
Our look at value is blonde,

118
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.790
just as we use before when we use the match function on its own comma.

119
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.660
Look,

120
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.690
A parade is the column in our data set where that word will appear.

121
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.960
So blonde appears in the second column.

122
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.950
Some highlight in B three through B seven common.

123
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.780
I want to find an exact match because I want to find the word blonde.

124
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.520
Precisely.

125
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.460
I'm gonna close the brackets.

126
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.840
And now we have our said the rope part of the index formula.

127
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.700
So the row argument is now completed.

128
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.050
So it's gonna look for blonde and work all its way down and return the value off blood,

129
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.050
which will be one to three comma now,

130
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.870
because the index is the full data array a three through B seven.

131
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.110
What we want to do is return the value from the first column,

132
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.640
which is column one,

133
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.360
and I'm gonna close the brackets on Hit.

134
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.820
Enter.

135
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.610
So there you go there.

136
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.500
We can see if we look up the value blonde.

137
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.230
We return Katie because it's now looked down here,

138
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.390
phone blonde and successfully looked over to the left to return the value off Katie.

139
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.050
So let's just try that again.

140
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.520
So let's type black on.

141
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.010
We can know.

142
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.760
See if we look down our column to hear on.

143
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.950
Look left.

144
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.250
John has black hair.

145
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.150
Okay,

146
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.480
Hopefully you followed that.

147
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.410
If not,

148
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.800
watch it through a couple of times,

149
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.350
it takes a little while to get your head around it,

150
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.240
but it's very simple.

151
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.320
Once you've mastered it,

152
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.000
we can have a look at it in action in the next lecture.

153
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.090
So I'll see you there
