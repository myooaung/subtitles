1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
again,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,890
guys,

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,950
up to now we've looked at V.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,780
Look up on.

5
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,790
We've used the match and index toe.

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,920
Look up backwards.

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,150
But V look up.

8
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,840
Has a brother on?

9
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,900
It's called H.

10
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,870
Look up now.

11
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,680
I must admit,

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,740
in 20 odd years of using Excel,

13
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,750
I have absolutely never used an h Look up.

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,550
But just in case you have to,

15
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,900
I want you to understand exactly where they work.

16
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,170
So what we're going to need to do is build a separate table.

17
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,690
So I'm gonna do is hit the little plus button.

18
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,640
And I'm just going to rename this,

19
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,520
uh,

20
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,880
family.

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,490
One second.

22
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,700
I'm just gonna rename this to location.

23
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,790
Okay,

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,250
so we're gonna go through a few steps to build a new data base or a new data set.

25
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,370
So what we're gonna do is nick the department structure from here,

26
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,980
and by copying all of these,

27
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,920
we're gonna flip back toe location on.

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,350
We're just gonna pay some straight in here as values.

29
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,400
So there you go.

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,140
We've got all of our values in there,

31
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,700
but you can see that we've got a lot of these that have bean duplicated.

32
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,950
So I'm going to do is just highlight the whole cell.

33
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,660
I'm going to come over to data and I'm gonna choose remove duplicates.

34
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,940
So I'm just gonna hit that.

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,420
Yes.

36
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,150
I want to look at column A something to click.

37
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,750
OK?

38
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,090
And they go,

39
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,290
We can no see that we've ended up with eight unique references or eight unique values out

40
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,380
of that entire list.

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,540
So even though we got 200 people,

42
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,330
they only work in one of eight departments.

43
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,750
Now,

44
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,950
we're just gonna copy that.

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,650
And I'm gonna use transpose as I did before,

46
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,210
so they know come across the top.

47
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,240
Delete.

48
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,830
Andi will actually change the formatting on.

49
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,650
That will change the orientation.

50
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,240
Which is this one here.

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,650
So formats,

52
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,920
cell alignment,

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,090
and we'll have them pointing upwards.

54
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,180
Okay,

55
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,290
so there's our There's our department titles.

56
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,390
Their logistics,

57
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,070
we can say,

58
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,070
will be Let's have a look.

59
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,600
What we got.

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:14,280
We've got Say their field based Let's say quality lives in,

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,450
uh oops.

62
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,550
Caps lock quality building.

63
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:31,350
Andi procurement lives in office One customer service is live in C s Plaza.

64
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,210
Very jazzy finance.

65
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:43,260
Living money I have and you sales lives on whips.

66
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:56,750
Miss the on the Road Director live in skyline on marketing live in Web marketing.

67
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,180
That was called,

68
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:57,260
um,

69
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,190
office to Because I'm not feeling that creative this morning.

70
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,860
Okay,

71
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,140
so they go and then we have a new data table.

72
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,660
And this time we have our headings across the top on.

73
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,490
We have ever locations in the second row.

74
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,000
So all we're gonna do Well,

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,490
flip that,

76
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,480
Teoh.

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,920
Should we go back to no intermediary,

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
we'll drop.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,350
That's just copy that and paste it,

80
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,780
then.

81
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,650
Here on,

82
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,500
we'll have location in here.

83
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,960
Okay,

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,370
so let's return our location using an H.

85
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,040
Look up.

86
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,140
So what we're gonna do is say equals H.

87
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,650
Look up.

88
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,300
Open brackets on what we want to find.

89
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,470
Where's our location?

90
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,890
What we want to find is the department name.

91
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,570
So coming back here,

92
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,360
our department name lives here in customer services.

93
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,530
So that's gonna be our look up value customer services comer.

94
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,410
We're not gonna drag this formula around,

95
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,870
so I'm not gonna absolute them.

96
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm gonna come back to a location and I'm gonna highlight from here all the way over.

97
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,430
Now I look at value in h.

98
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,950
Look up lives in the first row of the data that you've highlighted not necessarily line one

99
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:11,950
,

100
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,250
but always the first row of the data that you've highlighted on this is nice and simple

101
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,650
because we only have two.

102
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:26,130
So I'm gonna highlight from a one then two h two comma and I want a return of value from

103
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,640
the second row.

104
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,850
So this will be the first row in our days that this will be the second comma two.

105
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,380
And I want to find an exact match.

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,150
So false close brackets on they go.

107
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,350
This lady Isabel Rodriguez works in customer services and we've now used on h look up to

108
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,670
pull her location.

109
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,880
Let's just make that bold.

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,980
Now let's pick someone else.

111
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:57,930
One of eight Onda Lucy Cox lives in finance and finance live in Money Avenue.

112
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,850
So there you go.

113
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,150
That's how we use H lookups.

114
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,950
I'll see you in the next lecture
