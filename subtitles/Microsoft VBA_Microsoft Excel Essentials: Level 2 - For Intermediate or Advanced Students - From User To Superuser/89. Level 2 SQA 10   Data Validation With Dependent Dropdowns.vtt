Hello and welcome back to another student.

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.730
Questions answered.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.270
Lecture.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.420
Now the question relates to can we have data validation?

5
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.240
A drop down list in one cell and depending on which which option we choose from that drop

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.250
down list in Cell one displays a different list in box two.

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.020
So we have a dependent drop down list whenever you pick in here will drive and determine

8
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.130
the list that appears in the 2nd 1 So here's just some data.

9
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.450
I have a before sheet and then after sheet,

10
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.250
in case you want to play around with this and you can download this file from this lecture

11
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.250
.

12
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.390
So basically,

13
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.000
what they have is a main category,

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
which is this which I'm gonna call in the name box,

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.260
Um,

16
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.130
mein cut.

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.900
And you can make this dynamic if you don't know how to do that,

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.150
Have a look on the section dynamic name ranges.

19
00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.310
I'm gonna name these other subsequent data sets.

20
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.550
The names that appear in this list of this one I'm gonna call Collis spelled the UK Wait,

21
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.790
This one.

22
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.260
I am going to call animals Ni mountains.

23
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.990
This one I'm gonna call birds.

24
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:32.050
So I was clicking in there but and enter finally albums click in there and say albums boom

25
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.990
Okay,

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.800
so that there are 45 named ranges on main category The sub category one.

27
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.530
So Category two sub Category three on before.

28
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.620
So here I'm just going to come to data only goes that validation when she's data validation

29
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.810
and what I'm gonna do,

30
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.010
you say,

31
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.830
allow list now just for comedians.

32
00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.020
So I'm just gonna point to this I'm just gonna highlight over all of that and you will see

33
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.770
that this nao says Main cat.

34
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.200
So when I click OK,

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.330
I got a little drop down list there and allows me to choose colors or animals or birds or

36
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.920
albums.

37
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.950
Basically anything that appears in this list here.

38
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.560
Now,

39
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.990
what we want to do here as this saves colors,

40
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.800
what we want to do is show this list.

41
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.750
So all we're gonna do again is come to data validation.

42
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.120
I'm going to say data validation and we're gonna allow list.

43
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.860
And this time we're going to say equals.

44
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.190
I'm just gonna point to this cell for a second just so it can get that cell address and

45
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:49.750
here before them to say equals in direct open brackets goes to the end.

46
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.100
After the cell reference,

47
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.130
close brackets and click.

48
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.650
OK,

49
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.740
so now when I have colors in this in here red,

50
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.050
yellow,

51
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.350
pink,

52
00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.760
green,

53
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.520
orange,

54
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.820
purple and blue,

55
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.150
which is this'll ist.

56
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.360
But here,

57
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.490
If I go to this drop down and their virtues albums and I come back to you here,

58
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.690
I'll no have last play at the Chez A night at the Opera batters held Jagged Little Pill was

59
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.620
matted for the people and like a ruse.

60
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.840
And similarly,

61
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.050
if I come in here now and say animals and come to my second drop down,

62
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.290
then our troops,

63
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.800
I will have a list of animals dog cat,

64
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.290
rabbit on horse.

65
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.650
And that is the very simple way to create dependent drop downs again.

66
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.660
I hope that helped.

67
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.910
And,

68
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.470
as always,

69
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.770
any questions just dropped them in the cure name.

70
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.150
I'll see you in the next lecture
