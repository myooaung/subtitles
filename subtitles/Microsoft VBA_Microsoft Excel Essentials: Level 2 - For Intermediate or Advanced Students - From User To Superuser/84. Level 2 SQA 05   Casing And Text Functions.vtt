00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Okay,

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.660
guys.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.370
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.650
Question answered.

5
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.430
Now in level one of the course.

6
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.530
How the question says,

7
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.170
How can I make excel right?

8
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.650
The first letter in a cell in capital letters automatically.

9
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.060
Now,

10
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.000
by default,

11
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.800
proper words automatically capitalized.

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.350
So the days of the week and the months of the year are automatically capsulized because

13
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.940
their proper words Beyond that,

14
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.850
what we need to apply is a formula to do that.

15
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.340
And then the formulas are very,

16
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.640
very straightforward.

17
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.850
So here and you can download this file from this lecture.

18
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.910
What we have are a few examples.

19
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.180
So when I have in cell a three is Mary had a little lamb,

20
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.780
and what we're gonna do is convert that from lower case,

21
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.120
toe up a case a woman do in B three,

22
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.580
you say equals and I'm going to say upper open brackets.

23
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.390
Then just point to that cell and closer brackets and it enter.

24
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.760
And there you can see we have Mary had a little lamb all in uppercase on just conduce.

25
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
Copy that there.

26
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.530
Then when paste special values here.

27
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.390
So now I have Mary had a little lamb in upper case to convert it back the other way.

28
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.150
What I'm gonna do is say equals lower.

29
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.660
Open the brackets,

30
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.690
point to that cell closer brackets and hit.

31
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.300
Enter.

32
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.430
And there you can see.

33
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.960
I have Mary had a little lamb back in low.

34
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.310
Okay?

35
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.910
So again,

36
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.640
I'm just gonna hit control and seeing Copy that click here and pay special.

37
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.400
So now I have it in lower case,

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.800
and I'm also going to copy that and put it in uppercase.

39
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.860
Oh,

40
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.060
no.

41
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.450
We have it both here.

42
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.860
One in lower case one in upper case there to capitalize the first letter of each word.

43
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.370
We're going to use the proper function,

44
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.540
so we just come type equals proper open brackets.

45
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.400
Point here.

46
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.150
Closer brackets on hit,

47
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.550
enter.

48
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.620
And there you can see that everything has its first letter capitalizing.

49
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.490
If I just hit control in D and copy that down,

50
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.260
you can see that it doesn't matter whether it's in lower case or upper case.

51
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.140
It will automatically capitalize the first letter off each word.

52
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.920
Now,

53
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.710
a mindful that the specific question says head,

54
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.250
I capitalize the first letter in each cell,

55
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.080
not in each word.

56
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.250
So here,

57
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.010
we're gonna use will use this as an example.

58
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.110
It's gonna pace that in there.

59
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.070
So here we have.

60
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.440
Mary had a little lamb in lower case now to capitalize.

61
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.650
Only the first letter were really into Level two stuff here,

62
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.270
but I'm gonna wish through it anyway,

63
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.620
what we could have,

64
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.150
what we're gonna need to do is combine a few different functions.

65
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.070
Eso I'm just gonna wish through the so we can use the left function on what the left

66
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.590
function say's is point to the text that you want to extract the left most character from.

67
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.940
So we're going to be looking at D three and then we're gonna hit comma,

68
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.790
and it says in hair me characters do you want to return?

69
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.580
So Mary has four letter.

70
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.910
So if we hit four close brackets left four off this cell here returns Mary.

71
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.420
So there's the left there for completeness.

72
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.720
We're also going to do the right,

73
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.790
so it's gonna copy that.

74
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.980
Paste it in here to say equals right on.

75
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.210
No,

76
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.520
no,

77
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.200
we're extracting the right most character.

78
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.640
So again,

79
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.650
I'm gonna point here,

80
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.870
and I'm gonna hit comma on.

81
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.030
Let's let's just say three for a second.

82
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.780
So that should give us a M.

83
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.250
B.

84
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.400
So now we have a M beat.

85
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.830
But if I change that to four,

86
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.850
I would actually get the full word lamp.

87
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:34.460
Okay,

88
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.300
to complete this,

89
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.350
we're gonna have a look at the mid function.

90
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.930
We don't actually need to use that for the capital ocean of the first letter,

91
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.970
but just for completeness,

92
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:42.770
we're gonna cover it.

93
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.680
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say equals made,

94
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.710
and there is one extra argument here again,

95
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.660
we're gonna point to the text that we want us extract the middle from.

96
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.100
So again,

97
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.480
we're going to say D 11 here,

98
00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.250
comma start number will be the number of characters in that you want to start from.

99
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.730
So if we wanted to extract had A from this,

100
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.830
we would say Mary has four letters.

101
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.190
We have a space that's five.

102
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.800
And we want to begin at the sixth letter,

103
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.430
which is the H So six on hand,

104
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.020
A has a J D three letters.

105
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.990
A space for andan A,

106
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.710
which is five.

107
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.870
So comer number of characters to extract five and enter May go.

108
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.760
We extract had a no finally,

109
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.260
on one thing that we are going to need to do to capitalize.

110
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.250
The first letter is working out what the length of the string is.

111
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.360
So what we're gonna do is just copy that their copy and paste it into here.

112
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.450
And what we're gonna say is equal Len,

113
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.550
which is short for length.

114
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.240
They're just gonna point that sell close brackets Nager.

115
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.400
Many had little m has 22 characters.

116
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.410
So here we're going to build a complex formula.

117
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.170
It's going to capitalize the first letter.

118
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.920
So we're going to Firstly,

119
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.460
we're going to utilize the left so we can say left the point here on groups and say the

120
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.280
first character,

121
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.000
Intesa.

122
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.480
And there we have the M.

123
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.490
But what we want to do is make that upper case.

124
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.500
So we're gonna enclose all of that in upper case.

125
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.670
So now we get capital M.

126
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.980
That's capitalized our first letter.

127
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.460
Now what we need to do is return the rest of the string in lower case.

128
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.940
So what we're gonna do on Bear with me here?

129
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.610
We're going to say,

130
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:27.280
andi,

131
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.560
which is the equivalent of a can Katyn eight.

132
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.380
We're going to say Onda and we're going to say right,

133
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.750
we'll do this in stages were going to say the right off this string just here,

134
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.180
comma on the number of characters is going to be the length of the whole string minus one.

135
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.770
Because we've already captured that first letter.

136
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:57.660
So we're going to say length of this string close of rackets minus one on gun.

137
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.350
We're gonna close that off.

138
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.250
So that's going to give us.

139
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.050
Mary had a little lamb,

140
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:07.520
but let's imagine for a second that the lamb was also capitalized.

141
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.130
So now what we have is Mary had little.

142
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.120
And with a capital M in the capital,

143
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.280
l full leme.

144
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.910
So what we're going to do here is just wrap a lower around that west part of the formula.

145
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.970
So there we have the capitalized first letter and everything else in lower case.

146
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.590
Okay,

147
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.930
I hope that answers your question.

148
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.610
As always,

149
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.440
any others just post them in and I'll be happy to help.

150
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.350
Have a great day
