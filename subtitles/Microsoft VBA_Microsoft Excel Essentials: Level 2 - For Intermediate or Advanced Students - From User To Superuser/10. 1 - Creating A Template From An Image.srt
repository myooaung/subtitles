1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110
OK,

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:02,490
guys.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,780
Now let's have a look at how we create our new template.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,610
Now there are three ways to create a template.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,340
The moose,

6
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,520
cumbersome and time consuming,

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,200
is to create it from scratch completely.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,150
Three,

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,620
easiest by far is to get a copy of the original template in Excel format and just copy the

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,650
particular worksheet with the template on into your new workbook,

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,550
which is the time sheets and expenses master here that we're working on.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,570
But there is a middle ground,

13
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,480
and the middle ground involves cheating on its cheating.

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,260
That's going to be the subject of this particular lesson.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,950
Okay,

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,240
What we need to do is get a copy of the spreadsheet in a J peg format or some picture

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:43,890
format.

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,860
So I've added a new sheet by hitting the little plus button so we can see our original data

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,270
interest sheets just here.

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,100
We're going to be working in sheet to on.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,020
What we're gonna do is we're going to come up to the insert menu just have here left.

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,090
Click it on.

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:04,830
We can see in the illustration sections in the illustration section that we have the option

24
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,640
of pictures,

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,910
so I'm just gonna left click pictures on my desktop.

26
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,050
I have a blank time sheet in J peg format,

27
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,460
so I'm just double click that and they go.

28
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:14,720
No,

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
we can see we have a perfect copy of the original document that we want to transpose onto

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,500
this worksheet.

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,260
Okay,

32
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,150
now there are a couple of issues here.

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,730
Firstly,

34
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,900
we can see the image,

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,300
which is this area just here on.

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,360
We have the worksheet,

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,340
which is this bit here,

38
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,790
where we can see all the cells.

39
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,230
If we have a look at the name box,

40
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,090
we can see we're in cell a nine.

41
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,750
And just using the cursor keys,

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,380
we can see that we can quite happily move underneath the spreadsheet.

43
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,050
But we can't actually see through the spreadsheet to be able to enter any data in so no

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,590
locally Excel has a wonderful trick you can use when you do in J pegs like this on again.

45
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,810
Now we selected the image itself.

46
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,430
You can see that we have a new option,

47
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,890
appeared at the top on that's picture tools for matter.

48
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,720
So just come up to the top left click,

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,920
and you can see that we have a bunch of different options here.

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,340
Now,

51
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,180
in the adjust section just at the top Here we have color with a little down arrow.

52
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,690
So I'm just gonna left click the down arrow on their ignore all of these options.

53
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm going to come down to set transparent color.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,030
So I'm just gonna left quick that and you can see the cursor has changed to a little picker

55
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,030
.

56
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,680
Now all we need to do is click on the color that we want to be transparent.

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,990
So I'm just gonna left click on the white area on then the magic happens now we can see

58
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,950
straight through our template.

59
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,800
So we still have the image here,

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,970
and we still have the spreadsheet over here.

61
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,650
If we come on to the spreadsheets and no use our cursor keys,

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,860
you can see that we can move around underneath the actual image,

63
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,650
but we can still see straight through it because you've set that transparent color.

64
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,460
Okay,

65
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,960
so now all we need to do is a little jiggery pokery to make sure that these particular

66
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,470
cells underneath lineup with these cells in the spreadsheet.

67
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,750
Then the first thing that we can see is that the row height is completely different.

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,850
So the row height of the cells is much narrower than the row height of the template.

69
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:24,270
So all we're gonna do is we're gonna line up one of them eso It's just left click and drank

70
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,610
that up a little bit until it's more or less in line,

71
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,100
which is about that on.

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,280
Then we're going to do the same at the bottom.

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,140
So that's Maura less in line.

74
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,910
And then we're gonna have a quick look to see what the row height is on this one.

75
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,900
So it's just right.

76
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,050
Click the road that we've just changed.

77
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,090
Choose row,

78
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,120
height on.

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,990
We can see that we have a row height of 23.25 So?

80
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,390
So we don't forget it.

81
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,260
Let's just select it and copy it has click.

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,850
OK,

83
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,830
they're going to come to the rest of these.

84
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,740
Highlight them,

85
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,390
right click Choose row height again.

86
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,680
Drag it up on paste over 15 to say 23.25 It's OK on DNO.

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,890
We can see if we come to the spreadsheet since roll over that we now have a pretty accurate

88
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:16,010
representation of the row height of all of these input cells here.

89
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,000
So so far,

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,570
so good.

91
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,600
The next thing we need to do is line up the cells underneath.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,770
Um,

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,460
so the columns Aaron line.

94
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,080
So the 1st 1 we're going to do is between D and C,

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,290
and I'm just gonna drank that over There s Oh,

96
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:31,650
no,

97
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,580
we can see if we click on the spreadsheets have over where?

98
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,550
Almost spot on here,

99
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,790
which is very good.

100
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,650
We're gonna come over to here and lying it up.

101
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,200
So now,

102
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,910
so which so are we on cell D 25 which I'm just gonna color in matches perfectly the hole

103
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,020
that we have to fill in on the template that we can see through.

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,250
I'm just going to repeat that for all of these.

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,730
So I'm just gonna drag between e and F er,

106
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,990
make that the same width the same between F g,

107
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,040
G and H H.

108
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,030
And I know we might have to do a little bit of alteration of later on.

109
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,420
Let me just rips.

110
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,110
That's the image.

111
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,300
Lately.

112
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,480
Click on the spreadsheets.

113
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,330
Sabam beneath.

114
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm just going to color these into show that I've actually already completed these.

115
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,370
We can always change them back to color.

116
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,250
Less alert later.

117
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,640
Answer all those don't.

118
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,420
So that's good.

119
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,380
We can see that the row height is wrong on this one.

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,100
So let me just go to row height on change that we should still have in a clipboard.

121
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,350
23.25 Okay,

122
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,100
on.

123
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,450
We just want to move out of Scrooge E.

124
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,420
So it's in line now we're gonna have to do but emerging.

125
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,060
Centering.

126
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,620
So here we can see more or less where were were in line on the Rose.

127
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,480
But we need emergency center.

128
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,690
This is gonna be a constant data so we can talk.

129
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:59,850
My sign meant on We can probably format that in the center and make it bold.

130
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,520
Quicken spreadsheet Come over.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,900
We can merge in center This one.

132
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,830
Make it bold.

133
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,860
May kicked Central owned.

134
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,550
Put my name in there.

135
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,760
In general,

136
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:26,160
this we need to make this row also 23.25 row height paced 23.25 and scourge e than up there

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,160
.

138
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,660
Just so that matches nicely and again,

139
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,940
click on the spreadsheet.

140
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,510
Come over,

141
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,210
merge in center on.

142
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:33,620
Basically,

143
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,190
we're going to repeat that the entire process so we've got all of our cells underneath the

144
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,280
transparent template all lined up here perfectly with these boxes that we're going to enter

145
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,570
into again.

146
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,530
I'm just gonna pause for a second while I settle these up and I'll make sure all the cells

147
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,940
were aligned on.

148
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,290
Then we'll import the data from our data entry sheet into here.

149
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,150
Okay,

150
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,030
So these air Almora lesser lying.

151
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,670
Now you can see that these,

152
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,600
these particular ones then here have gone over.

153
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,050
But as this is just a client signature box,

154
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,350
that should be okay,

155
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,020
because if they're signing it,

156
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,600
they can just sign in the box so the alignment will mess.

157
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,960
And that's if you printing it off,

158
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,050
scandal it and fax and it'll scanning it and then emailing it.

159
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,830
But if it's just a typed box,

160
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,860
that will just look okay,

161
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm just gonna center align it and make it bold.

162
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,760
So that's me.

163
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,740
Took There was works.

164
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,340
This is also input field,

165
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,250
so I'm just going to call it that in on the date,

166
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,250
Will,

167
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,170
we'll come to some clever things on dates in a little while.

168
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,800
Okay?

169
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,020
So the first thing we're gonna do we start populating the dates from our data entry screen

170
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,020
.

171
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,560
So I'm just going to click the week end in box.

172
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,670
I'm gonna hit equals,

173
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,120
just like we did in the very first.

174
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,140
Like to improve for concept on.

175
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,910
I'm gonna click this box here to show us the date and you can see that the formula bar I

176
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,570

We're gonna tab over to sheet one on.

211
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,350
We're gonna put our payable hours as a floor,

212
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,270

she's we can't actually right click to change the formula to get to the formula bar.

219
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,400
So all we're gonna do is just wrapped the sheet out the way,

220
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,490
and we can see that that that's what the actual spreadsheet looks like until we don't the

221
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,800
template back over this up.

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,450

230
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,910
Whoops.

231
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,420
We're going to go Square brackets.

232
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,410

233
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,870

And they go 38 hours and 50 minutes,

238
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,190
Which is is exactly what we weren't.

239
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,570
So now that's all good or we're gonna do is pick the picture of stick it back over and they

240
