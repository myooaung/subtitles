00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
again goes,

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.640
Let's take a quick look at what we're gonna be creating now.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.670
It's always useful to know what you're going to be doing ahead of time,

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.420
so a little bit of planning is going to save you.

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.280
Alluded time a bit later on.

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.210
So let's just have a look at this scan of created of the time sheet that we're gonna be

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.950
using.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.350
You can see from this sheet that we have three different bits of data in there.

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.790
We have Constance those the things that will never change,

10
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.470
such as the logo of the company,

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.600
which I've cleverly made up to be A J consulted.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.390
That's me.

13
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.030
There's going to be the contact details at the top left hand side.

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.160
That's going to be constant,

15
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.650
So that's never going to change.

16
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.070
So all of the Constance weaken just leave in the template,

17
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.040
which we're going to create in sheet to shortly now name providing.

18
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.200
It's only going to be the one person is going to use.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.050
It can also be a constant.

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.200
We also have the times that we start in the morning that we started finish in the afternoon

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.200
.

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.240
Now they're gonna be data entry,

23
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.330
things and they're gonna be dynamic.

24
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
So we're probably gonna want to have those to our data entry screen,

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.150
cause that could change each time we enter it.

26
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.810
Now,

27
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690
the third type of data,

28
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.350
we have our calculations.

29
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.120
So when we see the total air was worth,

30
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.150
we don't need to enter that because we can perform some maths on the start times and

31
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.310
calculate what that is automatically.

32
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
Candidate signature is just going to be a constant.

33
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.710
So we can either print the thing and sign it,

34
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.600
then scan it and send it off or just type are naming and have that is the signature on the

35
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.310
same thing with the client signature.

36
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.680
So we've got three types of days that we have constant data which won't change,

37
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680
which we can just build into our template.

38
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.420
We have dynamic data,

39
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.520
those of the things that we want to enter into our data entry screen on.

40
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.850
We have calculations.

41
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.980
There are things that we don't need to enter.

42
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:57.890
We could answer it,

43
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.720
but what we're trying to do,

44
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.310
we save a little bit of time here.

45
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.600
So what we want to do is enter the bare minimum amount of information and have everything

46
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.970
else calculators automatically.

47
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.670
Okay,

48
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.150
so let's have a look at how we build those in
