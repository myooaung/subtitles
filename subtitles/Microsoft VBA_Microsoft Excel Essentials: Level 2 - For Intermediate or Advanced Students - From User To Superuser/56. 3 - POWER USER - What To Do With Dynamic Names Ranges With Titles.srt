1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Okay,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:02,540
guys.

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,370
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,950
we had a look at how to build a named range without title.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,250
So your data literally starts right here.

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,690
But in this sheet,

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,780
I've actually added titles into our data set.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,240
So I'm going to do is just quickly created Name ranges on the call.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,460
This my data Have a time.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:21,950
That right?

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,030
Let me move that at my data to And here's enter.

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,210
Not going to use that to build our dynamic named range.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,100
So formulas name manager My data to groups council.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,180
My data to click in here,

15
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,350
we're gonna build are offset upset open rackets.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,800
We always want to start a absolute one.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,040
Yes,

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,500
we do.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,390
We don't want to move over any on.

20
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:53,280
We don't want to move across any coming can't a open rackets.

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,000
Hamli non blank cells.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,360
Raven column A close brackets,

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,200
comma comes a again.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,850
Open brackets handy,

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,410
numb blanks elsewhere have in room one close brackets and close rackets and enter a case.

26
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:08,660
And there,

27
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,760
when I click in here,

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
we can see that that's captured all of this dynamically.

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,890
So far,

30
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,450
so good.

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,550
Now let's build a simple V look up.

32
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,350
So let's Let's say we want to look up apples and we rise.

33
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,700
Harvey,

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,840
look up Here we look up from rockets.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
Look at that coming out.

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,010
Look at my data to calmer.

37
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,400
Second column,

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,680
Exact match intact.

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,660
So there you go.

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,190
We know,

41
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,530
get Let me just change the formatting on that they go.

42
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,380
Apples are 10 p.

43
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,390
But what happens if we type fruit?

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,430
Well,

45
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,680
we get the return value of by price,

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,900
which is exactly writes.

47
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,340
It's looked in the second column,

48
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,150
but you probably don't wanna have that as a V.

49
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,580
Look up.

50
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,670
You actually want your values to start here where your first value starts.

51
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,350
Okay,

52
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,840
so let's have a look at how we're just for that in our dynamic named range.

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,540
So we're going back into formulas.

54
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,040
We're going back into name manage EPT,

55
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,290
and we coming back into our formula here for my data to stop doing that.

56
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,970
Click on that on.

57
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,760
We're coming back into the formula for my data to now,

58
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,300
what we want to do here is make an adjustment to reduce by one because of our titles in

59
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,720
here.

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,040
Just escape.

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,410
So here is our row argument account A with titles,

62
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,960
a and immediately after the close brackets on the A,

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,650
we're gonna hit minus one and enter and then Mommy click on here.

64
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,330
We can see that our data has no begun here.

65
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,400
It's actually started to say one,

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,550
but it subtracted one because of the titles that we have across.

67
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,310
So all we've done is can tell me.

68
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,240
Items appear in column A,

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,980
and that gives us the number of rows that we have on.

70
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,750
We have subtracted one because we have a title in there,

71
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,350
so enter on,

72
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,280
closed on.

73
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,570
That works perfectly well.

74
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,290
So no.

75
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,400
If we type fruit,

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,970
we can see that that Everest.

77
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,720
But if we type apples,

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,800
it's all happy.

79
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,630
Happy again.

80
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,120
And if you take cabbages,

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,800
it's still happy again.

82
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,760
So let's handsome strawberries,

83
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,780
strawberries and strawberries and strawberries.

84
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,110
Let's call intemperance eso they go.

85
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,280
No,

86
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,100
we have strawberries in our list,

87
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,830
and we can have looked at dynamic named Range my data to click in it and you can see Yep,

88
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,390
it's captured strawberries close.

89
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,570
But now let's imagine we're going to insert a couple of lines in here as we have done

90
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,080
before,

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,750
we're going to say at my stock list,

92
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,480
Onda we know give that jazzy title on the emergence century.

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,130
Where are we Emergence center And we left a line and we make it bigger and we make bold and

94
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,070
we make it red.

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:59,420
So now if we have look at our named range on dynamic and dynamic name range you remember

96
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,970
you can't pick it from here Back to formulas.

97
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,230
Back to name manager.

98
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,200
My data to go.

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,050
Stop double clicking that on clicking here.

100
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,960
You can see that we now have a spare line in here.

101
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,620
So what?

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,920
The cans a function has done is it's looked a column A's and I have one value to values.

103
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,880
345678 I have nine blank cells,

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:36,620
so therefore my data set will be one to 345678 minus one there because we have another

105
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,780
value in here.

106
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:44,570
What we now need to do is subject to because we don't want to include that in our count on

107
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,570
.

108
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,280
We don't want to include the titles in our account.

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,960
So hit.

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,090
Enter on.

111
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,140
Now when we click in it,

112
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,490
you can see that that still works absolutely perfectly because we want to discount this

113
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:55,930
line.

114
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,640
So therefore,

115
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,480
this cell on we want to discount this cell on subtract to because we have two things that

116
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,250
are not part of our data.

117
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,340
Close.

118
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,300
So there you go.

119
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,170
That's how you build a dynamic name.

120
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,020
Range on.

121
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,590
That's how you were just for it.

122
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,360
If you have extra bits of data in there So cells with values in that you don't want to take

123
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
into account in your data table,

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,090
OK,

125
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,500
I'll see you in the next lecture.
