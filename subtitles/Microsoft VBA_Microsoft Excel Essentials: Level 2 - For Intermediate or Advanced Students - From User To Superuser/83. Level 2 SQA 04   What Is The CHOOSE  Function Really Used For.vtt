00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
Okay,

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.730
guys.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.440
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.190
Questions,

5
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.620
Alice,

6
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.350
ID lecture.

7
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:06.900
Now,

8
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.800
this question relates to the choose function on the choose function in isolation.

9
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.200
Now,

10
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.470
you'll remember back in the building a database section where assured,

11
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.260
you have to do V look up,

12
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.150
utilizing choose to look up values from the left of the look of value.

13
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.090
But the quit the student question was,

14
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.560
how do you use choose in isolation?

15
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.580
Well,

16
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.010
in its simplest form,

17
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.050
what choose does is a lensed you to choose helps if you type equals in type in front of a

18
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.630
formula.

19
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.260
Bigger there she first lesson of the day.

20
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.240
All right,

21
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.650
so what we have is a few different arguments.

22
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.720
We have the index number on what that means is which of the following values the next

23
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.620
arguments am I to pick?

24
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.790
So that's basically which of the values am I gonna pick?

25
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.740
So if I chose one and hit comma,

26
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.750
then I get to value 123 And I think in go to about 254.

27
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.010
So I could easily type quotes,

28
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.700
apples,

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.640
comma quotes,

30
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.200
oranges,

31
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.270
come a quote pairs.

32
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.170
But I'm just gonna point to the cells hit comma come on comma and closed off the brackets.

33
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.050
So here I have three values end for which is apples and five,

34
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.510
which is oranges and six,

35
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.340
which is pairs.

36
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.220
And I'm choosing number one.

37
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.390
So that will be.

38
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.650
And for Apple's now,

39
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.180
obviously,

40
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.150
if I change that to number three,

41
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.490
then it would select the third value and 45 n six and give us pairs.

42
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.190
So in its simplest form,

43
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.550
that's what it does.

44
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.910
So in this lecture,

45
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.540
there's going to be four quick demonstrations of a few different ways to use the choose

46
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.500
function there.

47
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.720
The one thing that I use it for more than anything else,

48
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.120
particularly when doing financial reporting,

49
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.900
is being able to display the fiscal quarter and then build that and eventually create a

50
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900
fiscal year and quarter,

51
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.240
as you can see at the end here,

52
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.360
where we have F 14 fiscal 14 quarter,

53
00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.910
fourth quarter,

54
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.110
4 15 quarter one and so on and so forth.

55
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.960
So down here we just got a bunch of dates from January 25th 2015 through to December 29th

56
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.340
2016

57
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.900
So ultimately,

58
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.790
I would just use this end formula.

59
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.170
But I want to show you the steps I went through to build it.

60
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.420
So the first thing we have to do is extract the months number from this state.

61
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.880
So I'm just going to use the built in Excel function month on point to this cell here.

62
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.490
So when I hit enter,

63
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.820
I get one.

64
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.550
Because January is the first month.

65
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.420
Now,

66
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.170
what I'm gonna do is utilize this value in this formula.

67
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.880
So I'm saying choose,

68
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.970
have a look at B one and tell me what value is in there.

69
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.100
In this instance,

70
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.890
it's one.

71
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.510
And then I'm pointing to this table here.

72
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.960
No.

73
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.680
In the UK,

74
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.450
the financial year runs April through March.

75
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.330
So we don't have quarter 12345111222333 Well,

76
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.170
we actually have his quarter one is April May June courts to June,

77
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.020
July August.

78
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.430
Quarter three is October,

79
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.840
November,

80
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.500
December and quarter Four of this financial year will be January,

81
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.580
February and March of next year.

82
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.630
So this is a really good use for it.

83
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.610
So one of done let me just hit f two.

84
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.990
I have pointed to be,

85
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.450
too,

86
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.650
which gives us the months index number,

87
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.160
then I just have point.

88
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.520
And then I'm just pointing to these values here.

89
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.710
So you here I have l four l five l six,

90
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.040
which represent quarter for and so on and so forth and just as easily could instead of

91
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.160
saying l four,

92
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.380
we could just say four comer four come before then one comma,

93
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.860
one comma,

94
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.690
one to combat to comer two and three Coming three come three Just to give us those 12

95
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.140
values to pick from so that no says that this January is in quarter four.

96
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.150
So we have chosen the first index off this list here.

97
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.120
So that's where we're getting therefore from?

98
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.800
No,

99
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.680
in this formula,

100
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.460
all I've done is I've taken this formula month a four and I have dropped it here over the B

101
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.800
four.

102
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.220
So replaced the cell reference with the actual formula we used in that cell and that will

103
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.460
give us this formula.

104
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.640
Choose month a four comer,

105
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.620
and then we're looking down this table here.

106
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.220
Okay,

107
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.720
so far,

108
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.260
so good.

109
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.640
Now I think that one's have redundant one.

110
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.960
Let me just delete that and hopefully that's not going to make everything awful.

111
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.510
Now,

112
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.620
if you want to add their letter Q to the front of that,

113
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.300
it is literally a simple as typing equals.

114
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.850
Quotes que quotes Andi,

115
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.770
which is essentially can Katyn ating?

116
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.150
And then the formula that we just looked at.

117
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.690
So now waken return the value.

118
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.950
Q.

119
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.830
Four q four q one Q one.

120
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.880
So on and so forth.

121
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.920
Okay,

122
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.050
fiscal year.

123
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.780
Now the fiscal years a little more tricky because we have a logic to apply.

124
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.970
What I've done is I said F Andi,

125
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.530
so that's going to give us our F right up the front.

126
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.960
But we do have to do a test.

127
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.390
So what we want to say is,

128
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:12.350
if e for this day here equals quarter ful here than what we want to do is take the year and

129
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.600
subtract one.

130
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.930
Now,

131
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.130
here I am saying,

132
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.100
I just want the right to numbers from this particular year,

133
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.950
so right to numbers.

134
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.520
So instead of saying 2015 it will say 15.

135
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.850
Instead of saying 2016 it will say 16.

136
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.780
But if it's quarter for,

137
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.890
subtract one from either 15 or 16 if it isn't quarter for,

138
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.180
then the actual year is the same as the financial year.

139
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.130
And that's where we get our F 14 or F 15 or F 16 from now here what I've done,

140
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.370
I have replaced the A four value with the formula that lives in a four.

141
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.540
Where are we there?

142
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.530
So here I'm just basically taking the formulas and have used earlier and incorporating them

143
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.650
into one big formula.

144
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.430
And then the last thing I'm going to do at the very end is joining the two of them together

145
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.430
.

146
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.240
So I have the first formula that gives me the financial year on.

147
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.570
Then I'm going to say on day,

148
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.150
I'm just going to add that choose formula that we used to establish the month.

149
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.430
And then when it hits escape,

150
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.370
I get F 14 court for court for 15 quarter one on.

151
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.560
That works perfectly.

152
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.940
OK,

153
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.000
so that's one useful it for finding the fiscal year on the fiscal quarter.

154
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.800
Now,

155
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.610
not only can you reference values,

156
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.540
you can also have different formulas as your values.

157
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.120
So here have a really simple table.

158
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.630
We have half a dozen people what their salaries and what their salary bandits.

159
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.820
And in this table,

160
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.720
we say celery band equals a bonus of 10% Salaryman to is 20% salary bound.

161
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.150
Three is 30%.

162
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.550
So here I've just built a simple V look up to say,

163
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.050
look for John and tell me which band is in.

164
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.680
So if I typed in here Rita,

165
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.980
ignore the case in retail is banned.

166
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.340
One,

167
00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.860
This is a very look up to tell me what her salary is.

168
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.600
And here we using the choose function,

169
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.660
we're gonna look at B 11 which is the band.

170
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.710
So that gives us a choice Number one and then we're going to use a formula.

171
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.880
What?

172
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:25.150
We're gonna say ISS C 11 her salary times 0.1 because she is on 10%.

173
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:29.250
So we're actually using a formula as the first value there.

174
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.760
Now,

175
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.450
if this band was too,

176
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.000
the queues would become too.

177
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.160
And there we have a different formula.

178
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.900
So now we have C 11 her salary times 0.2,

179
00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.220
which is going to give her a 20% bonus on lastly,

180
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.540
we have the final form of says if this saves three,

181
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.040
so choose is three.

182
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.900
Choose the third formula,

183
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.350
which will be see 11.

184
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.430
Her salary multiplied.

185
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.440
Boys here by 0.3,

186
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.610
which is 30%.

187
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.000
So if we tested that it,

188
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.600
let's say Matthew So Matthew,

189
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.320
their nephews about into his cell was 25,000 on.

190
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.340
We are choosing the second of air options because B 11 equals two on.

191
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.600
We're looking at that formula there.

192
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:11.950
See,

193
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.810
11 times 20%.

194
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.830
And you can see that that works out correctly.

195
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.800
Okay,

196
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.450
so that's how you can use formulas in the choose function.

197
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.380
Now,

198
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:21.950
here,

199
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.990
What we're gonna do is we're going to apply another function,

200
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.620
the some function to the choose.

201
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.240
So what we have If I move out the way we have three columns of data.

202
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.830
We have all of our sales.

203
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:39.510
Quarter one court to quote 3/4 4 in 14 15 6016.

204
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.080
They're just for reference.

205
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:47.420
2014 is value 1 2015 is value to 2016.

206
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.620
Value three.

207
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.870
So this is a cell where I'm looking.

208
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:57.510
So I'm gonna say here 2000 and 14 on what that's going to do is say V look up.

209
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.470
Be nine.

210
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:05.240
The year we've just typed in here in this table just here on return the second value.

211
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.710
So what this is going to do is look at 2014 here,

212
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.400
straight V,

213
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.610
look up on retrieve the second value,

214
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.400
which is going to give us the index off one.

215
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.860
Okay,

216
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.410
so far,

217
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.950
so good.

218
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.680
So now we know we are choosing one now,

219
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.050
too.

220
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.850
All of our three values B two to B five,

221
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.910
C two to C five on D to two d five.

222
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.700
We want to apply the some function,

223
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.350
so we're going to say it's some.

224
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:38.780
Then we're going to choose which of the three values we want to look at on.

225
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.680
Then we're actually going to apply the some function to either this range,

226
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.880
this range,

227
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.110
all this range.

228
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.400
So 2014 is 275,000 279.

229
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.980
If I just hover over that and have a look down here,

230
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.580
you can see that's exactly correct.

231
00:09:54.580 --> 00:10:01.090
If I tied 2015 we're now going to choose the second column to some money,

232
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.930
a center to 9 to 172 And if I just drag of that,

233
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.870
they go to 9 to 172 And if I take 2016 and hit.

234
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.210
Enter Boom!

235
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.700
There you go.

236
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.590
We get 207 495 which I'm guessing must be about right They go 207 495 Okay,

237
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.690
so that's another thing that you can use it for.

238
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:25.440
You can actually use it to some or average or medium or mode.

239
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.750
Any particular column of numbers,

240
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.430
depending on what the choose value is.

241
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.870
Okay,

242
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.360
and they're just for fun.

243
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.180
Here's another one random name picker.

244
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.660
Now,

245
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.550
basically,

246
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.780
I'm going to use the round between to establish what number I'm going to get what the index

247
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.700
number will be.

248
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.640
So round between one comma three will just randomly create a number between one and three.

249
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.240
And when I hit F nine that will re calculate in here,

250
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.340
I've actually typed the three value.

251
00:10:55.340 --> 00:11:01.520
So I have Emma in quotes comma Rita comma sue all the values Aaron quote.

252
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.450
So choose around a number between 13 and then return.

253
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.510
If it's one Emma,

254
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.790
if it's to return.

255
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.890
If it's three soon so they hits.

256
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.380
If I hit Calculate now for hit F nine,

257
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.420
it'll stop recording.

258
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.330
If I calculate now,

259
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:22.680
you can see that that's rotating through them now is to say you can have 254 different

260
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.720
values in your choose argument on.

261
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.870
If you've only got a couple,

262
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.630
it's it's reasonably easy to actually just type them in in quotes.

263
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.520
But if you have like 100 of them,

264
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520
that's going to become pretty tedious.

265
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.790
So what I'm gonna do is show you a clever way to take this range and convert it into a

266
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.520
string that looks a little bit like this.

267
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.130
So you can just do the formula a little bit of jiggery pokery,

268
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.800
and they just type it over here.

269
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.610
So here is the formula.

270
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:57.690
What we have is concoct innate because we're joining all of these individual values

271
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:03.270
together on we're going to say transposed the range A one through eight.

272
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.060
So we have Emory to sue all the way down to John,

273
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.240
so we're transposing that is,

274
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.730
we're going from the vertical plane to the horizontal plane on now because we need quotes

275
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.620
between at the end of each word and at the beginning of each word beginning.

276
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.150
Add the asking character,

277
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.020
which is C.

278
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.610
H R.

279
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.710
34

280
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.740
O'Malley's double quotes Andi,

281
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.890
so we have double quotes Andi comma Andi Double quotes again.

282
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.990
Now,

283
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.900
that's part of the formula.

284
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.710
What we want to do is highlight Hall,

285
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:44.910
all of this part here from transposed all the way over to the last but one bracket.

286
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.350
And then we're gonna hit f.

287
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.660
Okay,

288
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.500
The slight technical hitch there,

289
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.640
apparently,

290
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:57.400
if I hit F nine while I am recording than the F nine on the recording software takes over

291
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.230
from Excel.

292
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:04.820
So what we want to do is transposed or highlight from transposed all the way over to the

293
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.270
last but one bracket there.

294
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:14.200
So we have transposed a one through eight on and Coats 34 Andi comma on Coke 34 again,

295
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.130
never gonna hit F nine Onda.

296
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.170
Why is that not where you OK?

297
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.620
This is just impossible.

298
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.890
Hits half nine.

299
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.770
There we go.

300
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.180
Sorry,

301
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.370
I have no idea what was going on there.

302
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:33.640
So when I hit f nine that actually converts this range into something that looks like this

303
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.440
now all we're gonna do is do a little bit of clean up.

304
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.670
We're gonna delete the first curly bracket on.

305
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.350
We're gonna delete the second curly bracket and then hit.

306
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.850
Enter.

307
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.750
So that's going to give us something that looks like this.

308
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.300
Now,

309
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.230
as you can see in the formula bar,

310
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.950
we have this in here,

311
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.370
which are basically extra quotes.

312
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.250
But if I right click ribs come off of that.

313
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.810
If I right,

314
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.860
click copy,

315
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.750
right click paste values,

316
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.910
you can see that it actually eliminates that.

317
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.080
So,

318
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.350
no,

319
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:10.690
all we need to do the quota at the front for Emma on delete the last two parts there.

320
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.840
So now we have our full strings and then we can just copy that Hits escape,

321
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.270
Come over to here on replace all of this with the full list.

322
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:27.950
Now I can say how many people have got 12345678 I can no se round between one on day eight

323
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:27.950
.

324
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.820
So there were no hit f nine,

325
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.370
which isn't gonna post the record.

326
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.630
And you can see that that is randomly selecting someone from that list.

327
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:37.310
OK,

328
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.940
so they go.

329
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.970
I hope that made sense as always.

330
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:40.770
Any questions?

331
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.970
Just drop it in the Q and A.

332
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.130
Or send me a message and I'll be happy to help.

333
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:45.050
Have a great day.

334
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.630
Thank you.
