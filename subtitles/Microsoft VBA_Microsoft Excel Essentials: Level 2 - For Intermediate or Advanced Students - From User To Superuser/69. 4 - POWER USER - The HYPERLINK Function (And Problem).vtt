00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Okay,

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.990
guys,

3
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.190
As I mentioned in the last leg to this,

4
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.460
this function for this project is pretty much redundant.

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.350
But at some point,

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.260
you probably going to come across this,

7
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.060
and it's important that you know how to deal with it.

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.730
Now.

9
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.340
We already looked at having hyperlinks over here,

10
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.050
and these work perfectly well.

11
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.360
But there's also a high pulling function.

12
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.030
And you gonna find that in the formulas tab under look up and reference Onda hyperlink.

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.910
And you get this really useful little box that pops up that says,

14
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.800
Tell me your link location.

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.000
So we're going to point to be l takers were on the BLT line,

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.380
and we're going to select cell a one.

17
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.420
So so far,

18
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.990
so good.

19
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.780
And our friendly name is what will appear rather than saying BLT exclamation point a one.

20
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.290
So we're going to say is go there on his enter.

21
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.220
So there you go.

22
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.940
Now you can see that we've got a hyperlink formula.

23
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.370
It say's go there.

24
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.590
That's the friendly text.

25
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.790
But when we click it this'll happens.

26
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.180
Can I open the specified file Now you would think is that's a built in function that that

27
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.950
should work perfectly every single time.

28
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.310
Unfortunately,

29
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.650
it doesn't know what you're gonna need to do is modify the formula this way.

30
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.710
Okay,

31
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.420
Now I'm going to zoom in on this so you can see what you have to do.

32
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.200
What you need to do is click after the first bracket,

33
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.160
open your quotes and hit a hashtag on,

34
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.480
then an apostrophe.

35
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.840
So you got open quotes hashtag apostrophe,

36
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.880
and you gonna come to the end of the word.

37
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.730
So if he had chili con carne,

38
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.320
you would come After that,

39
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.760
you would hit an apostrophe.

40
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.740
You will leave your exclamation point in there.

41
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.800
You'll move over and you will close your quotes after the A one on.

42
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.900
Then you'll hit.

43
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.410
Enter.

44
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.620
Okay.

45
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.990
And now when we click that we get,

46
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.190
go there on,

47
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.980
we actually do go there.

48
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.850
So I'm just gonna do that one more time so you can see it.

49
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.420
So what we're gonna do formulas look up in reference hyperlink on.

50
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.900
We'll go through the same process.

51
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.500
Link location is going to be chilli con carney on.

52
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.350
It's going to be this cell,

53
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.160
and our friendly name again is going to say go there and enter.

54
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.220
And then a game.

55
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.720
When we click that link,

56
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.260
we get an error.

57
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.010
So again,

58
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.120
we're gonna modify.

59
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.530
We're going to come in here.

60
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.310
We're gonna hit quotes.

61
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.090
We're gonna hit hashtag.

62
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.530
We already have the apostrophe.

63
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.660
This time we already have the apostrophe.

64
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.380
We already have the apostrophe After the name Chilli con Carney exclamation point a one

65
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.160
close quotes again and then hit.

66
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.020
Enter on this time when you click,

67
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.270
Go!

68
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.300
There you!

69
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.640
Finally,

70
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.220
they actually does go there now.

71
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.960
There is absolutely no way that you can work that out.

72
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.770
I don't think it's actually covered anywhere in excels help files.

73
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.220
It's just one of those things.

74
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.210
You really know how to fix it or you don't know.

75
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.660
You do.

76
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.650
OK,

77
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.630
I'll see you in your next lecture where you're gonna have a challenge.

78
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.790
I'll see you there
