00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Okay,

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.110
guys,

3
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.410
Um,

4
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.520
welcome back.

5
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.150
Now,

6
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.680
this is another student question this time from Natalia That follows on from the last

7
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.020
lecture that we looked at.

8
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.680
Then the last lecture we looked at,

9
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.650
we had a look at how to use dynamic name ranges to dynamically populate charts.

10
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.260
Now,

11
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.520
what of a new Italia's question?

12
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.950
Waas?

13
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.130
In the last lecture,

14
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.260
we looked ahead to populate it the day to win top to bottom.

15
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.760
That is vertically.

16
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.180
But what happens if the data goes across?

17
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.470
That is left to right?

18
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.560
So what have done?

19
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.440
You'll find a downloadable resource called horizontal dynamic dynamic named Ranges.

20
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.440
I haven't got my teeth improperly this morning on this comes in two flavors.

21
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.050
We have increasing and fixed.

22
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.970
Now all I did was just created a bit of random data in Italian stated he has bundle one

23
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.590
bundle to in bundle three on dates going across the top.

24
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.070
So what?

25
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.140
We have two flavors increase in what I did.

26
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.840
I just created this data set,

27
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.290
came up to insert,

28
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.840
went to recommended charts and chose this one.

29
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.850
I did the same for both of these.

30
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.180
So what we have on increasing?

31
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.750
We have data from the 19th of December through to the 23rd.

32
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.510
Now what happens if I just populate across notice what happens to the charts?

33
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.890
It is increasing and it is added in another block of data for the 24th.

34
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.700
And similarly,

35
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.680
if I handed him for the 25th it would increase.

36
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.320
So the chart constantly grows without day to set.

37
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.450
Now compare and contrast with fixed here we can see we have exactly the same day set from

38
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.820
the 19 through the 23rd of December,

39
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850
and that is what showing in our chart.

40
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.920
But look what happens here.

41
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.080
Notice that we have in the chart now the 20th to the 24th.

42
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.950
And if I put in some data,

43
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.720
you can see that we now have in the chart only this block of data,

44
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.550
that is,

45
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
it is fixed at five blocks of data.

46
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.060
So if I did it again,

47
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.640
you'll notice that the chart now moves from the 21st of December 25th of December on when

48
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.050
they add in some more data for that,

49
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.210
it's now looking it this block of data.

50
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.200
So let me let me just delete what I've just done and I'll give you a quick whizz through

51
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.800
exactly the difference in how you do both.

52
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.440
So what I did with this set of data is I just highlighted these dates.

53
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.390
Came up to the name box just to give me a static,

54
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.870
static named range on called that increasing on dates.

55
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.230
And they did exactly the same with bundle one.

56
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.400
I came into the name box here and call it increase in bundle one increase in bundle to

57
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.710
increasing bundle three.

58
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.110
Then while we're on the subject,

59
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.550
I did in the fixed.

60
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.150
I highlighted this range came into name box and I called it fixed dates.

61
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.580
I highlighted this.

62
00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.210
Came into name box and call it fixed bundle one fixed bundle to and fixed bundle three.

63
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.690
Now,

64
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.850
the next step was to go through and change those static named ranges to dynamic named

65
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:08.480
Rangers.

66
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.820
So I'm coming to the formulas and I'm coming to the name manager.

67
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.010
Now,

68
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.090
let's do the increasing first on which I make this so you can see it.

69
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.870
So increasing dates.

70
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.410
This is a dynamic named range.

71
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.050
So increasing B one.

72
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.710
I am starting at B one.

73
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.490
I am moving over zero rose from b 17 days.

74
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.710
I am still at B one,

75
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.020
and I am moving over zero columns from B one.

76
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.050
So I am still be one.

77
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.120
I want to return one row of data.

78
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.520
That is,

79
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.570
whatever is in row A that sorry row one,

80
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.900
and that the number of columns I want to look at is going to be the count of non blank

81
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.650
cells.

82
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.460
Count A from the sheet increase in row 1 to 1.

83
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.090
So that's the whole of row one for us,

84
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.420
far as it goes on.

85
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.640
When I click on that,

86
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.980
you can see that the states are highlighted.

87
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.340
Now,

88
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.140
if I just close that and I did another date control,

89
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.550
uh,

90
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.770
and then quipped,

91
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.160
um,

92
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.840
what are we on?

93
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.520
Increasing dates and then clicked in there.

94
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.890
You can see that the data set is increased to incorporate this new value off the 24th of

95
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.530
December.

96
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.950
Can just control it that for a second there with the bundles,

97
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.530
I did a similar thing.

98
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.890
I come to the name manager,

99
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.180
were on increase in bundle 12 and three the same.

100
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.550
They just look a different lines.

101
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.100
So with bundle one while I'm doing is I'm saying offset.

102
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.000
It's a dynamic name range increasing.

103
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.520
I am starting at Sell A to I am moving over zero Rose.

104
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.290
From there,

105
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.170
I am moving one column over because that is where the first value lies.

106
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.240
I don't want to return bundle one.

107
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.350
I want to return the first value.

108
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.230
So that's this value just here.

109
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:08.700
So that is 11 column over from where it is now I want one row of data.

110
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.910
That is a lot of stuff in line to and again,

111
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.580
I'm gonna use account eight.

112
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.270
Account the non blank cells from the sheets increase in row 222 That's this Here on at the

113
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.810
very end.

114
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.570
Now the minus one.

115
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.810
Because I don't want to count the title bundle.

116
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.510
One bundle to is exactly the same.

117
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.080
But starting its a three on looking at the amount of data in line 3323 on Bundle three

118
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.910
looks at a four and looks at line fort.

119
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.770
If all so,

120
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.380
that's how we do the increase in when I hope,

121
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.740
actually,

122
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.420
for her white one,

123
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.570
you can see that would be better so you can see the bundle.

124
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.380
One currently captures all of these dates noticed the minus one because we're moving over.

125
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.100
We're not capturing the title.

126
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.670
And then if I just commands to that for a second and the actually just control anarchists

127
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.680
had in controlling on there to say 45 20 whatever.

128
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.020
Just randomly and some data in there come to name manager dates we can see has increased to

129
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.080
capture all the dates on Bundle one has increased to capture all of those now in the

130
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.410
chancel I'm going to do is I'm gonna left Click the dates right click,

131
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:28.360
choose select data and in here I'm gonna hit Edit these of the dates on all I've done is

132
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.940
I've pointed to my dynamic named range.

133
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.320
It has the name of the work shape some reason here,

134
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.720
but it's increasing dates.

135
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.640
That's the name of this dynamic range.

136
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.650
Just here.

137
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.700
Okay,

138
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.300
now,

139
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.230
here I clicked.

140
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.490
Bundle one edit and I have done exactly the same thing.

141
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.610
I have pointed at a dynamic name range increasing bundle one bundle to Eddie's,

142
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.700
and I pointed that increasing bundle to on bundle three edit,

143
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.080
and I am pointing at increasing bundle three.

144
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.690
So that's how you do it.

145
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.470
If you want to increase your chart with every new set of data that gets added to the end.

146
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.150
Now,

147
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.860
here we have a different flavor.

148
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.600
This is the fixed on don't exactly the same thing.

149
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.620
I set this up as a basic fixed dates.

150
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.260
This is dates bundle one.

151
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.850
This sorry.

152
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.530
Fixed bundle.

153
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.760
One fixed bundle to fix Bundle three.

154
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.570
Now let me show you how I modified these.

155
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.480
So what we have is wrong.

156
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.080
Fixed only so fixed.

157
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.050
Fixed Looks like this.

158
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.420
So for the dates we have offset,

159
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.470
it's a dynamic name.

160
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.990
Range fixed.

161
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.790
Be one we're starting here on.

162
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:49.500
What we're doing is we are moving over zero Rose because we don't want to move from there.

163
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:56.420
Then we're going to use account I that is count the non blank cells in the whole of row one

164
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:03.200
and subtract five because we only want ever display five values.

165
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.530
So at the moment in the whole of row one,

166
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.010
we have five dates.

167
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.000
So five minus five is zero.

168
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.750
That is we are not moving over any rows or any columns from our start point.

169
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.190
While we have five dates in there,

170
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.190
I'm returning one row of data and I want to return five columns Where?

171
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.250
So at the moment,

172
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.660
that's just this data here.

173
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.310
But let me come out of that.

174
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.740
And then at another date,

175
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.640
him control and our come back into name manager.

176
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:39.470
Move that Dancy conceit and choose fixed dates and click in and no,

177
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.470
you can see account A will count six dates.

178
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:48.090
123456 and subtract five.

179
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.810
So now we're moving over one column from our start point of B one.

180
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.940
We're moving.

181
00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.100
We're capturing one row of data row one and we're only wanting to capture five columns.

182
00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.330
Where?

183
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.150
So it's capturing the last five columns.

184
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.410
Hopefully in banking sense of this.

185
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.150
No.

186
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:12.740
If you look at the fixed bundle one which currently is capturing that data just there we

187
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.180
have a very similar thing.

188
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.340
We have offset fixed A to cause We're starting it.

189
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.330
A two.

190
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:24.400
That's where our title lives were moving over zero rows of data.

191
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.490
We're not moving from there,

192
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:30.250
but then we're going to use the county fixed a two sorry row,

193
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.580
too.

194
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:35.290
So we're looking at the number of values in here on subtracting five.

195
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:45.550
So we have 123456 minus five comma one I want return one row of one row of values that is

196
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.470
everything in line to Onda.

197
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.810
Five entries.

198
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.510
So it will be the last five Exactly the same thing.

199
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.900
But this time we're starting at a two rather than be one.

200
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.940
Okay,

201
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.590
so here we can see that that's been populated.

202
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:06.450
If I close it and add another value and they're just say four and then come to name manager

203
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.290
into Fixed Wonder one,

204
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.040
you'll see that it's no capturing the last five entries.

205
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.670
So all I need to do with this one is just left.

206
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:23.680
Click the dates right click to select data come up to edit And this time I'm gonna point to

207
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.860
our fixed dates named range and with Bundle one I'm gonna hit edit on I have changed this

208
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:37.950
to point it Our fixed bundle one named range bundle to edit on again I am point into our

209
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:45.820
fixed bundle to named range on Finally bundle three edit on I am pointing to our fixed

210
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.530
bundle three named range So I'm just gonna put that back to how it Waas Before I started

211
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:58.110
playing around when this actually give us five entries in that one on 1234 five tips.

212
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.530
Five entries in that one on.

213
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.580
Hopefully you can have a play around with that.

214
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.470
As always,

215
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.600
if there are any questions,

216
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.640
just let me know and I'll be happy to help.

217
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.680
Have a great day.
