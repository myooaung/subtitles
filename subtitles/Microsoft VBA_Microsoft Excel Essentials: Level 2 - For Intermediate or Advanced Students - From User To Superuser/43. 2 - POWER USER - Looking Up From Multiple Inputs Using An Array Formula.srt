1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,170
So here we go.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,230
We have exactly the same day to set in here,

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,790
but what we're going to do is create a virtual concoct in a tid V Look up.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,690
String on.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,180
We're going to use that to look up the value of the national insurance number.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,950
If that's not clear at the moment,

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,720
stick with me.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,920
Because it will become very clear very shortly.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,050
So let me just copy those headings from here.

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,560
Uh,

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,550
that's what we want to do.

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,680
Copy on.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,190
Let me just paste them in here.

14
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:30,920
Okay,

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,000
So now we have a first name,

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,370
the last name to a cut for,

17
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,530
and we want to return our national insurance number in here.

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,230
Now,

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:44,290
what we did before when we use the backwards V look up was that we used the index a match

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:44,930
function,

21
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,490
and we're going to do exactly the same thing again,

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,950
just with a slight modification.

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,380
Okay,

24
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,870
Hagos.

25
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,910
So what we're gonna type is index because we still want to look at the whole data table

26
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,290
inner index.

27
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:04,050
So we highlight in the whole dates able because the index requires the full data set.

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:04,820
You'll remember.

29
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,750
Okay,

30
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,730
Comma there were going to go match,

31
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,120
just as we did before open brackets.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,070
But this time we're going to say hurry on.

33
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,150
And Mitchell?

34
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,940
So we're looking at both of those sets.

35
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,250
Okay,

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,220
so we're looking at Harry Andi Mitchell.

37
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,550
So they're joined together.

38
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,350
So comma,

39
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,170
and then we wanna have a look at Harry in this column.

40
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,150
So we're just gonna highlight that column,

41
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,020
okay?

42
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,350
And then we're going to hit.

43
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:43,160
And so Harry is being looked for in this column on our second value is gonna be looked for

44
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,350
in this column,

45
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,490
and then we're gonna hit comment on We're gonna find an exact match,

46
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,350
which is Aaron.

47
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,380
Close the brackets.

48
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,870
And that's how much part sorted out said they were sorted out.

49
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,220
Which road number?

50
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,750
We're in,

51
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,960
comma.

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,550
And we want to find the national insurance number from the full day to set.

53
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:11,150
So that's 1234 columns across for closer rackets and enter now.

54
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,190
You may not have expected that to happen every time we've entered a formula.

55
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,750
Up until this point,

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,290
we've just had enter.

57
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,590
When we've come to the end of our formula now array formulas a slightly different.

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,070
You may sometimes hear them referred to as C.

59
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,520
S E formulas,

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,750
which are control,

61
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,290
shift and enter formulas.

62
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,030
Aled.

63
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,480
That means that when you type this formula just going,

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,000
click back in the formula Bar for a second is you don't hit enter to make the formula work

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
because we can see that that returns an error.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,210
What we do is we select the formula by clicking in the formula bar,

67
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,780
hold down control,

68
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,680
hold down shift and then press enter and you'll notice that yet these curly brackets at the

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,000
end of the formula and at the beginning of the formula on that tells you that this is an

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,180
array formula.

71
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,820
All that means is that it's building an array in its virtual memory on Can Cassin eight in

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,610
these two strings together on,

73
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,340
then looking,

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,220
then this column for the first value,

75
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,150
this column for the second value,

76
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,430
and then it's returned in the national insurance number,

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,670
which is what we wanted to do.

78
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,820
So they go.

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,140
That's the difference between a normal formula on a ray formula.

80
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,850
You have to hold down control shift and enter when you enter it.

81
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,700
Okay,

82
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,890
so now if we were to look at Luca Brown,

83
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,870
enter you can see that Luca Brown doesn't return.

84
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,030
Oh,

85
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,460
sorry.

86
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,390
It's Harry Brown,

87
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,780
isn't it?

88
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,820
Where are we?

89
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,450
Let's have a look at Luke Cat.

90
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:41,950
Let's have a look.

91
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,510
A little Lucas.

92
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,850
So we have Luke Italy.

93
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,630
So let's have a look.

94
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,550
Look at Luca.

95
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,300
So look.

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,600
Sorry.

97
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,820
Luca Brown wears Luca Brown down here has returned a test 97 0856 which is absolutely right

98
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:55,820
.

99
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,470
But if we looked at Luke Aly Hey,

100
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,020
center.

101
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:05,770
We can see that Luke Elise number is P E 101260 c,

102
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,370
which is exactly right.

103
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,580
Okay,

104
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,220
so there's essentially the two ways to use multiple input criteria to return a value using

105
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,860
lookups or technically,

106
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,370
index,

107
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,520
um,

108
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:24,780
matches in the usual help of columns and inserted up front or use help of columns and drop

109
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,630
them at the end.

110
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,110
But using a V look up,

111
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,200
as we have here,

112
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,810
you'll remember that the data that you're looking up from,

113
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,240
V look,

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,080
abs only look to the right.

115
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,280
So you then gonna have to copy all the data over to the right of that.

116
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,010
Or the really jazzy way of doing it is to use an array formula.

117
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:41,910
Okay,

118
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,130
See you in the next lecture.
