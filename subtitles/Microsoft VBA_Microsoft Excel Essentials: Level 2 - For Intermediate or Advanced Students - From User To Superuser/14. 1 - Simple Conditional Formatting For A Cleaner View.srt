1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
okay,

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,160
now is welcome,

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,550
Mac.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:04,920
Now,

5
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,730
in this lecture,

6
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,150
we're gonna have a look at simple,

7
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,660
conditional formatting.

8
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,230
Now,

9
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,440
I finished off all of these other cells on Monday through Friday,

10
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:12,650
which,

11
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,540
in our happily reference in these cells just here on these cells all the way,

12
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,870
then Sunday and nobody referenced across here so we can see.

13
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,660
And when you say that we have a meeting because him Wednesday we have a meeting,

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,850
but everything else is pulling a zero because we have nothing entered in the data entry

15
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:31,550
screen.

16
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,870
Now what we're gonna do is apply a simple,

17
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,250
conditional formatting on all the conditional format means is that a particular format is

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,090
applied or not applied when a particular conditioners be met.

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,840
So the condition we're gonna test for is does the cell equals zero on or begin to try and

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,840
evaluate is whether we get a true or false response to that condition being met.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,320
So in this cell here,

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,650
I'm just gonna type zero.

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,880
And next week,

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,260
some type equals and I'm gonna hit that cell again,

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,910
and I'm gonna say equals one and there that will evaluate to false,

26
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,580
because what we've said is that M 31.

27
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,650
The soldiers here equals one which obviously is not true.

28
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,250
So it's evaluated to false.

29
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,350
But if we said M 31 equals zero on his enter with,

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,320
then get an evaluation of true,

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
so our condition would have been met on It's a simple is that when we apply the conditional

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,230
formatting over here because we've got the background set to yellow because we can see what

33
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,920
we're working on.

34
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,480
We want to actually change that toe.

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,850
Why it immediately?

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,030
That's what we're gonna do is we're going to make the text white.

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,240
If the condition is zero,

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,990
it's OK.

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,820
I've just selected this cell here.

40
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,360
I want to come up to conditional formatting hit the plus,

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,050
and I'm gonna create a new rule.

42
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay,

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,510
so now we have Ah,

44
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,680
window pop up on.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,260
What we're gonna do is we're going to use a formula to determine which sells to format,

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,360
which is the bottom option just here.

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,150
So I'm just going to click that,

48
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,790
move them out the way a little bit,

49
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,920
and then we can see this box,

50
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
which is the selector box.

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,210
So I'm just going to click in here on hit this little colorful box up the corner.

52
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,330
Then click the cell that we're looking at now.

53
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,020
At the moment,

54
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,520
you'll see that that say's equals dollar D doh,

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,100
at 32 which is an absolute cell reference.

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,740
Which means wherever we copy this format in,

57
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,490
it's only gonna look at that particular cell.

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,980
The cell was always Indy on,

59
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,880
always in 32.

60
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,440
So to scroll through,

61
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,230
these were just gonna hit F four,

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,180
which now gives us t absolute 32 f four again.

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,240
Then we get absolute D 32 on one more time on their four and gives us d 32.

64
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay,

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,780
so that's the cell were evaluated on DWI.

66
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,750
Want to have a look?

67
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,000
Does it equal zero?

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,520
So if this if this evaluates to be true,

69
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,980
Selvi 3rd 2 equals zero.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,120
What format would be like to apply?

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
So we hit the little format on.

72
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,070
What we want to do is we want to look at the funds which currently is colored automatic.

73
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,150
But what we wanted to do is color it white.

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,250
So I'm just going to change their funds color twice,

75
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,760
and you can do other things in here.

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,890
You can change the border.

77
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,000
You can change the fell.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,320
But all we want to do is change the front toe white.

79
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,600
So I hit OK and I hit OK again on DNO.

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,800
You can see that even though it's still say zero,

81
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
it appears to be blank.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,460
So what we're gonna do is copy the formatting from there and apply it to here and click

83
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:45,740
often.

84
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,160
You can see that we still have zero in there,

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,290
but you know,

86
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,520
can't see because it's white text on a white background and it's gonna carry on that all

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,750
the way across here.

88
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,700
And you can see that the only text that survived because it didn't meet the criteria of

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:11,070
this cell equals zero is meeting so we could go back Teoh Monday and say lunch as if lunch

90
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,450
would be a reason for a journey.

91
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,790
Actually,

92
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,060
pretty good reason for a Jannik on there.

93
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,780
We can see that lunch as as being added.

94
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,600
So there you go.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
That's a nice,

96
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,710
simple way of doing conditional formatting on a pretty good use for it.

97
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,070
It saves you having loads heroes all over spreadsheets,

98
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,110
and it makes things look a lot tired.

99
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,200
You,

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,680
if you could just blank it out.

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,180
So we've applied the conditional format.

102
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,850
We've said,

103
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,010
Does this cell equals zero?

104
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,370
If it does turn out a text white and it's a simple is that Okay?

105
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,510
So you in the next lecture.
