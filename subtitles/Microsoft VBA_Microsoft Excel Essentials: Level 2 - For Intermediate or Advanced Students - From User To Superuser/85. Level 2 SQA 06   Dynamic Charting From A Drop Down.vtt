00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Okay,

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:02.290
guys.

3
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.840
And welcome back to another student.

4
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.080
Questions answered.

5
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.550
Now this one's from ruin at my poll jizz.

6
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.410
If I'm not pronouncing that correctly,

7
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.350
then what ruin has is a table,

8
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.050
not a date arranged.

9
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.800
A table that looks something like this and what we want to achieve is having a different

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.840
sheet with a drop down list on charts.

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630
The changes dynamically,

12
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.070
depending on the value that we chosen from the drop down list.

13
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.190
Now,

14
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.350
the drop down list is to contain these values here in column one.

15
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.350
So if you flip over to sheet too,

16
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.320
come to drop down Li Shing's He currently may have a selected If we select be Look what

17
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.400
happens to the charts.

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.310
They go.

19
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:48.700
It changes dynamically based on the selection here on pulling data from this table here.

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.270
Okay,

21
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.050
so let's have a look at how we do that.

22
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.710
Okay,

23
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.710
here's a new file.

24
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.280
It's called Fire Dynamic Tables,

25
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340
and you can download this from this lecture.

26
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.840
So this is the base later on,

27
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.690
what we're gonna do is click somewhere in there,

28
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.420
hit control and T,

29
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.430
and we're gonna get this little poppet that says you want to create a table Click,

30
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.940
OK,

31
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.260
and they go Boom.

32
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.350
We have a table.

33
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.710
Now.

34
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.080
What we want to do is how to drop down list in here on a different sheet.

35
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.470
So we're going to do here is we're gonna select Cell a one on.

36
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.850
We're just gonna call this my list on type.

37
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.910
Enter on.

38
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.060
Then we're gonna come over to Formulas to the name manager,

39
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.640
and here we can see we have my list on notice.

40
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.640
What happens when I click in here?

41
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.370
I'm gonna try and change that from a two to a four on when I try to change it automatically

42
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.430
changes this to table square brackets at store.

43
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.750
Now I'm gonna overwrite that What I'm gonna say is absolute.

44
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.870
I absolutes.

45
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.100
Well,

46
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.670
let's just say a two.

47
00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.020
That would be quicker A to f 42 on whether we want to go to want to go see a four.

48
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.000
And I'm gonna absolute that by pressing f four don't going to click the little ticks at the

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.770
little tick box.

50
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.430
And now when I click on here,

51
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.190
you can see that that table is being selected.

52
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.700
Okay,

53
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.340
close.

54
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.900
Now I'm gonna come back to here.

55
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.870
I'm gonna Wiz over to data to data validation on.

56
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.340
I'm gonna choose list,

57
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.070
and I'm gonna say my lips say equals my list and enter.

58
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.610
And there we have this list here that says ABC just like here now,

59
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.040
because this is a table I can happily add,

60
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.340
a new value onto the bottom of this on this will also capture that dynamically.

61
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.500
So now we have a,

62
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.960
B,

63
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.330
C and D.

64
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.030
Okay,

65
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.580
so far,

66
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.220
so good.

67
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.230
Now,

68
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.030
the next thing we need to do is go to sheet to,

69
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.450
and what we're gonna do is add Look up to the value that's in here.

70
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.940
So I'm just going to say equals re Look up,

71
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.530
V.

72
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.680
Look up.

73
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.000
Open rackets.

74
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.250
Point here.

75
00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.080
Comer,

76
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.260
come back over to here on Dimas will just select the whole table se calmer to calm a false

77
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.750
because I want to also pull that description So they go No,

78
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.600
I get pi.

79
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.400
And if I choose number or letter B,

80
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.120
I get cake and you know if this works Okay,

81
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.730
so now we have RV.

82
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.350
Look up.

83
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.460
Okay.

84
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.260
Now we're gonna flip back to sheet one,

85
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.460
and we're going to create a chart because we have a selected here.

86
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.160
I'm just going to select the data from a I'm gonna come to inserts.

87
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.970
And I'm gonna come to recommended chart some groups that slowly off screen.

88
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.260
I'm just gonna pick this one here and click.

89
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.680
OK,

90
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.380
so here we have a pie and you can see the a pie.

91
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.250
Is this cell on this cell on the data is 123 And that's 123 here.

92
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.660
So women do is right.

93
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.120
Click.

94
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.050
Excuse me.

95
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.800
Choose cut.

96
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.060
Come over to here.

97
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.640
And I'm just going to paste it in that you can choose the first formal.

98
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.080
The 2nd 1 makes no difference whatsoever.

99
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.800
Okay,

100
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.020
so now we have our charts in the second thing.

101
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.320
Now what we're gonna do is right click the chart to select data on Dhere.

102
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.860
What we're gonna do do is choose edit.

103
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.540
And in this first serious,

104
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.530
we're going to delete what's in there.

105
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.230
I'm gonna come here.

106
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.830
I'm gonna flip back to sheet,

107
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.250
too,

108
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.430
and I'm gonna just drag over a and B and click.

109
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.000
OK,

110
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.430
so that's the first step.

111
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.420
And notice that this is no being deleted out of here.

112
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.330
The chart data range will come to that in just a second.

113
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.120
So okay,

114
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.560
now,

115
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.050
at the moment,

116
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.370
the data is not going to change.

117
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.090
But here,

118
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.620
if we choose be,

119
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.020
you'll notice that the total changes to be cake,

120
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.150
which is what's in here on DSI will change to sea ice cream.

121
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.690
Okay,

122
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.270
so far,

123
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.860
so good.

124
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.840
Now we need to deal with this bit the data bit and this is where it gets slowly,

125
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.050
more complicated.

126
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.660
Now,

127
00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.410
it would be so much easier if we could just use indirect when we use in our data source.

128
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.870
Then we could build a string that points to what we actually want to look at.

129
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.120
Unfortunately,

130
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.730
you cannot use the indirect function in a day to Siri's,

131
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.890
but you can use the offset.

132
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.950
So that's exactly what we're gonna do now.

133
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.310
So what we're gonna do is we're going to create a new named range on this time.

134
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.570
We're gonna select these three cells if we have a these three cells.

135
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.050
If we have B and these three cells,

136
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.920
if we have see okay,

137
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.470
so all I'm going to do for seconds,

138
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.890
I'm just going to select a one.

139
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.170
I want to call it my data and hit enter and know.

140
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.740
What I want to do is I want to come up to formulas,

141
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.400
go to name manager on This is where it gets a little more tricky.

142
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.950
So what we're gonna do is we're going to say sheet a one.

143
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.250
Absolutely.

144
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.350
That is where we want to start.

145
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.780
OK,

146
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.500
so that's our first thing.

147
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.840
But what we want to do is we want to offset from a one on.

148
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.640
We want to come down the appropriate number of rows Onda over two column,

149
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.540
see Through column E.

150
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.670
So I'm gonna say is offset open brackets.

151
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.900
This is where we're starting sheet one on.

152
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.250
I'm just going to say for now,

153
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.780
calmer,

154
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.010
too comer to come at one comma,

155
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.730
three and clothes.

156
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.530
And I'm just going to hit the little taken.

157
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.860
We'll see what that does.

158
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.760
So when I click in here,

159
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:34.730
you can see that be if I select be it's moving down from here 12 So that's our two on.

160
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.280
We're moving over two columns,

161
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.030
1 to 2 here and then we're selecting one column deep because we only want the first row of

162
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.050
data at one roadie for big,

163
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.090
a pardon and three cells across.

164
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:55.220
So if I change that second to or if I change that 1st 2 here to warm and hit enter and then

165
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.510
click back in you can see that we're actually Gellin the A data,

166
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.750
which is this one here.

167
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.420
OK,

168
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.310
so now what we need to do is find out dynamically.

169
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:11.400
Which row does the letter selected over here in sheet to relate to on what we're gonna do

170
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.910
is do a simple match for that.

171
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.340
So all we will say is match open rackets.

172
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.790
I hope you keeping up with this match this value here,

173
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.430
comma in this data set here.

174
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.880
And I'm just going to select the whole of column A and I'm gonna make that an absolute

175
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.460
reference.

176
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.140
I'm gonna make that an absolute reference on no one's an exact match.

177
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.570
So come at zero.

178
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.340
Andi,

179
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:35.910
enter.

180
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.800
So now you can see that a appears at line two,

181
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.720
which is absolutely correct.

182
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.080
But we only wanted to offset warm to get a I used data.

183
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.240
So what we're gonna do here is,

184
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.590
say,

185
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.910
minus one.

186
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:56.900
So near when we offset began offset by the correct number of Rose s.

187
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.280
So let me just copy that match Copy.

188
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.230
And I want to come up to let me just click off,

189
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.350
come to the name manager on.

190
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.710
I'm my data.

191
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.530
I am going to replace the first number here.

192
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.720
This number one with that formula.

193
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.250
So I'm just gonna pace it in there on click tick,

194
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.270
Andi.

195
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.430
Then we go in here.

196
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.880
So let me just come off that for a second.

197
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.950
So we have a selected on When we come in here,

198
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.580
we can see that we have the A data set selected.

199
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:37.540
So if I chose be in here on then came to name injure and selected my list my data rather

200
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.670
and click on here,

201
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.490
you can see that the B data is selected.

202
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:48.590
So now our data set is dynamically selected based on the selection that we have in here.

203
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.100
Now,

204
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.350
all the remains for us to do is point to that named range in the day to serious.

205
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.120
So just right click.

206
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.650
Come here.

207
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.510
So now all we can do is click edit.

208
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.040
We're going to come into here.

209
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.240
The data range lives on sheet one.

210
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.310
So we're just gonna delete everything else.

211
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.130
We're going to say my data on hit Enter and then click.

212
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.780
OK,

213
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:15.220
so now when we select a we have a pie because it's reading from here on Dhere on Then we

214
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:19.680
have 10 6 on do whatever those four and we have 10 6 and four.

215
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.220
But now when we come back and choose B,

216
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.740
it re sizes dynamically.

217
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.180
And when we select see it now resize is dynamically.

218
00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.730
So now we could go into the bottom here we could say,

219
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.050
Actually,

220
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.130
we also won t It's chocolate.

221
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:38.970
I'm just making this up now let's say 66 Andi,

222
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.290
I think they took also that from Venice.

223
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.990
A 62 on When I come back to sheet to,

224
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.520
I can come here and select D and they go never get chocolate to on.

225
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.580
That's how you do that.

226
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.850
Hopefully that was helpful.

227
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.380
An awful lot of steps and you do have to use the upset.

228
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.700
But that's the way to change dynamically.

229
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.740
A chart using a table.

230
00:09:58.740 --> 00:09:59.320
OK,

231
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.670
I'll see you in the next lecture
