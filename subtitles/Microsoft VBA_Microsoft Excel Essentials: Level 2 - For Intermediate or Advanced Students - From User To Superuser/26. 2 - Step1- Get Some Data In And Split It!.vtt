00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Okay,

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:02.910
guys,

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.520
a very useful thing toe have when you're building the database is some data that you can,

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.250
Queary.

5
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.370
And to that end,

6
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.220
I've created this fall for you,

7
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.940
which you condemn.

8
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.050
Load in the resource is section and it's called h R file duct XLs X.

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.550
When you download that file,

10
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.280
you'll be looking at exactly what I'm looking at here.

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.880
Now that the movement this is just a simple Excel spreadsheet with one tab which is called

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.230
HR file on.

13
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.820
What we're gonna do is rename it immediately to HR database Master.

14
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.970
So I already have that safe.

15
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.550
I'm just saving over the top of it.

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.160
Okay,

17
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.810
Now we need to do a couple of things in this lesson.

18
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.490
The first thing we need to do is add a new sheet ons,

19
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.240
Scrooge it to the front because that's where we're gonna be doing now.

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.460
Look,

21
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.870
ups.

22
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.100
So I'm just going to rename that too simple database on.

23
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.010
That's that bit done.

24
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.340
We're gonna come back to the HR screen way,

25
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.780
have a slight problem in here,

26
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.750
inasmuch as that we have a name column and we have both the Christian name and the surname

27
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.050
appearing in the same string.

28
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.390
So we have combat space.

29
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.040
Phillips.

30
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.560
Now,

31
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.260
what we may want to do is insert a couple of blank columns in here on what we want to do is

32
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.810
split this.

33
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.040
So we have Connor in here and Felix in here and then Harry in here and then Mitchell in

34
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.400
here and so on and so forth,

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.840
then the whole day to set.

36
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.470
So,

37
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.800
luckily,

38
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.300
there's a very quick way of doing this in excel.

39
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.550
We're going to highlight the data that we want to split by clicking the column letter.

40
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.500
So highlighted column D I'm gonna come up to the data tab at the top on Want to choose this

41
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.470
option over here,

42
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.480
which is text to columns.

43
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.590
So I'm just gonna left click that in this little box here is gonna pop up Now we're gonna

44
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.990
leave it,

45
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.300
set it delimited.

46
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.490
We're gonna click next.

47
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.880
Now one of delimit er is is it will look across the entire text ring in this case commerce

48
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.310
space.

49
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.360
Phillips on it will look for a character which will delimit each of the things that we want

50
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.330
to separate.

51
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.690
So at the moment,

52
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.070
tab is the default dilemmas that But what we actually want to do this?

53
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.580
We can see we have a space between the first name and the second name all the way down.

54
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.940
We will choose space as they would a limiter.

55
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.790
And in our data preview,

56
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.460
we can no see that that would be split between two columns with the Christian name in the

57
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.210
first column on the surname in the second column.

58
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.610
So,

59
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.130
so far,

60
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.710
so good hit next.

61
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.310
There.

62
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.740
We want to tell it where the destination is gonna be.

63
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.940
No.

64
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.560
Currently,

65
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.660
it's set to absolute d one,

66
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.350
which is this soul just here.

67
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.690
I'm just gonna choose the little box and click in B one because I wanted to dump in column

68
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.930
B and column C and then I'm gonna hit finish so they know we have a full name in this

69
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.110
column so we can no change that to full name.

70
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.410
Full name on.

71
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.600
We have a Christian name in this column on our surname in this column.

72
00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.510
So it's just re title those to first name Andi last name and they go.

73
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.430
So now we have employee number.

74
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.000
First name,

75
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.610
last name,

76
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.200
full name national insurance,

77
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.520
sex,

78
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.450
date of birth on start date.

79
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.190
Okay,

80
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.580
Now what we're going to do is we use the employee number toe.

81
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.060
Look up.

82
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.890
All the rest of this data in our simple database scream.

83
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.650
So?

84
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.010
So we don't forget any of these columns.

85
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.380
Here's a little tip for you.

86
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.620
What?

87
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.310
Men do it.

88
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.760
Just highlight all the titles hit control and see Flip back to wear simple database,

89
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.650
right?

90
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.970
Click and choose Speight and choose paste Special transposed Which is this one?

91
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.910
Just here.

92
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.330
When you click that you'll get all of those titles that were previously going across the

93
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.850
top on Dropped going down.

94
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.930
So they go in.

95
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.900
The next lesson will rearrange these and write some simple the lookups and start pulling

96
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.060
all of this data in.

97
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.990
Okay,

98
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.210
See you in the next lecture.
