00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
OK,

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:02.920
guys.

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.680
Now here's another question that I get asked frequently on.

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.100
That is,

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.730
can you look up from multiple inputs to return a single V look of value on again?

6
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.060
The answer is yes.

7
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.750
But first,

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
let's have a look at another inherent floor with the lookups.

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.270
Now you'll notice when we've done very lookups before.

10
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.210
Let me just temporarily create a cell over here to import something.

11
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.160
So we type Luca,

12
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.790
would you?

13
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.260
A strange look up equals three.

14
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.830
Look up open brackets.

15
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.290
We're looking at that comer.

16
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.200
We're looking over here and we want to return the national insurance number.

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.810
1234 full.

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.960
Come for Colin.

19
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.970
Full comment.

20
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.880
False enter.

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.920
Fantastic.

22
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.000
So we can see now that we have successfully looked up Lucas national insurance number.

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.210
So it's looked down all of here until it's found Luke at its looked across,

24
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.230
and it's returned P E 101 to 60.

25
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.900
See,

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.090
exactly right.

27
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.350
But if we carry on looking down this column here,

28
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.190
we can see that we actually have another Luca in here who obviously has a completely

29
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.130
different national insurance number,

30
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.320
and we can carry on looking down and we find that we have even another Luke at in here on

31
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990
another Luca just here.

32
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.030
So what happens if what you're actually looking for is the second or third or fourth or

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.820
40th or 400 Luca in your list?

34
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.670
And that's the inherent floor in V lookups that it will only ever find the first match.

35
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.350
Their one way around this is You can change the order of the issues in the sort.

36
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.280
But still,

37
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.950
even if the bottom Luca came to the top,

38
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100
you would only ever get as far as that first.

39
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.670
Luca.

40
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.060
Whichever order these appeared in whatever sort order you apply to this,

41
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.170
only the first Luca that it finds will ever be returned on.

42
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.100
That may not necessarily be the one that you're looking for.

43
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.830
Okay,

44
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.710
so let's just delete.

45
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.510
Not for a second,

46
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.860
actually.

47
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.450
Leave it in there just so you can see when you don't load it.

48
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510
There are a couple of ways of doing this.

49
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.660
The 1st 1 is introduced.

50
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.750
Help column.

51
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.940
I wanna help.

52
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.940
A column does.

53
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.880
Is it can Katyn eight's a couple of strings that you want to join together.

54
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.230
So I'm gonna do here is in before the first column.

55
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.880
I'll leave that one,

56
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.380
Meritus.

57
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.640
So I'm just gonna highlight the first color on there.

58
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.630
Right click and I'm going to choose Insert on.

59
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.850
I'm gonna movil the rows over to the right.

60
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.100
And here I'm gonna insert my help a column so I just call it Help on what I'm gonna do is

61
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:49.080
build a can capture nation cattle on what I want to join is the first name comma on the

62
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.990
last name.

63
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.560
So I'm just joining those two strings together.

64
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.750
Close the rackets hit Enter.

65
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.680
So now we can see if I auto size that that we now have Connor Phillips Copy that all the

66
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.290
way down.

67
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.320
So we have now a concoct in ated entry called Connor Phillips.

68
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.610
Harry Mitchell Oscar Kelly Luke early on a phenomenon Lou Camilla on then on and on Luca

69
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.440
Miller again.

70
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.110
Way have to Luca Miller's.

71
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.300
That's a catastrophe.

72
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.620
Welcome to that.

73
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.460
Shortly on Luca Brown.

74
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.040
Okay,

75
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.600
so now let me just widen those.

76
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.780
What we're going to do is enter to look ups.

77
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.310
So what we're gonna say is Luca,

78
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.570
this is where the years of his entering on,

79
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.590
we're gonna type Lee on.

80
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.030
We want to return the national insurance number.

81
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.420
So what we're going to do now is use this column as our index in RV.

82
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.050
Look up.

83
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.210
But I look at value is going to be this cell on this cell joined together.

84
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.450
So let's do that.

85
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.930
So we're gonna type equals V.

86
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.450
Look up.

87
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.470
Open brackets.

88
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.790
Now,

89
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.010
look at value is a concocted nation off these two cells here.

90
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.960
So what we're gonna type is con captain,

91
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.250
eight cats in a sack.

92
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.450
Oh,

93
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.470
from records this cell calmer.

94
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.620
And this cell,

95
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.600
we're not going to drag the formula around.

96
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.720
So not making it an absolute cell reference is fine in this instance.

97
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.690
So there's I can Curtin eight close brackets on that will finish the concatenation part of

98
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.230
the formula comma,

99
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.280
Now we're going to do is highlight our data table,

100
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.840
which is this area just here.

101
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.150
We can include the Hedda's if we want to eso our no concur tin ated value of Lucca.

102
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.200
Lee will appear in the first column on We want to return the national insurance number.

103
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.650
So 12345 So we want to go comma five comma,

104
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.120
false and close brackets enter.

105
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.710
So they go now we confined that Luca Lee swelling Luke Elise.

106
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.970
National insurance number is P E 101 to 60 c.

107
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.250
Which exactly correct.

108
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.320
But if we chose our next Luca Luca Miller,

109
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.170
we can just change the the entry in here to Miller.

110
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.000
And you can see that now.

111
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.320
Luca Miller returns Zen G 884813 b,

112
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.750
which is exactly correct.

113
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.640
And similarly,

114
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.020
we can choose Luca Brown Luca Brown on Luca Brown's national insurance number.

115
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.370
From down here is HS 970856 b anay,

116
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.280
go 970856 b.

117
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:36.250
So that works perfectly Now when you have to people with same name like Luca Miller here on

118
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.510
Luca Miller here,

119
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.140
you're probably going to need 1/3 string to concoct innate.

120
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.740
Now,

121
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.210
there's one quick way to find out how many entries you have with the same value on.

122
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.950
I'll just show you how to do that quickly.

123
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.660
What we're gonna do is we're gonna had another thing in here that say is What are we going

124
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.220
to say?

125
00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.510
Let's say how many in the appear okay on,

126
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.590
let's have the answer appearing here,

127
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.560
So I'm just going to center emergence center that won't over to the right Hemi appear and

128
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.710
what we're gonna do.

129
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.980
I'm just gonna pretty that up a little bit on these.

130
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.720
This is absolutely not essential.

131
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.630
It also the formula.

132
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.330
I just try to make it look a little bit better.

133
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.290
And what we want to do here is we want to count.

134
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:32.120
How many times can Katyn ated string off Luca Brown in this instance appears in our help.

135
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.600
Cullen.

136
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.540
So what we want to do is on account if formula here.

137
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.990
So what we're gonna say equals can't if on what it's asking for first is the range.

138
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.070
And that's gonna be this range just here on what we want to look for the criteria.

139
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.450
Comma is going to be this cell and this cell.

140
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:58.460
So we can either right again Cata Nation or we could just click that cell type ampersand,

141
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.390
which does exactly the same thing.

142
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.050
Hit that cell and close the brackets and then hit Enter.

143
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.200
So they go.

144
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.290
We can see that Luca Brown only appears once in this column here.

145
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.090
And if we similarly we talked,

146
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.820
what was the other girl's name locally?

147
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.940
We Kenly,

148
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.410
I don't That's a boy or a girl.

149
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.810
Luke and Lee.

150
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:19.440
It's a girl.

151
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.240
It's a boy.

152
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.530
Luca Lee apologised.

153
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.200
Or any Lucas who are doing this course appears once.

154
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.070
But we may have Luca Miller on.

155
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.380
We can see now that Lucas Miller appears twice for no.

156
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.880
That's the first way of using the help of column now similarly,

157
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.870
and help Colin to what I'm going to do is almost exactly the same thing.

158
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.990
But rather than moving all of these columns over long and do is introduce my help of column

159
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.780
at the end.

160
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.890
So I'm just gonna had add Helper se equals we can either use that can cast a nation,

161
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.580
or we can literally just click,

162
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.130
hit the ampersand and click the next one,

163
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.810
which will do exactly the same thing,

164
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.120
innit?

165
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.590
Enter.

166
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.170
So there we have our help.

167
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.510
A column of column comment Phillips on that's copied all the way down on their What we

168
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.600
could do is either use the index match to look up backwards as we looked at before,

169
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.590
or we could copy the national insurance number,

170
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.450
which is the value we want a lock up.

171
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:27.900
Look up coffee on pace that in here and then just use this little bit of data table as RV

172
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:28.470
Look up.

173
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.200
So again,

174
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.440
let's set the sensor.

175
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.020
Who we got?

176
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.550
Let's say,

177
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.270
Harry Mitchell.

178
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:38.730
So Harry whips no spaces Ellen Mitchell and said,

179
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.470
I'm those two l's and make sure that wouldn't have worked.

180
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:41.850
Okay,

181
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:42.560
Harry Mitchell.

182
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.010
And again,

183
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.900
we're gonna do a can Cassin ated v Look up.

184
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.760
So be look up!

185
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.000
Oh,

186
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.540
Prum rackets andare.

187
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.380
Look at value.

188
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.160
Is that Andi?

189
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:59.380
That's comma table array is now just this little section at the end here because I can.

190
00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.450
Caffeinated value appears here,

191
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.780
Comma.

192
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.850
We're looking Second column,

193
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.450
too.

194
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.440
Come out false and close brackets And there you go.

195
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.520
So that also works perfectly well.

196
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.580
All we've done is exactly the same thing as we did in the First Column,

197
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.140
but we've added a help.

198
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.600
A column to the end.

199
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.730
Okay,

200
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.300
so that's how you do it using a helper column.

201
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.080
But there is a more sophisticated way of doing this.

202
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.170
If you couldn't be bothered with adding helper columns into your database on that is using

203
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.000
the dark art of the array formula.

204
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.850
Okay,

205
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.150
See you in the next lecture.
