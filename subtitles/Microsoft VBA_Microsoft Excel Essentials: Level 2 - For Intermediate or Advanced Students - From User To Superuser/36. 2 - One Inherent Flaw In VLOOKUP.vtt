00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Okay,

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.830
guys,

3
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.850
welcome back.

4
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.240
Now,

5
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.730
the more astute of you will have noticed through all of the exercises so far in this

6
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.410
section that we've used for you Look up on reviews it pretty powerfully so far.

7
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.750
But you will have noticed with the look up that we will look here on it will read data from

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.660
across here.

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.850
Or we can look here on it will read data going across here.

10
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.380
Or it can look here everyday to going across here or look here on going across here.

11
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.910
Now,

12
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.320
the common element in all of those is whenever you use a V look up,

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.340
you can only return values that lie to the right of your index.

14
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.080
OK,

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.450
so what would happen if we had another column in here,

16
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.270
perhaps with car registrations down here?

17
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.350
And you wanted to look up from this column.

18
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.680
But you wanted to return the value from here,

19
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.330
so you would be looking to the left.

20
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.010
Now,

21
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.990
you cannot do that with the looker,

22
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.920
but luckily,

23
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.000
you can do it in Excel on.

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.430
That's gonna be the subject of the next lecture.

25
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.150
Okay,

26
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.960
See you there.
