00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
Okay,

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.030
guys.

3
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.250
So we've got a rhizomes in our list,

4
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.660
and then what we're gonna do is use that indirect function to build the cell,

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.720
reference that sheet on cell references to use a match function cause match is going to be

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.450
the middle parts of our formula.

7
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.390
So what I'm gonna do,

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.070
just for a second is just right.

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.460
Right?

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.300
A quick match.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.820
Former So equals match open rackets.

12
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.270
And I want to look for this value comma.

13
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.060
I want to look for in BLT on.

14
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.210
I want to look for it in column A and I only find an exact match.

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.640
Andi,

16
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.690
close brackets Sago.

17
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.790
We can see the bacon appears at line seven.

18
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.720
Now,

19
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.360
I'm deliberately going to do this again because I'm going to see a subtle difference.

20
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.030
I'm just gonna right.

21
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.460
Exactly.

22
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.510
The same formula almost equals match.

23
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.870
I'm gonna look here.

24
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.550
I'm gonna hit comma there because someone the line of chilli con Carney,

25
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.700
I'm gonna slight chilli con Carney tab Select.

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.800
Sell a column a descended before comma zero.

27
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.860
Andi,

28
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.870
close brackets.

29
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.590
Okay,

30
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.610
so bacon doesn't appear in chilli con Carney,

31
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.700
but it appears at line seven in a B.

32
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.950
L t now woman do is delete the equals from each of these cells.

33
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.170
Okay,

34
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.630
so that is what the formula looks like without the equals.

35
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.130
You'll also notice that the common elements are the match open brackets Andi e for Aunt

36
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.940
comma in both instances,

37
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.600
So what I'm gonna do is delete everything up to that point.

38
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.230
Delete on,

39
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.810
delete everything up to the A on.

40
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.320
I'm gonna do exactly the same with this.

41
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.920
So everything there,

42
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.530
I'm going to delete Andi This last little bit over here I'm going to delete.

43
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.940
Then when we look at this,

44
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.230
they look pretty similar.

45
00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:01.150
We have the sheet name in this instance an exclamation point in a cool on A But we do have

46
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.310
a slight difference here that we can see in chilli con Carney.

47
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.570
We can see that we have chilli con Carney apostrophe exclamation point,

48
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.800
A coal on a And if we actually looked at the cell value here,

49
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.790
you can see that we also have an apostrophe immediately before the name.

50
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.740
And that's a fundamental difference on the reason for that is on this cell on on this town

51
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.150
here,

52
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.340
BLT,

53
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.270
BLT are three characters that run concurrently with no spaces.

54
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.210
Therefore,

55
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.420
there is no need for the apostrophe.

56
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.900
But when you have a space in your sheet name automatically Excel will put an apostrophe

57
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.370
before the first word.

58
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.900
And after the last word on that's critical to consider when we build our string that we're

59
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.380
going to use in our formula.

60
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.920
So what we're gonna do now is build a string that matches this format precisely.

61
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.250
So here what we're going to do,

62
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.830
you say,

63
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.640
equals open quotes,

64
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.870
apostrophe.

65
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.770
There's our first apostrophe they were going to hit on.

66
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.740
And then we're gonna point to this cell over here because we're gonna be Dragon it this way

67
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.740
.

68
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.290
We always wanted to stay in column A but not necessarily online eight.

69
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.590
So I'm gonna hit at four,

70
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.720
but gives us absolute eight.

71
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.650
Absolute eight.

72
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.670
I'm gonna hit therefore again.

73
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.290
And then we have a absolute A's.

74
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.700
Andre.

75
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.300
Is it one more time because we always wanted in a but eight ca move Depend on where we drag

76
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.990
it up and down.

77
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.480
So now we have an apostrophe on their sheet name.

78
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.210
Then we're gonna hit on,

79
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.150
and then we're gonna add a next reports next possibly open quotes,

80
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.570
apostrophe,

81
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.910
then we can have that exclamation point because that's comp common between the two of them

82
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.910
.

83
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.700
A colon,

84
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.450
A l close quotes on his enter.

85
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.450
So they go now we have.

86
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.140
If I copy that here,

87
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.670
Andi away,

88
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.360
then they go.

89
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.410
You can see we've successfully built the exact cell reference that we're going to need to

90
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.810
reference when we use our match function.

91
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.490
Now,

92
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.090
you remember at the beginning that I said,

93
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.450
I'm not gonna also these.

94
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.930
I'm not going to change these.

95
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.230
That was for that reason.

96
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.750
So you can see what the full form that looks like.

97
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.910
So with these now,

98
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.830
I'm just going to release everything back to cottage high.

99
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.780
So I need to leave the apostrophe and,

100
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.010
you know,

101
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.980
I can't recall.

102
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.710
I don't think we do know.

103
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.530
So they go,

104
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.710
I'm just gonna delete everything back to the last word.

105
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.900
So here are our strings that we've built using this value over here on joining up.

106
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.040
Add in an apostrophe which must be in quotes,

107
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.450
use the and function.

108
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.300
Then we're gonna point to the south.

109
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.310
Then we're gonna open the quotes again.

110
00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:02.970
Add on next apostrophe exclamation point on our A coal on a and closed the quotes off on.

111
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.630
That's how you build a string to give you a cell reference on.

112
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.150
The next thing we're going to do is add an indirect function to that.

113
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.150
So we're going to click in here.

114
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:21.100
We're gonna say indirect open brackets jump over to the end and then close the brackets.

115
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.490
Andi!

116
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.150
Kenta!

117
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.280
So I'm just going to copy that all the way down on D.

118
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.180
Don't worry about what it's doing at the moment,

119
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.430
because what we want to do is add a match to this.

120
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.810
So what we're gonna do is click before that and add much open rackets.

121
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.610
No,

122
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.630
I want to click on here because I want to look for bacon in each of our sheets.

123
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.020
Now I'm gonna hit therefore once,

124
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.190
Andi twice because we always want to be in line for,

125
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.060
but not necessarily always in column e.

126
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.740
When we drank this across so common,

127
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.560
here's where I'll look up array lives because we just built it from our string on said it

128
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.470
is an indirect cell reference.

129
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.650
So we just jump to the end Coma zero exact match.

130
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.980
Close brackets Andi,

131
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.080
enter and I'm just going to copy that all the way down.

132
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.370
Control and d away across control Onda are so they go.

133
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.510
We can never see that we have bacon appearing online.

134
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.110
Seven in a BLT.

135
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.680
It appears at line seven in for English Does it?

136
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.220
That's probably does his bacon in a full English breakfast in a B l T butter appears at

137
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.100
line 10.

138
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.680
Let's just check that butter is outlined.

139
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.190
10 and most definitely is.

140
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.160
So there you go.

141
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.310
Now what we have let me just central of that home Andi center.

142
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.050
Now what we've successfully done is we built a string.

143
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.540
We have turned that string into an indirect sheet on cell reference and then reviews that

144
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.990
in our match function.

145
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.400
Now,

146
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.930
the next thing we're gonna do is convert this to either zero or a one by testing for an era

147
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.930
.

148
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.270
But this is quite a long lecture at the moment.

149
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.130
So what we'll do is we'll call it a day from now on.

150
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.940
We'll get to that in the next lecture.

151
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.850
I'll see you there
