1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,470
Okay,

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,860
guys,

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:02,970
um,

4
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,590
welcome back to this Lynch.

5
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,630
Now,

6
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,370
Thesis section prompted a couple of observations.

7
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:09,800
Now,

8
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,300
firstly,

9
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,470
let me say that this expenses and time sheet template that we go through in the course is

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,250
one that actually used my contractor for the NHS for a couple of years.

11
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:26,100
And now the questions observations around this are two things one I knew about when I

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,050
didn't know about both of which we're gonna cover now,

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,000
here we have ah,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,990
33 options car,

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,920
motorbike cycle,

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,380
petrol,

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,620
diesel LPG,

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,030
andan engines,

19
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,110
Engine size choice of three.

20
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,960
But if you don't know to only take one and let's face it,

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,600
some users wouldn't know to only take one.

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,140
What you can do is actually select two options.

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:58,260
So we get car and motorbike now the way around that you can protect this sheet and we cover

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,100
how to do that.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,680
See the lecture after this,

26
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,710
all the electro after that.

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,970
But within 10 minutes,

28
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,360
you'll certainly know how to protect the sheet.

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,170
And that will force the user to use the data entry screen just here,

30
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,320
which is sort of the object of the exercise.

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,230
So Option one is to use protection.

32
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,400
And the second option is to not use tick boxes or check boxes,

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,830
but to use option buttons or radio button.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,600
So I'm gonna cover that in this lecture.

35
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,580
No,

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,170
that's the part of this that I did know about.

37
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,910
The part of this they didn't know about is if you actually take a box in here,

38
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,540
it overwrites the formula that we wrote a little earlier.

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,390
Now it wasn't where that that happened.

40
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,010
Anyway,

41
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,550
we will find a way to get around that formula issue,

42
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,060
and we'll cover the shoes in radio buttons.

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,390
So Fanara here.

44
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,810
I'm just going to type radio buttons.

45
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,620
And this is the These are the cells.

46
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,480
That will be reference in shortly.

47
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,610
So for now,

48
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,700
I'm just going to come back to the expenses sheet,

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,070
hold down,

50
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,300
control left,

51
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,810
click left,

52
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,320
click left.

53
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,700
Click.

54
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,190
Pick all nine of these and move them out the way.

55
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,030
So we have an area where we can work.

56
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,770
So I'm just gonna left,

57
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:08,340
click and drag to move them down there More so so I can actually recall what the headings

58
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,650
are.

59
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,520
Now.

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm just going to give you a quick demo of radio buttons.

61
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,610
Go to the developer ribbon come to insert just as we did with the tick box.

62
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,700
But this time,

63
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,980
choose radio button or option button left,

64
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,080
click and click,

65
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,830
and I'm just gonna hit control and see control and the Lego.

66
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,590
You can see that we now have two option buttons.

67
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,190
I'm gonna click off and look what happens when they click the 1st 1 It fills in.

68
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,080
But look what happens when I click the 2nd 1 The 1st 1 is unchecked because option buttons

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,690
by their nature only lay you to select one option because it's an option now.

70
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,300
I could easily add another nine of these by copy paste,

71
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,890
copy paste,

72
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,700
copy paste.

73
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,490
But they all remain within the same group.

74
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,000
That is,

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,310
I cannot have three sets of three if I just have nine buttons on because all nine are

76
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:03,880
linked.

77
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,590
So if I ticked car,

78
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,350
I couldn't take anything in the second line or anything in the third line,

79
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,490
and if I kicked,

80
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,270
clicked greater than 2000 si se automatically.

81
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,440
I couldn't have any of the other eight options.

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,210
Now the way to get around this is to group them together.

83
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,640
So when do take control and left.

84
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,780
Click on delete Control Left,

85
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,090
click on Delete Mangan do is gonna come up to insert.

86
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,130
I'm gonna come to this option here,

87
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,910
which is group box form control.

88
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,260
And when a dragon box down here that I'm gonna come to inset add radio,

89
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,380
but just click just inside here control and say control and they control and V so I just

90
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,950
couple of a couple of times I'm gonna roughly move them to where I want them to bay.

91
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,200
So Obama won a second more or less will do the lining up short.

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,430
Like so here.

93
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm just going toe right Click edit text.

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,660
And I'm gonna type my computers really slow today.

95
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,240
Car here.

96
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:11,350
I'm going to right click and it text delete all the text that's in it and say motile bike.

97
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,450
I can't type in Texas saying that type and talk at the same time.

98
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,230
Right?

99
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,910
Click webs mis clicked,

100
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,980
right click and it text deleted all the text on a type cycle.

101
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,550
Okay,

102
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,680
I know what I'm gonna do.

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,730
I'm just gonna pause the video for a second.

104
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,430
I'm also going to make that box a little bit smaller now.

105
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,630
I have added those in.

106
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,170
I'm just gonna pause the recording for a section and add the other two groups of three and

107
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,870
I'll be back with you in just a second,

108
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,720
okay?

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,110
And we're back now,

110
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,630
I've just ended the three groups of three,

111
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,600
and I'm just going to click up all sort the alignment out in just a second.

112
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,410
But notice in the bottom group box,

113
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,710
I can click this one all.

114
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,350
This one,

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,520
all this one and the others and tick and the same with their second chip only click one at

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,010
a time.

117
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,280
So clear their car almost bike or cycle.

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,630
Now let's let's still with the alignment.

119
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,360
Now what I'm gonna do for a second,

120
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,260
I'm just gonna make sure that they all line up with these ones just here,

121
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,660
so at least we get them in the same kind of order.

122
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,760
So I was gonna movil these over here.

123
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:23,350
All I'm trying to do is make sure that this box is mawr left than any of these three.

124
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,900
That's probably awful English,

125
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,970
but I hope you know what I mean.

126
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,950
So I'm gonna hold down control.

127
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm gonna hold down car that I'm gonna click this one this one and this one,

128
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,560
and I'm going to come to shape format align.

129
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,450
Remember they aligned to the left?

130
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,730
Most item.

131
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,490
So that's why we selected made sure that the car was the furthest to the left and I'm going

132
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,740
to click control and motorbike and that is Mawr left in the middle.

133
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,690
Three and I will click the other three come back ups,

134
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,050
shape,

135
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,120
format and align Onda line left Boop on,

136
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,300
then the same with cycle,

137
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
so he's gonna click off.

138
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,110
Hold down control Click cycle.

139
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,980
Click that one.

140
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,540
Click that one click that one shape format.

141
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,390
Align a line left may go.

142
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,190
They will be in exactly the same position as as these ones were here.

143
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,530
Now we just need to align them all to the top.

144
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,880
So again it's going to go to the top most.

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,940
So I'm gonna select those shape,

146
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,450
format a line on the line top and not bring those together.

147
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,150
Click off.

148
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,510
Hold on control.

149
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,390
Click that one that one on that one and come to shape format.

150
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,770
Align onda alike top,

151
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,270
then click off.

152
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,820
Hold them control car,

153
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,030
though,

154
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,830
to make cycle and come to shape format.

155
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,460
Align Elaine Top now,

156
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,500
in order to move these all together,

157
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,430
what I want to do is group them or at least make 23 groups of three accounting mats.

158
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,230
So going to hold them control and click the group box.

159
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,270
And I'm gonna click car,

160
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,750
motorbike and cycle.

161
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,950
And I'm gonna come to shape format group on group and they go Now I have that one there.

162
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,980
Then only their left click off Click this box Hold down.

163
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,150
Control Petrol,

164
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,820
diesel LPG just left clicking Group group And then again,

165
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,490
click off Click Group box 45.

166
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,570
Hold and control click The next rate missed that 1123 So just left clicking Group on group

167
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,150
Now what we're gonna do now is we're just going to move them over to those other where we

168
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,260
move the other things from.

169
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,720
So I'm just going to click off,

170
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,260
click the first group on Defy Congrats.

171
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,970
It left click Will source at the final lining up shortly.

172
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,080
Probably do in the gym that up a little bit.

173
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,380
Eso group box one for one.

174
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,280
And I'm gonna line that up with that.

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,670
That actually looks pretty perfect the way it is,

176
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,250
I think,

177
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,010
and then finally this box.

178
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,870
Andi uh,

179
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,450
legit over a little bit,

180
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,050
I think.

181
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,790
Anyway,

182
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,760
you can You can do the finer points shortly.

183
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,570
So that's what it looks like?

184
00:07:59,570 --> 00:07:59,930
No,

185
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,830
unfortunately,

186
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:06,730
we have these awful lines around the glute group boxes and a little success group books one

187
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,820
for five group box,

188
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,520
but every list and all of the different group boxes,

189
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,090
so it actually looks pretty awful.

190
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,250
So what we're gonna do is we're just gonna left click each of these group boxes in turn

191
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,780
There's one and I'm gonna ungroomed them on.

192
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:28,190
This is gonna look really on inside a particularly if I can find them amongst all of these

193
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:28,190
.

194
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,350
So Group box got one at Andi on group.

195
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,580
I'm asking a levers to nudge these things around.

196
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,690
And hopefully I think I don't have court.

197
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,920
All three now,

198
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,390
obviously,

199
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:40,650
no,

200
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,870
I'll come back to that.

201
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,760
The point is that we have these awful boxes that look,

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,900
well,

203
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,420
awful,

204
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,990
really.

205
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,900
And then there is a bit of a work around to this on.

206
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,700
Didn't particularly want to delve into vb a this early,

207
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,780
but this is just one line of code,

208
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,280
so it will be fine.

209
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,690
Goes the developer Ribbon,

210
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,030
go to visual Basic Andi.

211
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,390
If you can't see something called the immediate window,

212
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,220
go to view and take immediate window and you'll get this here on.

213
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:20,250
What you want to do is type active sheet dr Group not check boxes,

214
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,000
group boxes not visible.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,390
I can't talk in type and I hit the inside.

216
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,420
I really can't talk in type.

217
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:32,770
Can I?

218
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,470
Active sheet active Just won a active sheet.

219
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't group boxes,

220
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,150
don't visible,

221
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,690
equals false and hit.

222
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,210
Enter.

223
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,770
Then when you come back to here,

224
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,710
um,

225
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,280
it's cause I'm missed that woman.

226
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
I did the grouping thing.

227
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,620
So shape format on group on group and then come back to the VB.

228
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,370
Just come to the end.

229
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,940
Active sheet dot group box is not visible,

230
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,270
equals false on hit enter and then you'll find that they have all disappeared.

231
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,150
And then we can happily just go and delete that and then close the VB.

232
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,200
So that's this far into visual basic for applications were going to get so far.

233
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Okay,

234
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,280
so now we have three groups off three and we can only select one of the options.

235
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,940
So that answers part.

236
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,170
One of the question obviously lined them up to make it look very pretty goes to the data

237
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:33,580
entry.

238
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,900
And this is what we're gonna do now we're gonna point to radio buttons instead of what we

239
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,190
were pointing to before.

240
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,650
So we actually I'm just going to click all three of those.

241
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,010
So I'm going to click the 1st 1 hold down Control,

242
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,880
click the 2nd 1 on the 3rd 1 Right click.

243
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,070
It's slightly off screen,

244
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,830
but the very bottom option is format object and drag.

245
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,990
Rallying to shop there.

246
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,890
Cell link on.

247
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,630
I'm just gonna go over here and point to radio buttons.

248
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,930
And that's the 1st 1 Enter and okay,

249
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,060
I'm going to repeat the process for the second and third set.

250
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,160
So hold down.

251
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,630
Control Petrol.

252
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,300
Diesel L P G right click.

253
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,900
Sorry about this is the bottom option format object,

254
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,130
cell link.

255
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,050
And here I'm gonna point to this one.

256
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,180
And here center on.

257
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:21,750
OK,

258
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,660
And click off and finally hold down control and click the engine sizes.

259
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,280
Right.

260
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,270
Click again.

261
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,350
My party is full metal object.

262
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,370
Drag up sell link on a point to the very bottom one.

263
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,550
Just here and enter on.

264
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,070
Okay.

265
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,780
So,

266
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,090
no,

267
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,060
When I click off.

268
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,150
If I click the first option here in the first option here in the first option here,

269
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,780
you can see in the data entry screen that we have radio buttons 111 Because this is radio

270
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,080
button one in this group,

271
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,860
this is radio button one in this group on this is radio button One in this group.

272
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,280
But if I clicked 12 on three and then came to the data entry screen,

273
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,280
you can see that we have 123 here.

274
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,810
The woman say here is equals.

275
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,350
If,

276
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,230
uh,

277
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,380
this equals car,

278
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,410
then return one comer.

279
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,450
If open brackets,

280
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,150
this equals motor or bike,

281
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,100
then two comma failing that three.

282
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,990
So if this equals car returned one if it equals motorbike,

283
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,700
return to if neither of those two a true return.

284
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,820
Three close brackets twice hit enter.

285
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,730
So he'll be an option one.

286
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,550
And we have an option one in here.

287
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,060
But here,

288
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,340
if we have option to this changes to number two.

289
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,730
And in an expensive,

290
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,820
expensive,

291
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,850
expensive sheet Motorbike kiss ticked.

292
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,740
Now again,

293
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,080
what we're going to do to save over right in these formulas,

294
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,400
we're gonna protect the sheet.

295
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,210
I'm gonna come to that in the next lecture of the lecture.

296
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,850
After that,

297
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,570
I'm just going to do exactly the same thing for petrol,

298
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,050
diesel,

299
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,350
LPG and exactly the same thing for these three options here.

300
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,160
Hopefully that's helped,

301
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,590
but is always if there are any questions,

302
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,450
I wouldn't delete that before you download it.

303
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,060
If there any questions do,

304
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,110
let me know and you can download this election is called Time Sheen Expenses,

305
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,630
Expenses Master with radio buttons.

306
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,230
OK,

307
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,660
I'll see you in the next lecture.
