00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Okay,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:02.700
guys,

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.420
we're almost at the end of this particular project,

4
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.330
and they're what we want to do is define a working area.

5
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:14.200
So we've We've done awful lot of work in our formulas over here and over here and over here

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.200
.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.910
Andi.

8
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.620
Ideally,

9
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.530
what we want to do is hide those from the view of the user,

10
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.660
because all we want them to see is this particular area just here.

11
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.470
So all we're gonna do is we're going to select column G Hold down,

12
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.290
shift control on,

13
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.080
right arrow,

14
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.650
go all the way across,

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.410
right.

16
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.430
Click and choose Hide and they go this there successfully hidden away.

17
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.370
And then we're going to scroll down to the bottom will probably leave a blank line.

18
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.840
I'm going to select that line.

19
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420
Hit control shift,

20
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.970
Andi Down Arrow.

21
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.010
And I'm going to right click Onda hide their So they go near the only working area.

22
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.910
The only wants visible to the user is this particular area here.

23
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.720
Now we're going to a little bit more tidying up,

24
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.470
so let's just come over to the time sheets.

25
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.350
I don't think we have any stray data there.

26
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.560
No.

27
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.620
So that's all good expenses.

28
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.510
We have these things that we've had it.

29
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.110
So let's cook that on groups.

30
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.580
Let's just delete those delete delete.

31
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.700
Andi.

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.010
Yeah,

33
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.850
that looks pretty good.

34
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.780
Okay,

35
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.430
So what we going to do in this lesson is we're gonna have a look at how we protect workbook

36
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.570
so that a user can actually,

37
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.900
either unhygienic play around with the formulas that you've worked so hard to create on,

38
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.370
basically break everything.

39
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.780
So the first thing that we need to do is select the value of particular cell and say

40
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.650
whether it is creditable or not creditable.

41
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.850
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna right click on our first data entry,

42
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.060
sell on.

43
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.820
We're going to choose format cells on what we're gonna do here.

44
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.110
Now,

45
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.380
we have a number of options in the format cells,

46
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.000
and the the one we're interested in is the last one that saves protection on what we're

47
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.660
gonna do is just untech the locked option there and click.

48
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.270
OK,

49
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.380
then we're just gonna move to whips these Let me just scroll down.

50
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.850
I'm just gonna select all of these areas that we want them to be able to edit.

51
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.970
And I'm just holding down the control buttons so I can select noncontiguous sets of data on

52
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.260
again.

53
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.290
I'm just going to right click choose format cells come to the protection tab on click the

54
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.740
Locked.

55
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.200
So it's unchecked.

56
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.140
Okay?

57
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.980
And they're What we want to do is go to the review tab just up here,

58
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.320
left click.

59
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.080
And you can see we have a variety of options in changes just here so we can protect sheets

60
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.850
or protect workbook or share What workbook?

61
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.920
What We're gonna do this?

62
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.360
We only want to protect the sheet.

63
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.260
Here at the moment is we're just going to click protect sheet on.

64
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.660
We can see that we get this box pop up here now,

65
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.950
if you want to password,

66
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:54.640
protect it,

67
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.330
go ahead.

68
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.360
But seriously,

69
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.790
hold Recommend writing down the password because it's really,

70
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.350
really difficult to recover this if you if you manage to forget it.

71
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.600
So what we want to do is protect worksheets and contents of locked cells,

72
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.360
which is everything that we didn't just change the format tab to say unlocked.

73
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.680
So what the hell out what the users will be allowed to use in this workbook there will be

74
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.550
allowed currently to select locked cells.

75
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.770
We don't want them to be able to do that.

76
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.580
We do want them to be able to select a locked cells,

77
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.220
which are all these areas in blue.

78
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.890
We don't want them to be able to format cells or format columns or any of these other

79
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.050
options in here.

80
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.920
So we're gonna do,

81
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.640
say hello users to select unlocked cells and click.

82
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.250
OK,

83
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.680
okay.

84
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.750
You can see because we were in this cell immediately.

85
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.090
Our curse has flipped over to this cell because it is the last cell or the first cell after

86
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.330
this,

87
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.160
so that the user can edit.

88
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.490
So if I hit the tab key,

89
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.930
you can see that now we've moved over to here when I hit the tab key again.

90
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.400
What it's gonna do is look for the entire rest of this line and see if there's another cell

91
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.290
that we can edit.

92
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.160
And there isn't because this is the next look sell.

93
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.210
So if we weaken tab and it will happily only allow the user to select the cells that we've

94
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.950
said that they can select.

95
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.770
Okay,

96
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.900
so now they can click this liking quickly.

97
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.160
Second,

98
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.660
click anywhere in the blue area on they can choose their things and change their answers,

99
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.100
but they're not going to be able to slight any of these cells or on hide any of these on

100
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.930
play with the formulas and break it.

101
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.890
So there you go.

102
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.800
That's how you protect your worksheet.

103
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.600
Okay.

104
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.850
See you in the next lecture.
