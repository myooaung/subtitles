00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
Okay,

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.530
So here's another question from Jonathan Now the question originally.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:16.120
Waas in column d We have three columns of data calls texts on day za and the throughs zero

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.860
value in all three columns,

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.200
then return a blank in column D.

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
And I'm sure we do have a blank somewhere down here.

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.790
Andi,

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.150
if there is a value in any of these cells,

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.140
then return the title that's displayed in road,

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.540
too.

11
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.660
So the question for this lecture is slightly different in the question is,

12
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.030
the first part is exactly the same.

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.320
So if all of the cells are blank than returned blank here,

14
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.330
But if any of these cells have text in them,

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.350
then return the heading in row two again.

16
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.990
But this time,

17
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.560
F two G two or H two.

18
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.840
So the first thing we're gonna do is we're going to just get some text in there randomly.

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.400
So I'm just going to show you how I'm going to build the formula for that.

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.560
So what do you say equals round between over brackets one on and two.

21
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.390
So that's going to give us sound set off between one on too.

22
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:18.110
So now what I'm gonna say is if open brackets round between one and two equals won't come

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.240
out.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.670
Some text close brackets failing.

25
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.800
Now I'm just going to say return a blank close.

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.030
Rockets hit.

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.460
Enter.

28
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.390
So they know we have blanks there.

29
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.310
I mean,

30
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.810
a copy that across on down a couple of 100 lines to match the other day,

31
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.130
sir.

32
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.330
Go control gun d se goes and there were randomly have text or no text.

33
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.460
I'm just going to copy that.

34
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.760
Pay special values.

35
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.060
Andi know we have a data set.

36
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.020
Okay,

37
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.180
Now,

38
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.720
because we're dealing with text robin values,

39
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.070
if we look over this formula here,

40
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300
you'll see the first part is a some.

41
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.980
Now we can't some because its text.

42
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.580
So what we need to do is combine the text using it can Katyn eight and check the length of

43
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.150
the concoct innate ID string.

44
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.870
So again,

45
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.990
we're gonna build in step.

46
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.570
So we're going to say equals cats in eight open brackets.

47
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.890
Can cabinet that comma with that calmer on drips that on enter Sago,

48
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.100
we can see we have a concurrent,

49
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.190
innate ID string here.

50
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.360
Just say some text on below because we have to some texts.

51
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.950
We'll have some text,

52
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.860
some text.

53
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.400
But what we actually want to do is find out the length of that string.

54
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.350
So we're gonna come back to the formula after the equals and before they can.

55
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.080
Katyn eight.

56
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.900
Just type l e m open rackets.

57
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.670
And the text is this Can Katyn ation string that we've just written come to their own

58
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.670
closer brackets his center.

59
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.060
So they go here,

60
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.770
we can see our combined length of Arkan.

61
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.100
Caffeinated string is 9 18 here,

62
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.480
nine here and he at because we have three blanks.

63
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.320
The King Captain ated length is zero there that we can do a test against.

64
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.830
So again,

65
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.800
we're gonna come up to this formula And we're going to say if the length of all this equals

66
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.660
zero,

67
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.400
that is,

68
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.470
there is no texting column f,

69
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.230
g or H comma return a blank,

70
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.200
double quotes,

71
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.230
comma.

72
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.540
And now this is our false statement.

73
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.500
For now,

74
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.560
we're going to say,

75
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.790
I'm gonna be careful here.

76
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.650
Some thing else.

77
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.910
Close quote close brackets.

78
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:35.420
Andi,

79
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.020
enter Vegas and no one we copy that groups when we copy that formula down by double

80
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.090
clicking here,

81
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.870
we have something else because we have text in at least one of these columns.

82
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.640
And here,

83
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640
when we have three blanks in a row,

84
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.220
it's returning just a blank return.

85
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.670
Okay,

86
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.100
there are two ways that we can do this next part of the formula.

87
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.980
So what we're going to do first is well,

88
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.020
do the length one.

89
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.510
So if we say equals,

90
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.800
if open brackets the length,

91
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.120
actually,

92
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.530
it's do this in piecemeal.

93
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.430
So that starts beginning we can say equals the Len,

94
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.750
which is short for length off this cell.

95
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.050
So they go.

96
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.110
So here we get nine on dull the way them get either 900 So now if we come in front of the

97
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:29.470
land and after the cause because A if the length off nine is equal or we can say is greater

98
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.590
than zero,

99
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.240
that is,

100
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.530
there is text in it comma,

101
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.430
then return value.

102
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.170
If true,

103
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.700
f two.

104
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.740
And we're gonna press F four on the keyboard to make that absolute f at absolute f absolute

105
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.320
to on a stick and ampersand in.

106
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.460
And we're gonna add a speck quote space quote and that's gonna make it nice and tidy when

107
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.250
we build the concatenation string.

108
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.390
Sorry,

109
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.040
comma and if it's false,

110
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.060
just returned blank.

111
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.950
Uh,

112
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.140
okay,

113
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.070
all we could do it in the opposite way by saying here we've tested.

114
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.110
See if the value is greater than zero.

115
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.040
We could also test the seafood is equals zero.

116
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.450
So again,

117
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.060
we're gonna build it.

118
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.470
Same way we're going to say equals the Len of this self close brackets on.

119
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.490
Just copy that down.

120
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.070
So we have a length of zero or no independent on if there is a value in here or not.

121
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.230
And then what we're going to say is,

122
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.340
if open brackets the length of G three is equal to zero,

123
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.000
that is,

124
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.500
it is blank return a blank double quotes,

125
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.160
comma failing that.

126
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.730
Return the value in G to press F four on the keyboard because we want that to be an

127
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.820
absolute value.

128
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.120
So that sound value if false.

129
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.980
So if the length of G three is equal to zero,

130
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.500
return a blank failing that return me the value in absolute G absolute too.

131
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.660
And again because this is the middle string.

132
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.550
What we can do is at an ampersand,

133
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.570
quotes,

134
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.980
space quotes,

135
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.160
and that will give us a space between this one and the last one on his enter.

136
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.090
So here we get nothing,

137
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.450
because there's nothing in there.

138
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.010
But we can copy that Down on they go.

139
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.030
If we have some text in here we can see were returned in the word texts from G to on one of

140
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.410
Hindus.

141
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.210
I'm just going to copy that formula.

142
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.980
Uh,

143
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.100
be on pace in their Andi.

144
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.570
Then we'll have all threes.

145
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.420
But instead of looking at G two,

146
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.160
we want to look at H two,

147
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.500
so I'm just contract those over on hit enter.

148
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.360
And we can also delete that space at the end because it's the last part of the string,

149
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.570
so we don't necessarily need a space after it.

150
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.460
So they go.

151
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.340
If we have some text in there,

152
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.560
we get calls.

153
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.110
If we have some text in there,

154
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.840
get text.

155
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.090
If we have some text in there,

156
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.350
we get data.

157
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.820
Now,

158
00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.060
all we need to do is build a can cast a nation that puts this this this together.

159
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.440
So what we're going to say equals corn.

160
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:11.680
Captain Nate Open Records that comma that comma on DWhite wouldn't think it's just copy

161
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.150
that them.

162
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.820
And now what we're gonna do?

163
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.180
Yep,

164
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.740
that looks all elicit.

165
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.100
Should.

166
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.040
What we're going to do is replace the J three with the formula from J three.

167
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.750
So this is the Cell J three.

168
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.870
So I'm going to cop every copy everything after the equals copy.

169
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.750
Just hit,

170
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.460
escape and tight.

171
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.390
That over J three.

172
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.130
So there's the first part of our formula there.

173
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.870
The next parties K three.

174
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.790
So I'm gonna come to K three and copied that formula.

175
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.160
Copy his escape.

176
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.560
CA move.

177
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.650
Ary pace.

178
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:54.030
That over K three on the last bit is l three that we can see just here.

179
00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:00.840
So I'm gonna come to l three and steal that bit of the formula and then paste that over

180
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.350
here.

181
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.670
So then when I copy that down,

182
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.990
we can see that we get the concatenation so we don't with the cells so we can delete those

183
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:18.490
now delete on their or we need to do is replace the false test that something else with

184
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.530
this formula.

185
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.900
So we're just gonna copy all of that formula all the way up so they can Katyn,

186
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.280
eight.

187
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.920
I'm gonna come to here and delete the false test,

188
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.650
which is the open quote.

189
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:31.910
Something else.

190
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:38.660
Close quotes paste in the concatenation formula that we just built his enter on.

191
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.290
There you go.

192
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.340
That formula works.

193
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:40.990
Exactly.

194
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.210
I'm gonna just going Delete column,

195
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:42.610
Jenkins,

196
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:42.890
Delete,

197
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.630
Delete On they go.

198
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.450
That formula works exactly the same as this one.

199
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.570
But instead of using numbers,

200
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.180
you can do with texts.

201
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.070
So I hope that answers your question.

202
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.570
Enjoy.

203
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.410
And as ever,

204
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.890
if you have any other ones just posting on the forum and I would be happy to answer them

205
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.240
for you have a great day.
