1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Okay,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:02,680
guys.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,070
In the last few sections,

4
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:10,510
we had a look at static named ranges and static name ranges of perfectly fine if your data

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,330
never expands or contracts now,

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,120
at the moment I've created a new named Range,

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,010
which is from a one through beasts five,

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,450
and called my table amusing that in this V look up just here.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,570
But the drawback with named range static name range is we can actually expand it

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,340
automatically.

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,050
So if we said we're going to start selling cabbages,

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,170
Onda cabbages are six p,

13
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,130
let's say but in the in here we talked cabbages and copied that sell down.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,110
You can see that we get an error reference because all of these cells are looking at the

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:57,350
hard coded a one through Be five on when we come to hear the data stops at a precut,

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,050
so never gets down as far as cabbages.

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:00,850
Okay,

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,470
so what we need to do is make this so it's dynamic on.

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,850
Whenever we had new items onto the bottom or we delete items from anywhere within the list

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,440
on named range,

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,110
which is this one automatically expands and contracts to match.

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,350
So let's just delete that for a second.

23
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,830
Okay?

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,810
Now what we're going to need to do in the dynamic named Range is understand how to other

25
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,990
functions in excel work.

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,120
And one of them we've looked at before,

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,120
which was the count A and the other one we haven't looked at yet,

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,090
which is the offset.

29
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,990
So let's just have a look at counts a again,

30
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,900
just so we can remember what it does.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,210
And we can see by the tall tip that can't a cancer the number of cells in a range that are

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,360
not empty.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,510
So what I'm gonna do is open the brackets and I'm just going to drag over this highlighted

34
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,190
area.

35
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,430
Now it means nothing that this highlighted.

36
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,030
This is just because that's where I'm dropping the d lookups.

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,280
I'm gonna close the brackets and hit enter so you can see when I hit Enter that are result

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,050
is five on the reason that it's fine.

39
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,310
Let me just center that the reason that it's five even though we've highlighted the entire

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:09,950
range,

41
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,150
is we have 12345 cells with the value in them on two blanks.

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,960
So the correct answer is five.

43
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,320
OK,

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,960
so that's count A.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,000
The next one we're going to look at is offset on.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,630
What offset requires is a reference,

47
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,210
which is a start point.

48
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,640
So I'm just going to click here on day.

49
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,610
I'm going to say Comma on Rose.

50
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,300
I'm going to say zero because I don't want to move any rose from my reference point,

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,010
My start,

52
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,630
point comma and zero again because I don't want to move any columns away from my reference

53
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,630
.

54
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,670
My start point.

55
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,360
And I'm gonna closer brackets and hit Enter.

56
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,320
So they go.

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,620
No,

58
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,150
we get the concept one because offset from G six No rose,

59
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,250
no columns.

60
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,110
Is this value just here?

61
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,500
So it returns one.

62
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,150
But if we were to say Rose one,

63
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,980
you can probably guess what matters.

64
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,350
It will start a g six and then move down one row and still zero columns.

65
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:21,170
So now we'll return the value A and similarly vote to change the column reference from 0 to

66
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,760
2

67
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,860
We have started a G six.

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,640
We have moved down one row on.

69
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,850
We have moved to columns across.

70
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,220
So when they hit enter,

71
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,850
we get the answer,

72
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,550
See?

73
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,270
Okay.

74
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:39,150
Now what we're gonna do is combine those into our formula to create a dynamic named range

75
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,890
bouquet.

76
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,240
So static ranges you can pick from the name box just up here,

77
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:51,640
but not so with dynamic named Range is what you have to do is come to formulas onto name

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,760
manager and then click in.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,290
Let me just really What it means is that string that down of it.

80
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,260
What we need to do is to click in here here to be able to see the dynamic named range area

81
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,450
on what we're gonna do because we already have this entity is we're going to use that as

82
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,660
our start point.

83
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,560
Now when you build a dynamic named range that are five arguments.

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,230
Justus,

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,420
with the offset,

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,890
our first argument is going to be the reference point.

87
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,500
Where do we want to start?

88
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,030
Our range from the next argument is Rose on The next argument is columns just like it was

89
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,700
when we looked at it a second ago.

90
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,390
Now the last two arguments are Hemley Rose,

91
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,180
Do I want to go down on Hamli columns?

92
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,850
Do I want to go across?

93
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,330
So let's build that.

94
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,230
So what we're gonna do is click it after the equals and type offset open brackets.

95
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,750
We always want to start a absolute a one,

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,440
because that's where our data start.

97
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
So we can delete the rest of that common Nu Ruz coming.

98
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,610
No columns.

99
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,310
Because we always wanna have our data starting that absolute a want or at least in this

100
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:03,870
instance,

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,690
Comer.

102
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,910
And now we're going to incorporate that count a function for the road argument.

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,140
So we're going to say,

104
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,800
can't a open rackets.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,060
And we're gonna quick the whole of column A which is going to say,

106
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,020
without titles,

107
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,060
exclamation point.

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,300
Because that's the name of the sheet.

109
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,600
Absolute Aito Absolute a close the brackets.

110
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,170
And for now,

111
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,960
what we're gonna do is we're going to say,

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,230
one column close the brackets hit,

113
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,540
enter on their.

114
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,660
When I click on this,

115
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,340
you can see that it is no expanded to include cabbages.

116
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,380
So I'm just close that for one second,

117
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,500
and now we're gonna say,

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,250
uh,

119
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,100
that's a strawberries.

120
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,570
Let's go back into it.

121
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:49,920
Remember,

122
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,580
you can't pick a dynamic name range from the name box,

123
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,380
so backups and name manager clicking here,

124
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,750
and you can see that it's now expanded to capture strawberries as well because the count.

125
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,600
A in column A has increased one because we've added strawberries in.

126
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,390
Okay,

127
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,180
so let's set with just close that let me just delete strobes for a second.

128
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,070
Now,

129
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,880
what we've done so far is we've expanded this according to the number of non blank cells in

130
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,300
Column A But what we're going to do now,

131
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,960
we've said hard coded.

132
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,870
It's only one column wide.

133
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,160
What we gonna do now is say it's going to be two columns wide on that will then incorporate

134
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,020
this second column to So when they hit,

135
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,660
enter and click in here.

136
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,600
You can see that that is now our full named range.

137
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,020
Somebody hit close all of their formulas work again.

138
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,760
And now if I buy cabbages and copy that formula down,

139
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,910
you can see that it's pull in six from the second column of there were no dynamic named

140
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,550
range.

141
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,150
Okay,

142
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,320
so just for completeness,

143
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,290
what I'm gonna do is I'm also going to show you what to do if you need to expand your data

144
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,160
this way.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,100
So you add 1/3 column into into your data set name manager picked the range that you want

146
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,800
to change.

147
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,830
Click in your formula on instead of hard code in number to hear.

148
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,590
What you would do is you would just repeat the count a function.

149
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:25,930
So can't a I want to count the number of non blank cells in row one because that will tell

150
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,390
me how many columns I have data in.

151
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,910
I'm gonna hit Enter groups.

152
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,250
I think I'm Mr Brackett.

153
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,450
Okay.

154
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,120
On Ben.

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,180
Close brackets hit.

156
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,710
Enter.

157
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,530
So,

158
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:37,740
no.

159
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,580
When I move this out the way and clicking here,

160
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,540
you can see that this is still our data table.

161
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,980
But if I had some more data in here,

162
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,170
let's just add something else in and then go back to name and jet and clicking here again.

163
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,760
You can see this automatically expanded to capture the data in our new column.

164
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,690
Okay.

165
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,740
In the next election,

166
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,370
we're gonna have a look at what to do If you have totals in your data.

167
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll see you in the next lecture.
