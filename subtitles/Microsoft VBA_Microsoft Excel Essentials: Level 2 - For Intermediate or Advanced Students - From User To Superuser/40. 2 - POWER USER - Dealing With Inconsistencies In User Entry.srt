1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
OK,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:02,850
guys.

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,320
Now here's another problem that you may come across now created this standalone Excel file

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,730
just to demonstrate this.

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,490
And it's called catching various inconsistencies in user entry.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,230
Now,

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,740
in the HR database that we've created so far in the look up section.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,430
Other than the car Reg in the first few databases we used a limit to list.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,520
So that way the user could only pick something that's in the less than there's absolutely

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,250
no way for them to typing in incorrectly.

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,000
Now,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,170
one of Delhi's of butchers,

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,280
some of that data and dropped in here and in here.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,710
I've put the car registration first.

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:47,060
This is just a cut down version of that list on what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,970
hit control and h hit space,

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,870
and I'm going to replace the space with absolutely nothing.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,030
So I'm just gonna hit replace all we've known made 10 replacements.

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,520
Okay,

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:05,210
so what we have is a database with car registration with no spaces whatsoever between the

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,610
letters and the numbers.

22
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,230
So the problem is one.

23
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,510
If when you have a user entering a car registration number,

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,510
they accidentally interest space because maybe they say the two lessons,

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,310
the two numbers,

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,290
then a space,

27
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,390
then the West,

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,080
three letters.

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,750
Maybe they even put a space between Absolutely everything will look elite.

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,470
There's a clever way of dealing with that.

31
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,520
So let's have a look at that now.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,180
So here's the value I'm gonna be looking up from,

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,280
so I'm just going to color that in so we know what it ISS on.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,820
I'm just gonna for now,

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,380
I'm just gonna copy that value and paste over there.

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,350
So we do have something to look up.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,470
So this is the value we're looking up,

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,340
and we're gonna do these columns exactly as they are in the V.

39
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,760
Look up.

40
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,950
So let's just write a simple V look at first equals V.

41
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,450
Look up.

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,400
Open brackets.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,970
We are looking there.

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,170
Now,

45
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,180
we're going to drink this formula across,

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,560
so I'm gonna absolute cell reference that by hitting f four so no,

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,360
no matter where we drank this cell,

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
down or across,

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,430
it's always gonna look at that cell.

50
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,050
Okay,

51
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:12,830
so there's our look up value comma data table will be this and you'll remember envy,

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,030
Lookups that what you're looking up has to be in the first column of your data Sable.

53
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:27,100
So I'm highlighting column a four down a 13 Onda away across to I 13.

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,540
Okay,

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,010
so there's our table array.

56
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,580
I'm gonna hit therefore,

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,150
because again,

58
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,600
I don't want that table to move.

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,250
When I drank the formula coming,

60
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm gonna look a column index took some.

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,640
Wanna pull the employee number here?

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,900
Comer.

63
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,800
I want an exact match.

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,100
So false.

65
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,540
Fantastic.

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,510
Now I'm just gonna drag that away over control,

67
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,890
And,

68
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,800
uh and I just need to change the color numbers.

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,580
So we have column number two and Colin,

70
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,600
number three.

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,880
Now,

72
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,210
just pause this for a second,

73
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,350
and I'll come back to you when these rolled down.

74
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,850
Okay,

75
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,420
hold on.

76
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:11,780
So now we're looking up zed I 09 g s s and were successfully pulling from column to here

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,060
Column three here on the same all the way across.

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,710
So we pull in all of this data set over,

79
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:24,890
but one if when the user enters this state at what they actually type is zed I zero known

80
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,230
space G s s where you can see that we get a bunch of letters because we're looking for an

81
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,620
exact match.

82
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,890
Zed I 09 space G s s does not appear in this list.

83
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,370
So therefore an exact match can be found.

84
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,850
So all of our formulas era.

85
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,660
Okay,

86
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:44,810
Now,

87
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,550
there's a very simple way of getting rid of this problem.

88
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,340
So what we're gonna do is modify our look at value,

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,190
which is this one here to remove the spaces.

90
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,620
So what we're gonna need to do for that is fine.

91
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:57,820
Now,

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,370
look at value in our formula.

93
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,070
Just here.

94
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,500
And just for a second we're going to enclose that in another set of brackets,

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,530
their fate ends,

96
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,890
or it won't affect the former in the slightest.

97
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,120
So if I deleted the space out of there,

98
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,320
just bracketing off that part of the formula won't stop it working.

99
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,050
So everything is still good.

100
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,170
So what do you just put my space back in?

101
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,390
So now we have bracketed off this particular formula.

102
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,280
Now what we want to do is remove all of the spaces in there.

103
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:35,060
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna type substitute open brackets and you can see in the

104
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,310
substitute that the first thing is looking for Is the text on that?

105
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,470
Is this particular cell here,

106
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,330
this one because that's where our text lives.

107
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,670
So we're happy that that's what it's going to substitute.

108
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,250
We're going to hit comma,

109
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,460
and they're what we want to tell it is what old text do we want to look for to substitute.

110
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,770
So we're gonna hit quotes,

111
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,570
space quotes,

112
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,190
because it's the space that we want to get rid off.

113
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,650
We're going to hit comma.

114
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,510
And now it wants to know what is the new text that you want in place of the old text.

115
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,320
So what do you want to substitute the old text with on?

116
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,470
We're just gonna hit a double quotes.

117
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,730
So now we've said effectively in this substitute.

118
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,400
Look at this cell here.

119
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,230
Absolute a 15 on find any spaces and replace it with no spaces.

120
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,150
Now all I'm going to do now is close off the brackets.

121
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,040
Hey,

122
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,560
center.

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,970
And there you go.

124
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,680
You can no see that this value is successfully looking up Number seven here,

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,900
even though the actual value in the look up table says and I 09 g s s and we're actually

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,610
looking up the same thing with space.

127
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,950
So even if we deleted the space.

128
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,160
This look up still works,

129
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,470
and even if the user happens to a groups happens to enter sent space.

130
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,090
Always space zero space night.

131
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,700
Any combination of spaces there will still be stripped out on this look up will still work

132
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,450
perfectly.

133
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,320
So that's one quick way to adapt any user interest to remove spaces.

134
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,440
And it doesn't have to be spaces.

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,570
If,

136
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,580
for argument's sake,

137
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,080
let's just removal spaces in there.

138
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,600
Let's imagine that the user has a habit of entering a dash.

139
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,010
So if the use rented zed I zero nine dash g s s and entered,

140
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,950
that would fail.

141
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,510
But all we need to do is modify this substitute instead of looking for a space,

142
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,870
look for a dash.

143
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,020
On they go.

144
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,680
You can see that that formula still works perfectly.

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,200
Now I'm just gonna put that back two spaces for a second on Delete that and leave space in

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,460
again.

147
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,350
Now,

148
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,130
the quick way to modify all these formulas so they look at exactly the same thing is to

149
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,540
copy the part of the formula you want to work on replace the part of the formula that

150
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,170
doesn't work.

151
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,360
So in these formulas that everything we can see that we have a look up off just that value

152
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,750
there.

153
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,560
So what we're gonna do is copied the bit That does work,

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,500
which is groups not quite there.

155
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,450
Everything from the substitute,

156
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,440
they're So this is the part.

157
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,580
The formula does work.

158
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,950
I'm just gonna hit control and see to copy That hits escape.

159
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,980
Now,

160
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,730
I'm gonna just going to highlight all of this line hit control and H which is find and

161
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,440
replace,

162
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,360
which we use a little earlier to remove the spaces out.

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,580
Controlling V Sorry,

164
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,970
Control and V,

165
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,070
that is what we want to replace it with.

166
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,970
And what we want to replace is just the A 15 but the absolute a 15.

167
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,770
So we want to look across all of these like all of these formulas in this row on replace

168
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,810
absolute a absolute 15 with this new modified entry here.

169
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,950
So replace all.

170
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,390
Hold on a replacements.

171
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,060
Okay,

172
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,100
so now this look up successfully works across the whole of the road.

173
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,020
And now just a test that it will let we'll just use this cell here.

174
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,980
So we typed.

175
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,950
Why G 53 space F r j.

176
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,900
You can see that That still works perfectly.

177
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,800
