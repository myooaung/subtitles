1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,510
Okay,

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,300
let's get started now.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,090
Recovered in level one of this course that one of the most important things that you

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,420
conduce whenever you begin a new project is the first thing you should do is always rename

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,050
your worksheet to something more meaningful.

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,600
And you can see here that I'll rename this worksheet to time sheet and expenses,

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,220
Master,

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,430
because that's the name of the project that we're gonna be working on now before you spend

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:33,560
hours creating a masterpiece and excel with lots of fancy formatting and tons and tons of

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,670
data and formulas is proven at the concept that you're trying to achieve on the concept in

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,300
this project is very simple.

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,480
What we want to see is can we create a simple data entry screen where we can get a user to

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,150
enter the band minimum amount of data and take that data and have it populate multiple

14
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:56,840
reports elsewhere in the workbook without having to duplicate all of the work?

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,340
OK,

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,510
so we're going to do that very quickly now just so I can see where I'm working.

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,860
I'm just gonna highlight these cells so I can see where I'm going to drop the formulas we

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,060
can change it again later.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,160
But this is just so we can see where I'm working.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,340
So have just selected cell C one.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,850
I'm gonna hear equal Satele IQ.

22
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,920
So it's a formula.

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,120
Move over to a one and his enter on.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,440
We can see there in the formula Bar that we've now got a formula that say's I am reference

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,840
in cell A one.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,700
Okay,

27
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,150
so far,

28
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,690
so good.

29
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,170
I'm just going to copy that down seven lines.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,350
So now I am referencing on this cell,

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,270
sell a one in this cell cell a two and so on and so forth.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,900
So no.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,510
When I populate some data into here,

34
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,030
hopefully and it does,

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,380
it populates automatically over here.

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,360
So I'm just going to use a drag handle and use the auto fill sequence so we can see Yeah,

37
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,920
that concept's pretty much proven their weaken type something in here and have it

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,190
automatically populate over here without having to enter it again.

39
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,830
So far,

40
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,510
so good.

41
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,200
Okay,

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,980
the next thing we wanna have a look at is,

43
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,710
can we do the same in the same she in a different sheet.

44
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,000
So what I'm gonna do is add a new sheet to this workbook by clicking the little plus down

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,450
here.

46
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,440
And that's created sheet three.

47
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,240
That's unusual.

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,610
Let me just zoom in so we can see that nice and big older.

49
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,410
Now,

50
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,190
if you want to be able to see two sheets in the same workbook at the same time,

51
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,260
that's entirely possible in Excel.

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,550
All you're going to do is you're going to come up to the view ribbon just up here.

53
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,350
You're gonna hit view to change from the view ribbon and then you're gonna hit new window.

54
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,720
Now what you can see here,

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,970
let me just zoom in again.

56
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,120
We can see here is sheet one on behind sheet one.

57
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,610
We can see the same workbook again.

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,110
Now what we're gonna have to do is we're going to come back to the view menu and we're

59
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,170
going to hit view side by side on.

60
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,030
When we do that,

61
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,360
we can see that in this sheets on the left hand side,

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,590
Review and sheet one and so far in the right hand side were also viewing sheet one.

63
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,690
But what we can do,

64
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,910
She's click sheet three and there we have two views of the same workbook,

65
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,210
so I'm just gonna do exactly the same thing again.

66
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,360
But I'm going to do it in B this time.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm just gonna hit the home button high like that so I can see where I'm working on.

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,390
I'm gonna hit,

69
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,140
equals.

70
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,000
And this time I'm gonna flip over to the left hand screen and click a one on they go.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,690
We can see that we now have Monday.

72
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,390
Just copy the formula down.

73
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,410
So whenever I type in here.

74
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,250
So if I say apples,

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,730
Godspell Apple's still can't spell apples,

76
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,020
apples and he sent it.

77
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,560
We can see that it's being updated here in this this array on the first sheet,

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,330
we can also see that's been changed over here on sheet three.

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,010
Okay,

80
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,950
let the only thing to notice here is with the formulas.

81
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,410
If we're working in the same sheet on,

82
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,430
we looked at the formula.

83
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,350
We can see it say's equals a one,

84
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,350
and that's because it's reference in a one on the same sheet.

85
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,440
If we had a look over here,

86
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,820
we can see that the formula has changed.

87
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,800
It no say's equals sheet.

88
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,260
One exclamation point a one on.

89
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,360
That's because the way Excel tells which sell a sheet is on.

90
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,760
If it's on the same sheet,

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,820
it doesn't have anything.

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,280
It just references the cell.

93
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,060
So a one over here.

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,630
But here it says you need to look in the same workbook we were looking for.

95
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,180
A different sheet on that sheet is called sheet one.

96
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,650
So they go sheet.

97
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,650
One exclamation point.

98
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,540
A one means look at cell a one on the sheet called sheet one.

99
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,280
Okay,

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,530
so they go near.

101
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,150
The concept has proved we can get on with building our data entry screen.

102
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,750
So you in the next lecture.
