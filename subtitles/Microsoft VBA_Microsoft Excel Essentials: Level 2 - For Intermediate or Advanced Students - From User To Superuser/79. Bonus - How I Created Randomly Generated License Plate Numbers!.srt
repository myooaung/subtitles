1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
Okay,

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,080
guys,

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,480
welcome to this lecture.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,780
No,

5
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,690
just for fun.

6
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,610
I'm going to show you how I generated all the car registrations that we used way back in

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,690
section two.

8
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,460
Okay,

9
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,180
Now what we're gonna do is combine a lot of the elements that we've already covered in this

10
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,220
course on.

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,820
We're also going to introduce a new one which is rammed between.

12
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,030
So the first thing we're going to do is build a look up table of all the letters of the

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,750
alphabet.

14
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,230
So down here,

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,250
I'm just gonna add the numbers one through 26.

16
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,250
Where are we?

17
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,460
One through 26.

18
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,710
And next to that,

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,590
I'm going to add the letters in caps A B,

20
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,100
C all the way down.

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,050
And I'll come back to you in just a second when I filled all those in.

22
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,210
Okay,

23
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,110
so now we have all of our letters of the alphabet down here.

24
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,770
So what?

25
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,560
Windows just highlight over that,

26
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,410
and I'm gonna add this as a named range,

27
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,750
so I'm just going to call this letters.

28
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,700
Hit,

29
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,150
enter.

30
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,040
So there's our first data rate.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,890
I think of the cups.

32
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,250
Look on.

33
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,060
That looks a little bit on attractive.

34
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:06,620
That they get.

35
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,320
Okay,

36
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,100
the next thing we're going to do is have a look up table for the first numeric in there.

37
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,910
Never contact.

38
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,290
Remember,

39
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,950
have these look in the real world.

40
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,110
So I'm just gonna put 123 in here on.

41
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,700
I think we have zero.

42
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,860
I think we have five,

43
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,490
and I think we have six on.

44
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,320
Then I'm just gonna change that to a data table by clicking in here.

45
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,230
See if I've got the caps lock on.

46
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,630
Not now on.

47
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,610
Call that numbers.

48
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,460
Okay,

49
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,420
so then we have our two data tables.

50
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,790
We have our letters and their numbers for the first digit.

51
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,410
Now,

52
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:46,570
what we're going to do over these cells is just create a random entry from this column or

53
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,490
from this column.

54
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,190
So let's start building here.

55
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,930
So here,

56
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,990
we're going to say,

57
00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:00,420
equals rand between open rackets on their bottom number is going to be number one,

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,060
because we're going to be looking at the alphabet on our top member is going to be 26 close

59
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,390
brackets and his center.

60
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,950
So now you can see that we have 18 entered in here.

61
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,570
Now,

62
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,820
what we're gonna do is take that 18 and use that as a look of value from this data table

63
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,500
over here.

64
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,530
So just before round between,

65
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,070
I want site,

66
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,750
they look up.

67
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,010
This is gonna be outlook of value.

68
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,300
The 18 just coma.

69
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,230
And when I wanna look at is the lettuce table comma.

70
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,070
I won't read from column two,

71
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,580
which is where the letter lives come up on type,

72
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,010
false and hit.

73
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,450
Enter.

74
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,610
So they go.

75
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,810
We now have our first letter,

76
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,480
which is going to be f.

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,730
So what I'm gonna do is strength that down that far.

78
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's say we eventually we're going to get down 200 lines there.

79
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,000
All we need to do is just basically that Let's go down 200 lines.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,410
So down,

81
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:58,670
down,

82
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,850
down them in there in a way to 200 because we have 200 employees control in deep.

83
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,850
So you go.

84
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,860
We now have 200 randomly generated letters.

85
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,350
That's the first letter of our member plate in the U.

86
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,850
K.

87
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,550
We have two letters at the start,

88
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,040
so I'm just gonna copy that across they go.

89
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
So there's our two letters.

90
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,540
The next thing we have is one of these numbers here.

91
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,100
I think,

92
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,000
if that's not correct,

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,030
you just put the right numbers in s.

94
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:35,320
So what we're gonna do very similar we're going to say equals Rand between open rackets on

95
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,500
this.

96
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,920
So I'm gonna have the lowest number as one of the highest numbers.

97
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,360
Three.

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,300
So it's going to be round between one comma three Andi enter.

99
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,230
So they go.

100
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,010
So now all we need to do is exactly the same V look up over here.

101
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,590
So the looker open rackets skip over this because this is going to be,

102
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:54,850
ah,

103
00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:04,370
look up value comma numbers comer to because we want to pull from the second column comma

104
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,360
false and close brackets on.

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,650
I'm just going to copy that all the way down by double clicking the drag handle,

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,390
they go.

107
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,450
We have a random assortment of either zeros,

108
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,990
sixes or fives in line with this table here again in the next columns.

109
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,480
A little bit more simple,

110
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,340
because this is just literally a random number between zero and nine.

111
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,370
So what we're gonna do,

112
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,610
say,

113
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:36,810
equals round between from rockets zero on day nine close brackets.

114
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,840
So they go.

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,220
So now you can see there are a number plate is starting to take effect.

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,600
So we have three letters,

117
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,910
groups,

118
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,660
two letters,

119
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,030
two numbers.

120
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,760
And then the next thing we have are the three letters that appear at the answer.

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm just gonna copy that control and see pay sitting there,

122
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,380
fill it across using control in our control and our highlight All of those three on Ben

123
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,230
Just double click that and that fills it.

124
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,700
Dancer,

125
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,120
No,

126
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,650
Across these columns with successfully randomly built a full UK car registration plate,

127
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,440
a case.

128
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,330
And next thing we're gonna do is join them together.

129
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,720
We've done this before with can Katyn Eights.

130
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,400
So we're gonna say equals Kong Cut where my and eight open brackets that I'm just gonna

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,270
point to these this one comma,

132
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,460
this one comer,

133
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,070
this one comer,

134
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:36,280
this one comma then we normally have a space in the UK space enclosed in quotes,

135
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,550
comma And then my last three less is this one comer.

136
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,510
This one comma this one and closed brackets.

137
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,800
So they go,

138
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,550
There's our first randomly created registration plate.

139
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,330
That woman do.

140
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,300
It's just copy that down 200 lines.

141
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,360
Well,

142
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
control and D.

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,190
Now,

144
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,160
to make sure that this is a unique value that is,

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,070
This registration only appears once we can adapt this formula to make it horrendously

146
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,370
complicated or what I normally do with these kind of things is I just cheat.

147
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,290
So I use the formula equals counts.

148
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,940
If what we're going to say is,

149
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,690
have a look at this range here.

150
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,320
This is our range in the count.

151
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,050
If his f four because we always want to use that ranges from when we drank the formula down

152
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,050
,

153
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,170
comma on gonna look at that value.

154
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:34,720
So what is going to do is find the count of that value in that range.

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,860
I'm closed rackets and his center and you can see is each time I hit enter that the numbers

156
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:48,120
change and they re calculate so double quick that and what we hope to see is a one against

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,830
absolutely every cell in here.

158
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,530
They're rather scroll down all the way to the bottom because we've already got this

159
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,390
highlighted.

160
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,070
We can just see down here that this sum is 200 which is exactly what we want.

161
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,850
200 unique individual UK license plate numbers.

162
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,630
Okay.

163
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,400
And that's how I generated those for use in our database section.

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,960
Okay,

165
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,040
So you in the next lecture
