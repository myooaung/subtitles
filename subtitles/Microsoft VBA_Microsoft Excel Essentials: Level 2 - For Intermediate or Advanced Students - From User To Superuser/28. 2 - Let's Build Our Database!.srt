1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Okay,

2
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:02,810
guys,

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,230
we're gonna add in our V Look up formulas.

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,750
Andi,

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,940
we're gonna tidy this up a little later on,

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,560
so we'll have these things appear in somewhere else.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,350
But for now,

8
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,050
let's just build our first formula.

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,600
So we're going to say equals V.

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,230
Look up because we're doing the V.

11
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:18,530
Look up.

12
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,290
Function open brackets.

13
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,430
Now the look of value is this one here that they're just selected from the drop down list.

14
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:25,950
Now,

15
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,370
at the moment you can see that that saves be.

16
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,830
For now,

17
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,440
what we want to do is just drag this formula down that have it always reference before.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,230
So I'm just gonna make that an absolute cell reference by hitting f for once.

19
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,750
And you can see that we get the dollar sign before the be on the dollar sign before the

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,100
four on that.

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,300
No.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,510
Means it's an absolute reference on no matter where we drag this particular formula,

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,640
it's always gonna look at that cell.

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay,

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,070
so,

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,020
comma table array.

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,240
Now,

28
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,900
that's our HR file.

29
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,590
Andi,

30
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,750
this time what I'm gonna do You want to come right up to the top?

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,500
Hold down shift,

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,260
hold down,

33
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,270
control and go all the way to the bottom.

34
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,270
Let me just stir scroll so you can see that.

35
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,950
So shift control and down on all the way over to the end off our data.

36
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,180
So that's our table array.

37
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,790
And again,

38
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,740
I'm gonna hit f four cause we don't want this to move down as we drank the formula.

39
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:32,410
So I'm just gonna hit f four to make it absolute a absolute one to absolute a h absolute

40
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,950
201 among in a hit comma.

41
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,200
And then the 1st 1 we want to read from is the second column over.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,650
So here's our index and this will be the second column.

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,260
So I was gonna hit to comment on I want an exact match,

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,340
so I'm gonna type false on closer brackets and hit Enter.

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,400
So there you go.

46
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,670
We can see that in m N C dash blue triple.

47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:56,830
Ooh,

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,680
too is hurry.

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,410
In fact,

50
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,460
what we're gonna do,

51
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,090
let me just go back to data validation there on.

52
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,030
I'm gonna shift that box so it doesn't appear so.

53
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,310
Date of elevation show input when cell is selected.

54
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,150
No.

55
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,550
Okay,

56
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,490
right.

57
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,230
Just because that's getting in the way of that at the moment now because of absolute

58
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,560
referenced this cell and of absolute referenced this entire table.

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,390
I can happily just drank that all the way down on it will copy that formula.

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,160
Exactly.

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
But you'll notice that even down here,

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,190
it's still reference in absolute be absolute for so because we copied these in exactly the

63
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,580
same order as they appeared across here.

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,370
We know that these air in the natural order So we have column 1234 and so on.

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,730
So this one say's comer to cause it's pulling from column two.

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,380
So we're just gonna change that.

67
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,680
123 We're going to change the next 1 to 4 on.

68
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,810
This is just straightforward,

69
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,100
countin so nice and easy to do.

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,160
I hope you don't make a mistake now.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,880
Five.

72
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,290
Andi six.

73
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,050
Andi seven.

74
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,750
Andi,

75
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,080
where my eight There.

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,120
Okay,

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,650
eight.

78
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,770
Now we can see that we've got these numbers appeared and you'll remember from the first

79
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,200
section that we just have to change the date format.

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,010
So back up to home,

81
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,130
back up to number formats and lets you short date.

82
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,830
Let's just resize those.

83
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,850
Let's have them all aligned over to the left.

84
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,790
Okay,

85
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,370
So they go.

86
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,850
We now have a simple V look up and we can choose anything in here,

87
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,850
and we can see that it's pulling from column to column three common for come 567 and eight

88
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:47,850
.

89
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,420
So,

90
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,500
whichever one the user chooses,

91
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
let's come down.

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,910
Number 90 is Milly Johnson.

93
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,220
Four Main Millie Johnson National Insurance number.

94
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,220
She's female.

95
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,430
That's the date of birth.

96
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,590
And that's when she started without company.

97
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,420
Now what we're gonna do is move all of this,

98
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,810
so I'm just gonna highlight all of it and click on the dark box or the dark line at the top

99
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,420
left,

100
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,130
click and just move it over here for a minute on.

101
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,960
Then we're going to move the monitor time.

102
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,750
So I'm just highlighting the first name,

103
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,960
which is the title on the formula by left Clicking and Dragon on.

104
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,080
We're gonna have that come here ongoing do the same with last name,

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,750
and I'm going to drop that in here.

106
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,250
So I'm just selecting the two sells the one with the title and the one with the formula

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,180
left,

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,970
click and drag over on.

109
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,410
Then I'm gonna left groups.

110
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,550
Now we're gonna left click on the dark line around it on.

111
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,540
Drop it in there on.

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,130
Then the national insurance number will have over here.

113
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,380
Onda,

114
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,030
the Sanks we will have over here on.

115
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:59,720
We'll have the date of birth of he have have that there on the start date with company over

116
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,210
here,

117
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,990
I'm just gonna highlight all of that double click on they go.

118
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,770
It's automatically formatted.

119
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,560
So if we want to set a background for that,

120
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,700
we could just highlight.

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,050
Actually,

122
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,870
we don't need to highlight that much don't like,

123
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,580
so let's highlight all of that.

124
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,450
Make it a nice That's an awful killer.

125
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,560
Let's make it that color and then we'll change that cell two,

126
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,910
White said.

127
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,730
The user can see that that's wedding in the enter on.

128
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,600
We can move that,

129
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,410
and it's now going to change all of their entries,

130
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,780
depending on what the user picks out of here.

131
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,360
So they go.

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,480
That's a simple data entry screen or simple database.

133
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,780
Now we can hide all of these columns and hide all of these rows,

134
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,120
as we did in the last section.

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,180
So all the user sees is this particular section here,

136
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,800
those calling him awfully.

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:58,180
So let's just change that font color of those two black on those and those.

138
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,610
So they go.

139
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,620
We have a simple database.

140
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,000
In the next lecture,

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,140
we're gonna have a look at how to make it a little bit more powerful,

142
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,600
for which we're going to need more data.

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Okay,

144
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,450
See you in the next lecture.
