00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Okay,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:02.660
guys.

3
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.500
In the last lecture,

4
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.080
we had a look at using the road labels to name these particular ranges just here.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.880
But what would they do this time is highlight this entire range.

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.950
We're gonna be in the formulas tab we're gonna choose,

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.630
create from selection on.

8
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.330
We're going to choose Top Row,

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.020
which is automatically being takes.

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.660
Andi left column.

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.070
Actually,

12
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.900
before we do that,

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.850
what we do need to do is change the title of that too.

14
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.370
Perhaps.

15
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.650
Mark Space up because we already have markup defined here.

16
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.600
So what this is going to do is it is gonna name this row,

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.370
apples,

18
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.760
this road oranges.

19
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.690
This column by this column mark space up on this column cell.

20
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.950
So let's highlight all of those hit create from selection.

21
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.380
Leave.

22
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.920
Top row.

23
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.060
Ticked leave left Colin ticked.

24
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.480
Now,

25
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.970
the only stipulation here is these must be unique values going down the left on unique

26
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.640
values going across the top.

27
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.930
Hit.

28
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.550
Okay,

29
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.840
on they go.

30
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.610
So now we can see if we click in here.

31
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.820
We now have apple,

32
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.560
which is highlight in all of this range because it's picked the label name from here.

33
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.900
We could choose sell on,

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.890
we can see that that's this entire range on.

35
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.960
We can equally pick coconuts,

36
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.490
and that's going to show us this range.

37
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.610
Now what we can do with that is something really useful previously would want it to work

38
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.940
out what some of this is.

39
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.560
We would write a some here,

40
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.350
and we were dragged over this range.

41
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.760
But now we could just click here and say equals the some off cell because cell is now this

42
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.110
named range and you can see that's automatically highlighted.

43
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.320
Now we've type cell on when a center,

44
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.790
some of cell,

45
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.660
which is this through this is £1.26.

46
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.580
Now,

47
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.250
here's something particularly useful.

48
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.110
And I was really excited when I first discovered this,

49
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280
so hopefully you're gonna get as excited as I am now.

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.000
Previously,

51
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.850
if we wanted to know what our sell price of oranges waas what?

52
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.690
We retire Peas,

53
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370
oranges,

54
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.680
and we would type of e look at formula like this for you.

55
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.830
Look up on.

56
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.060
We would reference that cell and we would click that and we were dragged over this area

57
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.590
here,

58
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.210
which is our first range,

59
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.690
My first range comma on the cell prices in column four.

60
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.730
We would type their some type false,

61
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.200
and we would hit.

62
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.440
Enter on Ben.

63
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.240
We would know the sell price of oranges.

64
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.850
Let me just change the format on that.

65
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.220
So they go.

66
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.300
So that's how we worked out using a V.

67
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.780
Look at what?

68
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.540
Sell price of oranges.

69
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.160
Waas.

70
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.340
Now,

71
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.310
what I wanna do is just change the formatting of that to exactly the same format in Okay.

72
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.600
Never going to do something really clever.

73
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.450
Okay,

74
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.650
so if we know what it just type oranges space and sell,

75
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.130
you can see that what's happened in this highlighted area here is oranges in blue goes

76
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.150
across here on cell in red,

77
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.300
goes down here and you can see that the intersect of this row and this column is 20.

78
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.350
So if you hit enter,

79
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.050
you get the answer of 20 p.

80
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.930
So you get exactly the same result as having an entry here that,

81
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.210
you know,

82
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.130
look up from on then right in the V.

83
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.750
Look at formula to look up from column for just by type in the name of the two ranges.

84
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.910
So if we wanted to say what's the mark upon coconuts,

85
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.380
we could literally just say Cocoanuts.

86
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.420
There's that range space mark.

87
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.600
Space groups mark If there's a space in your title,

88
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.540
if there's a space in your defined name,

89
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.510
you must use an underscore,

90
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.820
as you can see in the little tip just there.

91
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.730
So mark up and you can probably guess what's gonna come out to this.

92
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.010
The Intersect off this on this is going to be 20.

93
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.180
Peak hit,

94
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.790
enter and they get from Let me just for muscle of these two currency just so we can see

95
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.050
them.

96
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.700
And if we wanted to know the by price of apricots,

97
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.120
we could just have eagles a pre cults.

98
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:27.430
There's that range space by and there's that range on the Intersect is 12 p.

99
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.430
So they go.

100
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.420
That's a really neat trick.

101
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.020
The only thing it requires is that you have a unique values down here on unique values

102
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.910
across the top.

103
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.020
If you do have data like that,

104
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.210
you need never use of e Look up again.

105
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.760
It's a simple as write in the name of the two named Ranges.

106
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.890
Okay,

107
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.790
I'll see you in the next lecture,

108
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.020
where we're going to say Cullicott,

109
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.990
dynamic named Ranges.

110
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.840
See you then
