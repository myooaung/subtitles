00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Okay,

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:02.730
guys.

3
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.220
And welcome to this section.

4
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.670
Now,

5
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.170
you may have looked at the title and wondered what on earth the practical application of

6
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.760
what can they have for dinner would be now,

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.800
Because I do a lot of consultancy work and interim work.

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm generally new imposed on what happens I find in new organizations is they normally have

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.600
a suite of report where you can extract all kinds of useful data,

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.920
but without the experience of having bean there for a year or two and knowing which reports

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.890
give you which data room which format I use this project fold the one that we're about to

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.310
build.

13
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.320
So typically,

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.340
one I would do is I would run each of the reports in each of their permutations,

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.610
load them into a project file exactly like this one.

16
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.760
But where we will have the ingredients,

17
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.120
I will actually at the name of the fields.

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.330
So once I have built the project file,

19
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.270
say,

20
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.230
for argument sake Oh,

21
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.160
want to create a report or extract a report that gives me a product code a description on a

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.080
by price.

23
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.820
I'll just load those criteria into the front cheats on this project.

24
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.260
file,

25
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.990
and it will automatically point me to the appropriate report.

26
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.510
So that saves me having to keep running reports and running more reports until I find the

27
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.850
one that I actually want.

28
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.700
So they go,

29
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.910
No,

30
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.500
you have some context for it.

31
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.060
Let's crack on and actually create the project.

32
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.500
I'll see you in the next lecture.
