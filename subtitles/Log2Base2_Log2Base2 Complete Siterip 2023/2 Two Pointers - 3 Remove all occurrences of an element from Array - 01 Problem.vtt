00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.950
You will be given an array and the value and 

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.340
your task is to remove all the occurences of 

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.930
the given value from the end return in new length 

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.980
You should solve the problem in place. For example consider

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.250
the array with elements 10 30 40 10 10 and 

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.170
the given value is equal to 10.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.550
So the output array should be like this 30 40 

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450
and the new length will be equal to two.
