00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.070
we know that the XOR of equal numbers will 

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.350
cancel each other 

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.650
Using this fact we can easily find the missing number 

4
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.500
in the given 

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.750
array let us see how first let us take this 

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.170
array of size four 1435 and then let us 

7
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.790
write All the numbers from one to n plus one here 

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.040
n equal to four 

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.200
So write numbers from 1 to 5 

10
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.550
That is 12345 

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.250
Now if we perform XOR these two arrays the equal 

12
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.550
numbers will cancel each other and the missing number will 

13
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.850
be present at the XOR result 

14
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.870
So here the numbers 11 will cancel each other  

15
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.370
44 cancel each other 

16
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.540
Similarly numbers 33 and 55 will cancel each other and 

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.090
the missing number two will be present at the XOR 

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.150
result 

19
00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.400
So the logic is very simple 

20
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.750
declare variable to store the XOR result say result 

21
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.510
first XOR all the numbers present in the given array

22
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.610
with the variable result and then XOR all the 

23
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.370
numbers from one to n plus one with the above XOR 

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.550
variable result 

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.220
Now the missing number will be present in the variable result so we can return it.
