00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.430
in the previous video we have learned how to find 

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.450
the longest common subsequence between two strings 

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.160
In this problem we need to find the longest common 

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.850
sub string between two strings 

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.960
So what is the difference between sub sequence and sub 

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.350
string in a subsequent The characters can be in relative 

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.900
order but in the sub string characters should be in 

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.950
continuous order 

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.380
For example here B B B D B and B 

10
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.630
C B are common 

11
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.550
subsequence because the characters appear in relative order 

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.780
and the characters need not be in continuous order 

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.650
But here only A B and A B C are 

14
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.120
common sub strings between these two strings 

15
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.750
Because those two strings only appear in continuous order 

16
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.560
So let us come to a problem statement given two 

17
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.060
strings 

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.000
You need to return the length of the longest common 

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.740
sub string here 

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.250
The String AB appears in continuous order so it is 

21
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600
common sub string of length two and then string 

22
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.050
ABC appears in continuous order so it is also a 

23
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.850
common sub string but of length three we need to return 

24
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.320
the length of the longest common sub string in this case the expected output is 3.
