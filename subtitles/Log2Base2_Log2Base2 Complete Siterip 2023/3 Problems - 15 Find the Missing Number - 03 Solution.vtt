00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.300
in the implementation 

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.070
Let us write a function 

3
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.070
Find missing number which takes an integer array and 

4
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.620
an integer n which is the size of the array  and 

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.910
It returns an integer which will be the missing number 

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.750
of the array in the function we need to declare a 

7
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.690
variable to hold the XOR result so write int result 

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.550
equal to zero 

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.420
Next we need to XOR all the numbers present in 

10
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.550
the given array with the variable result 

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.600
So write a for loop for i equal to zero i less than 

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.510
n and inside that XOR all the elements 

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.820
that is result equal to result bitwisw XOR array 

14
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.660
of i next 

15
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.100
We need to XOR all the numbers from one to 

16
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.650
n plus one with the above XOR variable result 

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.280
So write a for loop from index 1 to n plus 

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.320
one and XOR all the elements with the variable 

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.950
result 

20
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.720
Now the missing number will be present at the variable result so return it.
