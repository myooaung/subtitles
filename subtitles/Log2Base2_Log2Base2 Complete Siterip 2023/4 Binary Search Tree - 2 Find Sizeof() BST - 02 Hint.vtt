00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.110
The size of a binary tree is the total number 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.050
of nodes in it. 

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.470
So to find the total number of nodes we need 

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.630
to traverse the whole binary tree, so you can 

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.550
use any tree traversal method like inorder traversal 

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.210
to visit each node and while visiting each node, calculate 

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.550
the tree size by incrementing a variable or by incremental 

8
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.150
returning from the recursion.
