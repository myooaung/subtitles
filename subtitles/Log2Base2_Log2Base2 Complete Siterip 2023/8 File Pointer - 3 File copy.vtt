Hi friends in this video let us learn how to 

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.860
copy a file.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.100
Here we have file1.txt and 

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.310
we have some content in it 

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.930
Now we have to copy this content into file2.txt

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.800
So how to do it?  

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.020
So let us understand this 

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.950
Using this programme here. First let us open the file 

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.110
file.txt in read mode using  

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.870
fopen function and the address will be returned to file 

11
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.489
pointer fr 

12
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.030
Now we create and open a new file, file 

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.660
copy.txt in write mode and the address is 

14
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.710
returned to file pointer fw. Now we create a 

15
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.850
string of size 10. Size equal to 10 is already 

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.000
defined in the programme. 

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.610
So if both file opening are successful let us read 

18
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.510
strings of size 10 from file.txt 

19
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.839
and write it to file copy.txt 

20
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.050


21
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.660
So in the first iteration "welcome t" will be 

22
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.680
read to str and will be written to buffer using 

23
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.050
fputs function 

24
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.690
In the second iteration "o log2bas" will 

25
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.190
be read and written to buffer. In the next iteration 

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.330
"e2." will be read to str first and 

27
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.119
then it will be written to buffer 

28
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.900
Now we have reached end of file so control comes out 

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.220
of while and now we can close both the files 

30
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.610
when we close fr, the buffer associated with it will 

31
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.740
be removed. When we close fw the data will 

32
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.640
be returned to file and the buffer associated with it 

33
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.240
will be removed from the memory 

34
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060
Now the data from file.txt is 

35
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.360
copied to file copy.txt

36
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.030
So this is how we can copy data from one 

37
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.169
file to another 

38
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.040
We can use fgets function to get strings 

39
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.250
from one file and use fputs function to 

40
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.340
write these strings to another file 

41
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.630
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
