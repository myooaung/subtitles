Hi friends 

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.280
In this video we are going to discuss about passing a union into a function 

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.200
So consider this programme We have a union with members i and f

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.700
and there is a user defined function fun

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.060
here it's It's prototype we need to write Union followed 

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.169
by the union name 

8
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.150
And in Main we are declaring a union variable d 

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.390
and in d value for Member 

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.200
i is set to 100 

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.190
Now we call function fun and by passing d 

12
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.200
So as we call a function by passing a variable 

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.349
we can call functions by passing union 

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.989
Also. Here d is the argument and 

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.150


16
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.260
obj is the parameter now we print value of i 

17
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
of obj here and we will get 100 

18
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.950
printed

19
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.199
And even if any changes made to a union member it will 

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.520
not be reflected in the original location since only a 

21
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.750
copy of the union is sent to the function 

22
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.529
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
