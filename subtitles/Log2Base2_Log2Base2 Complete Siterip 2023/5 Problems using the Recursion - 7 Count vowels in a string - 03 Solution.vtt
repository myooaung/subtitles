00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.960
first let us write to function isVowel which checks 

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.690
If the given character is a vowel or not this 

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.960
simply compares input character with each vowel and if any 

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.650
of the comparison is true it will return true 

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.160
Otherwise it returns false 

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.170
Now let us write our recursive function countVowels 

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.930
which takes the String str and its end index 

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.980
n as parameters and it returns the result which will 

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.940
be an integer first in the function we need to 

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.190
write the base case 

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.790
That is when n is less than zero then so write if n is 

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.500
less than 0 return 0 Otherwise check 

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.250
If the character at end index n is a Vowel 

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.070
If it is we need to call the function

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.710
recursively by passing the string 

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.780
Excluding the last character that is str and n minus 

17
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.890
one and we need to add one to it as 

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.030
the character at last index was vowel 

19
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.350
So write if isVowel of str of n then 

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.350
return one plus countvowels of str coma n minus 

21
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.640
one else if if it is not a vowel just 

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
called the function with str and n minus one 

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.150
so write else return countVowels of str coma 

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.000
n minus one that's it we implemented recursive logic.
