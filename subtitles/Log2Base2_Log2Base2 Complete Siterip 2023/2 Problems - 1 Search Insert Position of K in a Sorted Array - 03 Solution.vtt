00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.730
let us implement a solution with this function find insert 

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.360
position which will take three arguments array

3
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.650
size of the array and element to be inserted 

4
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.850
Let us take the code for binary search algorithm 

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.290
If the element is already present in the the array return 

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.310
statement here will return the elements current index in case 

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.370
of a new element 

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.670
This while loop will be run for log n times 

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.710
And in the end when the control comes out of 

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.250
the while loop the end index will point to the 

11
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.850
nearest smaller number 

12
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.240
This new element can be inserted after this to keep 

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.780
the array sorted that's we can return end plus one 

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.250
here .
