1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.950
the problem statement is 

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.720
You will be given an integer n you have to 

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.970
return the square root of n for input 16 

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.700
You have to return it square root 4 If the 

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.960
given number is not a perfect square it square root 

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.650
will contain decimal values 

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.550
In that case you just have to return the whole 

8
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.590
number alone ignoring the decimal values for a given 

9
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.890
integer 

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.680
34 

11
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.350
It's square root is 5.83 

12
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.700
Here you have to return the whole number five alone 

13
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.250
without decimal values.
