00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.960
There are two main types of Recursion 

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.640
one is direct recursion and another one is 

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.950
indirect recursions 

4
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.710
In direct recursion 

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.490
The function will call itself and an indirect Recursion 

6
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.350
more than one function will call mutually and this 

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.030
direct recursion is further categorised into four types 

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.520
First one is Tail 

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.910
recursion in Tail recursion the recursive call 

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.550
is the last thing executed by the function 

11
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.940
Next is Head Recursion in Head Recursion the Recursive

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.060
Call is the first thing executed by the function 

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.530
Next we have nested recursion in nested Recursion 

14
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.520
Recursive function will pass the parameter as a 

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.250
recursive call that is recursion inside recursion 

16
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.940
Next we have tree or binary recursion in binary 

17
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.910
recursion the function calls itself twice so these 

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.160
are the types of recursions and we will learn 

19
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.770
all types of Recursion one by one in the coming videos.
