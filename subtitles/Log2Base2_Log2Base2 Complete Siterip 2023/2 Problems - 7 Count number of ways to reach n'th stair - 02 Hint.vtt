00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.050
let us take the results for the first three stairs 

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.050
and analyse it 

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.140
These are the results of the first three stairs 

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.810
now let us analysed the third result 

5
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.770
How many ways can be directly reache stair 

6
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.250
Three 

7
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.880
We can reach the third stair only from two ways 

8
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.180
that is from stair one and stair two 

9
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.900
We cannot directly reach third stair from the bottom because 

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.070
we can climb either of one stairs or two stairs 

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.650
at a time 

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.480
So the solution to third stair must be the extension 

13
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.120
of the solution to stair one and stair two let 

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.520
us see how Let us take the stair One result 

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.550
and stair two results to reach stair three from stai r 

16
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.880
one 

17
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.090
How many steps we need to take two steps 

18
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.950
So add two to the result of stair one 

19
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.250
This will become one two 

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.050
To read stair three from stair two how many steps 

21
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.270
we need to take one step so add one to 

22
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.750
the result of stair two 

23
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.850
So this will become 111 and 21 

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.210
See we have got the result of stair three from 

25
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.350
the results of previous two stairs Here the total number 

26
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.080
of ways to reach stair three is three which is nothing 

27
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.970
but the total number of ways to reach stair one 

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.850
plus total number of ways to reach stair two 

29
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.070
Let us apply this observation and arrive at the solution 

30
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.250
for the fourth stair 

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.530
As we discussed we can reach the fourth stair only 

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.850
from stair two and stair three 

33
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.750
So take the result of stairs two and stair three 

34
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.710
to reach Stair four from stair two we need to take 

35
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.190
two steps so add two to the results of stairs 

36
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.690
two this will become 112 and 22 to reach 

37
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.710
stair four from stair three 

38
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800
We need to take one step so add one to 

39
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.550
the results of stair three 

40
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.070
So this will become 1111211 and 121 

41
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.190
So these are the solutions to reach stair four and the 

42
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.510
total number of ways is five 

43
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.330
That is the total number of ways to reach stair 

44
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.850
two and stair three 

45
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.690
So in general the total number of ways to reach 

46
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.120
the end stair is the sum of total number of 

47
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.040
ways to reach n minus one stair and total number 

48
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.910
of ways to reach n minus 2th stair and this 

49
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.580
exactly follows the nth Fibonacci pattern so you can 

50
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.950
apply the nth Fibonacci logic to solve this problem 

51
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.080
So we will need to store the base results 

52
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.790
That is the result of stair of one and stair 

53
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.900
of two from stair of three 

54
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.260
We can calculate the total number of ways by adding 

55
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.260
the previous two results and finally we can return the 

56
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.950
result of Nth stair.
