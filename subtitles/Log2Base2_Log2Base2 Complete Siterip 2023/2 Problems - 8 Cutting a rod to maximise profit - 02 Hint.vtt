00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.500
let us take this example where we have taken a 

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.440
wood of length of four and solve it 

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.770
Using dynamic programming let us take a one dimensional array 

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.610
of size n plus one that is five 

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.940
We are going to fill these array elements one by 

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.630
one in such a way that each entry is a 

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.450
sub solution to a smaller sub problem 

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.890
For example this element array of two will conduct a 

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.870
solution for a sub problem where the length of the 

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.150
wood is two and the cost is given for pieces 

11
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.340
of length one and two and this element array of 

12
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.960
three will contain the solution of this sub problem where 

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.990
the length of the wood is three and the cost 

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.670
is given for pieces of length 

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.910
One two and three with each subsolution 

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.470
We will solve the next subproblem and finally we 

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.170
will have an overall optimal solution at array of n 

18
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.030
when the length of the wood is zero the profit 

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.880
we can get will also be 0 so let us add 0 in array zero 

20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.900
Let's fill in the rest of the array one by 

21
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.110
one when the length of the wood is one and 

22
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.010
the cost has been given for that one piece alone 

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.230
We need not make any cuts and pick the piece 

24
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.900
to get the maximum profit 

25
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.850
So let us fill two in array of one 

26
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.920
Let us move to the next sub problem for the 

27
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.650
length of the wood is two and they cost for 

28
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.660
a piece of length 

29
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.400
One is two and the cost for a piece of 

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.950
length two is five 

31
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.120
To calculate maximum profit we need to consider all the 

32
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.170
possibilities of applying cuts in this wood of length two 

33
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.550
here there are two possibilities 

34
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.380
Either we can cut the wood at Position one and 

35
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.920
take two pieces of length one or we can take 

36
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.150
the piece of length two as a whole 

37
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.490
To cover these different cases we shall have another variable 

38
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.620
J pointing to one Let 

39
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.930
us iterate J from 1 to I in each iteration 

40
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.240
We assumed that cut has been made at the Jth 

41
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.950
position and calculate the profit by adding the price of 

42
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.500
rod of length J and the maximum profit that can be 

43
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.260
obtained for the remaining length 

44
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.980
First J is pointing to one so the price of 

45
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.760
the rod with length one is two remaining length 

46
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.520
Here is J minus one that is two minus one 

47
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.450
which is one 

48
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.990
We know that the maximum profit that can be obtained 

49
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.320
for a rod of length one is two 

50
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.590
So the profit will be two plus two which is 

51
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.080
four next 

52
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.440
J's value is two that is we are taking the 

53
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.450
piece of length two as a whole 

54
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.580
So the profit we get is the price of the 

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.460
rod of length two as the remaining length I minus 

56
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.760
J is zero here 

57
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.650
Five is greater than four that is taking the piece 

58
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.260
of length two yields its maximum profit so obtained five 

59
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.450
in the array of I 

60
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.840
Whenever get maximum profit we have to update it in 

61
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.660
array of I 

62
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.650
Else we can ignore it 

63
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.830
Let us move 

64
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.800
one to the next sub problem Where I is equal to 

65
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.930
three That is the length of the wood is three 

66
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.270
Start iterating J from one assumed that a cut has 

67
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.450
been made at one 

68
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.250
The price of the rod of length one is two 

69
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.350
The remaining length is three minus 1 2 

70
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.310
The maximum profit that can be obtained with rod of length 

71
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.320
two is five so the profit will be two plus 

72
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.210
5 7 next J will be two if the cut has 

73
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.000
been made at length two the price of Rod of 

74
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.350
length two is five 

75
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.550
The remaining length is three minus 2 1 

76
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.380
The maximum profit that can be obtained for the remaining 

77
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.830
length one is two so the profit will be the 

78
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.150
same five plus 2 7 

79
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.280
So we need not update array of I next J equal 

80
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.750
to three 

81
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.050
That is we are taking the piece of length three 

82
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.750
as a whole 

83
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.420
So the profit we will get is six which is 

84
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.380
less than seven 

85
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.020
So we need not update array of I does the maximum 

86
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.010
profit that we can make when length of wood is 

87
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.450
3 7 so let us 

88
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.290
Repeat the same for I equal to four that is length 

89
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.950
of wood is four First J will be pointing to 

90
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.390
one that is we will make a cut at length 

91
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.820
One 

92
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.840
The price of the rod of length one is two 

93
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.840
and the maximum profit that can be obtained for the 

94
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.850
remaining length three is seven 

95
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.780
So the total profit is seven plus two nine next 

96
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.720
J is two We are making a cut at length two 

97
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.490
the price of the rod of length two and the 

98
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.750
maximum profit for the remaining length two is five 

99
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.770
So the total profit here is five 

100
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.610
plus 5 10 and 10 is greater than nine so 

101
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.950
update array of I next J is equal to three rod 

102
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.710
of length three will cost six 

103
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.230
And for remaining length one we will get a maximum 

104
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.150
profit of two 

105
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.130
So the total profit is six plus two eight and 

106
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.480
eight is less than ten 

107
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.050
So we shall ignore it finally J is equal to four 

108
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.350
Here we are taking the wood of length four as 

109
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.880
a whole 

110
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.580
For this we will get a profit of eight and 

111
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.960
eight is less than 10 so we will not update 

112
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:37.850
array of I 

113
00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.620
Thus when the length of wood is four the maximum 

114
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.950
profit that we can get is ten which we have 

115
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.550
got in array of four.
