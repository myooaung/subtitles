00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
The problem statement is you will be given an expression 

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.040
and you have to check

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.080
If the parantheses in it is balanced or not.

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.550


5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.200
So what is balanced parenthesis? For every opening bracket there 

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.370
should be corresponding closing bracket and it should be properly 

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.950
nested.

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.180
For example, in this expression for every opening bracket

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.280
there is one closing bracket and it is properly nested. 

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.620
So this expression is balanced and this expression here is 

11
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.250
unbalanced since for this new opening there is no closing 

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.940
So your task is to write the logic for this 

13
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
problem and submit it using the below compiler 

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.420
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.070
If the input is this expression the expected output is one.

16
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.650


17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.290
If the input is this expression the expected output is zero.
