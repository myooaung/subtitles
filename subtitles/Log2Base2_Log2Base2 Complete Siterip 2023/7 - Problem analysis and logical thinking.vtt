00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.980
Hello friends 

2
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.500
In this video we will discuss the importance of problem 

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.260
analysis and logical thinking 

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.050
So the main idea of programming is to get the 

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.680
work done by the computer 

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.430
This means we are asking the computer to solve our 

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.950
problem by writing the proper program

8
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.350
So what is the first step to solving any problem 

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.170
The first step to solving the problem is to analyse 

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.330
the problem and then find a correct logic to implement 

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.650
it 

12
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.870
If we did not have clear logic to solve the 

13
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.260
problem we will end up wasting time in implementing wrong 

14
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.450
programmes which gives an unexpected result 

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.730
For example let us take this simple problem of swapping 

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.650
two numbers 

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.000
A has the number 3 and B has the number 

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.540
5

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.870
Our task is to swap the values in between A 

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.070
and B that is at the end value of A

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.750
should be 5 and value of B should be 3 

22
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.680
So what will be the logic for this problem?  

23
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.310
Can we swap 

24
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.810
the values just like that?

25
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.540
Let us try. Let us assign the value 3 to B 

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.340
Now both A and B has the value 3 and 

27
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.470
what happened here? We lost the original value of B 

28
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.340
that is 5.

29
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.210
That is the original value of B, 5 is overridden 

30
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.720
 by the value of A which is 3. 

31
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.700
So now we cannot solve this problem as we lost 

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.060
the actual value of B.

33
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.110
And if we assign the value of B to A

34
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.560
first that also we will lost the original value of 

35
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.050
A which is 3

36
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.200
So it is very clear that using this approach we 

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.800
cannot solve this problem 

38
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.890
So what will be the solution? In order to avoid 

39
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
this situation we should keep one more variable to back up

40
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.280
the actual value of one variable before the assignment 

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.139
So let us take another variable temp and before assigning 

42
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.230
value of B to A back up the value of A

43
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.380
 to temp. so temp will have the actual value 

44
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.240
of A that is 3. now assign the value of B 

45
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.810
to A

46
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.300
So now the value of A will be 5 and 

47
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.730
both A and B have the same value 

48
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.190
5 

49
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.079
Now Since we already have the original value of A

50
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.430
in temp from temp we can assign the value of 

51
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.950
A to B so assign temp to B so now 

52
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.350
the value of A will be 3 

53
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.940
So we have achieved our task 

54
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.630
Now the actual values of A and B were 3 and 5

55
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.000
 After the swap operation the updated values of A 

56
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.250
and B are 5 and 3 

57
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.740
So this is how analysing and logical thinking help us 

58
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.750
to speed up the implementation time 

59
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.170
If we directly go to writing codes we might end 

60
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.450
up implementing wrong logic again and again.

61
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.690
So before implementing actual code we can use these methods 

62
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.850
to formulate our thoughts in an organised way 

63
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.700
We have algorithm pseudo code and flow chart for this 

64
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.339
purpose 

65
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.410
So let us discuss about each of these. so what is 

66
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.600
an algorithm and algorithm is a step by step method 

67
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.930
of solving a problem 

68
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.450
We can write an algorithm using simple English 

69
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.070
Now let us write the algorithm for swapping two numbers 

70
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.020
The first step will be starting the process 

71
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.769
Then the next step is to input the first number 

72
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.490
to A The third step is to input the second 

73
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.929
about to B so we got the two numbers in 

74
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.250
A and B now

75
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.530
Now we have to swap them 

76
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.299
So using the logic with just discussed we have to 

77
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.830
copy one value to a temporary variable as a back 

78
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.050
up 

79
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.950
So next step is to assign A to temp 

80
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.000
And fifth step is to assign B to A and 

81
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.250
the sixth step is to assign temp to B 

82
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.760
So now the numbers are swapped.

83
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.500
The last step is to stop the process 

84
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.070
So that is algorithm the step by step instructions to 

85
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.350
solve a problem 

86
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.159
See anybody reading this algorithm can understand how we can 

87
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.450
swap two numbers A and B 

88
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.729
Now let us discuss about pseudo code 

89
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.270
The pseudocode is an informal programme description that does 

90
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.180
not contain code syntax 

91
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.520
That means we don't need to bother about programming 

92
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.500
syntax while writing the pseudocode using this pseudo code any 

93
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.400
programmer can easily understand your logic 

94
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.890
Now let us write the pseudo code for swapping two 

95
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.360
numbers first begin now get input A and B which 

96
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.049
are the numbers to be swapped next temp equal to A

97
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.300
that is we are assigning A to temp next equal to B

98
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.650
that is we are assigning B to A and next 

99
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.099
B equal to temp 

100
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.510
That is we are assigning temp which is the original 

101
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.349
value of A to B so the swapping is done 

102
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.670
Now we can print the swapped values so print A,B

103
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.050
and now we can end the process 

104
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.110
So that is pseudo code are it is like a programme 

105
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.120
but it is not 

106
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.530
There are no rules of syntax and all as the 

107
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.710
name pseudo code 

108
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.250
It is a fake code 

109
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.570
So that's all about pseudocode 

110
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.620
Now let us discuss about flow chart A flow chart is 

111
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.309
a diagramatic representation of logic or the process 

112
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.640
Let's understand what are the major elements in flow chart 

113
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.349
and their usage So the first element that we are 

114
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.750
going to discuss is an oval shape 

115
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.440
It is used to represent the start or stop stage 

116
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.380
of a process 

117
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.340
Next element is an arrow mark 

118
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.560
It is a connector 

119
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.710
It connects or relates between various steps of a process 

120
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.850
It shows the direction of the process flow 

121
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.050
Next element that we have is a parallelogram symbol.

122
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.870
It is used for input or output functions 

123
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.600
If we have to get input from user or we 

124
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.740
give output to the user we represent that 

125
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.950
step using a parallelogram symbol

126
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.460
Next we have a rectangle for processes like mathematical 

127
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.950
operations, assignment operations, etcetera 

128
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.790
We will use a rectangle shape and finally we 

129
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.650
use a diamond shape for decision making steps 

130
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.780
You will understand each one's usage very clearly once we 

131
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.120
draw flow charts for different problems 

132
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.160
Now let us see how to draw flow chart for 

133
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.090
our problem which is to swap two numbers so first

134
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.280
Start the process 

135
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.330
And as we learned for start and end we will 

136
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.030
use an oval shape next get input to A 

137
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.590
and B and for input output functions we will use 

138
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.630
a parallelogram shape so write input A,B 

139
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.420
in a parallelogram and we have to connect it using 

140
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.549
the connector symbol

141
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.390
Next we have to copy A to temp B 

142
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.020
to A and temp to B which are computations 

143
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.760
So we should use a rectangle shape here 

144
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.810
Now we can print A and B and it is 

145
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.150
an output function so write it in a parallelogram symbol and 

146
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.950
finally stop and as we learnt for start and stop 

147
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.570
we use an oval shape And it is also important 

148
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.850
to connect every stage or step using the connector 

149
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.510
So today we learnt the significance of analysing the problem 

150
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.270
and logical thinking we can first develop the correct logic 

151
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.930
before we can start actual coding and we can use 

152
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.780
three methods for that algorithm pseudo court and flow chart 

153
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.450
We learnt each one of them in detail 

154
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.900
So in the coming videos let us write algorithm pseudo 

155
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.550
code and draw flow chart for various problems 

156
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.950
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
