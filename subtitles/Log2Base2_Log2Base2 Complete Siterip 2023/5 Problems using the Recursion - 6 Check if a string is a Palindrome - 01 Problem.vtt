00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.130
the problem statement is you will be given an input 

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.630
number and you need to check if it is a 

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.080
Palindrom or not 

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.440
So what is a palindrome number Palindrome numbers are the 

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.270
numbers that will remain the same when it's digits are 

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.950
reversed 

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.250
For example let's take the number 121 

8
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.050
The reverse of this number is also 121 

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.620
So such numbers are called palindromes 

10
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.280
Take another number 456 

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.290
The reverse of this number is 654 

12
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.230
and these two are not the same 

13
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.920
So it is not a palindrome number 

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.220
So your task is to write the logic for palindrome 

15
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.760
number problem and submitted using the below compiler see some 

16
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.280
sampl inputs and corresponding outputs 

17
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.460
If the input is 121 the expected output is 

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.950
the message palindrome 

19
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.500
If the input is 345 the expected output is message not palindrom.
