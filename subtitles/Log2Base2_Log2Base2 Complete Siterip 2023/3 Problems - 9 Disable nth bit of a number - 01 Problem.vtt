00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.110
The problem statement is you will be given a positive 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.620
number and a value n and you have to disable 

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.850
the nth bit in that number. 

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.740
For example, if the given number is 65, this is 

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.390
it's binary representation 01000001

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.520
And if we have n equal to seven, 

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.670
we need to disable the seventh bit 

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.080
So this 7th bit should be set to zero and 

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.080
the resultant binary representation 

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:38.150
00000001 will correspond to the number one. 

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.220
So your task is to write the logic for this 

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.960
"Disable nth bit problem" and submit it using the below compiler 

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.440
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.620
If the input is 65 and 7, the expected output is 1

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.140
if the input is 65 and 1, the expected output is 64
