00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.260
so let us write a recursive Function isPalindrom which takes 

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.360
the string str start index start and end Index end 

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
as parameters and returns an integer which will be the 

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.340
result of the checking first in the function we need 

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.710
to write the base case 

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.200
That is when Start Index is greater than or equal 

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.220
to end index 

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.250
Then we can stop the recursive calls and return one 

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.580
So write if start is greater than or equal to end 

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.570
then return one 

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.450
Otherwise we need to compare the first index character and 

12
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.740
last index character 

13
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.360
So write if str of start is equal to 

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.880
str of end and if they are equal then we 

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.600
need to call the function Recursively by passing the 

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.480
string Incremental start index and Decremented end index so 

17
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.270
write isPalindrome of str comma start plus 

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.670
one comma end minus one and if they are not 

19
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
equal just return zero as the string is not palindrome so write else return zero.
