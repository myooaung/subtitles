Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.250
In this video let us have an introduction to greedy 

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.150
algorithms 

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.570
So the greedy method is one of the 

5
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.480
approaches to solve optimisation problems in the greedy approach 

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.380
The problem is solved in multiple stages in each stage 

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.650
We will consider one input from the given options 

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.340
If the option is feasible that means it satisfies given 

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.480
condition and we will include it in the solution by 

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.170
including feasible solutions 

11
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.820
In each stage we will get the optimal solution 

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.760
So the general greedy method will be like this 

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.040
We will be given a set of options and some 

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.650
conditions 

15
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.690
First we will consider one option from the given set 

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.150
of options if the option is feasible included in the 

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.850
solution 

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.340
If not we will consider the other option and check 

19
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.680
if it is feasible and if is include it otherwise 

20
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.150
move onto other options and like that 

21
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.130
So this is how in the greedy approach the overall 

22
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.470
optimal result will be achieved by choosing feasible options in 

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.450
each stage 

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.270
So this is all about the greedy approach 

25
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.400
In the next video we will learn how to solve the minimum coin exchange problem using greedy approach.
