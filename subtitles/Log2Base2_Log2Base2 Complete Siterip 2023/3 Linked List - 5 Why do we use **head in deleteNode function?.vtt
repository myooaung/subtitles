00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.880
in this video let us learn why we are using Star 

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.490
Star head in the linked list deletion code so 

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.850
we can create a linked list in two ways 

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.010
One is by declaring the head node in the global 

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.350
section and use it 

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.290
In this case any changes made to the head node 

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.690
will be reflected all over the code 

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.400
For example in this linked list 

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.590
If we delete the head node in the called function 

10
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.570
the head pointer in the function as well as the 

11
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.060
head pointer in the main function will change as it 

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.550
has global scope 

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.450
The second way is by declaring the head pointer inside 

14
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.450
the main function 

15
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.390
In this case the scope of head pointer is limited 

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.050
only to the main function 

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.750
So if we changed the head pointer in any function 

18
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.890
it will not get reflected in the main function 

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.710
For example in this linked list if we delete the 

20
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.060
head node in the called function the head pointer in 

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.250
the function will point to the next node 

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.320
But the head pointer in the main function will still 

23
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.550
point to the previous head node and it will become 

24
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.120
a dangling pointer so if we declare the head 

25
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.930
node in the main function and if we want to 

26
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.220
update the linked list we need to send the address 

27
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.050
of the head node instead of just the head node 

28
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.620
And to receive the address of the pointer a variable 

29
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.870
As a parameter we need to add two stars before the 

30
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.650
variable name 

31
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.030
And also whenever we want to access its data we 

32
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.580
need to de reference it 

33
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.650
That's why we have used star Head to access the 

34
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.870
head 

35
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.050
Node data all over the function 

36
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.670
And this is why we are using star Star head and 

37
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.550
sending the address of the head to the delete function 

38
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.800
It is nothing but just like call by value and 

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.850
called by reference concept for point of variables.
