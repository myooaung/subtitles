Hello friends. In this video, let us have an introduction 

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.210
to infix, prefix and postfix expressions. 

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.770
Infix, Prefix and Postfix notations are three different but equivalent

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.750
ways of writing expressions. 

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.780
First let us learn about infix expressions.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.900
In infix expressions 

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.980
Operators are written in between the operands

8
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.120
For example A + B

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.510
The operator + is written between operands A and B 

10
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.190


11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.850
See another example A + B - C

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.150
See another one A + B * C - D 

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.350
Now let us see prefix expressions. In prefix expressions 

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.850
Operators are written before their operands

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.650
So what will be the corresponding prefix expression of this 

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.300
infix expression A + B? operator comes before operands.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.050
Right? So + AB

18
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.700
Now let us see post fix expressions. In post fix

19
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.530
expressions, 

20
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.200
Operators are written after their operands

21
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.960
So what will be the corresponding post fix expression of this

22
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.120
infix expression? Operator comes after operands. 

23
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.150
So A B +

24
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.370
Similarly for the second infix expression, the prefix expression 

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.320
will be like this - + A B C and 

26
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.020
corresponding post fix will be A B + C - 

27
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.380
and for the third infix expression, prefix expression will 

28
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.390
be - * + A B C D and corresponding 

29
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.780


30
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.350
post fix will be A B + C * D -

31
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.110
So that's all. We will learn more about infix 

32
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.150
prefix and postfix notations in the coming videos
