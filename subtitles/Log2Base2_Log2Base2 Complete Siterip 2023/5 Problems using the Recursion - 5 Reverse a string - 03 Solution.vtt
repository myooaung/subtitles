00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.630
so let us write recursive Function Reverse which takes the 

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.180
string str starting Index I and its length n as parameters 

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.020
First in the function we need to write the base 

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.450
case 

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.480
That is when start Index is equal to middle index 

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.510
That is when I is equal to n by two 

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.920
We need to just return so write If I equal 

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.950
to n by two then return 

9
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.390
Otherwise we need to swap the first index character and 

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450
its corresponding last index character 

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.180
So right swap of Ambersons str of i coma Ambersons 

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.520
str of n minus i minus one And then we need 

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.440
to call the function recursively by passing the string 

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
incremental I and length n so write reverse of str 

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.060
comma 

16
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.870
I plus one comma n that's it we have implemented the logic to reverse the string recursively.
