00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.620
To solve this problem, we can use two pointers 

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.550
One is to iterate 

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.480
the array say i and the other one is to 

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.650
point the new array and length say new len

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.750
itearte the whole array one by one using i. 

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.040
And if the value is not equal to the given 

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.980
value, place it in new len index and increment it.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.900
If it is equal, just move to the next element 

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.400
and continue the process. 

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.510
For example take this array 

11
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.310
iterate the array using i, now compare the current 

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.000
element with given value. It is the same.

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.610
So move to the next element. Now compare these two 

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670
values and they are not the same.

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.710
So place it in new len index and increment new len and 

16
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.210
move to the next element. Do the same process. 

17
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.550
Next is 40 which is not equal to 10. 

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
So place it in new len and increment new len and move 

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.550
to the next element. 

20
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.890
Now compare these two values and we have 10 

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.210
So just move to the next element again 

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.120
We have 10.

23
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.350
So do nothing 

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300
And the new array will be till the new len index.

25
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.020
And the new length is equal to 2
