00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.480
The problem statement is you will be given a linked 

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.290
list and you need to check if there is a 

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.450
loop present in it or not. 

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.400
For example, if this is the given linked list, then 

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.450
it is very clear that there is a loop present.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.850
20 30 40 50 and again 20 

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.390
So a loop or cycle is present here

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.250
return 1 

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.890
And if this is the input linked list, there is 

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.550
no loop present here so return zero
