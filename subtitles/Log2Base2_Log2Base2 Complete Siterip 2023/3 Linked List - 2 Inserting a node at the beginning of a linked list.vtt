00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.920
in this video we are going to learn how to 

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.050
insert a node at the beginning of a linked list 

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.840
So this is the code to implement this programme here 

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.710
The function add First will insert a new node at 

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.540
the beginning of a linked list and we are passing 

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.360
the value of the new node to the function which 

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.750
will be stored in Val 

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.400
Now we are going to insert the element 10 so 

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.070
Val equal to 10 here 

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.470
Now suppose are linked 

11
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.340
List is empty so head will be equal to null 

12
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.120
First we need to create the new node 

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.090
So write node new node equal to new node 

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.050
So new node will be created at address 1024 

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.360
And as we know we have two parts for a 

16
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.370
node in a linked list the data part to store 

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.140
the value and the next part as a reference to 

18
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.040
the next node 

19
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.570
So first we need to add the data part so 

20
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.050
write new node dot data equal to val so the 

21
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.950
value 10 will be stored in the data part 

22
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.300
And since we want to insert our new node at 

23
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.690
the beginning the new node must be inserted immediately before 

24
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.220
the head 

25
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.680
write 

26
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.310
So the next part of this new node should point 

27
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.480
to head write New node dot Next equal to head 

28
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.360
So after executing this part of the code we have 

29
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.000
created a new node 

30
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.910
We have filled the data part and we have pointed 

31
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.890
it to the head of the linked list 

32
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.380
So the next step the final step is to make 

33
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.050
this new node the head of the linked list 

34
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.010
So write head equal to new node 

35
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.950
Now the new node has become the head of the 

36
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.760
linked list 

37
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.200
Now let us insert another element 20 to this linked 

38
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.450
list at the beginning 

39
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.700
So now the value pass the Val will be equal to 

40
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.040
20 and this new will be creating the new node 

41
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.950
and let us add our value 20 at the data 

42
00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.350
part 

43
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.310
So we have new node dot data equal to Val 

44
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.670
and next should point to the head 

45
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.330
So we have new nodes dot next equal to head 

46
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.270
Now made 20 the head of the linked list 

47
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940
So we have head equal to new node 

48
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.340
So we have inserted 20 at the beginning of the 

49
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.050
linked list 

50
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.770
So the new Head is the 

51
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.270
The node 

52
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.580
With Value 20 

53
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.560
Now let us insert another element 

54
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.050
30 

55
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.550
So Val equal to 30 and new will create a 

56
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.530
new node and add Val which is 30 at the 

57
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.950
data part and make its next point to the head 

58
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.910
Now made the node 30 The head of the linked 

59
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.430
list 

60
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.560
So thats all And this is how we can insert 

61
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.720
a node at the beginning of a linked list 

62
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.730
So create the new node at the value at the 

63
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.430
data part 

64
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.880
Make its next point to the head and at last 

65
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.720
make the new node the head 

66
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.610
Now let us relate this with a train so we 

67
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.930
know we have an engine followed by a number of 

68
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.470
coaches in a train right 

69
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.170
so let the engine be our head of the linked list and 

70
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.660
the coaches be the nodes after the head 

71
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.580
So let this be a node with data and next 

72
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.590
are the link part 

73
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.090
So suppose we have the train empty so a new 

74
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.960
block A is added so make it the 

75
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.100
Engine which is equivalent to the head in our linked 

76
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.530
list 

77
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.310
Now let us 

78
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.780
Insert another block B and that will become the engine 

79
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.420
Now let's insert another block C And that will become 

80
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.980
the engine 

81
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.530
Oh now when inserting another block D it will become 

82
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.150
the engine 

83
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.710
Same happens with the linked list in this case So 

84
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.880
whenever you add a new node it becomes the head 

85
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.650
Now let us talk about the time complexity 

86
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.370
Since we don't need any Traversal we only need to 

87
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.560
create and make the new node the head the time 

88
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.750
complexity is order of one.
