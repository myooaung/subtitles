00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.880
we can use this approach to solve the problem first 

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.130
declared a reference variable and move it till the start 

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.690
index 

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.910
Now we can logically divide the linked list into three 

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.420
parts from position 

6
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.480
one to start is the part one and from position 

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.200
start to end is the second part and this is 

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.410
the sub list that needs to be reversed and from 

9
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.250
end to null is the third part 

10
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.270
Now let us say the last node of the first 

11
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.130
part which will be used later to connect with the 

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.810
sub list 

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.830
After the reversal Node

14
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.680
20 will become the last node of the sub list 

15
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.010
so we need to save this node as well 

16
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.930
So save Node 

17
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.450
20 as second part Last node 

18
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.490
As of now 20 is the first node of Part 

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.050
two but after reversal it will become the last node 

20
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.350
so that we are saving it as the last node 

21
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.350
of the second part 

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.400
Now reverse the sub list from position start to end 

23
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.470
You can use the same linked list reversal logic for 

24
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.850
this 

25
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.260
If we apply the linked list reversal logic that is 

26
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.680
previous current and next node approach after the reversal current 

27
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.130
will point to node 60 and previous will point to 

28
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.050
node 50 

29
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.830
Now our task is almost over 

30
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.710
We just need to make some connexions to finish the 

31
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.250
logic 

32
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.980
First we need to connect the last node of first 

33
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.160
part with the starting index of reverse sub list 

34
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.510
That is Node

35
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.580
10 with node 

36
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.150
50 

37
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.340
We already have the address of node 10 in the 

38
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.100
variable first part last node and node 

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.980
50 in the variable previous 

40
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.430
So make first part last node 

41
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.410
Next as previous next we need to connect the last node 

42
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.630
of reverse sub list with third part 

43
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.520
First node that is Node 

44
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.150
20 with node 60 

45
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.270
We already have the address of node 20 in the 

46
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.670
variable second part last node and node 60 in the 

47
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.650
variable current 

48
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.610
So make second part Last node next as current and 

49
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.630
now we have reversed the given sub list and you can apply this logic and solve the problem.
