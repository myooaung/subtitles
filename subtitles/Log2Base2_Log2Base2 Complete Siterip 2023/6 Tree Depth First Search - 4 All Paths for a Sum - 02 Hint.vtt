00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.310
In the previous video we have printed all the paths 

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.750
in a given binary tree 

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.440
For this problem we can use the same logic and 

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.960
alter it based on the problem statement.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.940
so now let's see how every time adding that node value in the array

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.730
find a new sum value by subtracting the current node

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.210
value from the given sum and also in each iteration

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.840
we need to check whether we have reached the 

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
leaf node and the new sum value is zero.

10
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.730
If we have reached the leaf node but the new sum

11
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.200
value is non zero. 

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.810
We can say that this path sum does not equal 

13
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.810
to the given sum value, so we can skip this path.

14
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.260
 

15
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.990
If we have reached the leaf node with new sum

16
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.680
value as zero we can conclude that we have found 

17
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.950
the path with given sum and we can print it. So using this logic, you can try solving the problem.
