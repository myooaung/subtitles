Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.370
In this video we are going to learn about operator precedence.

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.440
See we have an expression here 

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.950
20 + 10 * 10 /2

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.570
Now How do we evaluate this expression? Will you perform the 

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.610
operations from left to Right And exactly in that order? If 

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.540
that is the case, we will perform 20+10 first

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.910
and we get 30 then perform 30*10

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.099
That is 300. then 300 /2  and we 

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.849
get 150 But is it the right method? What 

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.270
we got here, 150 is not the result of 

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.070
this expression 

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610
So this method is not right Because we have to 

14
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.010
take the priority of each operator into consideration while we 

15
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.450
evaluate an expression. so let us see How it actually works 

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.980
We have the same expression 20 + 10 * 10 /2 

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.190


18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.340
So first we have addition Then we have multiplication 

19
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.800
And then we have division 

20
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.740
So comparatively addition is of smaller priority and multiplication and 

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.840
division have the same priority which is greater than addition 

22
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.410
So what we do here is we 

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.100
Consider Associativity since we have same priority 

24
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.640
So here we have left to right order. So take multiplication 

25
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.229
First. so perform 10*10

26
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.610
Then we get 100 

27
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.200
And now between addition and division, clearly we need to 

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.560
perform division first 

29
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.810
So perform 100/2

30
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.039
We get 50 now perform Addition 20 + 50 we 

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.920
get 70 

32
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.040
So that is the result of this expression. 

33
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.220
So this is the precedence order of operators. the highest 

34
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.590
precedence is for parantheses. 

35
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.899
After that multiplication and division have the same 

36
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.600
precedence.

37
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.370
And then we have addition subtraction having the same precedence 

38
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.130
So let's see some examples 

39
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.710
We have 5 + 4 *3 So here between 

40
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.300
addition and multiplication, multiplication has higher precedence so perform 

41
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.430
4*3 First and we get 12 and now perform 

42
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.400
5+12 which is 17 

43
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.460
So what if we need to calculate 5+4

44
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.650
first and then perform multiplication In that case we 

45
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.760
can use () is as it has higher precedence

46
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.190
So now 5+4 gets calculated first and then multiplication 

47
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.140
is performed and we get 27 as the result 

48
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
So what will happen if operators are with same precedence.

49
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.090
See here we have multiplication and division which are of 

50
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.860
same precedence in such case we need to apply associativity.

51
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.079
for parantheses 

52
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.030
 it is from left to right for multiplication 

53
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.640
and division 

54
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.140
Also it is left to right and for addition and 

55
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.779
subtraction 

56
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.299
Also it is left to right 

57
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.260
So here we go from left to right 

58
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.210
So perform multiplication first

59
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.550
So we get 10*3=30

60
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.299
Now we have to perform division operation and we get 

61
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.140
30 /2= 15 

62
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.510
So that is how it is done 

63
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.440
So that's all and thank you watching this video.
