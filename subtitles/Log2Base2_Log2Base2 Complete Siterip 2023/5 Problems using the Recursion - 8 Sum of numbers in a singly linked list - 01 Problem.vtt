1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.700
the problem 

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.670
Statement is 

3
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.960
You will be given a singly 

4
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.050
linked list with integers and we have to find 

5
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.240
it 

6
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.850
sum using recursion 

7
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.050
For example if this is the input list the sum is 

8
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.390
seven plus nine plus 12 plus eight that is 36 

9
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.570
so the expected output is 36.
