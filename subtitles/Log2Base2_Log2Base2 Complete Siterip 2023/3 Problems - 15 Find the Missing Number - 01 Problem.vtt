1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
you will be given a non duplicate array of n 

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.950
minus one integer from range one to n 

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.100
One of the integer is missing in the list 

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Your task is to find that one missing number for 

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.760
example considered the array 145327 

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.450
Then the output should be the number six 

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.910
If the input array is 1435 then the 

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.250
expected output is the number two.
