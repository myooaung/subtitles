00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.220
Now let us see the implementation 

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.050
We need to get the number and bit position from 

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.440
the user.

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.650
So declare integer variables num and n

5
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.170
now get the values from the user and 

6
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.160
store it in num and n.

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.620
so we got the values 

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.600
Now we should create the bit mask which is all 

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050
bits one except the nth bit 

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.560
So first do n-1 left shifts on number one

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.100
and find its complement 

12
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.230
That is complement of 1 left shift n-1

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.850
And this is the bit mask.

14
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.780
Now perform bitwise AND on the given number and 

15
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.780
this bit mask. 

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.180
So write num equal to num AND our bitmask

17
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.730
which is complement of one left shift n-1 

18
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.760
so nth bit will be disabled and the result 

19
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.960
will be in num. So just print it.
