00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.220
Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.660
In this video we are going to learn the adjacency 

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.250
matrix of a graph 

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.990
So a graph can be represented in many ways 

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.440
And one such method is using adjacency matrix and 

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.130
first will see the case of an undirected graph So 

7
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.960
we have an undirected graph here and to construct the 

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.550
adjacency matrix The first step is to count the 

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.030
number of vertices and if you have n vertices then 

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.450
construct n by n matrix 

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.420
So we have five vertices here 

12
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.860
So construct five by five metrics Just like this giving 

13
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.890
the name of vertices in rows and columns and 

14
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.090
that is our first step 

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.780
And now to add values into this metrics so first 

16
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.470
we have cell 00 that is row zero column zero 

17
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.550
to add value to this cell 

18
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.230
We check if there is an edge from 0 to 

19
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.650
0 

20
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.930
But in our graph we don't have such an edge 

21
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.050
put a zero there

22
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.920
Next we have 01 So we check if the recent 

23
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.510
edge from 0 to 1 and yes we have 

24
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.350
And since this is an undirected graph we can say 

25
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.840
we have an edge from 0 to 1 and 1 

26
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.520
to 0 as 

27
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.220
Well so add a one here and next We have 

28
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.460
02 and the there ia an edge between zero and two so add 

29
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.820
a one here also 

30
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.050
And next we have zero three again 

31
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.800
We have an edge between zero three so val 

32
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.560
one is added in this cell and next zero four 

33
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.100
and there is no edge between zero and four 

34
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.790
So add a zero here and next we go to 

35
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.440
the second row of the metrics and check if we 

36
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.680
have an edge from 1 to 0 

37
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.510
So we have an edge between one and zero 

38
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.420
So add a one in the metrics and then we 

39
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.460
do not have an edge from 1 to 1 

40
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.540
So add a zero here and next 

41
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.720
We have one two 

42
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.320
So if you see and there is no edge between 

43
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.190
one and two so add a zero here and next we 

44
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.520
have 13 and the recent edge 

45
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.730
So add one and next we have one four and there 

46
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.260
is an edge between 14 

47
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.270
So add one 

48
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.880
And next we go to the third row and we 

49
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.780
have an edge between two and zero 

50
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.910
So add one here and next we have row two 

51
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.060
column one and one other method is that for undirected 

52
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.400
graphs 

53
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.010
If you have value one for adjacency matrix of 12 

54
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.140
then he will definitely have the same value one for 

55
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.630
adjacency matrix of 21 as well 

56
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.000
And similarly if you have zero for adjacency matrix 

57
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.830
of 12 then you will have the same value 

58
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
Zero for adjacency matrix of 21 So we will get 

59
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.880
zero here since row one column 2 is 0 and next is 

60
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.800
2 2 and there is no edge 

61
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.710
So add zero here and then we have 23 

62
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.650
And the recent edge so add one here and next 

63
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.050
is two four and see there is no edge 

64
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.360
So we add zero 

65
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.530
So that's the third row next 30 there is 

66
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.000
edge between three and zero 

67
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.300
So add one here and then we have 31 and 

68
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.450
the recent edge so add one again 

69
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.710
And next is three two 

70
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.810
And again add one 

71
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.190
Since we have an edge between three and two and 

72
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610
next  33 and there is no edge so 

73
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.660
add zero here and then we have three four and 

74
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.350
again we have an edge here so add one 

75
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.830
And next we have the final row and if you 

76
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.420
see there is no edge between four and zero so 

77
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.360
add zero here and then we have four one and 

78
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.070
the recent edge between four and one 

79
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.840
So add one and next is four two and there 

80
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.490
is no edge between four and two so add zero and next 

81
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.450
we have four three and the recent edge So add one 

82
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.590
and finally we add zero for four four since there 

83
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.550
is no edge 

84
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.920
So that is the edge adjacency matrix of this undirected 

85
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.450
graph 

86
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.570
Now if we have this adjacency matrix and if 

87
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.530
you want to know the number of vertices is in 

88
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.840
the graph that will be equal to the number of 

89
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.880
rows or columns and names of the vertices are the 

90
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.530
names of the rows or columns 

91
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.380
And if you want to know if there is an 

92
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.520
edge between two vertices you can check that in that 

93
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.850
adjacency matrix for an example 

94
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.040
We want to know if there is an edge between 

95
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.870
two and three 

96
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.810
Then I can go to row two and column three 

97
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.020
and I can find a one there which means I 

98
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.270
have an edge between two and three 

99
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.550
So that's all about 

100
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.740
adjacency matrix of an undirected graph now let us 

101
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.850
see the case of directed graphs 

102
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.370
Here we can follow the same procedure but the only 

103
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.220
difference is that you need to check the direction of 

104
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.880
the edge 

105
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.760
So again the first step is to find the number 

106
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.940
of vertices which is five here so constructive five by 

107
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.890
five metrics name the rows and columns by the names 

108
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.560
of the vertices and first 

109
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.620
We have 00 and there is no edge between zero 

110
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.290
and zero 

111
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.610
So add a zero there next is 01 and the 

112
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.820
recent edge from 0 to 1 

113
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.300
So add a one here 

114
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.080
Next we had zero two and the recent edge 

115
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.530
from 0 to 2 

116
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.030
So add one and next is 03 and again the 

117
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.100
recent edge from 0 to 3 

118
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.130
So add one again and then we have zero four 

119
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.460
and there is no edge from 0 to 4 

120
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.960
So add a zero there and that is all from 

121
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.250
Vertex zero 

122
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.010
Now take vertex one 

123
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.250
And from Vertex one there is no edge vertex zero 

124
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.980
So add zero there that is if you see the 

125
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.920
recent edge between one and zero 

126
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.500
But it is directed from 0 to 1 and not 

127
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.020
from 1 to 0 and direction really does matter here 

128
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.780
So we add zero here and next vertex 

129
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.180
two 

130
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.390
There is no edge 

131
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.010
So we add zero and vertex three and 

132
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.350
four 

133
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.740
There are edges from one 

134
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.690
So add one in these columns and next we take 

135
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.380
vertex two and check going edges and we have only 

136
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.670
edged 23 

137
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.770
So only that will be one and we get 

138
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.130
202122 and two four equal to zero next we 

139
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.500
Take vertex three and again check for outgoing edges 

140
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.250
And there is only one edge from three which is 

141
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.850
4 

142
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.800
So we get row three column four equal to one 

143
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.480
and every other column in this row will be equal 

144
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.080
to zero 

145
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.310
And finally we have vertex four and see there are 

146
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.260
no outgoing edges you will get zero in all the columns of this row
