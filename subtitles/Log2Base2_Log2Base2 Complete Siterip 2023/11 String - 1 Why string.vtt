Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.389
In this video we're going to discuss about 

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.950
the need of strings in C.

3
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.770
SO why do we need strings? We have char

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.450
datatype in C, but it can only store a single 

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.110
character 

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.439
For example if we want to store a then we 

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.590
can create a char

8
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.080
 variable c1 and store a in it 

9
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.869
Or if you want to store * we can create 

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.040
another variable c2 and store * and it 

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.300
And remember we enclose the character in single quotes but 

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.850
this can be used when we want to store single 

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.710
characters 

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.570
So what if we want to store a word or 

15
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.210
a line? Then we can make use of strings 

16
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.150
For example if we want to store the word India 

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.830
or the words C programming or the words etc etc

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.490
we can use string and a string is an array 

19
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.980
of characters terminated by null character \0 and strings 

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.460
are enclosed in double quotes 

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.230
where as characters are enclosed in single quotes 

22
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.000
So what is the difference between a character array?

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.280
 the major difference is that there is no null 

24
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.670
character in an array of characters But the string must 

25
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.950
always be terminated by the null character and it is 

26
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.229
very useful in many cases where we process the string 

27
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.330
We can easily find the end of the string and now 

28
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.140
about the applications of strings.

29
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.430
Many software application programmes such as notepad, word, spreadsheets 

30
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.310
database tools were developed using strings and 

31
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.050
it's manipulation features 

32
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.429
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
