1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.450
you will be given an unsorted array of size n 

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.250
and an integer variable K as input 

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.140
Your task is to find the Kth smallest number from 

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.950
the given array 

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.350
For example if given array is 42189 and 6 

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.430
and the value of K is equal to three then 

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.600
the expected output 

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.930
is number four because 

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.640
The first smallest number is one and the second smallest 

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.140
number is two and the third smallest number is four 

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.050
which is our expected output 

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.710
Let us take another example 

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.060
If given Array is 9 3 minus 3 0 8 and 7 

14
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.720
and the value of K is equal to two 

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.340
Then the expected output 

16
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.370
is number zero because here the first smallest number is 

17
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.270
minus three and the second smallest number is zero which 

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850
is our expected output.
