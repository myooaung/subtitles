1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.880
let us implement the solution in this function in count 

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.750
element occurrence which takes three arguments arr it's size 

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.310
and an integer n let us take the implementation of 

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.130
previous module

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.940
At the end of this while loop we will have 

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.350
the index of first occurrence of the integer 

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.740
in variable first pos and at the end of this while 

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.560
loop we will have the index of last occurrence of 

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.640
the integer in variable last pos 

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.140
Let us calculate count by doing last pos minus first 

11
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.150
pos plus one and finally return it.
