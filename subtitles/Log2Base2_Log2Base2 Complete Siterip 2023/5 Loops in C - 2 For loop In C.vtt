Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.180
In this video we're going to learn about the for 

3
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.550
Loop. 

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.700
Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of statements and for 

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.220
loop is an important one and it is used when we 

6
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.240
know the exact number of iterations 

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.990
For example if you want to print good morning five 

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.180
times the number of iterations is known which is five 

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.600
And if you want to print the numbers from 1 to 100

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.640
 here also we know the number of iterations 

11
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.650
It is 100 

12
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.240
So in such cases we can use for loop

13
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.030
Now this is the syntax of for loop we have 

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.760
the initialisation, condition and increment or decrement and then 

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.129
we have the statements to be executed and there are 

16
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.849
these semicolons which separate the initialisation, condition and 

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.180
increment/decrement 

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.769
Now let us see the working of for loop The 

19
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.080
working is very simple 

20
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.370
First step is initialisation and it will only happen 

21
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.809
once and then the condition will be checked 

22
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.269
And if it is true the statement inside will be 

23
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.520
executed and then it will increment/decrement 

24
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
And thus the first iteration is completed 

25
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.870
Now for the second iteration it will check the condition 

26
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.750
If it is true again it will execute the statements 

27
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.419
inside and increment /decrement after that and the 

28
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.390
second iteration is also completed 

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.380
Now for the next iteration it checks the condition again 

30
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.510
and suppose it failed 

31
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.560
Now the control comes out of the loop. so it repeats 

32
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.090
until the condition is failed 

33
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.100
Now see this example programme to print Good morning five 

34
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.619
times 

35
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.570
So we have the main function and inside we declare 

36
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.420
integer Variable i and then we have the for loop

37
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.770
and we initialise i equal to 1 

38
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.279
And since we need to print five times we can 

39
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.170
set the condition as i less than = 5

40
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.660
and then the increment part i++

41
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.259
So in the first iteration initialisation happens and i equal 

42
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.570
to one Now then we check the conditions 

43
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.730
One is less than or equal to five 

44
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.160
So condition is true 

45
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.400
So it executes the statements inside which is print Good 

46
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.890
morning 

47
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.400
So it will be printed and then it will perform 

48
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.670
the increment operation 

49
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.930
So i becomes 2

50
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.720
So first iteration is thus completed Now in the second 

51
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.950
iteration we won't be initialising again but we directly check

52
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.580
the condition and i which is 2 is less than 

53
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.120
or equal to five so condition is true and we 

54
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.580
execute the print statement 

55
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.070
So good morning is printed again and after that

56
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.750
i is incremented  and it becomes 3

57
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.340
Now second iteration is also completed 

58
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.490
Now condition is checked again and 3 is less than 

59
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.820
5

60
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.120
So the condition is true 

61
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.049
So it goes inside and prints good morning again 

62
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.420
And now i will be incremented and it becomes 4

63
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.850
and third iteration is also completed 

64
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.720
Now it checks the condition again and 4less than 5

65
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.340


66
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.030
So it goes inside and prints Good morning 

67
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.170
And after that the increment operation will be done and 

68
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.240
i becomes five 

69
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.050
Now fourth iteration is also completed 

70
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.090
Now the condition needs to be checked again and  

71
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.130
5=5

72
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.440
So condition is true 

73
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.490
So it goes inside and prints 

74
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.579
Good morning and increments i. So i become 6. now 

75
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.370
fifth iteration is also completed and the condition is checked 

76
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.750
again now i=6 which is neither less than 

77
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.679
five nor equal to five 

78
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.080
So the condition failed and the control comes out of 

79
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.260
the for loop and the programme is completed now 

80
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.210
So that is how the for loop works 

81
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.690
Now see another example 

82
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.140
Programme to print five numbers from 5 to 1 in 

83
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.140
descending order 

84
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.790
So we have the main function and we declare i

85
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.960
and then we have the for loop and we have 

86
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.029
for (i=5; i greater than or equal to 1; i--)

87
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.190


88
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.019
So first initialisation happens and i=5 now

89
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.300
Now it checks the condition five is greater than one 

90
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.600
so the condition is true 

91
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.920
Hence it executes the statements inside which is to print 

92
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.709
the value of i and i equal to five 

93
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.790
So 5 is printed and now i will be decremented

94
00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.239


95
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.190
So it becomes 4. so The first iteration is thus 

96
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.140
completed and now it checks the condition again and 

97
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.250
4>1

98
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.610
So the condition is true 

99
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.260
So it prints the value of i which is 4

100
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.450
And after that  i is decremented and becomes 3

101
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.210
Now second iteration is completed and now it checks the 

102
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.270
condition again 

103
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.010
And 3 is greater than one 

104
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.409
So the condition is true 

105
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.380
So it prints the value of i which is 3

106
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.169
and then it is decremented and becomes 2

107
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.110
Now third iteration is also completed and again it checks 

108
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.540
the condition and 2 greater than 1 

109
00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.750
So it is true 

110
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.289
So it prints the value of i which is 2

111
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.620
And after that  i is decremented and it becomes 1

112
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.750
Now the fourth iteration is also completed and it checks 

113
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.530
the condition again and 1=1 

114
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.239
So the condition is again true 

115
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.650
So it prints the value of i which is 1 

116
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.990
And after that i is decremented and it becomes 0

117
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.590
 

118
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.490
So fifth iteration is also completed 

119
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.320
And again when it checks the condition, zero is neither 

120
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.170
greater than nor equal to one 

121
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.070
So condition failed and control comes out of the for loop

122
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.290


123
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.610
And thus the execution is completed 

124
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.830
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
