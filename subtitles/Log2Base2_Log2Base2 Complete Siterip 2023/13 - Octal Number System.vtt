00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.090
Hello friends 

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.320
In this video we're going to discuss about the octal number system 

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.090
So in the previous video we learnt the binary number system 


4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.930
But it is very hard to deal with binary numbers 

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.730
because everything will be in zeros and ones

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.610
 to reduce the complexity we have the Octal number system 

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.640
in which we will group every three bits of binary in right to left direction 

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.119
The maximum value that can be formed using three bits is 7 


9
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.820
that is 111 in binary 

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.950
It is also called Base 8 number system 

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.770
and it has the numbers from 0 to 7 

12
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.890
That is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 

13
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.120
Now see the possible three bit group combinations 

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.330
we have 000 and its corresponding octal value is 0 

15
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.930
And for 001 it's octal value  is 1

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.120
and for 010 it's octal value is 2

17
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.530
and for 011 its octal value is 3

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.970
And for 100 the octal value is 4 

19
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.990
and for 101 the octal value is 5 

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.859
and for 110 the corresponding octal value is 6 

21
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.420
and finally for 111 it is 7

22
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.109
We have to byheart these values and it will be very helpful 

23
00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:30.080
Knowing these eight values, one can convert any large value to octal and from octal

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.870
 So how to convert a binary value to its octal value ?

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.730
Let us understand it using an example.

26
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.689
Let us convert the binary value 101100 to the octal number system 

27
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.930
So as we discussed before, in the Octal number system 

28
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.240
we will group every three bits from right to left 

29
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.890
So starting from the right end take the first three bits and group them 

30
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.040
So we got the first group 100 

31
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.800
Now take the next three bits and group it 

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.000
So we got 101

33
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.910
 Now let us write the corresponding octal values 

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.760
for 100 it is 4 and for 101 it is 5

35
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.000
So we got the corresponding Octal value 54

36
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.060
 So 101100 to the base 2 is equivalent to 54 to the base 8.

37
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.000
Now see another example we have 01100 

38
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.010
So to convert this binary value into its Octal value 

39
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.420
take the three bits from right end

40
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.570
So we got 100 

41
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.270
Now take the next three bits 

42
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.400
But there are only two bits left 

43
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.530
and we can make only three bit groups 

44
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.060
So what to do? 

45
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.420
in such cases we have to add zeroes to the left to make it three bit group.

46
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.420
So add a zero before 01. So we got 001. 

47
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.310
Similarly if we had only one bit left 

48
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.060
we can add two zeros to the left to make it a three bit group 

49
00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.820
So here we got two groups 100 and 001

50
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.000
Now taking the corresponding octal values

51
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.420
 we get for 100 it is 4 and for 001 it is 1.

52
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.890
So the octal value corresponding to the binary 01100 is 14

53
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.210
Now how to convert Octal number into its binary value?

54
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.130
 It is a very easy method 

55
00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:24.030
So to convert an octal number to it's binary 

56
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:29.670
We need to represent every digit of octal number in its three bit binary form 

57
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.240
See an example 

58
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:33.450
We have the Octal number 57 

59
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.870
To convert this into binary 

60
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.250
write the three bit binary value of each digit. 

61
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.610
So  for 5 it is 101 and  for 7 it is 111 

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.080
Now write these values together and this is the corresponding binary of octal 57

63
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.230
 So today we discussed about octal number system or base 8 number system

64
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.240
In octal system we will group every three bits of binary

65
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.500
 in the right to left direction 

66
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.680
We learnt how to convert binary to  octal. 

67
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.990
just group the bits in size of 3 from right to left direction

68
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.570
 and write the corresponding octal values of each group 

69
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.779
We also learned that if the number of bits is not a multiple of three

70
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.850
 add the required number of zeros before the binary number

71
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.620
 to make it a perfect three bit group

72
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.100
 and to convert octal to binary 

73
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.300
simply write the three bit binary value of each digit and join them 

74
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.520
So it is very clear that if you know the eight different combinations

75
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.750
 and its corresponding octal values you can convert any binary to octal and any octal to binary 

76
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.970
So that's all 

77
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.990
And in the next video we will discuss about the hexa decimal number system 

78
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.340
So that's all for this video and thank you for watching.
