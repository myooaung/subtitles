00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
The problem statement is

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.470
you will be given a binary tree as the input 

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.690
and you need to convert it into its mirror tree.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.590
So what is this mirror tree? It is nothing but the 

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.150
mirror image of the tree. 

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.830
So the mirror tree of this tree is this.

7
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.200
So your task is to write the code to 

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.980
solve this problem and submit it using the below compiler.

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.910
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.580
If the input tree is this, then the expected 

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.960
output is it's mirror tree which is this.

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.930
And if the input tree is this, then the 

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.350
expected output is this tree.
