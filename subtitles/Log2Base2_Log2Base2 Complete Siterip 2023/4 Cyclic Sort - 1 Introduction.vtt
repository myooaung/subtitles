00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.990
In this video let us learn about cycle sort. 

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.030
The cyclic sort is a useful pattern to solve the 

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.250
problems involving arrays containing numbers in a given range 

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.770
and finding the missing or duplicate numbers 

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.040
So how to identify cyclic sort pattern in a problem?

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.180
These problems mostly deal with arrays containing numbers 

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.890
in a given range and ask us to find duplicate or 

8
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.310
missing elements in that given range 

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.680
See some examples for such problems 

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.470
Given an array containing n distinct numbers from zero to n 

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.300
find a one missing number from the array. See another one.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.860
Given an array of n+1 integers

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.690
where each integer is between one and n. Only one integer 

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.380
will be present two times. 

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.320
Find that one duplicate element.

16
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.160
Here if we analyse the problem statements, we can identify the 

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.150
cyclic sort pattern easily 

18
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.510
See all the problems are dealing with an array of 

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.750
a given range and ask us to find the missing 

20
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.240
or duplicate element from it. So we can solve these 

21
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.850
kind of problems easily using the cyclic sort pattern

22
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.120
So in the next video we will learn about cyclic sort.
