00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.200
so let us write our recursive function fun which 

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.870
takes the input decimal value as parameter 

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.510
First in the function we need to write the base 

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:09.930
case 

5
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.370
That is when the number is zero 

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.440
Then we can just return so write if num 

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.850
equal to 0 return

8
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.900
Otherwise we need to call 

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.510
The function recursively by passing the number by two So 

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.950
write fun of numb by two 

11
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.290
And while the recursive calls return we need to print 

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.720
number modulo two so write print of %d

13
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 numb mod two and that's it 

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.070
We have implemented the recursive logic to convert a decimal 

15
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.750
number into binary value.
