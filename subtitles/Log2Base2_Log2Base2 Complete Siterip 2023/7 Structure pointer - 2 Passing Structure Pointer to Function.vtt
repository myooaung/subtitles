Hi friends in this video let us discuss about passing 

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.390
structure pointer to a function 

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.740
So let us explain it 

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.720
using an example programme. First we have a structure declaration 

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.360
for employee with members Name, age and weight 

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.550
Next we can see the prototype of a function  

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.780
fun which passes a structure 

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.440
employee pointer. Now in main we create a structure variable 'e'

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.110
 with values abc, 20 and 55.5 

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.120
Now we create a structure pointer ptr 

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.650
 and assign the address of 'e' to it.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.850
Now we call the function fun by passing this 

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.490
structure pointer ptr

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.280
So the control goes to  fun and the 

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.830
function parameter to receive the structure pointer is obj 

17
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.180


18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.960
So obj also points to the structure variable 

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.590
'e' now and here it prints name equal to  

20
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.430
obj->name 

21
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.400
So we will get abc printed similarly 

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.590
obj->age will access 20 and the printf function will 

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.130
print it 

25
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.380
The next print statement will print obj->weight

26
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.309
which is 55.5 now 

27
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.680
The control returns to main and finally return zero now 

28
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.850
let us discuss about modifying a struct  

29
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.330
element

30
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.090
So see this example 

31
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.590
Programme 

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.950
We create the same structure employee with members name, age

33
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.630
and weight and we have the function prototype for fun

34
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.520
 which passes a structure pointer. Now in main 

35
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.660
we create the structure variable e with values abc, 20 

36
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.250
and 55.5 

37
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190
Now we create a structure pointer ptr and assigns 

38
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.560
the address of e to it 

39
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.149
And now we call the function fun by passing 

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.820
this structure pointer ptr 

41
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.530
So now the control goes to the function and in 

42
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.839
the function the parameter is obj and using obj

43
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.030


44
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.430
 we print the name, age and weight of employee 'e'. 

45
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.730
and now we set  obj->age

46
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.970
which access age of 'e' to 30. Now control returns 

47
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.450
to main and we print the age there 

48
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.760
So we will get the modified value 30 printed 

49
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.860
So this is how we can modify the structure members 

50
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.010
from the function with a pointer passed. 

51
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.030
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
