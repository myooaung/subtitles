00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
The problem statement is you will be given an array

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.650
and a value K 

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.600
Your task is to rotate the array by K positions. 

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.770
In the previous video,

5
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.150
We have done the array rotation using the normal method 

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.930
We can also solve the same problem using array reverse 

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.450
logic.

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.650
So your task is to solve the same array rotation 

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.400
problem using array reversal logic.
