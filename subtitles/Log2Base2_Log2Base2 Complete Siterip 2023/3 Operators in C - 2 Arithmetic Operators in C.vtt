Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.349
In this video we are going to learn the arithmetic operators in C.

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.590
So an arithmetic operator is used to perform the 

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.390
basic mathematical calculations and the arithmetic operators are + for 

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.970
addition - for subtraction * for multiplication and / for 

5
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.130
division and % symbol for Modulo Operation. So let us 

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060
See a programme to see the working of these arithmetic 

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.849
operators 

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.920
So we have the main function and we declare 2 

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.770
integer variables A and B and initialised  a to 100 

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.610
b to 10 

11
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.140
And then we have a print function and it will 

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.339
print a+b =  %d and 

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.260
for that integer value you have a+b

14
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.870
and it will print 100 + 10 which is 110

15
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.120
 and then we have another print function and it 

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.290
will print a-b and a-b will 

17
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.190
be calculated and returned which will be 90 

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.600
Next is another print function and it will print a *b

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.190
 equal to a * b will be calculated

20
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.410
and 1000 will be printed and then we have another 

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.490
print function here and it will print a/b 

22
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.010
 equal to and a/b will be 

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.640
calculated and the quotient 10 will be returned and see

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.750
the next print function 

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.690
Here we have a %% b so we 

26
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.680
have 2 % symbols here 

27
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.850
And it is because in format specifiers, we use

28
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.250
% character and to print % as a character 

29
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.240
you can type like %% So this statement will 

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.420
print a %b that is a modulo b 

31
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.380
 equal to a mode b We will be calculated and 

32
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.750
that is a will be divided by b and the 

33
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.610
reminder zero will be printed

34
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.030
So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
