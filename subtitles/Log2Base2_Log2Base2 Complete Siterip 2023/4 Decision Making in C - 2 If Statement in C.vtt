Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.540
In this video we are going to learn the if statement in C.

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.059
So this is the syntax for the if statement and if the 

3
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.740
condition is satisfied then the statements here will be executed 

4
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.380
otherwise it won't be executed.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.959
So we have a programme here to perform division operation 

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.740
and we know that division by zero is not possible 

7
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.509
So we need to restrict it so we can use 

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.060
if statement to make sure that denominator is never zero. 

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.320
So see here we have the code and in the 

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.910
main function we are declaring two integer variables num1 

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.600
and num2

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.570
And now we are asking the user to enter 

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.100
two integers and suppose user enters 10 and 2

14
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.570
 and that is read to num1 and num2

15
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 respectively 

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.870
And now we have the if statement here 

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.540
And if we are going to place only one statement 

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.610
under if, then there is no need for parentheses and 

19
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.140
that is why we don't have parentheses 

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.270
 here and if num2 not equal to 

21
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.780
zero that is the condition 

22
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.090
And here num2 is 2 which is not equal 

23
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.610
to zero 

24
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.040
So the condition is true And the statement inside will 

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.590
be executed and num1 divided by num2 will 

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.840
be printed and the result of division 10/2 

27
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.850
which is 5 will also be printed 

28
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.970
Now see another case where the user enters the integers

29
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.090
10 and 0

30
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.340
So actually we have to perform 10/0

31
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.630
which is not possible 

32
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.460
So the if statement actually blocks that operation here. see

33
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.690
the condition is false 

34
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.530
Num2 is equal to 0 so it skips the 

35
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.850
inner statements and exits of the programme 

36
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.430
And this is how we can use if statement in 

37
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.830
many cases. So see an example to understand it more 

38
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.539
clearly 

39
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.390
If(rainy) take umbrella so the condition here is it 

40
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.240
is raining 

41
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.690
And if the condition is true, you want to take 

42
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.810
the umbrella and if the condition is false, then you 

43
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.649
don't want to.

44
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.830
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
