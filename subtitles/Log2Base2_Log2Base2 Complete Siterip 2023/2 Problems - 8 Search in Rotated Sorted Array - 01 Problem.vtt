00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.160
in this problem you will be provided with this sorted 

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.100
rotated array and an integer n 

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.990
You have to search for the integer in the array if 

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.980
the integer present you have to return the array 

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.550
index of that element 

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.540
If it is not present you have to written minus 

7
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.850
one 

8
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.160
Let us see some examples 

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.450
Take a sort of array of size seven 

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.770
Now rotate this array twice in the clockwise direction so 

11
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.050
it will look like this 

12
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.240
So this is how our input arrays will look like 

13
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.280
for this array 

14
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.600
If the integer given is ten you have to return its 

15
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.050
array index three 

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.170
If the given integer is 100 you have to 

17
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.220
return minus one as 100 is not present in the array.
