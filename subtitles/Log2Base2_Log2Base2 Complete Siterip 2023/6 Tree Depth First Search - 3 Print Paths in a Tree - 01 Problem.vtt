00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
We will be given a binary tree and your 

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.050
task is to print all the paths of it.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.310
So the nodes from root to a leaf node is 

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.750
considered as a path. 

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.900
So in this binary tree we have four paths 

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.260
So the expected output is 100 50 10, 100 50 60, 100 200 150  

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.550
and 100 200 300.
