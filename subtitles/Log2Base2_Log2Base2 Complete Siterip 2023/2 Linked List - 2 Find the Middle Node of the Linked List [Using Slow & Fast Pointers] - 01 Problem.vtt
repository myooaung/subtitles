00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.760
The problem

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.720
statement is you will be given a linked list and 

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.950
you need to find its middle node.

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.170
For example, if this is the given linked list, then 

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.110
you should return

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.750
it's middle node which is 30 here 

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.200
So your task is to write the logic for this 

8
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.950
middle of the linked list problem and submit it using the 

9
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.550
below compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.380
If the input linked list is 10 20 30 40 50 

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.350
then the expected output is 30.

12
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.240
And if the input linked list is 10 20 30 40 then

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.050
the expected output is 20.
