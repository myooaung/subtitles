1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.730
you will be given a rod of length n and 

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.580
an array of prices that contain prices of all size 

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.470
Smaller than n our task is to cut the rod 

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.880
in such a way that it maximises the total amount 

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.950
of money we get 

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.650
For example let us take a rod of length four 

7
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.640
these are the 

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.910
 price information for the smaller Pieces The rod 

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.270
of length one is worth rupees two rod of length 

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.770
two is worth of rupees 

11
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.720
Five rod of length three is worth rupee six and 

12
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.030
the rod of length four is worth rupees 

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.650
Eight 

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.700
Now we have to cut this given rod of length 

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.080
four in such a way that it gives us maximum 

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.650
profit 

17
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Let us say the various possibilities of cutting this rod 

18
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.420
one by one we can cut this rod into four single 

19
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.080
pieces 

20
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.690
In this case we will get a profit of four 

21
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.640
into 2 ₹8 

22
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.790
we can also cut this rod into two pieces rod 

23
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.550
of length one and another rod of length three 

24
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.150
Here we will get a profit of two two plus six ₹8 

25
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
We can also cut this rod into three pieces two 

26
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.050
pieces of length one and one piece of length two 

27
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.580
In this case we will get a profit of two 

28
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.170
plus two plus five ₹9 like this they can cut the 

29
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.510
rod 

30
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.740
In many ways our task is to find maximum profit 

31
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.720
Here 

32
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.460
We can get a maximum profit of 10 rupees 

33
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.230
then we cut the rod into two pieces of length 

34
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.450
two you need to write a logic to solve this 

35
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.050
problem.
