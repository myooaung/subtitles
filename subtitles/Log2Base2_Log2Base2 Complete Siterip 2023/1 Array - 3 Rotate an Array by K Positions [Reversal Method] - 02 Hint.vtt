00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
So if the given array is this, with elements 1 2 3 4 5 

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.790
and K is equal to two, then in reversal method 

3
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.850
the first step is to reverse the array elements from 

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.720
zero to n-k-1 which is 5-2-1 here

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.720


6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320
that is 0 to 2.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.620
So reverse the elements 1 2 and 3. 

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.210
So it will become 3 2 1. Now the next step is 

9
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.010
to reverse the array from index n-k to index n-1

10
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.010


11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.750
That is from 5-2 to 5-1 

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.350
That is index 3 to 4 

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.520
So reverse elements 4 5. So after reversal we will get 

14
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.220
5 4.

15
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.900
Now the final step is to reverse the entire array.

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.900


17
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.700
That is from index zero to n-1 which 

18
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.000
is from 0 to 4 here.

19
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.000


20
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.090
And see we got the array rotated by two positions
