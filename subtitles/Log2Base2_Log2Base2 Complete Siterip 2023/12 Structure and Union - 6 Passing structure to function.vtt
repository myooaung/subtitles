Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.150
In this video we are going to discuss about passing a structure into a function 

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.920
So consider this programme we have a structure student with members age 

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.960
and weight and there is a user defined function fun

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.369
 here is it's proto type  

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.750
we need to write struct followed by the structure name 

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.470
And in Main we are declaring a structure variable s 

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.169
with values 15 and 50.5 

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.850
Now we call function fun by passing s so 

11
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.920
as we call a function by passing variables we can call 

12
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.570
functions by passing structure 

13
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.419
Also. Here s is the argument and  

14
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.580


15
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.370
obj is the parameter since only a copy of 

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.510
the structure is sent, Any changes made to structure members 

17
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.870
are not reflected in the original location 

18
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.770
Now we print age and weight here so we will 

19
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.250
get 15 and 50.5 printed 

20
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.129
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
