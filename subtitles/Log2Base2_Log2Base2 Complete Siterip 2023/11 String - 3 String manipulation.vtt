Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.540
In this video we will discuss about string manipulation.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.430
So like arrays, strings 

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.180
Also start with index 0. See a string "hello" here at 

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.060
index zero We have H and at index 4 we 

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.779
have 'O', So to access First character use index zero and to 

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.460
access second character use Index 1 

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.750
And in general we can say to access nth character 

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.310
We can use the index n-1.  Now see 

10
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.670
an example We have character array word[6] equal 

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.530
to hello. So the string hello will be stored in 

12
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.040
word and we can access these characters using indices

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.739
from 0 to 4. 'H' at word[0] 

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.830
'e' at word[1], 'l' at word[2] next 

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.280
'l' at word[3] and 'o' at word[4] and 

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.220
at word[5]

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.350
We will have null character representing the end of the string.

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.410
Now see a simple programme 

19
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.449
Here we have the main function and a character array 

20
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.410
word is created and string Hello is stored in

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.170
it now using the format specifier %s, We 

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.660
are printing the word so the string hello will be 

23
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.050
printed as the output 

24
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.779
Now we are assigning the character * to word[4] 

25
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.350
So at index 4 o will be replaced with * 

26
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.380
Now we are printing the string again using %s

27
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.570
So the string h e l l *  will be 

28
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.139
printed 

29
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.040
Now we are assigning the character # into index one 

30
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.160
So # will replace e 

31
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.339
Now we are printing the string again 

32
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.330
This time it prints H # l l *  and return 

33
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.850
zero 

34
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.270
So that is how we can access each character in a string

35
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.640
using the indices

36
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.640
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
