00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.020
for this problem we can reuse the top K element 

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.720
code First let us change the min heap logic into 

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.850
Max heap logic 

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.560
And then let us rename the function 

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.830
Get Top K Elements into Kth 

6
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.950
Smallest element Next we need to construct the max heap for 

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.550
the first K elements 

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.050
This build heap statement will do exactly that 

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.250
so we don't need to change it 

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.140
We can keep the statement next we need to compare the 

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.590
remaining elements with the value of root note 

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.970
And if it is lesser than the root we need 

13
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.130
to replace the root value and call heapify function 

14
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.890
So in this if else statement just changed the greater 

15
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.080
than simple into lesser than simple 

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.020
And that's it 

17
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.130
After the execution of this loop the Kth smallest element 

18
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.800
will be present at the root node and we can 

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
just return it so write return array of zero.
