00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.360
to find the logic for this problem 

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.640
We need to understand the relationship between the power of 

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.030
two number and its previous number 

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.690
So let us represent some power of two numbers and their 

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.950
previous number in binary format 

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.290
The number eight is 00001000 and its previous number is 

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.330
seven and it's binary representation is 00000111 

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.140
for number 16 The binary representation is 00010000 and 

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.290
its previous number 15 00001111 and for the number 32 

10
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.840
0010000 and its previous number 31 00011111 we can see 

11
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.460
that all the power of two numbers have only one 

12
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.250
set bit 

13
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.560
If the position of set bit is X then the 

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.960
previous numbers have all bit set to one till X 

15
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.250
minus one position 

16
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.110
And if we and those two numbers the result will 

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.950
be zero 

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.360
So the logic is very simple 

19
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.360
Just do bitwise and on the given number and 

20
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.350
its previous number 

21
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.050
If the result is zero its power of two number 

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.850
Otherwise it is not a power of two number using this logic you can try solving the problem.
