Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.580
In this video we are going to learn the if else statement in C.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.390
So this is the syntax for

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.290
if else statement.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.540
And when the given condition is true, the statements under 

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.260
if executes and otherwise the statements under else will be 

7
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.880
executed. 

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.140
And if we have two cases that you can have 

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.520
in our programme and if you want to take a 

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.830
particular action in either case then you can use if 

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.410
else statement. Now see a real time example here.

12
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.190
we have the traffic signals and the code is if 

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.029
(red) stop else move So we have the two cases case 1

14
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.090
 is that the signal is red.  case2 is that 

15
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.480
the signal is not red.

16
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.540
If the light is red you want to stop. Otherwise 

17
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.980
that is, if it is not red, you can move. 

18
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.360
Now see an example programme and this programme checks if the input 

19
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.330
given is zero or non zero 

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.540
So in the main function, we're declaring an integer variable 

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.960
num and we are asking the user to enter

22
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.110
any number and suppose the user enters 10 and 

23
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.100
it is read to num

24
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.290
And now we have the the if else statement if num == 0 

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.759
 

26
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.990
So the condition is that the entered number equal to 

27
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.940
zero and here num equal to 10 which is not 

28
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.860
equal to zero 

29
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.899
So the condition is failed and if part will not 

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.060
work and else part will work and it will print 

31
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.520
"Non zero". Now see another case were the user enters 

32
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.110
zero 

33
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.649
Now the condition num=0, has become true 

34
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.210
So the statements under if will be executed and "Zero" 

35
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.500
will be printed and the programme is completed 

36
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.970
And that is how if else statement works 

37
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.729
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
