1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.610
you will be given an unsorted array of size 

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.550
n and Integer variable K as input 

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.560
Your task is to find K largest elements from the 

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.010
given array

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.630
For example if given array is 42189 and 6 

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.700
and the value of K is equal to three then 

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.910
the expected output 

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
is first three largest numbers in the given array that 

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.620
is 68 and 9 and if given array is 9 3 

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.490
minus 3 0 8 and 7 and the value of K is 

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.110
equal to two then the expected output 

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.540
is first two largest numbers in the array that is eight 

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.150
and nine.
