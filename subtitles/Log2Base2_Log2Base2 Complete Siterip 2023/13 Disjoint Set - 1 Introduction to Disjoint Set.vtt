The disjoint set is an effective data structure to 

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.750
track the connectivity of each element in a specific subset 

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.750
or connectivity of subsets with each other 

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.390
The famous algorithm which uses it disjoint set is 

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.580
Kruskal's Algorithm which detects a cycle in an undirected 

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.670
graph before learning about disjoint set in detail 

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.550
First let us learn what is disjoint set two 

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.140
sets are said to be disjoint when they have 

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.650
no common element 

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.340
That is if we take intersection of two disjoint sets 

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.310
the result will be a null set or an empty 

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.750
set 

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.650
For example let's assume the first set has elements 157 

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.050
and the second set has the elements 2689 

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.930
If we find the intersection between these two sets the 

16
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.300
output will be an null set as there is no common 

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.850
element 

18
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.350
This type of sets is called disjoint set 

19
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.370
Now let us learn what is disjoint data structure 

20
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.840
The data structure that contains a collection of disjoint 

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.300
sets is called disjoint set data structure 

22
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.250
It is also known as a union find data structure 

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.550
This is all about disjoint set and disjoint 

24
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.130
set data structure in this video we have learnt the 

25
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.650
need for disjoint set 

26
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.930
And what is disjoint data structure 

27
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.240
In the next video we will learn the main operations 

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.450
of in disjoint set.
