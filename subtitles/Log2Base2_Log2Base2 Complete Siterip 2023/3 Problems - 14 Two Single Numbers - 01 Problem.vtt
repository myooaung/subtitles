00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.380
you will be given an array of numbers 

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.400
Were each number appears twice except two numbers 

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.770
That means there will be two odd occurring numbers 

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.230
We need to find that two numbers 

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.010
For example Here we have an array of six numbers 

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.670
Number nine appears twice and number six appears twice 

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.470
The odd occurring two single numbers are five and seven 

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.480
So here the expected output 

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.250
is five and seven.
