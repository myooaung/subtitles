00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
So how can we perform this task? To rotate the 

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.700
array by one position, we can keep the last element 

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.980
of the array in a temporary variable 

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.580
That is back up array[n-1] then shift 

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.340
the remaining elements by one position to right. 

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.430
Now place the backed up element in the first place

7
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.950


8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
so that array is rotated once. So to rotate  it

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.050
K times which is two times here, 

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.620
we can do this procedure two times. 

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.750
We already did it once 

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.570
Now we have to do it again 

13
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.690
So back up 

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.750
last element four 

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
shift all the other elements to right by one position and 

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.740
place the backed up element which is four in zeroth index

17
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.530

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.250
And we got the array rotated twice 

19
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.490
So the idea is we can call this procedure  

20
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.550
k times to rotate the array k times.
