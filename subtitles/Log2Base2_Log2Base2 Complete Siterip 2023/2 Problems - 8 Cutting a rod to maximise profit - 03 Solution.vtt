00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.350
Now let us see the implementation 

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.060
This function here takes two parameters length of rod and 

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.150
and the prize array which will have prices for rod 

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.980
length from one to n first 

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.000
let us declare an array of size n plus one 

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.630
to store the sub problems 

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.730
Result Then let us set zero in our elements of the array

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.050
using a for Loop 

9
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.120
Now using a for loop let us iterate the 

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.650
max profit array from one to n and start filling 

11
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.710
the results of this subproblems inside this to check 

12
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.180
various cases that arise while cutting 

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.930
Let us use another loop from one to I in 

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.540
each iteration of this loop we will assume that the 

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.250
cut has been made at Jth position 

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.930
We calculate the profit made by adding the price of 

17
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.430
the rod with length J and a maximum profit that 

18
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.550
can be obtained for the remaining length 

19
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.960
That is the price of J minus one and the 

20
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.950
max profit of I minus J 

21
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.480
We have to update this to the max profit of 

22
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.140
I only when it is higher than the previously found 

23
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.810
profit for this use this if condition If the price of 

24
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.720
J minus one plus max 

25
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.880
Profit of I minus J is greater than Max 

26
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
Profit of I update max array of I 

27
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.460
Finally when both the loop exhaust we will have 

28
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.570
the maximum profit that we can get for that rod 

29
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.650
of length n in max profit of so return one.
