00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.870
We often confuses asymptotic notations with the best and worst 

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.330
cases of an algorithm. mostly we think that big Oh 

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.550
represents the upper bound, 

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.080
So, it is useful for worst case. Theta represents the 

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.910
average bound 

6
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.950
So, it is useful for average case and Omega 

7
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.670
represents lower bound so it is useful for the best 

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.150
case 

9
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.400
This is not true 

10
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.890
We can use any notation for any case 

11
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.410
Asymptotic Notations are the simplest way to represent time 

12
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.080
functions 

13
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.760
It has nothing to do with the best or worst 

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.090
case of an algorithm 

15
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.370
In short, asymptotic notations belong to time functions and 

16
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.270
the time function can be anything 

17
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.360
say best case time function, worst case time function or 

18
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.740
average case time function. That's it.

19
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.760
So don't confuse asymptotic notations with best case or 

20
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.120
worst case analysis.
