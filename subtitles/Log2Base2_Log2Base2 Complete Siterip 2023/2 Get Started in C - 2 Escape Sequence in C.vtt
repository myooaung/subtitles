Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.290
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.559
the escape sequence in C. 

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.440
Now let's say we want to print hello world like this hello and world one after 

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.869
the other in two different lines. So how will we 

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.820
print it ? So I am writing 2 printf functions for 

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.140
hello and world separately in two lines instead of one 

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.380
printf function and I am going to execute it 

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.419
and still result will be like this Hello world together 

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.540
So what I can do here is that I can 

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.370
use an escape sequence and and I am re-writing the function 

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.650
using \n and I am printing Hello \n world

12
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.580
 Now the result will be like this exactly as 

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.260
we wanted it 

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.700
So how did it happen? And what is this escape 

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.470
sequence? Why \ and n were not considered as two 

16
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.590
different characters? 

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.420
It is because there are some such kind of character 

18
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.950
sequences which have an indirect meaning when placed inside double quotes 

19
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.450


20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.030
And this \n is one such escapes sequence 

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.190
which works as a new line character 

22
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.679
Now let us see another case where I want to 

23
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.800
print Happy New Year with the horizontal tab space between 

24
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.970
these three words. Then I can manually give a tab

25
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.530
space while writing the printf statement 

26
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.809
But there is a much easier way

27
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.990
There is this escape sequence \t which will do the job 

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.650
for us. So I can write like this which is 

29
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.899
easier and provides the same result 

30
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.400
Now these are some useful escape sequences and first

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450
we have \n to go to a new line 

32
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.559
and we have \t to print horizontal tab space 

33
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.429
And we have \' to print a single 

34
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.130
quote and \" to print a double quote 

35
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.500


36
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.160
And if you want to print a backslash then you 

37
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.750
can use the escape sequence \\ and you can 

38
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.880
try these and let us know your thoughts 

39
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.630
So that's all and watching this video
