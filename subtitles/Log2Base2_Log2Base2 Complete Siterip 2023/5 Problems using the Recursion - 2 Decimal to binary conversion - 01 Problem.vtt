00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.560
the problems statement is you will be given a decimal 

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.800
number and you need to convert it into its binary 

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.080
value using Recursion for example if the input decimal 

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.790
value is seven the expected output is it's binary 

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.130
equal in 0111 

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.650
And if the input is ten the expected output is 

7
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.390
1010.
