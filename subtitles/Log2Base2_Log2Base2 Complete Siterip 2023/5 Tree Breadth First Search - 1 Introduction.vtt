00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.900
In this video let's have an introduction to breadth

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.550
First search on trees. 

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.540
So when any problem involves traversing the tree level 

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.020
by level we can effectively solve it with using the breadth

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.870
first search technique. For example to print the level order 

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.050
traversal of the tree 

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.590
For this problem we need to print the tree level 

8
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.250
by level 

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.440
For example if this is the given tree the level 

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.480
order traversal  output will be in level one 

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.040
We have node 10

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.420
in level two ,

13
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.170
We have nodes 20 and 30 in level three 

14
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.840
We have nodes 40 50 60 and 70. So the 

15
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.260
final output will be 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70

16
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.850

17
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.550
This problem involves traversing the tree level by level so 

18
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.150
here we can apply BFS technique to solve it 

19
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.690
in BFS we use a queue data

20
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
structure to keep all the nodes at a particular level 

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.100
Let us understand it better by solving problems using this pattern in the next videos.
