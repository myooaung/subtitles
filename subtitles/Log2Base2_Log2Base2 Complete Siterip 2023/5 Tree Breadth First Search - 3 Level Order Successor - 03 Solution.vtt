00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.300
We can re use the level order traversal code and 

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.600
modify it a bit to find level order successor.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.750
Firstly change the function name to level order successor 

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.670
this function takes the root of the tree and the 

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.340
node value that is key as parameters and returns integer

6
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.700


7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.150
That is a level order successor of the given key 

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.720
So firstly if root is equal to null, we can 

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.750
return -1. And as we discussed in the hint 

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.760
while doing level order traversal, if current node's value equals 

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.400
to the key value we need to break out of the loop. 

12
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.070
So write if node's data equal to key 

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.750
break now the level order successor will be present in 

14
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.780
the front of the queue. So get the front node 

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.750
so write node's Star successor equal to queue.front 

16
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.710
now check if it is not if it is not 

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.790
return -1 else we need to return the front data. 

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.110
So write return successor equal to now then minus
