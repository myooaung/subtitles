1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.810
the problem statment is 

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.000
We will be given a two 

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.100
dimensional matrix which will be in sorted manner 

4
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.430
both row vice and column vice and an integer n 

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.310
You have to return true if n is present in 

6
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.060
the matrix let us see an example in this matrix 

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.220
The second row contains elements 9 16 27 36 

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.580
They are in sorted manner and the third column contains 

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.750
elements 18 27 29 32 

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.250
Likewise all the rows and columns are sorted 

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.470
If the given integer is 31 you have to 

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.820
return 

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.050
True as it is present at Position 31 

14
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.460
And if the given integer is 35 you have to 

15
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.110
return false as it is not present in the matrix.
