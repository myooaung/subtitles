00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.450
So we need to find the middle node 

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.880
So what we can do is we can count the 

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.140
number of nodes. 

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.880
Or we can say we can find the length of 

5
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.360
the linked list and divide the length by two and 

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.990
we will get the middle node's position and the node 

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250
at that position can be returned.
