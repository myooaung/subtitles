00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.220
The problem statement is you have to implement two stacks in 

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.800
a single array. For an example 

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.360
Here we have an array of size six. 

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.420
We have to implement two stacks in this array and 

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.640
we should be able to do push and pop operations 

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.250
on either stacks without any error
