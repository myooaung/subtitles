00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.020
in this video let us learn the operations of the 

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.950
DisJoint set 

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.280
It has three main operations 

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.040
The first one is union which is used to connect 

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.850
Or merge two different sets 

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.040
The second one is find which is used to find 

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.710
out which set a particular element belongs to and the 

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.960
last one is isConnected which is used to check 

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.750
whether two elements are connected to each other 

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.910
Let us take a sample set of 10 elements and 

11
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.520
performed these operations here we have 10 elements from 0 

12
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.600
to 9 and

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.250
Consider each element as a unique subset 

14
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.760
Now let us perform the union of elements 

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.150
12 Union means we need to connect these two sets 

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.220
let us connect one and two and it will become 

17
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.180
a new subset 

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.340
And look something like this let us perform another union 

19
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.550
operation on elements 34 

20
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.040
So just connect the elements three and four and it 

21
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.090
will look like this 

22
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.310
Let us perform another union operation on elements four and 

23
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.850
seven 

24
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.850
So just connect the elements four and seven 

25
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.230
And since four is already connected with three it will 

26
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.200
look like this 

27
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.390
So now three four seven will become the new subset 

28
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.400
here 

29
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.560
One thing to node is 

30
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.870
three and seven 

31
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.870
are connected indirectly three iss connected to four and four is 

32
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.960
connected to seven 

33
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.340
Hence three is indirectly connected with elements 

34
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.850
Seven 

35
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.090
Now let us perform another union operation on elements 38 

36
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.360
So connect eight with three and it will become like 

37
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.640
this and we have performed union operations 

38
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.050
And now we have six different subsets 

39
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.830
The first one is subset with element zero 

40
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.170
Then the second one is with elements one and two 

41
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.470
the next one with elements 348 and seven and the 

42
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.270
next with Element five 

43
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.560
The next with elements six and the final subset has 

44
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.650
element nine 

45
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.570
Now let us learn about find operation 

46
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.940
The find operation is used to find out which set 

47
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.760
a particular element belongs to 

48
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.280
In other words the find operation will return the parent 

49
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.480
node of the set to which this given element belongs 

50
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.340
for example find of zero will be zero because the 

51
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.550
element zero is not connected with any element 

52
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.790
The element zero itself act as the root node so find 

53
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.040
of zero will be zero and what will be find 

54
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.820
of two It will be one because element 2 belongs to 

55
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.410
the set 12 

56
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.530
And here the root element is one so find of 

57
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.710
two is one and what will be find of seven 

58
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.770
It will be three because elements seven belonged to the 

59
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.250
set 

60
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.760
3487 and the root element here 

61
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:48.430
is three 

62
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.520
So find of seven is three 

63
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.040
And that's it the find operation will return the root 

64
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.550
node of given element 

65
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.600
Next 

66
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.220
Let us learn the isConnected operation isConnected 

67
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.870
Operation is used to check whether two elements are connected 

68
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.550
or not 

69
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.250
So how can we say two elements are connected to 

70
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.220
each other It's very simple 

71
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.230
When both the element has the same parent then they 

72
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.680
are connected to each other 

73
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.410
for example isConnected of zero and two will be 

74
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.990
false 

75
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.720
Because the parent of zero is zero and parent of 

76
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.570
two is one 

77
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.610
They're different 

78
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.520
So we can say that element zero and two are 

79
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.450
not connected 

80
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.390
We can use the find operation to find the parent 

81
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.300
of each node 

82
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.680
So what will be is connected of seven and eight 

83
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.740
It will be true because the parent of seven is three 

84
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.770
and parent of eight is also three they are the same 

85
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.930
so we can say elements seven and eight are connected 

86
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.560
That's it this is how we can use the 

87
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.050
isConnected operation to check whether two elements are connected to 

88
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.250
each other or not 

89
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.600
Now let us have a quick summary 

90
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.630
The union operation is used to connect a merge two 

91
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.900
different sets find operation is used to get the parent 

92
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.060
of the given element 

93
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.990
In other words it is used to find out which set 

94
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.800
a particular element belongs to 

95
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.170
And finally the isConnected operation is used to check 

96
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.900
whether two elements are connected or not so that's all for 

97
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.600
this video 

98
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.730
And in this video we have learned all three operations 

99
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.460
of disjoint set with graphical representation 

100
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.460
In the next video we will learn how to represent 

101
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.280
disjoint set in an array and also learn how to implement disjoint set.
