00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.170
to solve this problem let us write a function clear 

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.890
right most set bit which takes an integer n and 

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.150
returns an integer 

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.190
We need to perform bitwise and on the given 

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.110
number n its previous number n minus one 

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.660
So write n bitwise and n minus one 

7
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.210
And that will be the result in value so return 

8
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.550
it.
