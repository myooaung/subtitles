1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.810
the problem 

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.640
Statement is

3
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.450
You will be given a numerator and a denominator 

4
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.330
And you need to find Modulo using Recursion for 

5
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.320
example if num equal to 7 and den equal to 3 

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
the expected output is one 

7
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.870
That is the reminder we get after dividing seven by 

8
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.980
three and if Num is ten and Den is four the 

9
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.360
expected output is two which is the reminder we get 

10
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.450
after dividing 10 by four.
