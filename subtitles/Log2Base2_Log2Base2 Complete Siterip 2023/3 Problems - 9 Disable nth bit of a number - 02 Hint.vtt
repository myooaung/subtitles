00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.120
So which bitwise operator can we use to disable 

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.550
nth bit in a number?

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.940
It is bitwise AND operator. Because if we do 

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.760
bitwise AND between one and zero, we will get zero 

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.250
And if we do bitwise AND between zero and zero 

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.190
also we will get zero.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.050
So what we can do here is, we can create 

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.120
a bit mask with the nth bit alone set to zero

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.150
and all the remaining bits set to one.

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
Now if we do bitwise AND between the number and 

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.000
the bit mask, the nth bit will be set to zero.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.060
and the remaining bits will remain the same as 

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.170
it is in the number. 

14
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.300
So let us take an example. 

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.720
her the number is 58 and we are going to disable 

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.950
the fifth bit here

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.610
First let us create a bit mask with the fifth bit

18
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.690
alone set to zero and the remaining bits set to one.

19
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.050


20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.950
So how can we do that? From our previous videos,

21
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.810
we know how to create a bit mask with nth bit 

22
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.750
alone set to one with the remaining bits set to zero. 

23
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.270
we need to do 1 left shift n-1

24
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.680
right? that is, here it will be one left shift four

25
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880
So we will get the fifth bit alone 

26
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.840
set to one and all other bits to zero. 

27
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.610


28
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.320
But our bit mask should be nth  

29
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.850
Bit alone set to zero and all other bits one

30
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.720
which is 

31
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.470
actually it's compliment. 

32
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.070
So if we take complement of this, we will get 

33
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.070
our required bit mask that is nth bit alone will 

34
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.400
be set to zero and the remaining bits will be 

35
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.150
set to one. 

36
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
So let us do a bitwise AND operation between 

37
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.710
the number and the bitmask.

38
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.330
See, in the result, the fifth bit has been disabled 

39
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.260
that is, it has been set to zero and the 

40
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.740
remaining bits will remain unchanged because when we perform  

41
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.570
bitwise AND operation with one, the bit's value will not change 

42
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.350
as zero AND one is zero and one AND one is one 

43
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.330
So after disabling the fifth bit, the value in num will be 42.
