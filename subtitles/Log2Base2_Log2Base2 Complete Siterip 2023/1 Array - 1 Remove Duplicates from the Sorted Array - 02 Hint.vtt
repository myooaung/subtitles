00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.420
so how can we perform this task? We can compare adjacent 

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.980
elements of the array and only if they are different, place 

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.340
it in array and increment a length variable and this 

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.770
should be continued till the end of the array.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.750
So iterate the array elements till size-1

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.560
and check the elements at indices i and i+1

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.250


8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.450
If they are not the same, place ith element in 

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.510
the array and then increment length and this should be 

10
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.900
continued and finally place the last element in the array 

11
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.030
and increment length and then we can return it.
