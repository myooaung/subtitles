00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
You will be given a binary tree and your task 

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.650
is to print the tree in level order 

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.930
For example, if this is the given tree in level 

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.540
one we have the node 10.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.350
In level two, we have nodes 20 and 30 

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.850
in level three.

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.950
We have nodes 40 50 60 and 70 

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.320
So the output will be 10 20 30 40 50 60 

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.150
and 70.
