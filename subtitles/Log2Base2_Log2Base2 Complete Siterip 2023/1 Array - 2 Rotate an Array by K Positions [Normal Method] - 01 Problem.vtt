00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.300
The problem statement is you will be given an array 

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.650
and a value K. 

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.290
Your task is to rotate the array by K positions.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.670
For example, if given array is 1 2 3 4 5 and given value K 

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.250
is equal to two.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.350
So we need to rotate the array by two positions.

7
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:32.820
After rotating the array by one position, we will get 5 1 2 3 4 and 

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.660
after rotating one more position, we get 4 5 1 2 3. 

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.020
So your task is to write the logic for this problem and 

10
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.680
submit it using the below compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs.

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.470
 

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.550
If the input is 1 2 3 4 5 and K is equal to two

13
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.420
the expected output is the array 4 5 1 2 3. If the 

14
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.470
input is the array  1 2 3 4 5 and K is equal to three, the expected output is the array 3 4 5 1 2.
