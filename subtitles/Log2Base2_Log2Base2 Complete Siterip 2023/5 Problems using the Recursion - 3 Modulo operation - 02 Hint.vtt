1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.950
as we know 

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.900
If numerator is lesser than the denominator value the numerator 

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.880
is the answer 

4
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.130
Otherwise we need to find the reminder by dividing the 

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.460
numerator by the denominator instead of division 

6
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.330
For this problem we can continuously subtract the denominator from 

7
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.000
the numerator until numerator is less 

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.150
Than the dominator the numerator is less than the denominator 

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.910
We can return the numerator value 

10
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.780
For example if the given numerator is 10 and denominator 

11
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.330
is four instead of dividing 10 by four we can subtract 

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.430
four from 10 and we get six so called a 

13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.200
function again with this value six and the denominator of 

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
four and here also numerator is not less than the 

15
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.800
denominator so subtract and six minus four we will get 

16
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.450
two so called a function again with two and four 

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.340
and now here two is less than four that is 

18
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.960
numerator is less than denominator 

19
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860
So the result will be the numerator so we can return two that's our expected result.
