00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.020
In the previous video we have learned how to calculate 

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.460
the sum of all sub arrays using the sliding window 

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.050
method.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.870
For this problem we need to find the sub array 

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.750
which has the maximum sum

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.620
So just declare one max variable and update its value 

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.340
whenever a greater sub array sum is found and finally return

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.530
the maximum value.

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.110
So first sub array sum is five. So store it 

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.740
in max.

11
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.320
Next sub array sum is 10 

12
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.010
It is larger than the current max value. So update 

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.290
max the next sub  array is 8 which is smaller 

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.050
than max.

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.450
So do not make any change. In the next sub array

16
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.900
sum is 11 which is greater than max

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.350
So update Max and finally return the value in max
