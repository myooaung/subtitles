00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.110
to solve this problem Let us write a function is 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.410
power of two which takes an integer and returns in 

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.700
integer 

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.380
we need to AND the given number and its previous 

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.880
number 

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.820
So write 

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.390
N AND N minus one if the result is zero we 

8
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.450
need to return one 

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.820
So write if n and n minus one equal to 

10
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.370
0 

11
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.180
then return one otherwise return zero that's it.
