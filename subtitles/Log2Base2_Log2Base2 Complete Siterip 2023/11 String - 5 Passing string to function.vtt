Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.880
In this video we are going to discuss about passing a string into a function

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.260
First let us see how to pass 

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.130
character by character of a string into a function 

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.650
So here we have the main function and there we're 

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.389
declaring a string hello with name str and declare an 

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.310
integer variable 

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.410
Next we have a for loop and in each iteration 

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.000
we are calling the function by passing str[i] So 

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.710
in the first iteration we are passing str[0] 

11
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.670
which is H and it will be printed in the 

12
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.220
function 

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.360
In the second iteration we are calling the function by passing 

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.430
str[1] that is e which will be printed 

15
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.850
and in the third iteration The function is called with 

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.940
str[2] that is 'l' which will be printed 

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.020
and in the fourth iteration we are passing str[3] 

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.529
 which is 'l' and it will be printed in 

19
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.540
the fifth iteration 

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.410
We are calling the function by passing str[4] which 

21
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.840
is 'o' and it is printed in the sixth iteration condition 

22
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.470
fails and control comes out of the for loop and 

23
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.400
the programme returns zero. Now let us see what happens if 

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.310
we pass an entire string into a function so consider

25
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.300
the programme with main function and the user defined function

26
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.340
fun. first we create the string str equal 

27
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.390
to Hello and now we call the function fun

28
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.490
and by passing Str 

29
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.460
Since we are passing the name of the string, the address 

30
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.330
of First Element is passed to the function so here 

31
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.060
1024 is passed to the function now in a for 

32
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.270
loop we are printing each character in the first iteration 

33
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.039
H is printed and in the second iteration, e is printed in 

34
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.630
the third iteration, l is printed in the Forth Iteration l is 

35
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.770
again printed and finally in the fifth iteration o is Printed 

36
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.589
In the sixth iteration condition is str[5] which 

37
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.560
is null character 

38
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.860
So it fails and control returns to Main and returns

39
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.330
zero 

40
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.539
Now what happens if we make any modification in the 

41
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.720
function? Will it affect the actual value? So consider this 

42
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.400
programme here in Main function 

43
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.150
We are creating the string Hello and now we print it

44
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.810
before we call the function and we get Hello

45
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.940
printed now 

46
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.900
we call the function by passing str so the base address 

47
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.120
of the string or we can say the address of first 

48
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
character is passed which is 1024 now in the function 

49
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.130
in a for loop,we set each character equal to 'a'

50
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.170
in the first iteration first character is set to a in the 

51
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.970
second iteration second character is set to a In the third iteration 

52
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.790
third character is set to a in Forth Iteration l is changed to a and 

53
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.360
finally in 5th, o is changed to a and we return 

54
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.859
to Main

55
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.780
And there We print the string after calling the function and 

56
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.790
we get aaaaa printed 

57
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.910
So it is important that since we're passing the reference 

58
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.810
to the function if we modify the string element it 

59
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.150
will change the actual value of the string

60
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.010
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
