00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.070
the problem

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.810
Statement is 

3
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.760
You will be given a rotated sorted array and you 

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.330
have to find the index of the Pivot element 

5
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.670
or in other words the smallest element in the array 

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.050
Let's see some examples 

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.990
This is sorted array before rotation 

8
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.500
20 25 60 70 80 Initially the first index will hold 

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.060
the smallest element of the array After three rotations the array 

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.150
would look like this 

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.460
The last three elements have come to the first three 

12
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.510
positions and hence the smallest number has gone to somewhere 

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.150
in the middle 

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750
Our input array is will look like this 

15
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.370
In this case we have to return Index three which 

16
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.550
holds the smallest element 20 

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.180
If the given array is this 10 0 2 4 we have 

18
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.850
to return index one which holds the pivot element zero.
