1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.710
you will be given sorted array and an integer n 

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.460
you have to find and return appropriate position to insert 

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.530
this new element n so that the array remains 

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.150
sorted 

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.960
If the element n is already present in the array you 

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.870
have to return the array index of that element 

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.650
Let us take this array arr with elements 14 17 

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.050
25 26 32 

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.230
We have to insert Element 20 in such a way 

10
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.360
that arr remains sorted arr of one is 17 and 

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.540
arr of two is 25 

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.550
Thus the appropriate position to be inserted is 2 

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.360
And if the array is two for six and eight 

14
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.380
and the given integer is two you have to 

15
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.150
return index zero where element two is already present.
