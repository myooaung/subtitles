00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
In this video, let us discuss the properties of  

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.440
asymptotic notations 

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.050
The first one is the general property 

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.510
If f(n) is O(g(n)) then 

5
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.300
K*f(n) is O(g(n))

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.650


7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.220
Here K is a constant value 

8
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060
Let us take this example If f(n)= 5n+3 

9
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.770
 what will be big oh notation for 

10
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.770
 5n+3 it is big Oh of n. Now 

11
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.960
let us multiply f(n) with some constant value 

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.040
Say 10 it will become 10*f(n) 

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.070
that is 10*5n+3  that is 

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.360
50n + 30 Now what will be big Oh notation 

15
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.430
for 50n + 30, It is also big Oh of n

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.520
So, it means that if we know big Oh notation 

17
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.190
for f(n) Then if we multiply some constant with 

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.480
f(n) then Big O will also be the 

19
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.970
same 

20
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.500
The same property is true for other notations too. 

21
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.780
That is, if f(n) is omega of g(n) 

22
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.870
then K*f(n) is omega of g(n) 

23
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.210


24
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.040
If f(n) is theta of g(n) then 

25
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.220
K*f(n) is Theta of g(n) 

26
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.340
The second one is reflexive property 

27
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.110
If f(n) is given then f(n) is 

28
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.150
 big Oh of f(n)

29
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.280
This means if a function f(n) is upper bound 

30
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.500
to itself we can straight away say it's big Oh of 

31
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.800
f(n). For example, if f(n) is n^2

32
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.760
that we can straight away say f(n) 

33
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.810
is Big oh of n^2 

34
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.400
If f(n) is n^3 then we can straight 

35
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.470
away say f(n) is O(n^3)

36
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.100
That's it.

37
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.570
The next property is transitive property 

38
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950
If f(n) is O(g(n)) and 

39
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.240
g(n) is O(h(n)) than f(n) 

40
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.720
is O(h(n)) 

41
00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.810
For example let us assume f(n) 

42
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.110
is O(n) 

43
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.580
g(n) is O(n^2) and h(n)

44
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.160
is O(n^3)

45
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.540
If f(n)

46
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.140
is O(g(n)) which is O(n^2) 

47
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.290
and g(n) that is n^2

48
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.340
is O(h(n))  that is n^3

49
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.460
Then we can say f(n)

50
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.470
is O(h(n))  which is  

51
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.950
O(n^3)

52
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.430
It's very simple 

53
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.410
When g(n) is upper bound to f(n)

54
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.670
and h(n) is upper bound to  

55
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.080
g(n)

56
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.800
Then h(n) is also upper bound to  

57
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.150
f(n) 

58
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.950
That's it 

59
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.340
This property is true for all three notations 

60
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.420
Next Let us discuss about symmetric property 

61
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.880
This property is only true for the Theta notation

62
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.780
If f(n) is Theta of g(n)

63
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.780
 then g(n) is theta of f(n)

64
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.100


65
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.450
For example 

66
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.730
f(n) is theta of n^2 and g(n) 

67
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.720
is also theta of n^2 

68
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.990
We can say f(n) is theta of g(n)

69
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.230
 that is n^2 and g(n) is theta

70
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.700
of f(n)  that is n^2. Then both functions 

71
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.630
are the same. 

72
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.250
They are symmetric, so we can say first function is 

73
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.440
theta of second one and second function is theta of 

74
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.470
first one. Here, an important thing to notice This property 

75
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.990
is true only for theta annotation 

76
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.140
It won't apply for Big Oh and omega notation Next 

77
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.800
is transpose symmetric 

78
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.790
This property only applies to Big Oh and omega notation 

79
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.340
If f(n) is big of g(n) then 

80
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.900
g(n) is omega of f(n)

81
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.500
And viceversa. For example, if f(n) is n 

82
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.360
and g(n) is n^2 and f(n) is big of g(n)

83
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.670
 that is n is O(n^2) 

84
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.650
and g(n) is omega of f(n) that 

85
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.820
his n^2 is omege of n. The same property 

86
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.540
is true for vice versa form that is if f(n)

87
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.300
is omega of g(n) then g(n) 

88
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.920
is big Oh of f(n)

89
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.270
For example let us take a f(n) as n^2

90
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.790
g(n) as n then f(n) is omega of

91
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.630
g(n) that is n^2 is omega of n

92
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.220
and g(n) is big Oh of n that 

93
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.370
is n is  big Oh of n^2.

94
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.220
That's it. This property only applies to Big oh and 

95
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.440
omega notations 

96
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.730
So in this video we have learned about the properties

97
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.440
of asymptotic notations 

98
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.840
In the next video we will learn some other observations on Asymptotic notations
