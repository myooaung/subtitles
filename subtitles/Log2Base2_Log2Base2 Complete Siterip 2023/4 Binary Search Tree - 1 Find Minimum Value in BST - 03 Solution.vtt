00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.310
We need to return the minimum value of the BST.

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.290
So let us create a function min_val and 

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.550
pass the root node of the tree into it.

4
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.430
In BST the minimum value will be present in the 

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.760


6
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.280
left most node. So create a temporary variable current and let it 

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.190
point the root of the tree. Now use this current 

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.830
pointer to move to the left child of the node

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.360
continuously till we reach the left most node.

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.150


11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.420
So write while current left not equal to null, make 

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.350
current equal to current left.

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.040
So at the end of the loop execution, the current 

14
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.030
pointer will point to the left most node which has 

15
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.960
the minimum value.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.490
So after the loop execution, return current's data 

17
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.140
Here it is 10
