Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.210
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.630
the datatypes in C.

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.350
So to store or access any data in our programme 

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.290
First we need to define it's data type. 

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.070
Suppose we want to use age in our programme 

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.520
So first thing to do is to define its data 

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.740
type

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.180
And how do you choose the correct data type Since 

9
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.550
we always have a whole number for age we can 

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.890
choose the integer data type. so we can have values 

11
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.839
like 20 25 et cetera 

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.680
And what about 20.3 Now you cannot have a decimal 

13
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.640
number for integer data type and in some cases we 

14
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.510
need to use decimal numbers as well 

15
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.580
For example if you want to use weight in your programme 

16
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.490
and weight need not necessarily be a whole number all the 

17
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.820
time 

18
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.260
So we need another data type which can have decimal 

19
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.850
values 

20
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.760
For that we have the floating point data type and you 

21
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.309
can have values like 52.3 kg 70.5 kg etc

22
00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.600

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.820
Now let's see some basic data types and their size 

24
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.750
As per GCC. The size of integer data type is 

25
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.970
four bytes and it is used to store and 

26
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.750
integer value 

27
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.730
Some examples are -5,-1, 0, 4 etc 

28
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.660
Float data type is used to store a floating point number or 

29
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.570
a number with a fractional part 

30
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.630
And it is also called a single precision floating point 

31
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.540
number the size of float is four bytes 

32
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.240
And these are some examples 

33
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.300
Next we have the double or double precision floating point 

34
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.820
number 

35
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.550
It provides more space to store a number 

36
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.449
The size of double is eight bytes and these are 

37
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.550
some examples 

38
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.190
Next we have char data type which is used 

39
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.110
to store a single character such as a,b,c *,# etc.

40
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.950
and it is of size 1 byte

41
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.620
Next we have void data type. It is of size 1 byte and 

42
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.210
it's an incomplete data type which is mainly used in 

43
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.390
functions as return type or argument type

44
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.170
An example is void fun that is 

45
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.210
fun will not be returning anything we will 

46
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.130
be discussing about void type in later lessons 

47
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.530
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
