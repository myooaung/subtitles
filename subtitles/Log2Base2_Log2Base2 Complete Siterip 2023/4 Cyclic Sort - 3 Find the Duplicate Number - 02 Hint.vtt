00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.100
Since the numbers are in a given range, we can 

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.150
use cyclic sort to identify the duplicate.  

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.730
So as usual check if the numbers are present in the correct 

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.480
indices.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.300
If not, bring the numbers to its correct position 

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.710
by swapping it while swapping the numbers 

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.660
If both index has the same value that will be 

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.580
the duplicate number. Before swapping the number, check 

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.640
Ii both are same. If they are the same then 

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.610
return that number as the duplicate number. Here while swapping 

11
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.370
the numbers we have value two at both the indices

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.210
so simply return that number two.
