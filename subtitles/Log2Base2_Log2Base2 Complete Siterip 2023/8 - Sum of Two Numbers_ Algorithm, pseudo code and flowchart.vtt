Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.990
In this video let us learn   

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.860
how to write an algorithm, pseudo code and draw flow chart

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.250
 for the task to find the sum of two numbers 

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.090
For example, if we have two numbers 10 and 20 given as the input

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.159
we have to find the sum of these two numbers

7
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.200
which is 30 as the output.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.640
So that is the task. 

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.020
We have to read two numbers from the user

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.790
find the sum and print the result as the output. 


11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.150
So how can we perform this task? 

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.850
Let us write the algorithm for this task.

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.980
So the first step is to start the process 

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.430
And we will need three variables here.  

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.590
num1 and num2 to store the input numbers 

16
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.870
and sum to store the result. 

17
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.060
So second step is to declare these three variables 

18
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.180
Now we have the variables ready.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.450
 But we don't have the numbers to be added 

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.140
It should be read from the user

21
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.950
to num1 and num2

22
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.050
So that is the third step.

23
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.320
Read the numbers from user to num1 and num2.

24
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.820
Now the numbers are here 

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.510
Now we need to find the sum 

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.650
and store it in variable sum. 

27
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.400
So forth step is to add num1 and num2 

28
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.170
and the result is assigned to variable sum.

29
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.040
 Now fifth step is to print the result on screen

30
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.870
That is display sum.   

31
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.190
And the last step is to stop the process 

32
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.520
So that was the algorithm. 

33
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.550
Now let us write the pseudo code. 

34
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.580
First begin and get input to num1 and num2

35
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.350
And next, add num1 and num2 and assign to sum 

36
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.960
So sum=num1+num2  

37
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.380
finally print sum and end. 

38
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.980
So that was the pseudo code. 

39
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.340
And now let us draw the flow chart for this process 

40
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.950
First start and to start a process or end a process 

41
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.649
we use this oval symbol 

42
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.360
Next get input to x and y 

43
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.450
and we use a parallelogram symbol for input and output functions. 

44
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.879
Next we have to find sum which is equal to x+y

45
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.290
And we will use this rectangle symbol  

46
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.490
to denote these kind of processings or computations

47
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.150
Next print this sum on the screen and end 

48
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.380
So our task was to read two numbers from user 

49
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530
and find and print it's sum on the screen

50
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.730
 and we learnt how to write algorithm, pseudo code and flowchart for this task.
