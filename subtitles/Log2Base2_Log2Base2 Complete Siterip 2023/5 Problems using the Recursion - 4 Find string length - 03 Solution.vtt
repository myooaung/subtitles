00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.770
so let us write a recursive function str length which takes 

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.020
the string and index as parameters and it returns integer 

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.680
which will be the length of the string 

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.040
So we need a static variable to store the length 

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.240
So write static int length equal to zero now we need 

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500
to check if the character at index is valid or 

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.990
not 

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.570
And if str of index is valid that is 

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.100
it is not null character 

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.950
We need to increment length and called the next recursive 

11
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.260
function with index plus one value so write if 

12
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.440
str of index not equal to null character then length plus 

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.860
plus and return str length of str coma index plus 

14
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.250
one 

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.350
Otherwise that is if str of index is equal to 

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.360
null character 

17
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.600
We need to stop the recursive calls and return their 

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.650
length so right If str of index is equal to 

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.510
null character then return length and that's we have implented the logic recursive to find string length.
