1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.200
you will be given an unsigned individual as input 

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.280
Your task is to clear its right most set 

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.370
Bit For example Let us take the number 12 which 

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.750
is 00001100 as input Here the right most set bit 

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.710
is this one 

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.660
We need to clear this one 

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.350
That is we need to change this 1 to 0 

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.150
After clearing the right most bid we need to return 

9
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.200
the resulted number here 

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.020
The resulted number is eight 

11
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.710
So the expected output 

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.710
is eight if the given input is 15 that 00001111

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.650
Here the right most set bit is this one 

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.520
And if we clear it the expected output is the 

15
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.580
decimal equivalent of this resulted binary sequence which is number 

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.250
14.
