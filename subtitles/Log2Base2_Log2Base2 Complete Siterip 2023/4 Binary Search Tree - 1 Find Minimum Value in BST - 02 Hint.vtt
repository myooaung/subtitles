1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
In a binary search tree 

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.540
The node with minimum value will be the left most node 

3
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:04.910


4
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.650
So just traverse the binary search tree till you reach 

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.100
the left most node and finally return the data present 

6
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.730
in the left most node.

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.550
