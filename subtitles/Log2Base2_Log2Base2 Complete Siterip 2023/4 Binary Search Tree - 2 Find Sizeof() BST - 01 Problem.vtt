00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.640
The problem statement is 

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.020
You will be given a binary tree as the 

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.880
input and you need to print its size 

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.560
That is the number of nodes present in the tree given.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.090


6
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.380
For example, if the given input binary tree is this

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.380


8
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.640
The output should be size equal to seven.
