00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.650
Hello friends in this video let us understand  

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.150
what is programming and what is the need for programming languages.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.810
So firstly let me ask you a question 

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.640
Why do we need a language like English, Chinese, Arabic etc.?

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.640
Because when two people are interacting with each other 

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.290
we need a medium to convey our thoughts 

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.450
It should be understandable between these two people 

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.270
For that we have languages. 

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.480
And a language will have some sort of vocabulary and grammar 

10
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.490
The vocabulary defines the subject, verb, objects, symbols etc.


11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.890
Example Alan Cricket Play etc


12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.720
The grammar defines how to use those vocabulary.

13
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.049
That is if I say Alan Cricket play 

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.440
It does not have a particular meaning 

15
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.170
It could be Alan played Cricket 

16
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.940
Alan Plays Cricket 

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.480
Alan will play cricket 

18
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.340
Alan has been playing cricket 

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.530
It could be anything like this.

20
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.060
So we need a Grammar to define the use of these words 

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.870
Take an example : "Alan Plays Cricket" is a subject verb object pattern 

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.790
that follows the correct grammar

23
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.170
But if we interchange these words, what will happen?  

24
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.360
For example "plays Alan cricket" or "cricket Alan plays" etc. 

25
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.720
It will be meaningless 

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.070
So simply grammar defines the standard structure or pattern  

27
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.630
to use the vocabulary  

28
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.950
Here both are humans. 

29
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.330
So they will understand the vocabulary and grammar of the English language

30
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:39.350
So there is no issue in sharing their thoughts. 

31
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.090
But what if a human want to interact with the computer?

32
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.660
Here the computer won't understand these vocabulary and grammar 

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.320
of the English language or any other language like English 

34
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.960
Computer has its own language and it has its own vocabulary and grammar.

35
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.700
And that is known as the programming language.

36
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.550
Here the vocabularies are int, char, float, for, while

37
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.530
symbols like + - etc. 

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.130
and the programming language grammar is something like "operand + operand" 

39
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.900
that is when we add two numbers using + operator 

40
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.650
The operator + should be between the operands

41
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.580
Example A + B

42
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.880
 here + is the operator and A and B are the operands

43
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.490
 and here + is surrounded by operands.

44
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.840
So the grammar is correct.

45
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.390
And if the grammar is incorrect the computer won't understand it. 


46
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.120
For example if we write +AB or AB+ 

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.830
 the computer won't understand it 

48
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.440
The grammar should be correct. 

49
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.910
So simply using native languages like English, Chinese   

50
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.220
two people can interact with each other.

51
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.970
and using programming language, a human can interact with computers. 

52
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.640
Now let us understand what is a program.

53
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.070
Here if first person wants second person to get the pencil and throw it away

54
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.230
 person1 should provide a clear instruction to person2

55
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.740
This is known as a task.

56
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.090
and using this first  person gets a job done using second person 


57
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.930
Similarly if a person wants to get a job done by a computer

58
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.450
 he should provide a clear instruction in the computer known language. 

59
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.970
For example to add two numbers A and B 

60
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.429
He should give instructions like this 

61
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.270
int a=10; int b= 20; int sum = a+b;

62
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.550
Here this step by step instructions is known as the program 

63
00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:43.790
so a collection of instructions that performs a specific task 

64
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.190
is known as a computer program.

65
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.990
And to accomplish various tasks using computer 

66
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.760
we need to write various programs 

67
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.760
This process of designing and building an executable computer program

68
00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.079
 for accomplishing different tasks is known as Programming.

69
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04.03.710
And who is a Programmer ?

70
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.660
The person who writes these programs is known as the computer programmer

71
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.650
 so that's all about programming language and programming 

72
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.549
In the next video we will understand why programming is so important.
