00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.530
You will be given a linked list with a loop 

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.050
and your task is to find the starting point of 

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.450
the loop and return it. 

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.680
For example, if this is the given linked list,

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.770
the starting point of the loop here is the node with 

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.350
value four. And if this is the given linked list 

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.370
the starting point of the loop is the node with 

8
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.250
value three.
