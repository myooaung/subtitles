00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.780
In the last movie we saw how to find the 

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.880
first and last of occurrence of an element in the array

3
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.940
using a modified version of binary search 

4
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.660
We shall make use of the same logic here 

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.880
Let us find the first occurrence of integer n 

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.520
in the array 

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.280
For this the larger case do a binary search of 

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.720
integer in the array and whenever we find the integer 

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.190
we should store the respective array index in a variable 

10
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.270
and continue the search by pointing end to mid 

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.040
Minus one does 

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.130
At the end we will have the first position of 

13
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.650
the integer in a variable 

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.700
Next let us find the last of occurrence of the 

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.190
integer 

16
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.180
For this again we have to do a binary search 

17
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.280
And whenever the integer is found we will store the 

18
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.520
index in a variable and continue the search by pointing 

19
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.050
start to mid plus one 

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.680
We will now have the first and last occurrence 

21
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.580
of the integer in two variables 

22
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.090
Thus we can calculate count by doing last pos minus first pos plus one.
