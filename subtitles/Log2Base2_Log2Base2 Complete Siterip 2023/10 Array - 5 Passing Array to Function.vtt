Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.940
In this video we're going to discuss about passing an 

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.199
array into a function. 

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.300
So first of all consider a programme which passes array

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.810
elements into a function 

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.500
So here we have the main function and there we are

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.770
declaring an integer array arr with elements 10 20 30 40 

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.410
and 50 

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.960
And now we declare an integer variable i. now in 

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.709
a for loop  we are calling the function display(arr[i])

11
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.699
so in each iteration the element of array will 

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.559
be passed to the function display 

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.430
So in the first iteration we are calling the function 

14
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.620
by passing arr[0] which is 10 and it will 

15
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.900
be printed in the function 

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.460
In the second iteration we are calling the function by passing 

17
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.660
arr[1] that is 20 which will be 

18
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.010
printed in the third iteration 

19
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.970
We are calling the function by passing arr[2] that 

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.760
is 30 which will be printed. In the fourth iteration 

21
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.830
we are calling the function by passing arr[3] which 

22
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.870
is 40 and it will be printed. In the fifth iteration 

23
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.590
We're calling the function by passing arr[4] which 

24
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.589
is 50 and it is printed.

25
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.750
In the sixth iteration condition fails and control comes 

26
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.230
out of for loop and the programme returns zero Now let us 

27
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.979
see what happens if we pass an entire array 

28
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.880
into a function 

29
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.860
So consider the programme with main function and the user 

30
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.270
defined function display 

31
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.360
First we create the array with elements 10 20 30 40 

32
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.980
and 50 

33
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.090
Now we call the function display by passing arr and 5

34
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.100
So we are passing the name of the array 

35
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.220
So when we passed the array name into a 

36
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.929
function the address of the first element or the base 

37
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.399
address of the array is passed into the function 

38
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.280
Remember that the entire elements will not be passed into 

39
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.450
the function so here 1024 is passed into the function 

40
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.150
here 

41
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.250
In the function parameter, the size of array is optional 

42
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.340
Now in a for loop we are printing each element 

43
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.479
in the first iteration 10 is printed and in the second 

44
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.310
iteration 20 is printed and in the third iteration 30 is printed 

45
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.270
and in the fourth iteration 40 is printed and finally in 

46
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.710
the fifth iteration 50 is printed. In the sixth iteration 

47
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.340
condition i less than  size fails and control returns to main 

48
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.350
and return zero.

49
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.359
Now what if we had an assignment statement like this? 

50
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.750
array[2] = 100 then third element is set 

51
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.490
100 

52
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.170
So it is important that since we are passing the 

53
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.560
reference to the function if we modify the array elements 

54
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.870
it will change the actual value of the array

55
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.829
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
