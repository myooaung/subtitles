Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.019
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.440
the Basic Structure of a C program.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.100
For every C programme We have two major sections 

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.930
First one is the header section and the second one 

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.580
is the main section First let us learn

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.709
Why we need this header section. In the header section 

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.080
We will include some of the standard header files and 

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.930
the header files consist of multiple pre written codes

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.730
For example stdio.h math.h et cetera 

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
and in stdio.h we have pre-written 

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.410
codes for printf, scanf et cetera. for reading or writing 

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.379
the data 

13
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.650
And if you want to use these functions you definitely 

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.720
need to include the header file stdio.h

15
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.089
and in math.h will have all 

16
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.580
the mathematical functions definitions like finding the power or square 

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.239
root of a number again 

18
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.430
If you want to use these functions you shall include  

19
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.680
math.h header file

20
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.009
So that is the header section where we include the header 

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.059
files like these and then we have the main 

22
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.540
section and every program must have this main function 

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.050
And when we run the programme the operating system begins the 

24
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.110
execution from the main function and we can write the 

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.650
code inside main function 

26
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.250
And both these sections together make a C programme 

27
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.530
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
