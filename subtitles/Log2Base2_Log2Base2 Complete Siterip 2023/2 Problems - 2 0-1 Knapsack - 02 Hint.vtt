00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.700
in this video let us learn how to solve 01 

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.060
knapsack problem Using dynamic programming let us take the following 

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.460
items with weights 1345 and it value or profit is 

4
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.650
1457 The capacity of the knapsack is seven 

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.850
Now we need to fill the knapsack with given items 

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.450
with maximum profit 

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.770
But here the important thing is we cannot break an 

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.830
item and take it 

9
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.890
Either we need to take it fully or leave it 

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.010
That is 01 property 

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.020
We can solve this using dynamic programming in each step 

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.510
we need to find the sub solutions and using that 

13
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.500
sub solution we can arrive at the overall optimal solution first 

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.920
let us place all the items and knapsack capacity 

15
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.440
in a row 

16
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.690
column manner here Each item is placed in a row 

17
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.500
with its weight and value and the knapsack capacity is 

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.020
seven 

19
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.380
So we have placed 0 to 7 in the columns 

20
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.800
Now we need to fill the table with sub solutions 

21
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.840
All the entries in the table is a sub solution 

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.550
to smaller sub problems 

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.480
For example this position will have the sub solution for 

24
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.790
the problem but the maximum capacity of the knapsack 

25
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.070
is one with only one item and this position will 

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.060
have the subsolution for the problem 

27
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.660
For the maximum capacity of the knapsack is four with 

28
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.650
two items one and three 

29
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.830
This position will have the sub solution for the problem 

30
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.000
of the maximum capacity of the knapsack is six with 

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.550
items 13 and four 

32
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.830
And this position will have the sub solution for the 

33
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.420
problem 

34
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.300
But the maximum capacity of the knapsack is seven with 

35
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.720
items 134 and five And this is exactly our problems 

36
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.390
statement 

37
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.370
So the final solution will be present here to arrive 

38
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.470
at this position 

39
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.950
We need to solve all these sub problems one by one 

40
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.070
So let us solve it one by one Here the 

41
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.500
knapsack capacity is zero but the weight of the available 

42
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.650
item is one 

43
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.310
So we cannot pick this so fill it with zero 

44
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.570
Similarly we cannot pick anything when the knapsack capacity is 

45
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.990
zero 

46
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.450
So make the first column with zero 

47
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.100
Now here the knapsack capacity is one and the weight 

48
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.170
of available item as also one 

49
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.150
So we can pick this item 

50
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.200
So the value we get by picking this item is 

51
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.350
one So fill it with one 

52
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.800
And for this entire row whatever made the capacity of knapsack 

53
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.130
the available item 

54
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.080
weight is one 

55
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.950
So we cannot pick anything 

56
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.560
More than one kg so filled the entire room with 

57
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.170
one 

58
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.120
Now here the capacity of knapsack is one but the 

59
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.970
available item weight is three so we cannot pick the item 

60
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.650
And if we are not picking this item what will 

61
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.170
be the maximum value we are leaving item three from the 

62
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.160
available option 

63
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.340
That means the maximum we can get is whatever the 

64
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.950
maximum profit we can get from item one 

65
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.100
And what is the maximum profit We will get the 

66
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.510
knapsack 

67
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.890
capacity is one and with only first item That 

68
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.610
is this position here 

69
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.210
The value is one so simply placed the same value 

70
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.670
here 

71
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.440
What does that mean When the capacity of knapsack is 

72
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.390
one and we have two items with wait one and three 

73
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.630
The maximum profit we can make is only one next 

74
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.070
here 

75
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.740
The capacity of knapsack is two and the weight 

76
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.680
of available item is three 

77
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.420
So we can't pick this item 

78
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.680
So the maximum profit we can make by not picking 

79
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.690
this item as one we can reuse this subsolution so 

80
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.750
we can place one here Also 

81
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.430
This means when the capacity of knapsack is two 

82
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.550
And we have two items with wait one and three 

83
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.930
The maximum profit we can make is one next 

84
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.420
The capacity of knapsack is three and the weight of available 

85
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.340
item is also three Here we have two options 

86
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.080
We can either pick the item or leave the item 

87
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.360
That is the maximisation problem 

88
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.210
So we need to take the maximum of profit we 

89
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.770
get by picking this item and profit 

90
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.910
If we are leaving this item let us calculate the 

91
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.450
profit 

92
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.250
If we are picking this item if we pick the 

93
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.040
item three the value we get is four and it's 

94
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.880
not over 

95
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.550
We also need to add the profit for the remaining 

96
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.220
capacity of the knapsack here the knapsack 

97
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.210
Capacity is three and the available item weight is also three 

98
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.080
So the weight remaining in the knapsack is zero 

99
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.190
And what will be the maximum profit when the knapsack 

100
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.370
capacity zero Here we have picked three so the available 

101
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.000
item is item one 

102
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
So when the capacity of knapsack is zero and available 

103
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.580
item is one the maximum profit we can get is 

104
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.330
Zero 

105
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.570
So add 0 to 4 this value we can get by moving 

106
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.000
one row up and three steps back 

107
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.140
We're moving one row up because we have already picked 

108
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.960
this item 

109
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.480
So to calculate the remaining profit we need to exclude 

110
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.250
this item 

111
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.870
From there we are going three steps back because we 

112
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.890
have already picked an item with weight three 

113
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.880
And to get the profit for the remaining capacity we 

114
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.450
need to subtract three from current knapsacks capacity 

115
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.140
So if we pick item three the profit we get 

116
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.540
is four plus zero which is four And if we 

117
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.910
don't pick item three What will be the profit It's 

118
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.850
one so we can get it from the above cell 

119
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.230
So what will be the maximum of four and one 

120
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.280
It is four right So write four Here 

121
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.330
This means when the capacity of knapsack is three And if 

122
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.510
we have two items with weight one and three the maximum 

123
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.930
profit we can make is four next 

124
00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.840
The capacity of knapsack is four and the weight of 

125
00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.720
available item is three we need to calculate the maximum of 

126
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.910
profit we get by picking this item and profit we 

127
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.620
get by not picking this item  

128
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.630
if we pick the item the value we get 

129
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.350
is four 

130
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.310
Plus we need to add the profit for the remaining 

131
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.190
capacity of the knapsack here the napsack  capacity is 

132
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.140
four and we have picked the item with the weight 

133
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.750
of three 

134
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.750
So the remaining capacities one and the remaining item is 

135
00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.570
item one 

136
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.550
So what will be the maximum profit with the knapsack 

137
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.750
Capacity is one with only first item 

138
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.900
We can get the value by moving one row up 

139
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.220
and three steps back 

140
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.090
The value we get is one 

141
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.990
So the total profit we make will be four plus 

142
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.400
one 

143
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.250
That is five 

144
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.560
The what value will we get 

145
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.010
If we do not pick the current item we will 

146
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.300
get value one that we can get from the above cell 

147
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.930
So the maximum of five and one is five 

148
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.050
So fill this cell with five 

149
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.120
Next 

150
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.070
Whatever the knapsack capacity we can pick this item with 

151
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.970
weight three

152
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.720
And after picking the item the remaining knapsack profit is 

153
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.270
flat 

154
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.120
That is one 

155
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.630
It won't make any difference in the overall profit so 

156
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.230
we can fill the remaining rows with profit five next 

157
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.180
The capacity of knapsack is one and the weight of 

158
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.760
available item is four So we cannot pick this item 

159
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.800
The maximum profit we can make by not picking this 

160
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.720
item is one here also the capacity is two and 

161
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.670
weight of item is four 

162
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.120
So we cannot pick it and the profit will make 

163
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.450
is one again 

164
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.860
The capacity is three and the weight of the item is 

165
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.350
four 

166
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.570
So we cannot pick it and the profit we can 

167
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.810
make is four which we can get from the above cell 

168
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.790
Now here the capacity is four and the weight of 

169
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.150
available item is also four so we can pick it 

170
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.760
So we need to calculate the maximum of profit we 

171
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.980
get by picking this item and the profit we get 

172
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.700
by not picking this item 

173
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.720
If we picked this item the value we get is 

174
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.390
five and the remaining capacity is zero 

175
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.850
So the total value will be five 

176
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.970
And if we don't pick this item the value we 

177
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.120
get will be five again 

178
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.730
So both are the same 

179
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.240
So write 

180
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:19.970
Five here 

181
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.280
Next the item 

182
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.760
weight is four and the capacity is five 

183
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.280
So if we picked this item the value we get 

184
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.250
will be five 

185
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.980
So the remaining capacity is one and the remaining items 

186
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.570
are item one and three 

187
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.520
So what will be the maximum profit It will be 

188
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.710
five plus one that is six 

189
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.290
And if we don't pick this item the profit will 

190
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.300
be five 

191
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.050
So chose the maximum 

192
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.260
Next the capacity is six and available Item weight is 

193
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.830
four so we can chose this item 

194
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.660
Then the value will be five and 

195
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.120
The remaining capacity is two and the remaining item is 

196
00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.300
one and three 

197
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.550
So the profit will be five plus 1 6 

198
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.010
And if we don't pick this item the profit will 

199
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.820
be five 

200
00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.860
So chose the maximum six Next 

201
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.220
The capacity is seven and the available item weight is 

202
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.700
four so we can chose this item 

203
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.900
Then the value will be five and the remaining capacity 

204
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.690
is three and the available items are item one and three and 

205
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.300
the value we get when the capacity of knapsack is three 

206
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.570
and with the third item is four so the total 

207
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.000
profit we make will be five plus four that is 

208
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.450
nine 

209
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.070
And if we don't choose this item the profit will 

210
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.770
be five 

211
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.270
so chose the maximum that is nine Next the item 

212
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:48.180
weight is five and four the knapsack capacity is 0123 and 

213
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.650
four 

214
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.640
We cannot pick this item so the profit will be 

215
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.670
the same from previous room 

216
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.360
Next When the capacity is five we can pick the 

217
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.950
item five and the value will be seven 

218
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.230
And when the capacity is six we can pick this 

219
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.180
item five 

220
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.360
Then the value will be seven and the remaining capacity 

221
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.490
is one and then the value will be seven plus 

222
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.700
1 8 And when the capacity is seven we can pick 

223
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.700
item five 

224
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.630
Then the value will be seven and the remaining capacity 

225
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.600
is two 

226
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.890
So the profit by picking this item will be seven 

227
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.760
plus 1 8 and the profit without picking this item will 

228
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.430
be nine 

229
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.050
So choose the maximum that is nine 

230
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.550
So finally the overall result will be stored in the 

231
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.350
last cell and the maximum profit we can make is nine 

232
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.900
That is when the capacity of the knapsack is seven 

233
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.080
and when we have four elements with weights 134 and 

234
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.440
five we can get the maximum profit by picking the 

235
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.610
elements with weight three and four whose values are five 

236
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.860
and four So this is how we can solve 01 

237
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.750
knapsack problem in the dynamic programming approach 

238
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.940
In each step we solve and stored one sub problem 

239
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:03.480
result 

240
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.550
And using those sub solutions we get the overall optimised 

241
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.140
result In the next video let us learn how to 

242
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.550
implement 01 knapsack problem.
