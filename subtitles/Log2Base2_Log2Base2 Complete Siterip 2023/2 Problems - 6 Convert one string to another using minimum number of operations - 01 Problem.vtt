00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.680
the problem statement is you will be given two strings 

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.460
and your task is to find the minimum number of 

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.650
insertions and deletions required to convert the first string into 

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.550
the second string 

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.630
For example let us take these two strings War and 

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.050
Gear 

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.990
We need to convert the first string war into 

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.490
Gear for that 

9
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.000
First we need to remove the character W from war 

10
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.750
and insert characters G and E as the prefix 

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.070
So the total minimum number of deletions is one and 

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.450
insertions is two 

13
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.650
Let us take another two strings merge and merge sort 

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.130
here We need to insert the characters SORT into 

15
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.950
the first string 

16
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.890
So the total minimum number of deletions is zero and insertion is four.
