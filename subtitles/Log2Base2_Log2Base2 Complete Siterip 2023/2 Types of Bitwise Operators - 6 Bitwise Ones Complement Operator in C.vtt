Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.989
In this video we are going to discuss 

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.130
about  

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.260
bitwise ones compliment operator 

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.910
So the bitwise ones compliment operator  is a unary 

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.050
operator and it is denoted using a tilt

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.349
And what it does is inversion. that is it will invert 

7
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.209
the binary bits

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.310
See if the bit is 1 it will convert it 

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.970
into 0

10
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.210
And if the bit is 0 it will convert it into 1

11
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.540


12
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.310
For example let us find the bit wise ones complement 

13
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.380
of decimal 4. First of all let us write the  

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.350
binary representation of decimal 4. It is 00000100 What will be its  

15
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.620
bit wise ones complement to obtain that we will take each 

16
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.720
bit and invert it so take first 

17
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.340
bit it is 0 so it will become 1 Next 

18
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.050
take 0 invert it and we will get 1 again 

19
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.820
Next 1 it will become 0 and next is 0 it 

20
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.610
will become 1 and similarly all the remaining zeros will 

21
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.870
become 1 and we got 11111011 which corresponds to the 

22
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.369
decimal -5 

23
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.730
So the bit wise ones complement of 4 is -5 

24
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.180


25
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
Now let us see a sample programme which prints the 

26
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.060
bit wise ones complement of 4

27
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.620
So we have the main function and we are declaring 

28
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.310
the integer var and initialising it with 4 

29
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.220
Now we print value = %d ~var

30
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.890
 That is bit wise ones complement of var 

31
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.570
So we will get output value equal to -5 

32
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.570
and finally the programme return zero 

33
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.800
Now how is compliment 4 equal to -5? To 

34
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.530
understand that let us understand how -5 is represented 

35
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.140
in the memory 

36
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:48.229
The number 5 is represented like this. 00000101 and negative numbers 

37
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.170
will be stored in the memory using two's compliment form

38
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.580
And how do we find two's compliment form of a 

39
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.920
number? First find the ones complement of the number and 

40
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.190
then add one to it 

41
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.179
So to find two's complement of -5 find ones

42
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.300
complement of 5 and then add 1

43
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.470
So in ones compliment we just invert each bit So 

44
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.450
1 become 0, 0 becomes 1, 1 become 0,0 becomes 1 

45
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.510
and similarly all the zeros becomes 1 and now we 

46
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.880
need to add one to it 

47
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.640
So we get 0+1 = 1 and 

48
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.470
then 101111 Now if we closely look this representation of 

49
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.690
-5 it is a same as complement of 4

50
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.890
Hence the value of compliment 4 is equal to -5 

51
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.529
 

52
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.920
Now let us see

53
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.340
Another example We have -6 for six the  

54
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.490
8 bit binary representation is 000001 Now what is its 

55
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.570
complement Just toggle the bits we get 

56
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.970
0 to 1, 1 to 0, 1 to 0, 0 to 1,0 to 1, 0 to 1, 0 to 1 and again 0 to 1 

57
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.020
So we got 11111001 Now if you see this is 

58
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.980
equivalent to 8 bit binary representation to -7

59
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.440
Now take to the corresponding binary 00000010 and the 

60
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.720
compliment is 0 becomes 1, 1 become 0, 0 becomes 1 and similarly 

61
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.710
we get all remaining bits as 1 

62
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.170
So we got 11111101 which is equivalent to -3 

63
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.570
So if you observe the previous results the compliment of 

64
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.480
six is equal to -7 which is -(6+1)

65
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.850


66
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.310
and the compliment of 2 is equal to 

67
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.810
-3 which is -(2+1)

68
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.220
So we can say in general the bit wise ones 

69
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.310
complement of N is equal to -(N+1)

70
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.590


71
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.359
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
