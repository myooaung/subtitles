00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.810
You will be given a binary tree and a node 

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:03.340
value 

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.110
Your task is to return the level order successor of 

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.950
the given node 

5
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.770
For example let us take this binary tree and 

6
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.950
the node value as 40 

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.350
Then what will be node 40's level order successor 

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.250
It will be node 50.

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.750
So we need to return the value 50 

10
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.670
And if the given value is 30, then the level 

11
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.050
order successor is node 40 

12
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.790
And if the level order successor node is null or if 

13
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.140
the given key is not present in the tree, just 

14
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.250
return -1.
