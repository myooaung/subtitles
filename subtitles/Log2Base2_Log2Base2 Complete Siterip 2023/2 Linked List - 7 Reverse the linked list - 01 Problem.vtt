00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.910
The problem statement is you will be given a linked list 

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.980
and you need to reverse it.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.340
Let us take an example. So consider this linked list with 

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.350
three nodes and 10 being the head 

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.410
So your task is to reverse this linked list and 

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.410
at the end, the expected linked list will look like this.

7
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.830


8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.850
The last node 30 will be the new head 

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.850
So your task is to write the logic for reversing 

10
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.150
a linked list and submit it using the below compiler. 

11
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.980
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs. If the given 

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.430


13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.290
input linked list is 10 20 30,

14
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.870
the expected output is 30 20 10. If they given input 

15
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.880
linked list is

16
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.550
50 60 70, the expected output is 70 60 50
