00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.920
Hello everyone 

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.670
In this video let us discuss about the minimum coin 

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.070
exchange problem 

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.110
So assumed that we have this collection of five rupee 

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.540
coins ₹10 coins ₹20 coins and ₹25 coins here 

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.420
The problems statement is given a set of coins and 

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.070
a value 

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.580
We have to find the minimum number of coins with 

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.350
satisfies the given value 

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.250
Let us take the value as 50 

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.390
The possible coins combination will be 2 ₹20 coins and 

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.580
two five rupee coins two ₹20 coins and 1 ₹10 

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.050
coin 

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.390
5 ₹10 coins 10 five rupee coins two ₹25 coins 

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.580
1 ₹20 coin and 3 ₹10 coins 

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.740
etc

17
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.060
We can have different combinations of coins for the value 

18
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.700
50 Each set will have a particular number of coins 

19
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.140
first set is having four coins than three coins than 

20
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.420
five coins than 10 coins 

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.350
And like that our problem here is to get the 

22
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.770
value with minimum number of coins and here the minimum 

23
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.130
number of coins that satisfies the given value is 2 

24
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.850
₹25 coins 

25
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.580
We can solve this problem using the greedy approach 

26
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.100
Let us see how in order to reduce the number 

27
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.710
of coins we need to take the higher valued coin 

28
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.290
first 

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.680
So first we need to sort the given coins in 

30
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.810
the descending order 

31
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.530
Let us assume we need to give coins for a 

32
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.890
rupees 110 to reduce the number of coins we 

33
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.780
need to take the higher valued coins as much as 

34
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.350
possible 

35
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.500
So take the 25 of the coin as much as 

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.580
we can 

37
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.090
Since 25 is lesser than 110 

38
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.190
1st take 1 25 of the coin and increment the 

39
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.050
coin count 

40
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.450
And now the number of coins becomes one 

41
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.810
The balance amount is 110 minus 25 which is 

42
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.000
85 since 25 is lesser than 85 

43
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.780
We can take another 1 ₹25 coin and incremental coin 

44
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.250
count 

45
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.220
Now the number of coins becomes two and the balance 

46
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.650
amount these 85 minus 25 which is 60 again 25 

47
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.300
is lesser than 60 

48
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.880
So take another 25 rupee coin and increment the coin 

49
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.350
count 

50
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.200
Now the number of coins becomes three and the balance 

51
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.770
amount is 60 minus 25 which is 35 again 

52
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.420
25 is lesser than 35 

53
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.390
So take another 25 rupees coin 

54
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.250
An increment coin count 

55
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.460
Now the number of coins becomes four and now the 

56
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.700
balance amount is 35 minus 25 which is 10 now 

57
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.050
The remaining amount to be taken is ten but 25 

58
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.140
is greater than 10 

59
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.450
So we can't take ₹25 coins any more 

60
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.840
So we need to check whether the second largest coin 

61
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.850
satisfies the remaining amount 

62
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
The second largest coin is 20 but the expected amount 

63
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.550
is ten 

64
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.410
So we can take ₹20 coins as well 

65
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.630
So we need to check whether the third largest coin 

66
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.750
can provide the expected solution 

67
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.710
The third largest coin is 10 and our need is 

68
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.030
also ₹10 

69
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.100
So we can take 1 ₹10 coin in the solution 

70
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.150
and we need to increment the count 

71
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.040
Now the number of coins becomes five and the balance 

72
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.350
amount is 10 minus 10 which is zero 

73
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.090
The balance amount zero means that we have found our 

74
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.060
solution so we can stop the process 

75
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.470
The solution is four ₹25 coins and 1 10 rupees 

76
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.100
coin

77
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.490
So the minimum number of coins needed to the amount 

78
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.550
1 10 is five 

79
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.510
Now that is Take another example 

80
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.910
Let us take the value as 55 here we can 

81
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.040
take two ₹25 coins since two into 25 which 

82
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.530
is 50 is less than the actual value 55 

83
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.650
So the coin count will be two 

84
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.390
Now the balance amount is 55 minus 50 which is 

85
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.050
five 

86
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.250
We can take another ₹25 coin so moved to the 

87
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.150
next coin 

88
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.540
Now the expected value is five and since 20 is 

89
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.850
greater than five we cannot take ₹20 coins as well 

90
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.390
So move to the next coin which is 10 and 

91
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.750
10 is also greater than five 

92
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.630
So we can't take it So moved to the next 

93
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.620
coin which is five here The expected value is five 

94
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.340
so there is no problem 

95
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.170
So at one five rupee coin to our solution and 

96
00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.880
increment the coin count so the number of coins becomes 

97
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.230
three 

98
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.600
Now the balance amount is five minus five which is 

99
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.190
zero 

100
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.100
That means we have found our solution and the solution 

101
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.940
is to ₹25 coins and one five rupee coin 

102
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.230
So the minimum number of coins needed to the amount 

103
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.550
55 is three 

104
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.110
So this is how the greedy algorithm finds the optimal 

105
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.550
solution for the minimum coin exchange problem 

106
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.330
In the next video we will learn how to implement 

107
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.650
the minimum coin exchange problem and its algorithm.
