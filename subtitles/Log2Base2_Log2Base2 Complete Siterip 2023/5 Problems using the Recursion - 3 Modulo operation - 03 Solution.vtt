00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.060
So let us write a recursive Function Mod which takes the numerator 

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.560
and denominator as parameters num and den and it returns 

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.350
the result which will be an integer 

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.490
So first in the function we need to write the 

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.750
base case that is the numerator is less than the 

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.690
denominator then we need to return the numerator 

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.850
So write if num is less than den return num 

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.740
Otherwise we need to call the function recursively 

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.610
by passing the difference of numerator and denominator and denominator 

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.760
So write 

11
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.350
Return mod 

12
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.610
num minus den comma den And that's it we have 

13
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.350
implemented the recursive logic to find modulo.
