Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.830
In this video we are going to discuss about the 

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.020
continue statement in C 

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.450
So the continue statement is mostly used inside loops 

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.120
So whenever a continue statement is encountered inside a loop,

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.050
it skips the next statements of the loop. stop 

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.970
The current iteration and control goes to the beginning of 

8
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.350
the loop 

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.340
Now let us see the syntax of continue 

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.610
It's just writing the word continue followed by a  semicolon. 

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.110
now let us see a sample programme to understand the working 

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.220
of continue statement 

13
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.300
So we have the main function and we have an 

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.750
integer variable declaration 

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.610
For i. then we have the for loop 

16
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.250
for(i=1; i less than = 5 ;i++ )and inside the 

17
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.400
for loop is an if statement 

18
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.120
If i=2 or i=4 continue now i=1

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.830
It checks the condition whether i less than or equal to 5

20
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.190
 it is true 

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.769
So it will go inside the loop and we have 

22
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.370
If i=2 or i=4 it 

23
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.620
will return false since i=1

24
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.440
So it will skip the continue statement and print one 

25
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.280
and increment i 

26
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.070
Now i=2 So the first iteration is 

27
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.520
over 

28
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.230
Now it checks  the condition i less than =5

29
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.590


30
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.350
It is true 

31
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320
So control goes inside and we have 

32
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.300
if i=2 or i=4 and it will return 

33
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.940
true since i=2 now 

34
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940
So it will execute the continue statement which will skip 

35
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.970
the next print statement and goes back to the start 

36
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.289
of the loop and increment i 

37
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.360
And now i=3

38
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.120
Now it checks the condition again whether i less than =5

39
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.650
 which is true 

40
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.040
So it will go inside 

41
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.060
And if condition fails since i=3 So it 

42
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840
will skip the continue statement and print three and increment i

43
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.559
now i equal to four 

44
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.850
Now the condition is checked again and 4 less than 5

45
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.530


46
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.250
So the control goes inside the for loop and check 

47
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.950
the if condition which is true 

48
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.370
So it will execute the continue statement 

49
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.850
So it skips the next statement of the loop which 

50
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.179
is a printf statement and goes back to the 

51
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.380
start of the loop and increment i and i becomes 

52
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.829
five 

53
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.570
Now Now we check the condition i less than = 5 

54
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.110
which is true since i=5 now

55
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.640


56
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.820
So it goes inside 

57
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.690
And if condition fails so it prints five and will 

58
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.329
increment i 

59
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.070
So i=6

60
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.920
Now now when it checks the condition whether i is less 

61
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.940
than or equal to five 

62
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.050
It will fail 

63
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.290
So the control comes out of the for loop and 

64
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.050
execute the return zero statement 

65
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.070
So this programme will print the numbers continuously from 1 

66
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.170
to 5 except two and four 

67
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.530
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
