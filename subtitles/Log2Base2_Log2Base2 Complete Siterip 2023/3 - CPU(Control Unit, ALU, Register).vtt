Hi friends in this video let us discuss about 

2
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.000
the processing unit of the computer. 

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.529
We're learning about the computer and it's three major units.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.920
The central processing unit or the CPU

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.770
So the CPU or simply the processor is an electronic circuit

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.340
 responsible for executing the instructions of a computer program 

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.910
And the CPU is also called as the heart of the computer

8
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.440
The CPU contains three major parts. 

9
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170
Arithmetic and Logic Unit - ALU 

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.940
The Control Unit - CU and Registers 

11
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.910
Each unit has its own responsibility  

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.160
and let us understand it one by one 

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.620
First let us learn about the ALU 

14
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.550
The Arithmetic and Logic Unit 

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.180
It is responsible for Arithmetic and logical operations  

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.230
such as addition, subtraction, division, modular operation, lesser than, greater than etc. 

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.470
And what are registers? 

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.100
The registers are high speed temporary storage areas in the  CPU.


19
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.600
All the operands and data must be stored in a register  before it can be processed

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.830
And the intermediate results are also stored in these registers 

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.570
And finally we have the Control Unit 

22
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.780
The control unit is responsible for controlling the whole operations.

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.820
It receives the programming instructions from the memory 

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.900
and understands  the operations 

25
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.490
and then it will ask the ALU  to perform the required tasks 

26
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.300
And once the task is done  

27
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.510
the control unit will transfer the result to main memory  

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.490
and instruct the output device to display it 

29
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.310
So these are the major parts of a CPU.

30
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.520
Now let us understand the CPU functionality using this example 

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.000
Suppose the user gives the input as 3+5

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.170
And it will be converted as programming instructions 

33
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.000
which will  be stored in the main memory 

34
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.980
The control unit will receive the instructions now  

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.530
And the operands 3 and 5 will be stored in registers 

36
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.280
And then it will interpret the instructions one by one 

37
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.880
And understand the operations 

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.700
Here the operation that needs to be performed is addition 

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.740
So the control unit will ask the ALU Unit to perform addition on 3 and 5

40
00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.660
So ALU will perform addition operation  

41
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.340
And store the result 8 in a register

42
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.090
Then the control unit moves the result to main memory

43
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.280
And instructs the output unit to display the result 


44
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.570
So the result of 3+5 that is 8 

45
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.080
will be displayed as the output 

46
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.960
So that's all about the central processing unit and its functionality.

47
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.460
In the next video we will learn the applications of computers.
