1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.500
in the previous problem 

2
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.960
We learnt what is mountain array and how to 

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.080
find the peak element in a mountain array 

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.380
In this problem we're going to search for an element 

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.000
in the mountain array and return it's index 

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.050
If all given array is this and the element to 

7
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.390
search is 30 

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.090
We have to return three 

9
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.970
And in cases like these if the given element is 

10
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.050
not Present in the array we have to return minus one
