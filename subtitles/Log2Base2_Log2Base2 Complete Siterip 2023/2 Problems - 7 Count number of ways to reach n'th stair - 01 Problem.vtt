00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.560
the problems statement is there are n stairs and a 

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.800
person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top 

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.970
at a time the person can climb either one 

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.730
stair or two stairs 

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.350
He can't climb more than two stairs at a time 

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.650
We need to count the number of ways the person 

7
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.990
can reach the top 

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.540
For example if we have only one stair there is 

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.400
only one way to reach the top so that output 

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
will be one if we have to stair

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.680
there are two ways in which we can reach 

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.200
the top 

13
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.330
We can either climb one step two times or two 

14
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.790
steps at ones so the total number of ways to 

15
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.850
reach the end stair is two 

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.780
And if the number of Stairs is three we can either 

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.180
climb one step three times or climbed one step first 

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
and then climbed two steps or climbed two steps first 

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.760
and then climbed one step 

20
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.460
So the total number of ways to reach the end stair is three.
