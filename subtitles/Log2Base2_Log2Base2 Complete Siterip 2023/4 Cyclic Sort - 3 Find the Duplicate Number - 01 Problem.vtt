00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.730
The problem statement is

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.390
We will be given an unsorted array containing n+1

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.900
numbers taken from the range one to n. The array

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.450
will have only one duplicate but it can be repeated 

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.600
multiple times. So we need to find that duplicate number 

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.940
without using any extra space.

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
For example, let us take five numbers from the range 

8
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.830
1 to 4. So this is the array 1 2 4 3 2 

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.550
Here the duplicate number is two.

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
Now let us take another example six numbers from the range 

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.590
1 to 5. So we have 1 2 5 3 5 5. Here the duplicate number is five.

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.240
