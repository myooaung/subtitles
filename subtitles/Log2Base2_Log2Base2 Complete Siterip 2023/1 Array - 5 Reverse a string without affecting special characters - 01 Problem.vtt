00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.340
The problem statement is you will be given a string 

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.350
and you have to reverse it without affecting the special 

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.370
characters in it. 

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.110
For example, if this is the given string you have 

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.950
to reverse it. 

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.340
But only the alphabets. The special characters should not be 

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.950
changed. 

8
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.690
So reverse the string without affecting special characters 

9
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.440
So the result will be like this. 

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.560
So your task is to write the logic for this 

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.780
problem and submit it using the below compiler. See some sample inputs 

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.240
and corresponding outputs.

13
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.810
If the input is this string, the expected output is this. 

14
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.390
And if the input is this string the expected output is this.
