00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.150
The problem statement is you will be given a positive 

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.330
number and a value N and you have to check

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.050
if the nth bit is set or not. 

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.710
For example if the given number is 64, and this is 

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.350
its binary representation.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.600
And if we have n equal to five, we need 

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
to check if the fifth bit is set or not. 

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.790
So here the fifth bit is zero 

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.350
So it is not set or OFF. 

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.640
And if we have n equal to seven, we need 

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.040
to check if the seventh bit is set or not. 

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.860
And here the seventh bit is one. So it is 

13
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.550
set or ON.

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.600
So your task is to write the logic for this 

15
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.800
"Check if nth bit is set or not" problem and submit it

16
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.810
using the below compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

17
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.020
If the n parties 64 and 5 the expected output is OFF

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.870
and if the input is 64 and 7 the expected output is ON.
