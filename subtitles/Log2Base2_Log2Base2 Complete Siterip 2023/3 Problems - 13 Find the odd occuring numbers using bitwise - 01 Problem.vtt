00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.790
The problem statement is you will be given an array 

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.390
where all numbers occur even number of times except one number

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.650
which occurs odd number of times 

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.270
So you need to find the odd occurring number in it.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.920
That is the number that occurs 

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.310
odd number of times in the array. For example given an 

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.180
array of positive integers

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.670
1 3 5 1 3. Here one occurs two times three also occurs twice 

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.750
but five occurs once only. 

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.540
So here the odd occurring element is five.

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.000
So your task is to write the logic for this 

12
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.760
odd occurring number problem and submit it using the below compiler 

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.670
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.140
If the input is 1 3 5 1 3, expected output is five 

15
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.550
If the input is 5 7 2 7 5, the expected output is two.
