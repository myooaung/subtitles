1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.830
you will be provided with the BitonicArray but 

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.750
otherwise call this mountain array 

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.080
You have to find the maximum Elements index and return 

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.350
it 

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.650
Let us see what is BitonicArray If 

6
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.720
you see this array 

7
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.610
In the beginning the array elements are increasing and after 

8
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.960
a particular index the elements will be present in descending 

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.350
order 

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.480
If you plot them in a graph they will be in the 

11
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.690
shape of a mountain this type of array is called 

12
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.340
a mountain array or BitonicArray 

13
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.680
 

14
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.780
Given an array like this you have to find the 

15
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.530
index of the peak element here 

16
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
The peak element is 35 it is present at the 

17
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.550
index three so you have to return three 

18
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.530
If they given array is 1872 you have to 

19
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.450
return one.
