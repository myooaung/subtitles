00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.300
the problem statement is you have to count the number 

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.050
of vowels in a given string 

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.400
So what are vowels the characters A 

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.260
E i O and U

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.360
 are called vowels 

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.700
For example 

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.620
If the given string is Tamil then the vowels in 

8
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.280
this string are A and I 

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.940
So we have vowel count equal to two now 

10
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.120
If the given string is nature then the vowels in this string are 

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.630
a u and e 

12
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.960
So we have vowel count equal to three 

13
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.540
So your task is to write the logic for this 

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.330
vowel count problem and submitted using the below compiler 

15
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.110
see some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

16
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.810
If the input is the string Tamil the expected output 

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.450
is two 

18
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.450
If the input is the string nature the expected output 

19
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.080
is three.
