00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.620
The problem statement you will be given an array 

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.900
and size n. The array will have n distinct 

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.800
numbers from zero to n. Your task is to 

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.450
find the missing number in the given array.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.640
For example let us take an array of size five 

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.440
and five distinct numbers from 0 to 5 

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.100
The elements are 3 5 1 4 0. Here which number is 

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.170
missing in the range 0 to 5? It is two.

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.450
So here the missing number is two.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.100
Now let us take another example 

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.040
Take this array of size three and the elements are 

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.990
0 2 3.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.320
Here which number is missing in the range 0 to 3? It is  one.

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.750
