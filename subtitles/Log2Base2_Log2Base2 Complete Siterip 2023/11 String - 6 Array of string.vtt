Hi friends 

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.950
In this video we are going to learn about array of strings.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.520
So using an array of string 

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.389
We can manipulate a group of strings very easily 

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.120
Now the syntax for creating an array of string 

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.660
is like this where name is the name of the string

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.150
array and number of strings is a total number of 

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.120
strings you want 

9
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.210
written within square brackets and one need to specify the 

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.110
maximum string length also within square brackets 

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.650
And finally put a semi colon

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.150
For example  

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.530
char str[10][100]

14
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.320
This will create a string called str with 10 strings 

15
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.300
each of maximum length 100 

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.980
Now let us discuss about initialising array of strings 

17
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.629
So here we have a string array subject created with 

18
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.730
five strings each of maximum length 

19
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.250
20 

20
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.340
Now initialising string is similar to initialisation of a 

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.150
character array 

22
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.410
We write the string separated by commas in curly braces 

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.930
But the difference is that we enclose characters in single 

24
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.270
quotes

25
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.250
Where we enclose strings within double quotes 

26
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.050
Here we have Tamil English maths science social science 

27
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.240
So this is how it will look like in the 

28
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.620
memory. First 20 bytes will be given for the first 

29
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.920
string

30
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.660
2nd 20 bytes will be given for the second string 

31
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.450
and so on 

32
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.770
Now let's see an example Programme to print the strings 

33
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.640
in an array we have the main function and we 

34
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.520
are creating and initialising a string array subject with five 

35
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850
strings and maximum size equal to 20 

36
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.760
Now we are initialising with strings Tamil English math science 

37
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.900
and social science 

38
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.850
Next we have an integer variable declaration for i So i 

39
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.100
will be created now using a for loop, We are 

40
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.800
going to print each string in the array. so first i equal 

41
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.160
to zero and zero is less than five 

42
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.380
So condition is true 

43
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.410
So we go inside and print subject[0] using 

44
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.550
%s format specifier and subject[0] which is 

45
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.230
Tamil will be printed and i will be incremented now 

46
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.799
equal to one and one is less than five so 

47
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.850
condition is true 

48
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.739
So we go inside and print subject[1] which 

49
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.760
is English 

50
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.200
So english is printed and i will be incremented 

51
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.140
Now i has become 2 and 2 less than 5

52
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.489


53
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.650
So condition is true 

54
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.750
So we go inside and print subject[2] which is 

55
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.940
the string maths

56
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.660
So the string maths will be printed and i will 

57
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.560
be incremented 

58
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.640
Now i equal to three and 3 less than 5

59
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.340
So the condition is true again 

60
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.970
So we go inside and print subject[3] which 

61
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.450
is science and it will be printed and i will 

62
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.450
be incremented

63
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.429
Now i equal to four and four is less than  5

64
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.710


65
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.850
So condition is true 

66
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.410
So we go inside and print subject[4] which 

67
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.280
is social science and it will be printed and i

68
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.480
will be incremented 

69
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.210
Now i has become five and condition becomes false now 

70
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.839
5 is not less than 5

71
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.500
So control comes out of the for loop and return 

72
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.050
zero 

73
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.140
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
