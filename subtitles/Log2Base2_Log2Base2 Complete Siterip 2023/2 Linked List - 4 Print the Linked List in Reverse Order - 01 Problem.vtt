00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.750
The problem statement is you will be given a linked

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.470
list and you have to print it in the reverse 

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.950
order.

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.510
For example, if this is the linked list with three 

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.140
nodes, 10 20 30 then you have to print it in 

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.960
the reverse order. That is the output will be 30 20 10.

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.150


8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.710
So your task is to write the logic for this 

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
print the linked list in reverse order problem and submit it 

10
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.250
using the below compiler.

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.580
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs. 

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.020
If the input linked list is 10 20 30, the expected output 

13
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.150
is 30 20 10. 

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.270
And if the input linked list is 11 22 and 33

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.350
the expected output is 33 22 and 11.
