00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.030
So how can we reverse the string without affecting the 

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.570
special characters? We can use two pointers one to point 

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.890
the starting of the string and another one to point the 

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.180
end of the string. Now if both start index and 

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.920
end index are pointing to an alphabet, we can simply 

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.450
swap those characters. 

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.500
And if it is a special character, skip that character 

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.140
by incrementing start index or decrementing end index 

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.850
For example 

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.650
Here last index points to a special character dollar sign 

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.740
so skip it by decrementing end index 

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.230
Now start index points to a and 

13
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.890
end index points the character e. Both are alphabets  

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.750
so swap them 

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.750
And after swapping increment start index and decrement end index. 

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.460
Now start index points to the special character asterisk 

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.250
So skip it by incrementing start index and end index 

18
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.600
points to the special character comma.

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.050
So skip it by decrementing end index. 

20
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.450
Do the same process for the remaining characters 

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.810
So now start and end indices,

22
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.950
 both are pointing to alphabets. So swap them 

23
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.180
now increment start and decrement end and since 

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.450
both are pointing the same index, we can stop the process 

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.720
and we got the result. So try writing code using this logic.
