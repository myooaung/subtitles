00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.050
in this video let us learn how to solve the 

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.360
longest common subsequent problem using dynamic programming in dynamic 

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.010
programming 

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.970
What will we do We will first solve the smaller 

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.810
sub problem and we will store the result 

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.060
Using that result we will solve another problem and so 

7
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.550
on 

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.200
Finally using all these sub solutions we will arrive at 

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.150
the overall optimal solution 

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.080
Let us take two subsequent is and apply the 

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650
same approach to solve this problem 

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.160
We have  BACDB and BDCB write down 

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.250
the subsequent is in a row column vice manner 

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.020
You might have a question Why are we writing these 

15
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.540
subsequent through column wise in dynamic programming we 

16
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.870
need to solve all these sub problems to arrive at 

17
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.420
the overall oprimal result here each and every cell 

18
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.570
denotes one sub problem and the result of that particular 

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750
sub problem will be stored here 

20
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.460
Using that result we will solve the next problem and 

21
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.050
using that we will solve another problem and so on 

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.170
For example here this cell will have the length of 

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.650
the longest common subsequent B and B 

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.200
This cell will have the length of the longest common 

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.350
subsequent BDC and BA 

26
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.840
This cell will have the length of the longest common 

27
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.550
subsequent BDC and BACD and the 

28
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.860
last cell will have the length of the longest common 

29
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.750
Subsequent B D C B and B A 

30
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.000
C D B which is exactly our problem statement so 

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.490
the overall result will be stored in 

32
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.170
This cell so let us solve each sub problem one 

33
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.430
by one first mark all the cells of the first 

34
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.860
row and first column as zero as they don't have 

35
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.050
any characters 

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.800
Here we have B and B that is we have 

37
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.330
the same characters 

38
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.620
When two characters are equal we need to add one 

39
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.820
to the previously found longest common 

40
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.120
Subsequent linked excluding these two characters and work 

41
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.060
in we find that we can find that in array 

42
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.950
of I minus one J minus one which is zero 

43
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.290
here 

44
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.840
So we will get zero plus one that is one 

45
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.650
in this cell 

46
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.910
Next we have B and D so different characters And if 

47
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.900
the characters are not equal the longest common subsequent length 

48
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.350
can be found by excluding anyone of the current characters 

49
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.360
If we exclude the row element the maximum length can 

50
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.580
be found in array of I minus one 

51
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.250
J that is the top cell 

52
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.090
And if we exclude the column element the maximum length 

53
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.010
can be found in array of I J minus one 

54
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.460
That is the left cell 

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.860
So we are taking the maximum of these two here 

56
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.450
the maximum is in left 

57
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.250
cell So write one here 

58
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.550
Next we have B and C again 

59
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.400
We got different characters so take maximum of left and 

60
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.220
top cells 

61
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.950
It is one so write one here 

62
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.940
Next we have B and B the same characters 

63
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.150
So what should we do We can take Previously found 

64
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.630
Longest common subsequent length excluding these two characters at array 

65
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.820
of I minus one J minus one and add one 

66
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.290
to it 

67
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.540
So we will get zero plus one 

68
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.250
So write one here 

69
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.300
Next we have A and B different characters 

70
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.850
So take the maximum value which is one 

71
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.190
Next we have A and D again different characters 

72
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.850
So take maximum of one and one which is one 

73
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.440
Next we have A and C 

74
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.840
So different characters 

75
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.290
So write one next is A and B again different 

76
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.010
characters 

77
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.450
So write maximum of one and one which is one 

78
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.070
next is C and B 

79
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.890
So we got different characters 

80
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.560
So take the maximum which is one next is c 

81
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.880
and D again take the maximum of one and one 

82
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.780
which is one next is 

83
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.490
C and C that is we got the same characters So 

84
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.670
go to previous row previous column and we have one 

85
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.570
there so add one to it and we will get 

86
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.530
two And now let us see what this means 

87
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.030
This value here is a solution to a sub problem 

88
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.090
that is it holds the length of the longest common 

89
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.400
subsequent for the strings BDC 

90
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.010
And BAC for these two strings the longer subsequent possible 

91
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.850
is B C and its length is two 

92
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.450
And that is exactly what we got here 

93
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.280
Next we have C and B 

94
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.420
That is we got different characters 

95
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.550
So take the maximum of one and two which is 

96
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.530
two next we have d and B 

97
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.060
We got different characters 

98
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.350
So take the maximum of zero and one which is 

99
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.930
one next we have B and D So we got the 

100
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.920
same characters So go to previous row Previous column and 

101
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.050
we have one there 

102
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.300
So one plus one equal to two 

103
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.250
So we get two here next we have d and 

104
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.750
c 

105
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.430
So take the maximum which is two next is D 

106
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.060
and B 

107
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.460
So again take the maximum two next 

108
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.750
We have B and B that is we got the 

109
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.810
same characters 

110
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.880
So take this zero and add one to it 

111
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.650
So we will get one 

112
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.770
Next is B and D

113
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.510
We got different characters 

114
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.350
So take the maximum value two next is B and 

115
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.280
C again take the maximum value which is two next 

116
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.420
B and B 

117
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.050
That is same characters 

118
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.740
So take this value two and add one to it 

119
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.570
so we will get three 

120
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.860
Now 

121
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.130
This value is the length of the longest common subsequent 

122
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.810
for the strings B D c B and B 

123
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.850
ACDB 

124
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.680
The longer subsequent is possible are B D B 

125
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.450
and B C B and their length is three 

126
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.430
That is exactly what we have got here.
