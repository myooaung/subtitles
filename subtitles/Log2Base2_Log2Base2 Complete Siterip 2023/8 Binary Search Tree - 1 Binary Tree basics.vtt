00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.610
hi friends 

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.920
In this video we are going to learn some 

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.200
binary tree basics 

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.550
So first see a linked list 

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.040
In this Each node has a data path and a 

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.790
link path which refers to the very next node 

7
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.890
So how is a binary tree no different from this 

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.850
Say this binary tree here 

9
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.740
Here each node will have the data path and two 

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.650
pointers left and right 

11
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.740
Also tree is a non linear data structure but the 

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.150
linked list was a linear data structure 

13
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.470
So the tree is a hierarchical data structure and these 

14
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.190
nodes are related here and the links between these nodes 

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.250
are called the branches of the tree 

16
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.870
Also if we have n nodes in a binary tree that 

17
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.710
it will have n minus one branches say Here we 

18
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.970
have 1234567 nodes and daughter so it must have exactly 

19
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.470
seven minus one branches that is six and see 

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.650
We have six branches here now The first node of 

21
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.670
the tree which is having no parent is called the 

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.910
root node of the tree that is the top 

23
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.500
Most node is called the Route and the bottom 

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.020
Most nodes which are having no Children are called the 

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.780
leaf nodes or leafs and the nodes other than leafs 

26
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.250
are called the internal nodes of the tree 

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.080
Now each node is connected by an upper level node 

28
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.860
and that is called the parent of that node that 

29
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.210
is you can see A is connected to B and A is 

30
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.860
connected to C so A is called the parent of 

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.540
B and also of C and if the parent of 

32
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.490
two nodes are the same then they are called the 

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.250
siblings 

34
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.580
Here parent of B and C is a so we 

35
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.350
can say B and C are siblings 

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.560
See another example 

37
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.160
Parent of D and E is B so we can 

38
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.630
say D and E are

39
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.840
Siblings and the three nodes are arranged in levels 

40
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.600
The top most level is level one then level two 

41
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
level three level for etcetera the root node will always 

42
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.660
be on level one 

43
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.350
Now let us discuss about descendants 

44
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.690
So the descendants of a node are the nodes including 

45
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.550
the Children of that node their Children and so on 

46
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.350
simply the descent of a node can be it's 

47
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.910
child 

48
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.210
It's grandchild it's great grandchild etc 

49
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.890
So here is an example of a descentant D

50
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.040
is a descendant of a since it is a grandchild 

51
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.980
of a similarly an ancestor is a node which is the 

52
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.560
parent or grand parent or great grandparents etc 

53
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.830
So this is an example A is ancestor of B 

54
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.050
since A is D's grand parent 

55
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.680
Now let us discuss about the depth of the node 

56
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.770
The depth of node is the number of edges 

57
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.350
from the route to that node 

58
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.960
see an example 

59
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.510
The depth of node E is two since there are 

60
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.550
two edges from route to D 

61
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.910
Now the depth of G is also two because we 

62
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.450
have two edges to G from the root 

63
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.050
So that was the depth of a node 

64
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.950
Now let us discuss about the height of a node 

65
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.940
The height of a node is the number of edges 

66
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.250
on the longest path from that node to a leaf 

67
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.950
so see an example 

68
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.260
Let us find the height of nodes C from C 

69
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.850
we have paths to two leafs C to H and 

70
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.650
C two G and from C two g 

71
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.940
We have one edge and from C to edge we 

72
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.520
have two edges so C to edge is the longest 

73
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.490
path hence that will be the height of the node 

74
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.350
So height of C is equal to two 

75
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.570
Now let us find the height of node A which 

76
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.050
is also the root here 

77
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.960
And we have four paths to leafs from  A 

78
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.650
to D A to E A to H and A to G 

79
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.250
and the longest path is clearly from A to H 

80
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.900
and we have three edges in this path 

81
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.570
So the height of node A is three 

82
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.370
So today we learn some binary tree basics first 

83
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.280
We learn the term branches which are the links between 

84
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.200
different nodes 

85
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.970
And then we learn the relationships parent child Siblings 

86
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.860
And then we learned about the levels than the height 

87
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.440
of a node and depth of a node and also 

88
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.550
we learned about descendants and ancestors.
