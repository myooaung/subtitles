00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.040
So let us write the function move zeros which takes the array and 

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.020
its size as the parameters. 

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.610
We need two pointers here 

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.770
one to iterate the array and another one to point the 

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.410
updated array.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.830
So write int i, new len equal to zero 

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.150
Now we need to place all ones in the beginning.

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.550
So iterate the array and if the element is one 

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.020
then place it in  new len and increment new len. 

10
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.160
So we can write a for loop

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.690
for this. for i equal to zero 

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.890
i less than n, i++. If array[i] 

13
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.130
equal to one. 

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.050
We need to place it in new len index and then 

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.150
increment new len. 

16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.540
So write array[new len ++]  equal to array[i]

17
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.150


18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.580
So after this loop, all ones are at the beginning 

19
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.250
And now we need to make every next element zero. 

20
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.050
So  write a while loop for this task 

21
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.100
While new len less than n array[new len ++] equal to zero.

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.750
and that's it. The task is done.
