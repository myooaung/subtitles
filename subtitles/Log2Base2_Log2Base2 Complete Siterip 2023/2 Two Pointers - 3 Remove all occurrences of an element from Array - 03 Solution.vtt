00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.650
So let us write a function remove element which takes the array

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.100
its size and the value as parameters and returns the new length

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.530
 we need iterating variable i and one more 

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.550
variable to point the new array.

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.310
So declare i and new len. So write int i, newlen 

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.950
equal to zero 

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.500
Now iterate the array, compare the element with the given 

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.060
value.

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.490
If it is the same, do nothing. And if it 

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.340
is not the same, then move that element to new len index

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.840
 and increment it. So write for i equal to zero, 

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.920
i less than n, i++ and in each iteration,

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.910
check if array[i] is not equal to the 

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.750
given value 

15
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.360
If true, we need to place the current element array[i]

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.530
in array[new len]. 

17
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.350
And then we need to increment the new len value 

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.060
So write array[new len ++] equal to 

19
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.950
array[i] 

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.640
And finally we can return the new length of the array. So return new length and it is done.
