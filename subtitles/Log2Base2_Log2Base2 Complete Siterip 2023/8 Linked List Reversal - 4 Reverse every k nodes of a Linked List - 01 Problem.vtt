00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
the problem Statement is you will be given a linked 

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.150
list and a value key you are 

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.130
Task is to reverse every K nodes of a linked 

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.540
list 

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.900
For example let us take this linked list and K 

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.340
value 

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.320
As two then the expected linked list will be like 

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.660
this 

9
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.450
10 20 reversed 30 40 reversed and 50 60 reversed 

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.630
If we take the K value as three then the

11
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.680
expected output will be like this 

12
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.850
10 20 30 reversed and 40 50 60 reversed.
