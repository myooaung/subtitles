Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.350
In this video we are going to learn about Constants in C

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.720
So the C programming language 

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.420
allows us to define constant values in the programme 

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.550
For Example 

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.810
We can define pie equal to 3.14 so a constant 

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.110
is actually  a variable but it's value cannot be modified 

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.770
Now let's see the syntax so we can use the 

9
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.880
key word const to

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.950
all the data types to define a constant so we 

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.210
can write const datatype variable name = value 

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.680
Now let's see some examples to define integer

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120
constant i with value 

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.190
10 we can write const int i =10. To define 

15
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.430
a character constant c with value a We can write  

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.070
const char c = 'a' to define a float constant f 

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.930
with value 1.414  we can write 

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
const float f= 1.414

19
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.350
so for these constants i, c and f we cannot alter 

20
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.039
the values 

21
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.160
See an example we have int i= 10 So 

22
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.940
integer variable i = 10 is defined 

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.230
Now we are trying to set i=100 

24
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.820
Now what will happen? There are no issues since i is 

25
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.149
just a variable. It is allowed to modify them. now 

26
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.039
we have const int i=10

27
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.429
 

28
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.369
So an integer constant i=10 is defined 

29
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.250
Now we are trying to set i=100 

30
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.530
Now what will happen? since i is a constant, it is 

31
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.330
not possible to alter its value. so this error will 

32
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.110
be generated 

33
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.630
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
