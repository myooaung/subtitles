00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
now let has taken algorithm that has loping statements inside 

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.750
the conditional statement and analyse its timecomplexity

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.370
Here in this algorithm if given input isn't even number this 

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.550
sinker statement will be executed. So the time complexity 

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.970
for this block is order of one 

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.330
If the given number is odd this loop will be 

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.530
executed n times. So the time complexity for this 

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.090
block is order of n. Here, we can notice that 

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.930
the running time of this algorithm is decided by conditional 

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.760
statements 

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.280
So for this algorithm we need to write the best 

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.990
and worst case time complexities. Here The best case is when 

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.430
given number is even because for an even number the 

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.110
algorithm will take only order of one time So the 

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.840
best case time complexity of this algorithm is order 

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.410
of one And the worst cases when the given number 

17
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.670
is odd because for an odd number the algorithm will take 

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.070
order of n time 

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.850
So the worst case time complexity of this algorithm 

20
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.010
is order of end So the conclusion is if the 

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.020
running time of an algorithm is decided by conditional statements 

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.380
we need to write the time complexity in best and worst cases. Thats it.
