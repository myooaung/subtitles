Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.050
In this video let us have an introduction to computers 

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520
So what is a computer? 

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.750
A computer is an electronic device which converts the data into meaningful information.

5
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.090
So what is the difference between data and information ?

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.400
see the data is a raw and unstructured fact that may

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.050
contain numbers, characters and statements.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.699
But data is useless until it is processed and organized by humans or computers.


9
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.410
And what is information?  

10
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.810
When this data is processed by humans or  computers,

11
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.670
it gets structured and organized. 

12
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.949
And this kind of meaningful data is called as information. 

13
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.100
So let us understand this with an example. 

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.650
We have the income of each person in a country.

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.330
And this is the data.  

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.410
And it is useless until we process and take meaningful information out of it.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.279
So we can process this data to get the average income of a country

18
00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:08.649
and how the average income rate increases per year.

19
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.150
Now that is an information and it is very useful. 

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.530
So simply data is a collection of unorganized facts.

21
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.750
And the processed meaningful structured data is called the information.

22
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.820
So as we have discussed the computer transforms data into meaningful information.

23
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.650
It should receive the data as an input 

24
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.770
and display useful information as the output.

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.210
 And to receive the input, the computer needs input unit  

26
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.461
and to display the output, the computer needs an output unit.

27
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.791
Together this is called the I/O unit or the input output unit.


28
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.920
And in order to convert this data into meaningful information,

29
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.791
the computer needs to process it.

30
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.440
So the computer needs another unit to process the input.

31
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.750
And this unit is called the processing unit.

32
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.430
But the computer can't directly process the input.  

33
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.780
It should store the received input in someplace  

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
and from there, it will take the data and then process it. 

35
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720
So the computer needs another unit to store the data  

36
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.410
and it is called the memory unit. 

37
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.110
So it needs an I/O unit, a processing unit and a memory unit.

38
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.360
 And these are the major sections of a computer

39
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.230
Let us understand how the computer will convert the data into meaningful information.

40
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.790
The input unit will read the data and the data will be stored in memory

41
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.740
 and from memory the data will be sent to the processing unit.

42
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.220
After processing the data, the useful information is again stored in memory.

43
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.420
From the memory the useful information will be displayed via the output unit.

44
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.760
 So these are the basic components of a computer.

45
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.309
 And in the coming videos we will 

46
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.260
learn each component of a computer elaborately.
