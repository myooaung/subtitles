Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.000
In this video we are going to discuss about array of structures.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.010
So as we declare an array of integers, an array 

4
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.970
of characters 

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.550
We can also declare an array of structures 

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.919
Here we have a structure student with members name age

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.450
and roll 

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.669
Now if we need an array of three structures we 

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.250
can declare it like this 

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.070
Keyword struct followed by structure_name followed by structure 

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.570
variable and size in square brackets 

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.250
Now to access name of structure1 use s[0].name

13
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.790
to access Name of structure2 use s[1].name

14
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.890
and so on 

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.300
And we can initialise the values like this Just write 

16
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.699
the values in braces separated by commas and these set 

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.070
of values again separated using commas within braces and put a semicolon 

18
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.220
 finally. so the values are stored in 

19
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.850
like this Now let us print the values using a 

20
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.940
for loop. we print s[i].name s[i].age

21
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.160
and s[i].roll for i =0,1 and 2 

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.450
So we get these values printed now 

23
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.220
let us see a C program to get input from the 

24
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.880
user and print it. So we first declare the structure student 

25
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.610
And then we declared the array of structures so 

26
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.350
s[0], s[1] and s[2] are created and 

27
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.080
an integer variable i is also declared 

28
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.510
Now we asked the user to enter the student 

29
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.180
details 

30
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.700
And using a for loop, it is scanned to these 

31
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.510
structures 

32
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.899
In first iteration the values entered which are abc, 20,

33
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.650
78456 are scanned to S[0]

34
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.710
In the second iteration the values entered which are cde 

35
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.850
23 78458 are scanned to s[1]

36
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.350
Similarly the next set of values are scanned to s[2]

37
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.649


38
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.590
Now we print these values using a for loop just 

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.660
as we did before 

40
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.340
In first iteration values in S[0] are printed 

41
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.609
in the second iteration values in S[1] and in 

42
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.940
third iteration values in s[2] are printed and 

43
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.950
finally main returns zero 

44
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.929
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
