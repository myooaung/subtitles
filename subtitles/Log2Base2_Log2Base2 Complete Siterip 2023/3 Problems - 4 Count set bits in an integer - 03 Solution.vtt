00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.610
so let us 

2
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.790
 write a function count set bits which takes an 

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.980
unsigned integer and returns an integer in the function declaring 

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.010
integer variable count and initialised it to 0 We 

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.860
need to do bitwise and between the given number 

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.490
and one 

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.350
So write if n bitwise and one 

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.570
And if the result is one we need to increment 

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.150
count 

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.280
So write count plus plus Now we need to right 

11
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.400
Shift the number by one position So write n right 

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.750
shift equal to one 

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.090
We need to do the same operation until the number 

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.860
becomes zero So write this code inside a while loop 

15
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.350
while n and finally return set bit count.
