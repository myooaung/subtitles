00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.300
as we know this sorted array is rotated 

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.750
That is it will have two sorted sub arrays 

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.140
Now the algorithm to sort this efficiently is first 

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.900
We have to find the pivot element which marks 

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.750
the beginning of the second sub array 

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.020
Then we have to determine which of these two sub 

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.930
arrays can hold our search element and finally do a 

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.150
binary 

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.440
search on it that is find the pivot 

10
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.370
element first 

11
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.060
In the previous problem we have discussed the logic to 

12
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.550
find the pivot element let us use it here

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720
Element 20 is the pivot element 

14
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.650
Hence pivot will point index three 

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.050
Now let us find out with sub array can contain 

16
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.250
our search element 

17
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.010
If we're given Element is between array of start an 

18
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.920
array of pivot minus one then the search element 

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.180
can be present only in the first half 

20
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.690
Else we can search in the second half here 

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.540
Our search element is 25 25 is not greater than 

22
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.050
array of 0 60 

23
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.010
Hence it cannot be present in the first sub 

24
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.020
Let a search for Element 25 in second sub array 

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.970
starting from index three till Index six mid will be 

26
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.740
three plus six divided by two 

27
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.540
that is four and in array of four we have 

28
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.700
25 our search element thus we can return index 4.
