Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.550
In this video we are going to discuss about the decimal number system

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.850
Humans used a decimal number system on their day to day life

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.650
It is called  the base 10 number system

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.250
 and it  will have numbers from 0 to 9 

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.040
In general base N number system will have numbers from 0 to N-1

7
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.970
For example base 2 number system consists of numbers 0 and 1 which is 2-1
 

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.719
And base 8 number system consists of numbers from 0 to 7 which is 8-1

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.430
We have represented numbers from 0 to 9 

10
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.900
using the decimal number system 

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.040
But if we need to express numbers beyond 9, what can we do? 

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.490
For that, we can use positional decimal numbers.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.420
See an example 

14
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.390
We have 18 to the base 10 

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540
that is 18  is a decimal number

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.980
Here the position of 8 is 0 and position of 1 is 1

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.570
The position count starts from the right side of a number 

18
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.820
and in this system the numbers can be represented as a sum 

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.060
Here we have the number 18 

20
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.920
Let us represent it as a sum

21
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.080
 we can write 1 X 10 ^1 + 8 x 10 ^0

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 which is 1 x 10 + 8 x 1  

23
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.120
that is 10 + 8 which is our number

24
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.320
So all the numbers in decimal system can be represented as a sum like this 

25
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.110
Here what we're doing is, we take each digit 

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.160
and multiply with 10 raised to its position number 

27
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.160
See another example 

28
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.520
We have 145 

29
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.520
here the position of 5 is 0,  4 is 1 and  1 is 2

30
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090
So we can represent this number as 

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.840
1 X 10 ^2 + 4 x 10 ^1 + 5 x 10 ^0

32
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.670
that is 1 x 100 + 4 x 10 + 5 x 1 

33
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.600
which is 100 + 40 + 5

34
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.760
which is our number 145. 

35
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.230
So that was about whole numbers 

36
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.139
Now what will happen with fractional numbers or decimal numbers?

37
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.739
For an example we have the number 125.67 

38
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.360
which is a decimal number 


39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.470
in this case the position after dot will be counted as -1,-2, and so on

40
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.020
Hence the position of 6 here is -1

41
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.860
And the position of 7 is -2 

42
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.330
The position of 5 will be 0 

43
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
the position of 2 is 1 and finally the position of 1 is 2

44
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.640
Now let us represent it as a sum 

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.060
Again it is the same idea 

46
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.030
Take the digit and multiply it with 10 raised to its position number 

47
00:02:49.100 --> 00:03:03.030
So we will get 1 X 10 ^2 + 2 x 10 ^1 + 5 x 10 ^0 + 6 x 10^-1 + 7 x 10^-2

48
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.710
which is 100 + 20 + 5 + 0.6 + 0.07

49
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.800
which gives the sum 125.67 which is our number.

50
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.350
So that was decimal number system 

51
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.850
It is also called as the base 10 number system 


52
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.470
and we have the numbers 0 to 9 in the system.

53
00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.020
 We can represent any number in decimal system as a sum 

54
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.390
So that's all 

55
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.940
And in the next video we will discuss about the binary number system

56
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.320
So that's all for this video and thank you for watching.
