00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.750
This is the implementation of odd or even number problem using 

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.760
bitwise AND. So in the implementation 

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.350
First we need integer variable to store the input 

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.960
number. So declare number. Now read number from user to 

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.690
variable number using the scanf function. 

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.520
Now we can perform bitwise AND on one and 

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.350
this number.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.210
And if the result is zero, it is an even 

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.800
number.

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.750
And if it is one, it is an odd number 

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.400
So check if number bitwise AND on one equal  

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.000
to zero, then print "Even" else print "Odd".
