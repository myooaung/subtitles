1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
some of n natural numbers is equal to n plus 

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.830
n minus one plus n minus two place etcetera up 

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.640
to one 

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.670
So here what will be the recursive call every time 

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.970
N is decrementing 

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.150
By one like n n minus one n minus two 

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.850
etcetera 

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.190
So the recursive call will be function of n

9
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.950
minus one 

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.400
And here we need to find the sum of all 

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.360
those numbers 

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.920
So add n to the result of each recursive call 

13
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.460
Hence the Recursive call will be n plus function 

14
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.800
of n minus one 

15
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.850
And we need a base case for every recursive call 

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.910
And what will be the base case here We need 

17
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.760
to do this process still n becomes one 

18
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.280
So we need to stop the recursive call when n 

19
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.370
is equal to one 

20
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.920
So using this logic you can solve the problem.
