00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
The problem statement is you will be given a sorted array

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.060
and its size 

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.870
Your task is to remove the duplicate elements from the 

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.450
sorted array and return the modified new length. 

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.480
And please know that we should do the operation without 

6
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.050
using additional memory. 

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.220
For example, if given array is 1 1 1 3 3 5 5, a fter removing 

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.760
duplicates we get 1 3 5. So the new length is equal 

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.250
to three.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.030
See another example. If the given array is 5 5 5,  

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.930
after removing duplicates the result is 5 and the length is 1.

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.750


13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.950
So your task is to write the logic for this 

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.080
problem and submit it using the below compiler. See some sample 

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.050
inputs and corresponding outputs. 

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.780
If the input is this array 1 1 1 3 3 5 5, the expected output 

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.090
is the new length 3.

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.650


19
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.070
If the input array is 5 5 5, the expected output is the new length 1.
