00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.570
In the previous video, we have used recursion to 

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.950
print linked list in reverse order 

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.050
We can use the same logic to solve this problem 

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.850
The recursion call will be returning from the last 

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.000
node, so we can declare one static variable count and 

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.800
increment this count variable by one each time the recursive 

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.880
call is returned. 

8
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.640
And when this count matches the given value n, we can 

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
conclude that the current node is the nth node from 

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.750
the end of the linked list 

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.760
So declare one static variable count and increment this count 

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.800
variable after the execution of each recursive call and when 

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.650
count matches given n, return that node.
