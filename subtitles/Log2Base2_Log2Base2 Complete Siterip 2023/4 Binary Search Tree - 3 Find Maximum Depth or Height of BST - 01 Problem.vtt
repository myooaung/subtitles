00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.760
The problem statement is 

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.850
You will be given binary tree and you have 

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.370
to find its maximum depth or height.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.670
So the height of a binary tree is the number 

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.250
of nodes from the root node to the farthest

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.150
leaf node.

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.720
For example, let us take this tree

8
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.240
Here the farthest leaf node is the node with value 55.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.460
so we have four nodes in the path. So the 

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.150
maximum depth of this binary tree is four.
