00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.180
So how can we solve this problem? We can use 

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.780
a temp variable and a count variable 

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.660
And if the index is two, we will start iterating the 

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.520
list from head and increment count after visiting each 

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.250
node and when count becomes the given index which is 

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.890
two here, just return that node which will be pointed 

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.050
by temp. So return temp data.
