00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.800
The problem statement is you will be given a binary tree 

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.650
 and a value sum 

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.460
Your task is to print all the paths such that 

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.490
the sum of all node values will be equal to 

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.850
the given sum value.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.590
For example if this is the given binary tree 

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.240
and the sum value is 10, then the output will 

8
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.260
be the path 1 5 4 and 1 7 2. Because if we 

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.100
add all the elements in each path, the sum value 

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.780
will be equal to the given sum value 10.
