00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.040
Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.030
In this video let us learn how to write 

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.290
algorithm, psuedocode and draw flow chart to 

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.740
find the average of five numbers 

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.990
That is the input will be five numbers 

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.920
Then it's average should be calculated and that should be 

7
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.810
the output 

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.640
So that is our task 

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.680
And how can we perform this task Let us write 

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.020
the algorithm for this task first 

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.870
So the first step is to start the process 

12
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.739
And after reading the numbers we have to find its 

13
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.910
sum first 

14
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.540
Then we have to divide the sum by five to 

15
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.650
get the average 

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.500
So we will need the variable sum and to store 

17
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.760
the result we need another variable average and we have 

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.550
to read five numbers from user

19
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.379
So we need another variable 

20
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.390
i also So the second step is to declare these 

21
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
three variables and third step is to initialise sum and 

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.270
i to 0 Now we have the variables ready but we 

23
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.050
don't have the numbers to be added 

24
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.200
It should be read from the user. So that 

25
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.449
is our forth step read the numbers from user 

26
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.840
and we need to read five numbers so we can 

27
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.050
use the variable i for that 

28
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.369
We will read numbers one by one from the user

29
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.550
 

30
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.220
After reading each number we will add it to the 

31
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.820
variable sum and also increment i

32
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.320
So when i becomes five it means we have got 

33
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.750
our five numbers and we can stop reading input 

34
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.560
So we check if i is less than five and 

35
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.580
if it is get input X from user and add 

36
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.040
it to sum that is sum = sum + x 

37
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.259
and then increment i 

38
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.890
And since this is a loop go to fourth step 

39
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.610
again 

40
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.440
So we check if i is less than five and 

41
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.930
if it is get input x from user and add it to sum

42
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.820
that is sum = sum + x and 

43
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.480
increment i 

44
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.250
And since this is a loop go to step four 

45
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.710
again 

46
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.630
This loop will be continued five times and each time 

47
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.290
we will get one value and it will be added  

48
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.840
to sum

49
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.210
And if fourth step fails then find average by dividing 

50
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.560
sum by five 

51
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.720
And then print the average on screen and the last 

52
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.470
step is to stop the process 

53
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500
So that was the algorithm 

54
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.720
As you can see to implement a block of operations 

55
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.400
We can write algorithm like this see we have for 

56
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.190
step five 

57
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.680
We have some sub steps 

58
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.950
And for step six also we have some sub steps 

59
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.380
So that was the algorithm 

60
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.820
Now let us right the pseudo code First begin the 

61
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.730
operation declare and initialise sum = 0 and i=0

62
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.350


63
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.330
And while i is less than five get input to X 

64
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.570
and add it to variable sum that is sum = sum + x 

65
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.370
 and then increment value of i that 

66
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.390
is ++i that is the loop and then find 

67
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.890
average avg = sum/5

68
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.550
So we got the average finally prnt average and end 

69
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.350
the process 

70
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.730
So that was this pseudo code and the algorithm 

71
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.570
now let us draw the flow chart for this process 

72
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.910
First start then initialise sum = 0 and i =0

73
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.350


74
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.160
The next step is to read five numbers using a 

75
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.850
while loop 

76
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.239
So we have while i<5

77
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.910
And as we know for conditional statements we can use 

78
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.450
a diamond symbol and it may have different results 

79
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.550
So if this is true then read input to X 

80
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.820
and for that use a Parallelogram 

81
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.690
Symbol

82
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.630
Next add X to sum and increment i 

83
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.890
And since these two operations are computations we 

84
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.240
can use a rectangle symbol and go back to the 

85
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.720
conditional statement 

86
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.239
And if it is false just find the average 

87
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.600
avg=sum/5 and again since

88
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.760
it is a computation 

89
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.750
We can use a rectangle now print the result average 

90
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.950
and end 

91
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.490
Now let us see how this works 

92
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.970
First start the process initialise sum and i to 0 check

93
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.520
if i < 5 and it is true 

94
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.150
since i equal to zero 

95
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.130
So it will go this way and read input X 

96
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.150
and X will be added to sum 

97
00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.520
Also i will be incremented to 1

98
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.849
And again control goes back to this step

99
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.640
And again this will be checked and it will be 

100
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.440
true and the same process will be repeated 

101
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.710
And i would be 2 

102
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.430
Now again the condition will be checked 

103
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.650
Still it would be true 

104
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680
The same steps will be taken and i will become 

105
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.120
three again while will be checked 

106
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.580
And still it would be true 

107
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.810
So same will happen 

108
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.840
Input will be read 

109
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.880
It will be added to sum and i will be 

110
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.760
implemented to 4 again while will be checked 

111
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.240
And still it would be true 

112
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.200
So the same thing will happen again and i will 

113
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.770
become five now and it checks the condition again 

114
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.510
And now it would fail 

115
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.450
And the program execution will go this way 

116
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.450
The average will be found and it will be printed 

117
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.870
So that is how a loop can be represented in 

118
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.650
a flow chart 

119
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.109
So our task was to read five numbers from user

120
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.350
 and find and print it's average or screen 

121
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.170
And we learnt how to write algorithm pseudo code and 

122
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.049
draw flow chart for this task
