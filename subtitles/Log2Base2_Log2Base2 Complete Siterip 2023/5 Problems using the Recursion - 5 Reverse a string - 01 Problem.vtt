00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.240
the problem statement is you will be given a string 

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.760
and you have to reverse it for an example If 

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.960
they given string is apple then we need to reverse 

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.050
it So we will get e l p p A 

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.270
So your task is to write the logic for this 

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.730
reverse of a string problem and submitted using the below compiler 

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.370
see some sample inputs and corresponding outputs If the input 

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.130
is the string apple the expected output is 

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.350
e l p p A if the input is the string orange The 

10
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.460
expected output is e g n a r O.
