00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.890
So how to check if a number is odd or 

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.410
even using bitwise operators? we know for even numbers 

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.590
The LSB is zero and for odd numbers 

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.350
it is one.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.410
And using bitwise AND operator we can check 

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.680
whether the LSB is zero or one. 

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.370
Let us see an example 

8
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.980
Let us take the number 10.

9
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.750
We have to check whether the LSB is 

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.360
one or zero. To check that, we need to create 

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.730
a bit mask with LSB as one and 

12
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.650
all the other bits as zero.

13
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.370
Because we are going to check only the LSB bit

14
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.950
 

15
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.910
So bit mask will be 0001. Now perform bitwise AND 

16
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.910
operation on the number and the bitmask 

17
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.150
If the result is one, it is an odd number 

18
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.020
else it is an even number. And if we are getting 

19
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.750
zero, so we can say it is an even number 

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.860
Now take another example.

21
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.670
Five. We have to check whether the LSB 

22
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.050
is one or zero. 

23
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.260
So again bit mask will be 0001. Now perform

24
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.730
bitwise and operation on the number and bitmask 

25
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.780
And here we're getting one. So we can say it is an odd number.
