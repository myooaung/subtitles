Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.490
In this video let us learn about the Input Output Unit and the memory unit.


3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.120
In the previous video we have learned about the basic components of a computer


4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.980
First we will learn about the input unit.

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.290
The main purpose of this input unit is to get the data from the user

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.020
the computer uses various input devices to receive the data from the user.

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.370
The input device is any hardware device that 

8
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.160
allows us to communicate with the computer by sending the data. 

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
The keyboard ,the mouse are some examples of input devices 

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.020
which allows  us to communicate with the computer. 

11
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.970
And the user can give data using such input devices 

12
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.860
and this input received from the user will be stored in the memory unit .

13
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.410
So that was the input unit.

14
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.030
Now let us understand the output unit.

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.870
The main purpose of this output unit  

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.020
is to display the processed useful information to the user . 

17
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.680
Computer uses various output devices to display the information.

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.980
An output device is any hardware that receives information  

19
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.780
from the computer and displays it to the user.

20
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.300
These are some of the output devices.  

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.600
Monitor, printer, speaker etc. 

22
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.600
So that was I/O unit or input and output unit 

23
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.040
So after getting the input from the user, 

24
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.720
it will be stored in memory and then it will be processed. 

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.980
The processed useful information is again sent to memory

26
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.970
and from memory that information will be displayed via output devices 

27
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.970
Now let us discuss about the memory unit.

28
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.590
The purpose of this unit is to store data or information.


29
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.800
There are two major types of memory available.  

30
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.300
The Random Access Memory - RAM and the Read Only Memory - ROM

31
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.240
First we will discuss about RAM

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.960
The random access memory or RAM is used to store temporary information. 

33
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.400
For example, while computing big calculations,  

34
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.920
the temporary details will be stored in RAM 

35
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.150
It is also known as volatile memory. 

36
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.190
Because for any reason, if the power supply to the computer is lost,

37
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.000
we will lose all the data stored in the RAM.

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.130
And there are different types of RAM also available. 

39
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.030
Such as the static RAM or SRAM   

40
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.329
and the dynamic RAM or DRAM 

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.090
and the Synchronous Dynamic RAM or SDRAM

42
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.070
Now let us discuss about the second type memory - ROM 

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.500
So the Read Only Memory is used to store permanent information. 

44
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.930
It is a non volatile memory.

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.870
That means even if the power is turned off, 

46
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.360
the information will reside in the memory. 

47
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.210
For example, the operating system booting information, 

48
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.350
 the audio files, video files, etc will be stored in the ROM section 

49
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.420
and we can access this information whenever we want. 

50
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.859
And there are different types of ROM also available 

51
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
such as PROM or programmable read only memory 

52
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.260
EPROM or Erasable & Programmable Read Only Memory 

53
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.710
EEPROM or Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory etc.

54
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.930
So today we learned about the I/O unit and the memory unit

55
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.300
So simply the input unit will take data from the user,

56
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.860
store it in memory 

57
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.380
and then it is sent to  processing unit 

58
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.950
and the processed information is sent back to memory. 

59
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.730
From there, the output unit will take it and give the output to user

60
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.570
So that's all for this video 

61
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.920
And in the next video we will learn about the functionality of central processing unit and its components.
