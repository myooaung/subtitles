00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.350
to solve this problem we need to understand the binary 

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.700
relationship between a particular number and its previous number n 

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.430
minus one 

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.920
Let us take the number 12 and its previous number 

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.180
11 and write 

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.250
It's binary form 

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.670
Now let us also take one more number 15 and 

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.050
its previous number 14 and write 

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.250
It's binary form 

10
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.800
If we observed the binary numbers we can understand that 

11
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.330
the n minus one numbers bits are flipped from the 

12
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.630
right 

13
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.530
Most set bit that is after the right most set 

14
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.440
Bit if the bit in the original number is zero 

15
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.660
than the corresponding bit in the number n minus one 

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.450
will be one 

17
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.480
Similarly if the bit in the original number is one 

18
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.450
then the corresponding bit in the number n minus one 

19
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.350
will be zero 

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.280
So if we do bitwise and on n and 

21
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.540
n minus one the right most bit will be set 

22
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.250
to zero 

23
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.630
So the logic is very simple 

24
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.280
Just do bitwise and on the given number n and its 

25
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.950
previous number n minus one and returned that resulted number.
