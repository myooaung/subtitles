00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.770
We already know how to implement the LCS problem so 

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.320
we can re use that code now 

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.140
We just need to add the logic for this problem 

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.800
So let us write the function find minimum delete and insert 

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.160
so write function 

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.350
Fight MinDel Insert by passing the strings X and Y 

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.390
and its length 

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.440
M and N The first step is to find the 

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.560
length of longest common subsequent so call the LCS function for passing 

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.590
the strings and its length and store the result in 

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.380
variable length so write in len equal to LCS of 

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.900
X Y M 

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.350
And N now we will have the LCS length in len 

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.070
Now we can simply find the minimum number of deletions 

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.570
by subtracting LCS length len from String one 

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.720
Now we can simply find the minimum number of deletions 

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.940
by subtracting LCS length len from string 

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.720
One length n

19
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.290
so write print of minimum deletions equal to % 

20
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.690
D 

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.930
M 

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620
Minus len and find the minimum number of insertions by 

23
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.400
subtracting LCS length Len from string two length N 

24
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.900
So write print of minimum insertion equel to %D 

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.350
N minus len and that's it we are done.
