00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.730
Now let us see the code to toggle nth

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.850
bit of a number. 

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.680
First we need to get the number and bit position 

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.210
from the user. So declare the required variables 

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.030
Now read num and n from the user.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.040
Now we need to create the bit mask one left shift 

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.020
n minus one 

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.780
And now we need to perform bitwise XOR.

9
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.630
So write num equal to num XOR one left 

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.050
shift n minus one. 

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.540
Now the nth bit will be toggled in num.

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.180
so we can just print it.
