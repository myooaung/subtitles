00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.050
We can use two pointers to solve this problem. 

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.000
one to iterate the array and another one to point 

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.340
the updated array.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.760
It's new len so we can solve this problem in two steps. 

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.360
In step one, place all the ones in the beginning

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
and track the new length. In step two,

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.220
we can replace all the elements from new length to 

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.650
end with zero. 

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.650
So this way, let us solve this problem 

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.380
First we need to iterate the array and in each step, 

11
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.320


12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.320
check the current index value is one 

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.490
If it is one, place the element in new len

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.450
index and increment new len

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.250
If the element is zero just move to the next element 

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.710
Here the first element is one.

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.960
So we can place it in new len index zero and 

18
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.050
increment new len.

19
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.120
Next we have element zero 

20
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.070
So without doing anything, we can move to the next 

21
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.650
element.

22
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260
And here we have element one 

23
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.060
So we need to place it in new len index 

24
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.240
And currently new len is index one, so place this one 

25
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.770
at array index 1. Now increment new len

26
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.460
Now in the end of this iteration, we will have 

27
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.050
all the ones placed in the beginning and the updated 

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.460
new length value after that from new length to end

29
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.420
we need to replace all the elements with zero and 

30
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.450
the task is done. 

31
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.260
So using this logic, you can try to solve this 

32
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.990
problem.
