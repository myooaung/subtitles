00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
So we need to check

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.850
if there is a loop in the given linked list 

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.800
here we can use two pointers slow and fast and 

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.990
traverse the list using these two pointers. As the names, 

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.530
slow pointer will move slowly and fast will move fastly.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.850
In each iteration, slow will move to one node ahead and 

7
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.330
fast will move two nodes ahead. At any point 

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.180
if slow and fast points to the same node, then 

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.250
we can understand that a loop is present 

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.910
And if slow or fast reaches last node or null,

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.180
then we can understand there is no loop in the 

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.350
given linked list.
