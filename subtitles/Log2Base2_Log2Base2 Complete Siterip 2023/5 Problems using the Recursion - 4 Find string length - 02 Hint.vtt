00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.150
So how can we find the string length Using 

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.860
Recursion we can keep a static variable to store the 

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.960
length and write a recursive function with two parameters 

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.910
the string and the index and in every recursive call 

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.560
check 

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.160
If the particular character is valid or null character 

7
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.600
If it is a valid character increment length and make 

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.350
the next recursive call with the incremented Index Value 

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.920
If it is null character it is the base case 

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.610
so we can just return 

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.590
the length for example 

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.210
Here str of Index has the character A 

13
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.080
It is not null character so increment length value and 

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.350
make the next Recursive call with index value as 

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.630
one similarly here str of index that is str of 

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.490
one is B which is not null character so increment 

17
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.800
length 

18
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.230
So it becomes two 

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.310
Now make the next recursive call with incremented index which 

20
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.090
is two and here str of two is equal 

21
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.750
to C which is not null 

22
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510
So increment length 

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.450
Now make the next Recursive call with incremented 

24
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.350
index three And here also str of index that 

25
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.190
is str of three is not null so increment length 

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.170
and it becomes four now called the Function Again by passing 

27
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.870
index plus one which is four and here index is 

28
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.330
four and str of four is null character so we 

29
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.510
can stop this process and return length which will be 

30
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.370
the string length 

31
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.750
So using this logic you can try solving the problem.
