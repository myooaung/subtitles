00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Now let us see how to write the code to 

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.770
check if nth bit of a number is set or not.

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.250


4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.050
First let us declare the required variables 

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.400
We need to store the number and the bit position 

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.140
So declare integer variables num and n. Now read 

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.120
the values of num and n from the user.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.060
now we need to create the bitmask by doing 

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.550
n-1 left shifts on number one and then 

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.810
performing bitwise AND on this bitmask and the 

11
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.350
number.

12
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.000
So write  num equal to num AND (1 leftshift n-1) 

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.450


14
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.220
Now if the result is zero, the bit is not set.

15
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.640


16
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.890
And if the result is non zero, it is set. 

17
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.300
so write if num = 0 then print "OFF" else print "ON".
