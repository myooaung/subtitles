00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.110
In this video, let us learn about two pointers 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.750
technique.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.770
The two pointer technique is a useful pattern to solve 

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.670
problems involving sorted arrays or linked list. 

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.150
So how can we identify two pointers pattern?

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.380
The problems mostly deal with sorted arrays or linked 

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.280
list and ask us to find pairs or triplet or sub array

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.980
with a given target or remove duplicates from it.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.360
See examples for such problems. Given a sorted array. Find a 

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.930
pair with the target sum

11
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.610
 remove duplicates from the sorted array. Given a sorted array,

12
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.340
find the triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.950


14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.470
If we analyse all the problems, we can easily observe 

15
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.050
the two pointers pattern 

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.180
Here 

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.750
All the problems are dealing with sorted arrays 

18
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.130
and ask us to find the pair or triplet with 

19
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.840
the target or remove duplicate from the sorted array

20
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.800
We can solve these kind of problems easily using two 

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.000
pointers approach 

22
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.090
So in the next video we will learn the sample problems to understand two pointers pattern.
