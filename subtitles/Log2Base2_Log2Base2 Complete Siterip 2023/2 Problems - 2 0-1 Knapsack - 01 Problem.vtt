1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
let us take the same knapsack and items 

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.520
But this time we cannot break the item and take 

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.780
it 

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.260
That is we can't take the fraction of items we 

5
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.280
can either pick the item completely or leave it 

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.150
That is 01 property 

7
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.530
So can we applied 

8
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.800
The same greedy approach To solve this problem let us 

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.860
see how it works 

10
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.880
we have the items are already in sorted order with 

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.350
profit weight ratio 

12
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.050
What will greedy algorithm do First it will take item 

13
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.590
a fully so knapsack weight will be five kg and 

14
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.220
profit will be ₹50 and then it will take the 

15
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.460
item be fully and now the knapsack weight will be 

16
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.850
five plus 20 25 kg and the new profit will be 

17
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.480
50 plus 1 40 

18
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.640
That is 190 now the remaining capacity is five 

19
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.190
kg 

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.040
But all the items are above five kg 

21
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.240
So we cannot pick any item 

22
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.580
If it's fractional we would have picked five kg of 

23
00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.520
item C 

24
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.370
But in this 01 knapsack problem we can either pick 

25
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.080
the item completely or leave it so our final profit 

26
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.200
will be ₹190 is 190 

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.190
The maximum profit we can make with 01 knapsack 

28
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.040
No if we pick items B and C fully the total 

29
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.180
weight will be 30 Kg and our profit will be 

30
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.410
₹200 

31
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.650
So 200 is the right solution for this problem 

32
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.950
So greedy approach won't work for 01 knapsack problem 

33
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.060
We can solve 01 knapsack problem using dynamic programming 

34
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.110
So in the next video we will learn how to 

35
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.750
solve 01 knapsack problem using dynamic programmin.
