00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.820
so write function findSteps which takes the number 

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.920
of stairs n as the parameter 

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.990
And it returns the result which will be an individual 

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.000
now declared the integer array steps of size n 

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.430
plus one and the iterating variable iw

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.750
Now we need to write the base case steps of 

7
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.330
one equal to one and steps of two equal to 

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.650
two 

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.710
Now when n is greater than or equal to three we 

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.170
need to calculate total number of ways by using previous 

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.980
two results 

12
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.980
So write a for loop for i equal to three I 

13
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.410
less than or equal to n 

14
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.040
I plus plus and in each iteration findSteps of 

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.720
I equal to steps of I minus one plus steps 

16
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.950
of I minus two and the final answer will be 

17
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.040
stored in steps of N so we can return steps 

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.650
of N.
