00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.780
Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.990
In this video let us have an introduction to selection 

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.700
Sort selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm and in 

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.650
this algorithm we will select the correct element for every 

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.350
position 

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.620
So assume that there are some students standing in a 

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.340
queue and all the students in a row should stand 

8
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.600
based on their height 

9
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.650
That is the shortest person will stand in the beginning 

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.070
and the tallest one will stand in the end just 

11
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.850
like we stand in a school assembly 

12
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
So let us take these five students with different heights 

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.380
First one's height is 180 centimetre 

14
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.850
The second one's height is 165 centimetre 

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.890
The third one's height is 150 centimetre and the fourth 

16
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.600
one's height is 170 centimetre and the fifth one 

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.850
height is 145 centimetres 

18
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.160
But you can see they are not standing based on 

19
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.650
their heights 

20
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.240
See here the Tallest person is standing at the first 

21
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.900
position and the shortest person is standing at the last 

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.550
position 

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.570
They're standing in a randomly

24
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
So here we need to select the correct person for 

25
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.780
every position 

26
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.890
And how can we do that We can do that 

27
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.800
by selecting one person at a time and comparing him 

28
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.350
with the other person's 

29
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.270
And if they are not in the right order we 

30
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.770
can change their positions 

31
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.180
So first let us select the student who is standing 

32
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.950
at Position one and whose height is 180 centimetres 

33
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
Now let us compare him with the next person and 

34
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.410
student 

35
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.350
One is taller than student two here which means they 

36
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.210
not standing in the right order 

37
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.290
So we have to change their positions like this 

38
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.630
And you have to understand one thing very clearly 

39
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.250
Here we are finding the right person for position one 

40
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.850
and we are not finding the right position for student 

41
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.150
one 

42
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.340
there is difference between them that is we have selected 

43
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.540
the position one here and we are comparing the student 

44
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.640
at position one with all the other students behind him 

45
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.740
And whenever we find a shorter person we bring him 

46
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.920
to the first position 

47
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.850
So now let us compared the student at position one 

48
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.450
with the third person 

49
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.050
Because we are finding the right person for position one 

50
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.550
So compare these two persons and we can see that 

51
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.840
the third person is shorter so again changed their positions 

52
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.230
So now compare the student at position one with the 

53
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.900
student at position four and we can see that the 

54
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.690
fourth student is taller than the first one 

55
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.520
So there is no problem 

56
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.710
So now compared the student at position one with the 

57
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.150
student at Position five and see they are not in 

58
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.960
the right order 

59
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.160
The fifth one is shorter than the first one so 

60
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.740
exchange their positions 

61
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.650
And now what just happened 

62
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.620
The shortest person that is a person with height  

63
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.600
145 centimetres got into his correct position which is position 

64
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.940
one 

65
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.910
So we selected one position and did many comparisons and 

66
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.750
found the right person into that position 

67
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.000
So that is what selections sort is so first Position is 

68
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.250
now 

69
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.750
Okay 

70
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.760
Now our objective is to find a correct person for 

71
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.400
the position to so compared these two 

72
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.750
And we found that the third one is shorter than 

73
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.580
the second one 

74
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.780
So exchange their positions and now compare the second one 

75
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.650
and fourth one 

76
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.500
And they are in right order 

77
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.010
That is the shorter student is standing before the taller 

78
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.150
one so no need to exchange the positions 

79
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.130
And now compared to students standing it's 2nd and 5th 

80
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.690
positions and see the student and Position five is shorter 

81
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.650
than the student at position two 

82
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.410
So we have to change their positions 

83
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.150
We have to bring the shorter one into the front 

84
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.850
And this step is also done now

85
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.590
And now we got the correct person for the position 

86
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.270
two now Our objective is to find the correct person 

87
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.030
for position 

88
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.070
Three So compared these two and we found Third one 

89
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.690
is taller than the fourth one 

90
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.230
So we have to change their positions and now compared 

91
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.330
the students standing a third and fifth positions and see 

92
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.080
the student 

93
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.150
at position five is shorter than the student at position 

94
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.450
two 

95
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.130
So we have to change their positions 

96
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.820
And now this third step is also completed 

97
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.550
And we got the correct person for position three 

98
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.310
So now we have the right person at position 1 2 

99
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.850
and three 

100
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.610
Now we only have to take care of students at 

101
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.350
position four and five 

102
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.970
So now let us find the correct person for position 

103
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.350
four 

104
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.090
So compare the students at position four and five 

105
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.180
And we found that fourth one is taller than the 

106
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.850
fifth one 

107
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.680
So we have to change their positions and now this 

108
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.890
fourth step is also completed and we got the correct 

109
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.350
person for position four 

110
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.690
And there is only one student left now and he 

111
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.040
must be the tallest one 

112
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.360
And he must be at their right position after this 

113
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.150
final step 

114
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.110
So now all the five students are at their right 

115
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.600
positions and this is exactly how selection sort works 

116
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.720
In each iteration we will find the minimum or maximum 

117
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.960
element and places it in its right position by comparing 

118
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.450
it with other elements 

119
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.880
So that is what selection sort is Now let us derive

120
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.050
The algorithm for selection sort from this example 

121
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.460
So we have five students here 

122
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.520
But we needed only four iterations because when fourth person 

123
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.090
finds his place the fifth person that is the last 

124
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.270
person automatically finds his place too 

125
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.690
So if we have size elements size minus one iterations 

126
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.230
are enough to sort all the elements so we can 

127
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.250
write the outer loop as for i equal to zero i less 

128
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.850
than size minus one i plus plus 

129
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.020
And in each iteration we are comparing one element with 

130
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.420
all other elements which are after it that is in 

131
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.500
iteration zero 

132
00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.350
We are comparing elements that positions 1 2 3 and four 

133
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.540
And in iteration one we are comparing elements that positions 

134
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.020
2 3 and four and in iteration two we are comparing 

135
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.680
elements that positions three and four 

136
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.570
And finally in iteration three 

137
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.980
We are comparing elements at position four so in every 

138
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.350
outer loop iteration 

139
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.290
For I the inner loop execution will be from I 

140
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.420
plus one to size so we can write the inner 

141
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.820
loop

142
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.110
As for J 

143
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.610
equal to I plus one j less than size J 

144
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.130
plus Plus that is the outer loop is dealing with 

145
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.380
an element at a particular position 

146
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.920
Then the inner loop make comparisons from the element 

147
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.040
one ahead of the element the outer loop is dealing 

148
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.950
with till the last elements 

149
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.930
And if the order is not correct then the elements 

150
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.650
will be swapped

151
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.890
And this is how selections sort works and we have 

152
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.750
derived the algorithm for it 

153
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:27.000
In the next video we will learn how this algorithm works with suitable examples.
