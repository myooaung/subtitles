Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.449
In this video we are going to discuss about the 

3
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.949
break statement in C 

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.959
The break statement can be used in several cases 

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.259
Like if you want to terminate a loop or to 

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.950
terminate a case in switch 

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.050
Now let us see how the break works 

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.750
When a break statement is encountered inside a loop the 

9
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.000
loop will immediately be terminated and the control goes to the 

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.550
next statement

11
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.620
after the loop 

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.670
Now let us see the syntax of break it is 

13
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.380
very simple 

14
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.730
Just write break followed by a semi colon 

15
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.550
Now let us see the usage of break using a 

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.080
simple programme to execute the loop until user enters a 

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080
negative number 

18
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.890
So we have the programme here and we have the 

19
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.010
main function and an integer variable 

20
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.430
num is declared and we have a while loop here 

21
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.940
and it is while(1) 

22
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.100
So the condition is always true 

23
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.130
So it is an infinite loop and in each iteration we 

24
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.450
ask the user to enter a number and that is 

25
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.830
stored to the variable num 

26
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.030
And if num less than 0 we have to break 

27
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.360
and come out of the loop and execute the next 

28
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.529
statement. Otherwise

29
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.710
Just print the number and continue 

30
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450
So let us suppose user enters number 5 which 

31
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.560
will be stored in num. 

32
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.339
And when the if condition is checked it fails.

33
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.839
So print the value of which is five and first 

34
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.880
iteration is over. Now we check the while condition again 

35
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.529
which is true 

36
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.640
So we ask user to enter the number 

37
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.360
Let us assume this time it is 10 and it is stored in

38
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.679
num And  condition fails again. So print 10 and 

39
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.110
it will go for the third iteration and ask the 

40
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.200
user to enter the number Let it be -1

41
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740
Now it will be stored in Num and when it 

42
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.830
checks the if condition it is true 

43
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.130
So it will break out of the loop that is 

44
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.950
control comes out of the loop and executes the next 

45
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.000
statement which is return zero here 

46
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.770
So that is how it works 

47
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.930
Now let us learn about break inside a nested loop

48
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.890
So we have an inner loop and outer loop here and 

49
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.470
break is inside inner loop 

50
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.179
And if it gets executed than the inner Loops execution 

51
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.660
will be stopped and it will start executing the next 

52
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.549
line of code after that block 

53
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.309
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
