Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.990
In this video let us discuss about malloc vs calloc. 

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.660
So we have learned both these functions to allocate memory 

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.560
dynamically 

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.430
So why do we need two different functions for the 

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.910
same purpose which is dynamic memory allocation? What are the differences 

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.900
between these two? First difference is in arguments. For malloc 

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.439
We have just one argument which is the size specified 

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.150
in bytes

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.690
But calloc takes two arguments 

11
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.190
which are the number of elements and the size of the 

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.730
element 

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.450
Now let us discuss about initialisation 

14
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.489
malloc doesn't initialise the memory area 

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.839
The allocated memory area will have garbage values. But calloc 

16
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.730
initialise the memory area to 0. calloc is 

17
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.780
malloc() + memset(zero). memset is a 

18
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.360
function which is used to fill a block of memory 

19
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.600
with a particular value. Here 

20
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.310
In case of calloc the memset function will 

21
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.170
fill zero to the dynamically allocated memory 

22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.430
So whenever we want to allocate dynamic memory and initialise 

23
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.410
with zero we can use the calloc function. So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
