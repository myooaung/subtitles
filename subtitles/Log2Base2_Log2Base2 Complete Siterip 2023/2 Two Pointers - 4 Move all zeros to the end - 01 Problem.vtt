00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.750
You will be given an array of zeros and ones 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.260
and your task is to move all the zeros to 

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.550
the end of the array.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.440
For example, if this is the given array, we 

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.030
need to move all the zeros to the end.

6
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.710
So the expected output is like this. All the zeros 

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.560
at the end.
