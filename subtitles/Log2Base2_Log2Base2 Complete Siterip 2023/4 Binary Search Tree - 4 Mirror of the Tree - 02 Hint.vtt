00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.860
So to find the mirror of a tree, just use 

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.320
inorder traversal to traverse the tree and in each 

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.850
recursive call, swap the left and right sub trees.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.550
So let us see how. After the recursive calls, we can swap left 

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.600
and right sub trees. For node 10 both the left 

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.450
and right sub tree is null. So null will be swapped 

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.690
similarly 

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.270
for node 60 left subtree is null and right subtree is null

9
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.240
So null will be swapped. Now for node 50,

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.980


11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.900
It's left sub tree with root 10  and right sub tree

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.120
 with root 60 will be swapped. for node 150 

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.510
both the left and right sub tree is null and it will 

14
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.150
be swapped. similarly for node 300 left sub tree null and right 

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.500
sub tree null will be swapped now for node 200,

16
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.450


17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.100
It's left sub tree with root 150, right sub tree

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.800
with root 300 will be swapped and lastly for 

19
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.910
node 100

20
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.200
It's left sub tree with root 50 and right sub tree

21
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.850
with root 200 will be swapped.

22
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.810
See finally we have got the mirror of the actual binary tree.
