1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.530
to solve this problem 

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.710
Let us write a function count set bits which takes 

3
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.110
an integer n and returns an integer

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.350
First declare an initialised count to 0 

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.830
Now we need to continuously clear the right 

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.430
Most set bit and increments count until the number becomes

7
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.250
zero 

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.260
So write while n n equal to n bitwise 

9
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.830
and n minus one and count plus plus and finally return 

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.350
count.
