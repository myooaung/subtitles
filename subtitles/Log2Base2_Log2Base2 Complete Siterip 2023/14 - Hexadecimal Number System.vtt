00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:01.650
Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.050
In this video we're going to discuss about the hexa decimal number system.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.920
In hexadecimal number system 

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440
We will group the binary value into four bit groups 

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.130
See this example this is a large binary number 

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.990
What we do with hexadecimal system is that

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.240
we group these into four bits from right to left like this 

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.849
The maximum value that can be formed using four bits is 1111

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.980
 which is equal to decimal 15 

10
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.150
So we can call this as a base 16 number system

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.380
Hexa decimal number system has values from 0 to 15 

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.469
to represent numbers beyond 9

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.500
hexadecimal uses letters from A to F 

14
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.200
that is 10 will be represented as A, 

15
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.750
11 as B, 12 as C, 13 as D, 14 as E and finally 15 as F 

16
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.790
So see this table with 4 bit binary values and its corresponding decimal and hexa decimal values 

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.590
for 0000 decimal is 0 and hexa decimal is also 0 

18
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.290
till 1001 decimal and hexa decimal values will be the same 

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.720
That is till 9. 

20
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.770
so for 0001 decimal and hexadecimal value  is 1

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.370
For 0010 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 2

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.050
For 0011 hexadecimal and decimal value is 3

23
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.450
And for 0100 decimal and hexadecimal value will be 4

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.280
And  for 0101 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 5

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.040
and  for 0110 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 6

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.090
and for 0111 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 7

27
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.700
and for 1000 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 8

28
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.240
 and for 1001 the decimal and hexadecimal value is 9

29
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.000
 now for 1010, the decimal is 10 and hexadecimal is A or a
 
30
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.690
and for 1011, the decimal is 11 and hexadecimal value is B or b 

31
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.170
 for 1100, the decimal is 12 and hexadecimal is C or c 

32
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.490
 for 1101, the decimal is 13 and hexadecimal is d or D

33
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.660
And for 1110, decimal is 14 and hexadecimal is e or E


34
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.050
for 1111, the decimal is 15 and hexadecimal is f or F

35
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.150
So we have to by heart these values  

36
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.390
and it will be very easy for us 

37
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.030
to convert any binary number to it's equivalent hexadecimal value

38
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.830
and any hexadecimal value to it's equivalent binary value.

39
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.860
So what is the major difference between Octal and Hexadecimal systems?

40
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.650
In the octal system, we had grouped every three bits of a binary number 

41
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.820
But in the computer, the memory allocation always happens in the multiples of 4 

42
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.510
 like 1 byte which is 8 bits.

43
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.820
4 bytes which is 32 bits. 

44
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.000
8 bytes which is 64 bits like that. 

45
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:10.700
All are multiples of 4. 

46
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.780
so using octal number system is not a good idea 

47
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.410
So how can we easily handle computer memory addresses? 

48
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.640
The answer is use hexadecimal number system.

49
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.840
In hexa decimal number system 

50
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.260
We group every four binary bits  

51
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.770
so that we can easily represent computer memory addresses  

52
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.520
so it makes life easier as it allows grouping of binary numbers 

53
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890
which makes it easier to read, write and understand 

54
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.910
Now let us see how to convert a binary value into it's hexa decimal value.

55
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.410
It is very simple 

56
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150
Make groups of 4 bits from right to left 

57
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.850
and replace each group with corresponding hexadecimal value 

58
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.420
So we have a binary value here : 10001101

59
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.400
We have to convert it into its hexa decimal value.

60
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.560
So first group it.

61
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.150
So we get 1000 and 1101 

62
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.270
So for binary 1000, the hexa decimal value is 8 and for 1101 it is decimal 13 and hexadecimal D

63
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.150
 So for binary 10001101, the corresponding hexadecimal value is 8D

64
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.690
So that is how we convert binary to hexadecimal.

65
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.430
Now how to convert hexadecimal value to binary ?

66
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.080
It is also very simple.

67
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.680
Take each digit or character from hexadecimal value and replace it with its 4 bit binary value 

68
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.840
So see an example. We have the hexadecimal value FD

69
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.070
So write the corresponding 4 bit binary of F and D. 

70
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.740
for F it is 1111 and for D it is 1101

71
00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.200
So for the hexadecimal number FD, the equivalent binary value is 11111101. 

72
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.580
So today we discussed about Hexadecimal number system or Base 16 number system  

73
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.400
In this system we will group every four bits of binary in the right to left direction.

74
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.979
we learned how to convert binary to hexadecimal  

75
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.870
just group the bits in size of 4 from right to left 

76
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.270
and write the corresponding hexadecimal values of each group 

77
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.260
and to convert hexadecimal to binary

78
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.349
Simply write the 4 bit binary value of each digit or character and finally join them.

79
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.770
Also unlike octal system, hexadecimal number system is quite very useful to handle

80
00:05:40:250 --> 00:05:44.340
 computer memory addresses since we have groups of 4 bits 

81
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:45.610
So that's all 

82
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.500
And in the next video we will discuss about how to convert decimal number to other number systems 

83
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.950
So that's all for this video and thank you for watching.
