1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.900
you will be given sorted array that might contain duplicate 

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.210
elements and then integer n your task is to 

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.950
find the first and last occurrence of end in the array

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.390
For example let's take this array arr and an integer n 

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.430
 Here integer eight is present in four indices 

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.630
from indexed 3 to 6 

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.860
Thus the first position is three and the last position is 

8
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.360
six 

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.850
Thus you have to return 36 

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.640
Let's take another array 

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.170
Who's elements are 256699 and here n is five five occurs 

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.830
only in index one 

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.880
Thus you have to print 11 .
