1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.830
given an array of integer 

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.110
Each element represents the maximum number of steps that can 

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.750
be made for what from that element 

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.210
For example 

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.370
If the number is two we can take at Max 

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.180
two steps if the number is three we can take at 

7
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.050
max three steps and so on 

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120
So we need to write a logic to return the 

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.100
minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the 

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.450
array 

11
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.450
For example here the first element is two 

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.480
So at Max we can take only two steps 

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.540
So from here we can take two steps and reach 

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.850
one 

15
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.350
And from one we can take one step 

16
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.680
So from one we can reach the next one 

17
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.060
And from here we can take one step and we 

18
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.270
can reach two from two 

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.250
We can take two steps and reached the next two 

20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.870
And from here we can take another two steps and 

21
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.550
reach one 

22
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.140
And from this one we can take one step to 

23
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.050
reach the end 

24
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.700
So in this way it takes six jumps to reach 

25
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.750
the end of the array from the beginning 

26
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.790
see another case 

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.300
First we have to so we can take maximum two 

28
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.510
steps but let us just take one step and reached 

29
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.850
three and take three steps from there to reach two 

30
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.610
and take two steps from that to reach next two 

31
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.030
and take two steps from that to reach one and 

32
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.680
finally take one step to reach the end 

33
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.290
So in this way it takes five jumps to reach 

34
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.830
the end 

35
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.540
Now considered this case here we first take one step 

36
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.750
to reach three and take three steps to reach two 

37
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.730
and just take one step to reach four and take 

38
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.350
four steps to reach the end 

39
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.460
So in this way it only takes four jumps which 

40
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.890
is the minimum one so the expected output is 

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.550
four.
