00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.470
Given a binary tree and a value sum, you need 

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.960
to find if the tree has a path from root to leaf

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.020
such that the sum of all the node values 

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.250
of the path equals to the given sum value 

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.060
For example if this is the given tree and the 

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.370
given sum value is 210, then this path with nodes 

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.050
100 50 60 gives the total sum 210 

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.310
So such a path exist in this tree and if the given 

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.880
sum value is 450 there is no such path 

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.250
exist in this tree.
