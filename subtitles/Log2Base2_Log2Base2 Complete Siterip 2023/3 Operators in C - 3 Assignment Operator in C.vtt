Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.660
In this video we are going to learn that assignment operator in C.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.080
So the assignment operator can be used 

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.950
to assign values to the variables 

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.729
So see a programme here in the main function we're 

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.060
declaring an integer variable A and initialising to 10 

7
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.130
And next we are declaring another innteger variable b and 

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.670
we have b=a 

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.110
So that is the assignment Operator and the =

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.200
symbol is th assignment operator in C. And what happens 

11
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.680
here is that the value of a is assigned to 

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.530
variable b. so 10 will be stored in b also 

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.930
now we are printing the values of A and B 

14
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.959
and see the output 

15
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.800
It will be 10 , 10. Basically what happens is 

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.740
that the value of right side operand will be assigned 

17
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:48.820
to the left side operand

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.770
But there are more compound assignment operators and we're 

19
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.970
going to see them. First we have += 

20
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.670
which means left and right 

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.330
Operands will be added and the result will be assigned 

22
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.139
to the left operand and it is equivalent to writing 

23
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.610
a = a+b

24
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.490
Then we have -= which means right operand

25
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.720
will be subtracted from left operand and the result 

26
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.800
will be assigned to the left operand 

27
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.320
And it is the same as writing a = a-b

28
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.970


29
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.780
next is *=

30
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.620
 which means the product of left and 

31
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.400
right operand will be calculated and the result will be 

32
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.950
assigned to the Left Operand 

33
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.190
And it is same as writing a= a*b

34
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.390
next 

35
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.699
We have /= which means the left 

36
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.590
operand is divided by right operand and the quotient

37
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.229
is assigned to the left operand and this is same 

38
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.560
as writing a=a/b next we 

39
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.150
have %= and here after left and right 

40
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.360
operand division the remainder will be stored in left 

41
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.610
operand. Now let us see examples and let a equal 

42
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.610
to 10 and b=5  

43
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.390
And we have a+=b and as we 

44
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.040
said it is equivalent to a= a+b

45
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.839
 so we will get a equal to 15 

46
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.720
Next we have a-=b so that 

47
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.489
is equal to a=a-b and we 

48
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.730
get a=5 and next is a*=b

49
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.230
 that is a=a*b

50
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.450
 and we get a= 50 

51
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.840
Next is a/=b that is 

52
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.130
a=a/b and we get  a=2

53
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.920
 next a%=b and it is 

54
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.550
same as a=a%b and we get a=0

55
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.150


56
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.860
So let us see an example programme and we have the main 

57
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.010
function and  we are declaring integer variables a equal 

58
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.690
to 10 and b = 5

59
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.320
Then we are calculating a += b and 

60
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.010
we are printing the value of a as a+b

61
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.649
be so the output will be 15 

62
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.480
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
