Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.840
In this video let us discuss about the binary search 

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.550
algorithm 

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.710
So Binary 

5
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.480
search is actually like searching a page in a 

6
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.660
book with ordered page numbers 

7
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.900
Here the first page number will be one 

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.930
Next will be two then three then four 

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.610
And so So assume you have such a book in 

10
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.850
your hand with 100 pages 

11
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.850
And I am asking you to find Page number 90 

12
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.870
So what will you do You will take the book 

13
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.150
and opened the page near to centre 

14
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.860
Now you have the left half and right half so 

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.710
we know we have 100 pages 

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.030
So in the first half it will be 1 to 

17
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.710
50 

18
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.650
The second half it will be 51 to 100 

19
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.330
So you will ignore the first half and consider the 

20
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.050
second half 

21
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.850
Only since 90 could be present in this half only 

22
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.330
And here the page numbers are from 51 to 100 again 

23
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.540
You will divide it in half and it will be 

24
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.450
51 to 75 76 

25
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.150
to 100 

26
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.670
And you will ignore the first half again and search 

27
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.790
in the second half 

28
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.480
And this way you can easily find the page 

29
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.660
Number 90 

30
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.900
So unlikely 

31
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.610
linear search 

32
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.200
We don't need to go through all pages of the 

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.650
book 

34
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.410
We will continuously divide the book into half till we 

35
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.910
find that particular page so we can save a lot 

36
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.520
of time 

37
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.120
So that is binary search so binary search 

38
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.850
can be performed on sorter or ordered set of elements.
