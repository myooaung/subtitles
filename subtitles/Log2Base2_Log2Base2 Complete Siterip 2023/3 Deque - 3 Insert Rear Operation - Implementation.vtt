00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.420
in this video let us learn the insert rear operation 

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.740
and its implementation 

3
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.410
The insert rear operation will insert the given element at 

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.990
the end here 

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.290
We need to handle two 

6
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.480
Main cases the first one is when the deque 

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.600
empty and the second one is when the deque already 

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.650
has elements 

9
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.380
let us discus case by case 

10
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.760
First let us take an empty 

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.760
deque and insert Element 100 

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.730
at rear so created new node with the given Value 

13
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.350
100 

14
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.850
Here the rear point of is null which means the 

15
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.970
deque is empty 

16
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.370
So in this case we need to set both front 

17
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.550
and rear points to the first node 

18
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.310
So make both front and rear point to node 100 

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.170
that's it 

20
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.700
Next let us discuss how to insert at the rear 

21
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.020
when the deque already has some elements 

22
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.120
so let us take this deque 

23
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.350
It already has two elements 

24
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.070
nodes 

25
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.370
10 and 20 let us 

26
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.550
Insert a new element 30 at the rear 

27
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.980
First let us create the new node with the given 

28
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.300
value 30 and then we need to do the following 

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.770
things first make next 

30
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270
of rear points to the new node and then make 

31
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.860
previous of new node points to the rear Pointer 

32
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.790
and finally make new node as rear 

33
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.850
And that's it 

34
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.550
so the logic of insert rear operation is very simple 

35
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.990
First create the new node with the given value using 

36
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.220
get node function 

37
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.400
If rear is null make both front and rear points 

38
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.350
to the new node 

39
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.530
Otherwise insert the given node at the rear by using the 

40
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.650
following steps 

41
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.320
Make next of rear points to the new node and 

42
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
then make previous of new node points to the rear 

43
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.450
and finally make the new node as rear 

44
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.880
And that's it we have implemented the insert rear 

45
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.500
function 

46
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.710
In the next video we will learn how to implement 

47
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.150
the delete front function.
