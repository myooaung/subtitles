00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.600
The problem statement is you have to implement two stacks 

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.650
in a single array. 

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.550
We already learned a method to do this but the 

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.740
problem with that method was it was not efficient with 

5
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.250
memory utilisation.

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.880
For example, let us assume the first stack is full 

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.050
and the second stack is empty. 

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.250
Suppose we want to push another element into stack1

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.450
So what will happen? It is not possible because stack1 

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.750
is already full 

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.570
So even though we have three empty spaces left in 

12
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.590
the stack, we ended up with stack overflow 

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.950
so you need to find another efficient method to solve this problem
