1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.280
we can use four methods to solve recurrence relations 

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.290
The first one is substitution method where we first guess  

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.700
the solution and then use mathematical induction to prove our 

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.650
guess is correct 

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.900
The next one is back substitution method which is also 

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.220
known as iteration method where we put the recurrence relation 

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.960
back into itself until we see a pattern 

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.800
Once we see the pattern we can easily find the 

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.560
solution 

10
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.520
The next one is Recursion Tree method where we draw 

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.000
the picture of the back substitution process and calculate the 

12
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.770
time complexity and fourth one is Master's theorem where 

13
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.600
we instantly tell the solution by seeing the 

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.210
pattern of the recurrence relation 

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.680
So these are the methods to solve recurrence relations and from 

16
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.030
the next videos we will start solving the recurrence relation 

17
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.370
using these methods
