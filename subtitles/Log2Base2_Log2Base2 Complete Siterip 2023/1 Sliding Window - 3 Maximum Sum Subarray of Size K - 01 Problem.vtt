00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.320
The problem statement is you will be given an array 

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.150
of integers and the subarray size k.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.760
You need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.630
sub array of size k 

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.330
For example, given an array 1 5 -1 6 3 2 and  

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.030
k equal to 3. Here sum of sub array of

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.670
size 3 are 5 10 8 and 11 

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.230
So the maximum of sub array sum is equal to 11 and 

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.540
the sub array is 6 3 2. So your task is to 

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.210
write the logic for this problem and submit it using the 

11
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.810
below compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs. 

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.160
If the input array is 1 5 -1 6 3 2 and 

13
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.150
k is equal to 3, then the expected output is 11 

14
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.110
And if the input array is 4 2 3 5 1 and k is equal to 2, then the expected output is 8.
