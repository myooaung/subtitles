00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.140
In the size of the tree video 

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.340
We have calculated the size of the tree using the 

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.050
inorder traversal method 

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.040
We can modify the logic a little bit to calculate 

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.950
the maximum depth of the tree.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.540
So while finding the size of the tree, each time 

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.350
we will return 1 + size of its sub tree 

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.580
Here we don't need the total number of nodes 

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.850
We need maximum depth 

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.170
So what we can do is instead of returning 

11
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.470
1 + size of left sub tree + size of right sub tree

12
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.980
we can return 1 + maximum value between 

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.650
size of left sub tree and right sub tree 

14
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.160
See here for this node, the left sub tree size is one

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.410
and right sub tree size is two 

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.670
which one is maximum? Two. So return one + two 

17
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.150
So it will return three which is the maximum depth 

18
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.580
of this sub tree.

19
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.050
Similarly here both left and right sub tree size is one

20
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.690
So maximum value is one, so return one + one

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.060
 and it will return two which is the maximum 

22
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.850
depth of this sub tree.

23
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.270
Finally here the depth of left sub tree is three and 

24
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.890
right sub tree is two. So maximum is three.

25
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.080
So return one + three which is four.

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
And that is the maximum depth or height of this tree

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.060
So you can reuse the size of the tree logic 

28
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.450
but each time, return one + maximum value between 

29
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.630
left sub tree size and right sub tree size.
