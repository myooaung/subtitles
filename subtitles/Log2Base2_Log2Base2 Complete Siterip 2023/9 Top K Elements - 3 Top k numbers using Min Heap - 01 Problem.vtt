00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.420
In the previous method we have solve the top K 

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.450
elements problem using max heap 

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.980
But the problem with that method is to build a 

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.680
max heap it will take order of n time and 

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.850
to get the top K elements it will take another 

6
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.950
K log n time 

7
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.730
So the total time complexity of this algorithm will be 

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.150
order of n plus K log n 

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.620
In this problem your task is to further optimise the 

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.550
above algorithm and reduce the time complexity.
