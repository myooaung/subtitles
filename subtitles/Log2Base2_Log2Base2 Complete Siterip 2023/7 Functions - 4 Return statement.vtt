Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.070
In this video we are going to learn about the return statement in C.

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.500
When the programme execution 

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.970
reaches a function call the control goes to function definition 

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.230
and when the programme execution reaches the return statement it 

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.290
terminates execution of a function and returns the control 

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.880
to the calling function. Now let us see the syntax

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.750
If we write return just like this it will not 

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.040
return anything to the calling function but it will terminate 

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.220
the function execution and gives control to the calling function 

10
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.190
But if we specify any particular value or variable or 

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.760
expression for example return 10, return a or return a+b 

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.260
then given value will be returned to the 

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.750
calling function and then it terminates the function execution and 

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.010
gives control to the calling function 

15
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.290
Now let us see a programme here 

16
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.110
Execution will be beginning from main function and integer variable 

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.430
ans will be created and next we have ans = sum(10,5)

18
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.280


19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.580


20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.650
So control goes to function sum and the arguments 10 and 5

21
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.700
 will be stored in parameters a and 

22
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.910
b then a+b is calculated and stored in 

23
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.890
another integer variable result. so there is 15 in result now

24
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.860
Next we have return result 

25
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.440
So this value will be returned to the calling function 

26
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.480
main and function 

27
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.300
Execution is terminated and control comes to main and 15 

28
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.420
is assigned to Variable ans

29
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.990
Next we have a printf statement which will print 10 +5

30
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.960
equal to value in variable ans which is 15 

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.600
and return zero Now What will happen if there are any 

32
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.100
statements below the return statement If the programme execution reaches 

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.339
the return statement the statements below that will not get 

34
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.020
executed 

35
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.480
So this statement here will not be executed 

36
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.470
So that's all thank you watching this video.
