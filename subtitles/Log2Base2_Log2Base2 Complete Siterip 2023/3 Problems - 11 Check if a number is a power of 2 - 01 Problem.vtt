00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.350
you will being given a positive integer as the input 

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.960
and your task is to check whether the given number 

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.950
is the power of two or not 

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.120
For example if given number is eight the expected output 

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.950
is true because two rise to 3 is eight 

6
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.420
If given number is 32 

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.860
The expected output is true as 32 can be 

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.530
represented as two rise to five if given number cannot 

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.750
be represented as a power of two return false.
