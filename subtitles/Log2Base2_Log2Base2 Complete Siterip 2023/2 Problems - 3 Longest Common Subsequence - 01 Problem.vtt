1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.870
given to sequences find the length of the longest common 

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.150
subsequent present in both of them 

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.780
But before going to the problem let us understand of 

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.180
what is subsequence as sub sequences a sequence that 

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.650
appears in the same relative order 

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.650
It need not necessarily be continuous 

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.160
For example let us take two sequences A B C 

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.780
D 

9
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.490
E and A D E is ADE sub sequence of A  B 

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.070
C D A appears as the first character 

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.000
That is okay 

12
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.350
Next D appears as the fourth character 

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.340
That is also okay because both a d 

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.950
are in relative order 

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.220
Next character E appears as the fifth character 

16
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.820
So all three characters A D and E appears and 

17
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.560
relative order to the sequence a B C D 

18
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.080
So ADE is a subsequent of ABCD 

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.330
similarly a C E A 

20
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.460
B C E are examples of subsequent of A B 

21
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.500
C D 

22
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.450
As their character follows the relative order 

23
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.350
Will ADB Subsequent  of A B C D E

24
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.780
Here A appears first that's okay 

25
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.830
Next D appears as the fourth character so far that's okay

26
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.660
next character B appears as the second character that 

27
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.420
is character B actually appears before D but here ADB

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.350
is not following the relative order So it is 

29
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.290
not a subsequent of A B 

30
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.570
C 

31
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.250
D E

32
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.960
So in subsequent 

33
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.070
The characters should appear in relative order and it need 

34
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.350
not be continuous 

35
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.190
But it cannot appear in a random order like the 

36
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.040
example 

37
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.880
ADB Let us compact our problem given two sequences 

38
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.450
Find the length of the longest comment subsequent present

39
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.250
both of them 

40
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.230
For example let us take two sequences B A C 

41
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.820
D B and B D C B 

42
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.240
Here what are all the common Subsequent  length 

43
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.730
two subsequent are B D B C B B 

44
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.370
D B and C B length three subsequent are 

45
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.450
B D B and B c B 

46
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.270
Here both B D B and B C B is 

47
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.170
the longest subsequent and their length is three 

48
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.570
So this is our problem statement given two sequences we 

49
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.530
need to find and returned the length of the longest 

50
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.150
comment subsequent present both of them we will learn 

51
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.570
how to solve the longest commerce subsequent problem in the next video.
