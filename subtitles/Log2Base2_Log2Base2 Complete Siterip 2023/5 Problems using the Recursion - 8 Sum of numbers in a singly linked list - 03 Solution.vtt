00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.890
so let us

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.960
write our recursive function nodesSum which takes the 

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.240
head of list as parameter and it returns 

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.810
And integer which will be the sum of elements of 

5
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.450
the list 

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.010
First we need to check if this node is null 

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.750
or not 

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.000
If it is not 

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.030
null we need to call this function again with the 

10
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.170
next node and add current nodes data to result of 

11
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.950
that recursive call so write if head not equal to null 

12
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.240
return head data plus 

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.630
 

14
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.480
node sum of head next 

15
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.470
And if head node is null then that's our base case 

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.040
So we need to stop the recursion so we 

17
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.160
can return zero 

18
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.000
So write return zero and that's it 

19
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.340
We have implemented the recursive logic to find the Sum 

20
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.650
of Elements of a singly linked list.
