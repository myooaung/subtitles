00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.840
hi friends 

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.930
In this video we are going to learn about the 

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.250
graph data structures 

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
So simply saying a graph is a collection of vertices 

5
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.930
and edges 

6
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.670
So this is an example for a graph and the 

7
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.850
vertices are also called as nodes 

8
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.080
And here we have five 

9
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.000
vertices 0123 and four and these vertices are connected 

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.880
by the edges and an edge is represented by a 

11
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.970
pair of vertices 

12
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.200
So if you see 01 it means the recent edge 

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.760
between zero and one 

14
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.610
So a graph can be represented like this G of 

15
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.200
E V where E and V stands for edges and vertices 

16
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.420
respectively 

17
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.860
A graph is not possible without vertices so we cannot 

18
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.380
have an empty set for V 

19
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.930
And for E it is possible that we don't have 

20
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.070
an edge in a graph 

21
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.620
So an empty set for E is a lot for 

22
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.210
a graph and we have two types of graph 

23
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.720
first one is undirected graph So as the names such 

24
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.190
as we have undirected edges here now say this 

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.220
edge between zero and one 

26
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.680
Since there is no direction we can say this edges 

27
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.700
from 0 to 1 and it may also be defined 

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550
as an edge from 1 to 0 

29
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.210
So for such graphs we always take double the number 

30
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.960
of the edges 

31
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.630
So here the number of edges is equal to two 

32
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.560
and the edges are 01 and 10 

33
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.940
Now say another undirected graph 

34
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.440
The vertices in this graph are 0123 and four and 

35
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.650
the number of edges is not seven but 14 and 

36
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.530
the edges are 0102 and zero three from zero 

37
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.960
And from one we have 1013 and one four and 

38
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.090
2023 from two and from three we have 303132 and 

39
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.230
three four and finally from four we have four one 

40
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.150
and four three 

41
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.350
So that is an undirected graph now let us see the 

42
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410
next type of graph which are the directive 

43
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.050
graphs and obviously the direction of every edge will be 

44
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.280
specified in the graph 

45
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.380
So see this vertices zero and one and there is an 

46
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.630
edge between them and this directed from 0 to 1 

47
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.790
so it is always from 0 to 1 it is indicated 

48
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.450
by 01 

49
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.520
Now see this example of it directed graph and the 

50
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.340
vertices in this graph are 0123 and four and the 

51
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.480
number of edges is 7 

52
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.800
And the edges are 0102 and 03 from zero 

53
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.070
And from one we have edges towards three and four 

54
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.240
So we have 13 and one four and from two 

55
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.970
We have an edge towards three 

56
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.900
So it is 23 and from three we have an 

57
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.960
edge towards four 

58
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.710
So it is three four and finally we have No 

59
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.130
edge coming from four 

60
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.410
So that would be all 

61
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.310
Next will discuss about the degree of a graph and 

62
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.090
there will be two types of degree for each node 

63
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.860
in a graph 

64
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.020
The in degree and the out degree first let us see

65
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.300
the in degree of a vertex and it is the 

66
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.650
number of edges that are coming into that vertex 

67
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.550
So take vertex zero here and there are no

68
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.250
edges that are coming into it 

69
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.920
So in degree equal to zero now take vertex one 

70
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.150
We have an edge from 0 to 1 

71
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.170
So in degree equal to one 

72
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.990
Now take vertex two and there is an edge from 0 to 2 

73
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.810
So in degree equal to one 

74
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.010
Now take vertex three and the we have three 

75
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.770
edges coming into it which are from 01 and two 

76
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.080
So in degree of vertex three equal to three 

77
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.620
And finally we have vertex four and we have 

78
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.490
two edges to vertex four from one and three 

79
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.750
So in degree equal to two 

80
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.740
Now let us discuss about out degree and it is 

81
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.180
the number of edges that are coming out of a 

82
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.750
vertex and take vertex zero here 

83
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.490
And we have three edges coming out of zero 

84
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.760
So it's out degree 

85
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.670
equal to three and take vertex one here and we 

86
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.760
have two edges coming out of it 

87
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.080
So out degree equal to two and take vertex two 

88
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.440
we have one edge from two so out degree of vertex 

89
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.650
two equal to one 

90
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.080
And next we have vertex three and we have 

91
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.260
just one edge from 3 to 4 

92
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.780
So out 

93
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.010
degree equal to one 

94
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.870
And finally we have vertex four and we have 

95
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.110
No edges coming out of vertex four 

96
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.660
So out degree of vertex four equal to zero 

97
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.570
So that is the concept of in degree and out 

98
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.300
degree of Vertex in the graph. Thank you.
