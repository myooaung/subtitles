1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.970
You will be given a sorted array of n integers and 

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.050
a target value.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.290
Your task is to check

4
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.310
If any pair of elements exist such that their sum 

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.450
is equal to the given target.

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.690
For example, let us take a sorted array of five integers 

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.960
1 5 10 20 80 and the target sum is 90 here 

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.140
we need to check

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.780
If there is any pair in this array which gives 

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
the target value as the sum here 10 + 80 

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650
will give the target value 90. 

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.750
So in this case, we need to return 1.

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.580
Suppose if we take the target value as 40,

14
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.410
there is no pair in this array that will give the 

15
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.870
target sum 40. 

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.950
So in this case, we need to return 0.
