1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.350
you will be given a positive integer as input 

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.650
Your task is to check whether the given number has 

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.200
an alternate bit pattern in its binary representation or 

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.290
not Here 

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.910
Alternate pattern means that zeros and ones in number occur 

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.250
in alternate order 

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.090
For example if the given number is ten we have an 

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.170
alternate bit pattern in its binary representation 

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.550
That is 1010 

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.550
In this case we should return one 

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.690
If the given Number is 7 there is no alternate bit 

12
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.350
pattern in it so we need to return zero.
