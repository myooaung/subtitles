00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.260
The problem statement is

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.810
you will be given a linked list and you need 

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.350
to find nth node from it 

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.950
So a linked list and a value n will be 

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.710
given and you need to find and print the 

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.650
nth node of that linked list 

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.970
So here if the given index is two, the node at 

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.230
index two which is 30 at address 3024 should be 

9
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.850
returned.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.900
And if the given index is four, which is out of 

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.250
size, so return -1

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.430
So your task is to write the logic for getting nth 

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.900
node from a linked list and submit it using the below 

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.540
compiler.

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.860
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs. If the given 

16
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.950
input linked list is 10 20 30 40 and given index is one

17
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.050
then the expected output is 20.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.600
And if the given linked list is 10 20 30 40 

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.440
and given index is three, then expected output is the value 40.
