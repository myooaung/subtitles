Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.540
In this video we are going to learn about the switch statement

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.030
So the switch statement is a multi way branch statement and 

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.520
it can be used as an alternative for a long 

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.759
if else statement here we check the value of a 

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.600
variable and corresponding case will get executed 

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.230
Now see the syntax for the switch statement 

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
So here choice is the variable and we can define cases 

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.919
inside like this 

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.800
And this variable here must be an integer type 

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.970
or character type 

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.130
Other data types like float or string are not allowed 

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.520
Now let us see how the switch statement works 

14
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.000
It will check the cases one by one from the 

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.430
top 

16
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.489
And if any case matches the particular block will get 

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.260
executed. 

18
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.500
So here if choice equal to 1 then case1 

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.660
will get executed 

20
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.430
And if none of them match then the default case 

21
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.480
will get executed here 

22
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.150
If choice is not equal to one then we check

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.070
If it is equal to 2 and if it is 

24
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.030
not equal to 2 also then the default case will 

25
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.890
get executed. 

26
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.190
Now let us see an example programme which implements 

27
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.260
a simple calculator using switch case statement. So first we 

28
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.780
are declaring 3 integer variables num1, num2 and 

29
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.360
choice. 

30
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.480
Then we are asking the user to enter the numbers 

31
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.650
or the operands

32
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.949
So let the numbers entered by the user be 

33
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.920
10 and 20 and it is stored to num1

34
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.790
and num2 respectively 

35
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.240
Now we print a menu and ask the user to 

36
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.229
enter a choice 

37
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.699
So if the user press 1 we need to 

38
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420
perform Addition. If the user press 2 we need to 

39
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.649
perform subtraction. 

40
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.790
If the user press 3, we need to perform multiplication 

41
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.259
And if the user press 4, we need to perform 

42
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.670
division and suppose user enters 3 and it is stored to 

43
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.910
variable choice 

44
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.580
Now the switch statement will work and the variable choice 

45
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.790
will be compared with each case value case one is 

46
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.600
not matched

47
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.520
So which case2  it is also not matching 

48
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.530
So we go on and check case3 Now we have 

49
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.960
a match so the statements in case 3 will get 

50
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.580
executed. So 10 x 20 will be calculated and 

51
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.080
printed.

52
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.930
Next we have a break so it will terminate the

53
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.820
switch statement 

54
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.350
Now suppose user entered 7 and it is stored in choice 

55
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.810
So when switch get executed case1 is not matching 

56
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.380
case2 

57
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.019
is not matching case3 

58
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.700
is also not matching and even case4 is not a 

59
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.280
match 

60
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.299
So the default case will get executed and it will 

61
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.150
print "Enter a valid choice" 

62
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.920
So if there is no match, the default case will 

63
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.950
be executed. 

64
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.780
Now let us discuss about the need for break in 

65
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.660
switch statement 

66
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.840
Let us take the same programme without break statements 

67
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.530
So suppose user enters 2 as the choice So when 

68
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.549
switch gets executed first it will check case one there is 

69
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.380
No match 

70
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.700
So it will check case 2 which is matching 

71
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.220
So the statements in case 2 will get executed so 

72
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.220
num2 is subtracted from num1 and the difference 

73
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.050
will be printed And along with that all the following 

74
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.750
cases will also get executed.

75
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.900
So the break statement is used to terminate the switch 

76
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.859
case execution 

77
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.450
If we don't use break statement and if a case 

78
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.460
matches then the statements following that case will execute until 

79
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.990
a break statement is reached 

80
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.270
This is also called fall through in the switch case 

81
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.740
Now let us discuss some benefits of the fall through 

82
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.260
feature 

83
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.250
Let's take the classic example 

84
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.940
You must be familiar with this question are issue you 

85
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.970
want to delete then press

86
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.240
'y' or 'Y' or 'n' or 'N'

87
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.460
here we need to execute the same piece of code for 

88
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.950
y and Y

89
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.340
and so for n and N

90
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.810
We can achieve this by using the fall through feature 

91
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.650
here 

92
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.869
If the user enter 'y' or 'Y' the 

93
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.740
same piece of code will be executed and if the 

94
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.170
user enters 'n' or 'N' this 

95
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.080
piece of code will be executed. 

96
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.119
And if user enters any other input, then the default 

97
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.550
case will be executed.

98
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.230
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
