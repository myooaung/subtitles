00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.570
we already know that using heap data structure we 

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.380
can track the largest elements 

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.460
The idea is very simple 

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.710
First built the Max heap and get the top K 

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.050
elements by applying heapify process K times 

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.330
For example let's take this array and K is equal 

7
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.750
to three 

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.750
First we need to build the Max heap 

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.050
After the build heap process the Element 80 will be 

10
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.580
present at the top of the heap After the first step 

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.480
is over we need to extract the top three elements 

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.250
from the heap 

13
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.100
For that we can write the logic something like this 

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.550
First take 80 out as it is the top element 

15
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.250
present in the heap and apply heapify process again 

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.090
Now the node 60 will be present at top as 

17
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.580
60 

18
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.320
is the second largest element 

19
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
We can take 60 out and apply the heapify 

20
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.400
process again 

21
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.700
If we do the same process for K times we 

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.960
will get the top K elements from the given array here

23
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.150
We already have extracted top two elements 

24
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.760
We need to get one more element so just apply 

25
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.450
the heapify process again 

26
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.740
Now the node 50 will be present at the top so 

27
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.860
just take it out and that's it 

28
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.530
We have extracted top three elements from the given array so 

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.050
you can apply this logic and solve the problem.
