Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.100
In this video we are going to have 

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
an introduction to C programming 

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.100
So C is a general purpose 

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.290
Programming language 

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.960
And it was invented by Dennis Ritchie 

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.160
And he actually invented C programming language to develop the 

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.630
Unix operating system 

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.150
And now it is one of the most widely used 

9
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.420
programming language and C is sometimes called system programming language 

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.800
because it is very useful for writing system programmes like 

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.430
device drivers, compiler, linker, assembler et cetera 

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.430
And also it is a portable programming language because we 

13
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.220
can write a C programme in one machine and it 

14
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.640
can run in any other machine which support C without 

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.769
modifying the code

16
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.920
So it is not tied to any hardware or system 

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.930
so it can be called as a hardware independent language 

18
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.770
or platform independent language 

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.380
And there are many modern languages which are derived from 

20
00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.840
C

21
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.680
Some examples are C++

22
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.580
Java, php, Javascript, Python, perl et cetera 

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.900
So all these are C family languages and for all 

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.970
these languages C is the foundation 

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310
So if we master in C it will be very 

26
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.710
easy to learn these languages so that's all and thank you for watching this video.
