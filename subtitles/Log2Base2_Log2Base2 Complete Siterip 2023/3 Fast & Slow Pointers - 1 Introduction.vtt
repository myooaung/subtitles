00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.020
The fast and slow pointers approach is an effective technique 

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.460
when the problem involves a cyclic linked list or 

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.240
cyclic array.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.230
The fundamental idea of this approach is when two pointers 

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.240
move through a cyclic

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.530
path at different speeds 

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.840
at some point in time, those two pointers will meet 

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.190
somewhere in the loop. 

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.090
That means the fast pointer will meet the slow pointer

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.220
when both the pointers are moving inside the loop 

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.870
Using this approach, we can solve some of the famous 

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.150
problems like detecting the loop in a linked list 

13
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.380
check whether a number is a happy number or not etc.
