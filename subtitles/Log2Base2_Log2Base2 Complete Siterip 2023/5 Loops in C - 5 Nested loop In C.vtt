Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.970
In this video we are going to discuss about nested loops in C.

2
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.930
So the C programming language 

3
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.810
allows us to create nested loops.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.540
Or we can say a loop inside another loop like 

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.029
this 

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.100
Now this is the syntax for nested while loop. 

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.740
And this is the syntax for nested do while loop

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.250
And this is this the syntax for nested for loop

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.110
Now let us see an example 

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.510
We have a pattern here with five stars in

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.310
five rows and five columns 

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.379
Now the task for us is to print this pattern 

13
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.379
on the screen 

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.640
So what we can do is we can use nested

15
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.050
loop. so we can use 2 for loops. the inner

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.470
loop will print Five stars like this and the outer loop will 

17
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.650
execute the  inner loop 5 times 

18
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.260
So let's see how to write this in C

19
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.420
So we have the main function and two integer variables 

20
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.990
i and j

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.240
are

22
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.470
Declared. And we have the outer for loop 

23
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.730
for(i=1;iless than =5;i++)

24
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.710
so it will be executing for five 

25
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.430
times 

26
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.580
And then we have the inner loop

27
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.810
for(j=1;jless than =5;j++)

28
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 which will also execute five times and 

29
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.649
each times it will print a star 

30
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
So first i=1 and iless than 5

31
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.830
So we go inside and we have j=1

32
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 

33
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.630
And j is also less than 5  so it will 

34
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.720
go inside and print a star 

35
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.280
And then j will be incremented and it will 

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.390
become 2 

37
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Now we have j=2 and jless than 5 

38
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.720


39
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.610
So it will go inside again and print another 

40
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.950
star and j will be incremented and it will 

41
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.750
become 3

42
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.320
So now j=3 and jless than 5 

43
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.630


44
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.490
So again the condition is true 

45
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.220
So it will print a star and then j will 

46
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.810
be incremented and it will become 4 now 

47
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.979
Now we have j=4 and jless than 5

48
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.520


49
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.929
So the condition is true 

50
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.510
So it will go inside and print a star 

51
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.740
And then j will get incremented and it will become 

52
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.240
5 

53
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.920
Now we go for the next iteration and we have 

54
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.650
j=5 and j=5

55
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.290
So condition is still true 

56
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.500
So it prints a star and then j will be incremented

57
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.859
and it becomes 6 

58
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.040
Now when it checks the condition whether jless than =5 

59
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.359
it is not satisfied 

60
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.570
So the control comes out of the for loop and prints 

61
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.750
a new line character 

62
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.360
And now it will increment i

63
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430
 and i will become 2 now 

64
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.880
So the first iteration of the outer loop is completed 

65
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.530
and what we got is a row of five stars 

66
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.510
Now i=2 and iless than 5

67
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.859
So the condition is true 

68
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.340
So it goes for the second iteration and in a 

69
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.400
similar way it prints another row of 5 stars

70
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.630
And it will print a new line character and it 

71
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.410
will increment i now 

72
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.670
i=3 and again condition holds so inner

73
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.260
loop will work and print a row of stars and go to 

74
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.730
next line and increment i 

75
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.540
So now i=4  and condition is still true 

76
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.220
So the inner loop will work and print forth row

77
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.440
of stars and go to next line and it will 

78
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.480
increment i Now i has become five and again condition

79
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.270
holds since i=5

80
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.830
So inner loop will work and it will print the 

81
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.750
next row of stars and go to next line and 

82
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.260
increment i 

83
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.840
And now i becomes six 

84
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.920
Now the condition fails and comes out of the loop 

85
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.220
and return zero 

86
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.589
So the inner loop will print a row five 

87
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.640
stars in each iteration of outer loop and it will 

88
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.220
have five iterations so five rows of five stars will 

89
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.850
be printed as the output 

90
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.530
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
