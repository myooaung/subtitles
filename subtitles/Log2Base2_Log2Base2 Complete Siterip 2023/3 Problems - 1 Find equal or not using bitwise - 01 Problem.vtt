00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.320
The problem statement is you will be given two numbers 

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.230
as input and you need to check whether these numbers 

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.710
are the same or not using bitwise operators 

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.180
For example, if you get input numbers as two and two

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.350
then these numbers are equal.

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.340
And if the input numbers are five and two, 

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.000
then these numbers are unequal.

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.420
So your task is to write the logic for 

9
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.070
"Equal or not problem" and submit it using the below compiler 

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.070
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.080
If the inputs are two and two, the expected output 

12
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.150
is equal.

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.800
If the inputs are four and three the expected output 

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.850
is unequal.
