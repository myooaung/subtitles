00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.600
So how to print the reverse of a linked list?

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.320
We can start from the head node, move to the 

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.290
next node do recursively till we reach the end 

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.530
of the linked list and then we can come back 

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.750
by printing each node's data.
