00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.570
If we know the loop length, we can easily find 

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.650
the starting point of the loop using this approach 

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.080
So first declare two pointers ptr1 and ptr2 

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.750
 initialise both ptr1 and ptr2 to 

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750
point the head of the linked list 

6
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.250
Now find length of the loop 

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.450
That logic is discussed in the previous video 

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.150
So here the loop length is four.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.350
Now move ptr2 to 4 positions ahead 

10
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.670
After that keep incrementing ptr1 and ptr2 until 

11
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.450
they meet. 

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.770
Since ptr2 is four steps ahead, when both ptr1

13
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.540
 and ptr2 meet, ptr2 must have 

14
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.150
completed one loop. 

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740
So the meeting point will be the starting point of 

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.250
the loop. 

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.530
So using this logic you can find the starting point 

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.950
of linked list loop
