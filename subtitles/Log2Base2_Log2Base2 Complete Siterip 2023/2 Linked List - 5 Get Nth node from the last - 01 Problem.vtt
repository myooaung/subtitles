00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.370
The problem statement is you will be given a linked list

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.900
 and you need to get the nth node from 

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.050
the end of this linked list. 

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.220
For example if this is the given linked list and 

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.640
if n is equal to one, then the node 30 

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.720
should be returned as it is the first node from 

7
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.350
the end of the linked list. 

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.520
And if N is equal to a three then the 

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.880
node 10 should be returned as it is the third 

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.050
node from the end. 

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780
So your task is to write the logic for this 

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.250
get nth node from end of the linked list problem 

13
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.960
and submit it using the below compiler. See some sample 

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.970
inputs and corresponding outputs.

15
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.170
If the input linked list is 10 20 30 and  

16
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.050
n is equal to one, then the expected output is 30.

17
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.880
And if the input linked list is 10 20 30 and n equal to three, the the expected output is 10.
