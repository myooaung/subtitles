1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.170
You will be given an array of numbers 

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.870
where each number appears twice except one number. 

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.350
Your task is to find that one odd occurring number 

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.430
For example, let us take an array of five numbers 

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.130
3 4 5 4 3

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.460
Here the number three appears twice and the number four 

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.580
appears twice. 

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.510
Number five appears only once. So in this case, 

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540
the odd occurring number is five.
