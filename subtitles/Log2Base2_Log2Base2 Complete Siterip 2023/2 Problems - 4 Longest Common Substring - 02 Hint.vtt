00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.140
let us write two strings in a row column vice 

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.650
manner as we did in the longest common subsequence problem 

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.690
in the longest common subsequence problem 

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.300
If two characters are equal we will take the previous 

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.810
longest result array of I minus one J minus one 

6
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.310
and add one to it 

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.710
If they are not equal we will carry the maximum 

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.640
result for further calculation 

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.770
Because an LCS the characters can appear in relative order 

10
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.160
that is the common sequence may appear anywhere in the string but 

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.070
in the case of a common sub string the characters 

12
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.040
should appear in continuous order 

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.840
So as long as the characters are equal we will 

14
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.910
increment value 

15
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.470
Otherwise there is no need to carry the maximum result 

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.250
throughout the problem like we did in LCS 

17
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.370
So let's see how to solve this problem here 

18
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.480
We can keep a variable to track the maximum sub 

19
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.290
string length and whenever we find a new maximum length 

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.450
we can update it 

21
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.350
So first add zeros and first row and first column 

22
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.790
Next we have D and A which are not equal 

23
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.400
so add zero next is B and B which are 

24
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.510
also not the same 

25
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.400
So add zero here next 

26
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.000
D X not same D Y not same d a

27
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.050
not same d B and D 

28
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.670
C are also not the same 

29
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.870
So add the 00 now go to the second row 

30
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780
We have A and A which are the same 

31
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.930
When two characters are equal we need to add one 

32
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.420
to the previously found longest common sub strings length which 

33
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.190
we can find at array of i minus one J 

34
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.850
minus one 

35
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.230
So add one to the value present there and store 

36
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.860
it here 

37
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.550
So we will get zero plus one which is one 

38
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.290
And since this is a new maximum we need to 

39
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.850
update the result variable 

40
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.230
So result equal to one 

41
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.550
Now 

42
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.370
Next we have a B A x A y which are 

43
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.130
not equal 

44
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.920
So add zero next is A A which are equal so 

45
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.250
increment the value and we will get one 

46
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.160
Next we have AB and AC which are not equal So 

47
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.580
add zeros in the third row b a are 

48
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.600
Not the same 

49
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.770
Next b b are same so increment value and we 

50
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.120
will get two since this is a new maximum we need 

51
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.660
to update result variable then b x b y b 

52
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.920
a are not the same 

53
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.410
But next b B are equal 

54
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.420
So increment the value and we will get two next 

55
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.790
B C are not equal 

56
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.760
So add zero now in fourth row only Last column 

57
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.160
has the same character 

58
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.370
So increment the value here and we will get two 

59
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.550
plus 1 3 

60
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.430
And this is a new maximum 

61
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.620
So update result now add zeros in remaining columns now 

62
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.930
in fifth row every pair of characters are different 

63
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.130
So add zeros there

64
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.270
Now this value in result three is the length of 

65
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.750
longest comment sub string here that is of ABC.
