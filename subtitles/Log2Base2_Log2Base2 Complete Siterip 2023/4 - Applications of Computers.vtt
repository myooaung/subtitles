00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.370
Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.649
In this video let us discuss about applications of computers. 

3
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.400
So computers have revolutionised many industries 

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820
and changed the world in many ways. 

5
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.270
Let us understand the major applications of computers. 

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.530
So computers are widely used in scientific research. 

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.950
In early days, the scientific research was handled by humans

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.290
 which may not provide 100% accuracy rate 

9
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.390
And some research may lead to danger to human beings 

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.380
such as in nuclear research, deep sea investigation etc

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.180
But today all those research are handled by computers 

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.700
and computers can promise no error or much fewer errors.

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.900
Also it can handle very vast amount of data  

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.730
and it can be processed very fast.  

15
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.340
So humans can invest their time in other areas of research.

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.450
Now another very important application of computers  

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.350
is in area of medicine 

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.560
Computers are used increasingly in this area.

19
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.020
It can help in diagnosing diseases. 

20
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.170
Patient medical history and records can be saved forever

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.510
which is very helpful in treatment 

22
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.730
And it was very difficult in early days.  

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.510
Keeping information of every person in physical documents.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.940
Also hospitals have patient monitoring systems now 

25
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.850
and computer applications are used in devices like hearing aid and so on

26
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.100
Computer intelligence is even used in surgical procedures  

27
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.030
like we have Computer Assisted Surgery now

28
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.900
Another area is in business applications 

29
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.890
Computers are able to store large amounts of data  

30
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.910
which is a very convenient, cost effective and timesaving method. 

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.670
It is also used for marketing, for communication, for research, 

32
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.680
for employee and team management, for accounting,

33
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.500
And the list goes on.

34
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.270
The applications of computers can be seen from a very small business 

35
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.090
to very large scale business 

36
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.990
Now another important application of computers is in banking 

37
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.090
Earlier were the days we had to go to the bank 

38
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.030
the exact same branch where we have an account  

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.150
and get the services.

40
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.310
Everything was physical. 

41
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.240
We had to spend a lot of time to get even a small service 


42
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.540
But what is scenario now?  

43
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.260
we can get most of the services in just some clicks.

44
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.220
Electronic transactions, online banking, account management,ATM etc.


45
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.960
Things are now easier not only for customers  

46
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.220
but also for the bank personnels. 

47
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.620
Now can you imagine a bank without computers?  

48
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.050
It is very hard. 

49
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.940
With computers, the accuracy is improved. 

50
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.120
There are no chances of errors. 

51
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.440
Time and Cost - everything is improved 

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.360
Now another area of computer application is in education 

53
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.250
See how easy things are now. 

54
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.740
We can find almost everything on the Internet. 

55
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.870
with computers and Internet, we can get study materials,

56
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.580
watch tutorials, clear any doubt etc.

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.110
It is easier to refer to the Internet 

58
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.840
than searching for information in these big reference books 

59
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.720
It is easy to maintain soft copies of notes

60
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.740
than hand written notes. 

61
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.010
The applications are endless.

62
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.850
Now another area of computer application is engineering. 

63
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.270
This is something I think need no explanations. 

64
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.490
We cannot imagine the engineering field without computers 

65
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:43.570
We need computers to design, to test, to make changes in design,

66
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.620
to implement and to maintain.

67
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.830
We can find potential errors 

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.660
and solve them before the product is actually built.

69
00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:53.750
It is cost effective, time saving and so on 

70
00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:57.870
Now another area of computer application is in communication 

71
00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:03.100
We have the Internet, voice and video chatting, social networking.

72
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.780
We can access information and a lot more.

73
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.910
Even this communication between you and me 

74
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:11.180
is not possible without computers 

75
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.090
So what we should understand from this is, 

76
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.300
computers are used in almost every field  

77
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.420
and in this century computer is like oxygen for us 

78
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.340
We cannot live without it 

79
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.890
We are some how dependant on computers and its applications.
