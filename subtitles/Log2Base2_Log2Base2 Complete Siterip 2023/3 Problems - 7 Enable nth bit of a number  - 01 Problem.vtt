00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.870
The problem statement is you will be given a positive 

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.320
number and a value n and you have to enable 

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.950
the nth bit of it.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.680
For example if the given number is 64, and this is 

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.350
it's binary representation 

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.910
And if we have n equal to five, we need 

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.900
to enable fifth bit of 64. 

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.590
So it should be set to one and resultant

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.450
binary representation will correspond to the decimal 80 

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.830
And if we have n equal to eight, we need 

11
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.640
to enable the eight bit and the resultant binary 

12
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.350
representation will correspond to the number 192 

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.470
So your task is to write the logic for this 

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.530
"Enable nth bit problem" and submit it using the below 

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.870
compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

16
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.930
If the input is 64 and 5 the expected output is 80

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.350
If the input is 64 and 8, the expected output is 192
