Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.350
In this video we will discuss why the Greedy algorithms 

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.500
may not always provide the optimal results 

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.650
Let us understand this with the minimum coin exchange problem 

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.290
let us assume we need to give coins for a 

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.450
piece 40 and we have coins of rupees 25 20 

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.350
10 and five 

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.610
What will be the greedy solution for minimum number of 

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.410
coins here It will start taking coins from the highest 

10
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.240
value and 25 is lesser than 40 

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160
So it will take 1 25 

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.380
rupees coin and increment 

13
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.250
The coin count 

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.150
The coin count becomes one 

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.000
Now the balance amount will be 40 minus 25 which 

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.350
is 15 and 25 is greater than 15 

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.150
So we cannot take another ₹25 coin 

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.960
So move to the next coin which is 20 here 

19
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.150
20 is 	greater than 15 

20
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.250
So we cannot include coin 20 in our solution 

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.460
So move on to 

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.370
The next coin which is 10 and 10 is lesser 

23
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.450
than 15 

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.840
So take 1 ₹10 coin and increment count the coin 

25
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.360
count becomes two now 

26
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.610
Now reduce 10 from the current balance 

27
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.480
So the new balance will be 15 minus 10 which 

28
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.150
is five 

29
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.240
And since 10 is greater than five we cannot take 

30
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.590
another ₹10 coin so move onto the next coin 

31
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.390
which is five and our expected 

32
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.020
Value is also five so take five and increment the 

33
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.950
coin count 

34
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.450
The coin count becomes three 

35
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.960
Now we have found the solution which is 1 ₹25 

36
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.980
coin and 1 ₹10 coin and one five rupee 

37
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.470
coin 

38
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.320
So the minimum number of coins needed to the amount 

39
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.650
40 is three 

40
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.350
But do you think this is the best solution for 

41
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.850
this problem Absolutely not 

42
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.760
Only 2 ₹20 coins are enough to satisfy the actual 

43
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.170
value 

44
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.850
40 

45
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.480
So the minimum number of coins needed to the amount 

46
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.160
40 is two which is 2 ₹20 coins 

47
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.340
But the greedy approach solution is three coins 

48
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.740
So from this problem we can understand that the greedy 

49
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.450
algorithm cannot produce the overall optimal result 

50
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.180
Always 

51
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.860
So before applying the greedy algorithm we should analyse the 

52
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.160
algorithm for all possible input cases 

53
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.990
If it does not provide the correct result for any 

54
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.810
particular case we should choose another approach to solve the 

55
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.610
problem 

56
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.340
So that's all for this video 

57
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.620
And in the next video we will learn the implementation of minimum coin exchange problem.
