Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.199
In this video we are going to discuss about decision making in C.

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.730
So we have decision making statements in C 

3
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.760
And why do you think we need these kind of 

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.080
statements? It is because while programming, we often need to 

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.830
make a lot of decisions. In some cases we need 

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.360
to execute this block of code and in some other 

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.750
cases we need to execute this block of code. 

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.420
So using decision making statements, we can decide the programme 

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.560
execution order based on the given conditions. 

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.879
For an example consider this programme if the number is odd

11
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.510
we want to execute this block 

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.010
Otherwise we want to execute this block and we have different 

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.780
types of decision making statements in C like if, 

14
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.519
if else, nested if else ,switch etc. And we will 

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.370
be discussing each of them in the coming lessons So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
