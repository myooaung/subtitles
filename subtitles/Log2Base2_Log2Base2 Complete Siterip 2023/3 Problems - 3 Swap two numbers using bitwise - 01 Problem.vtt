00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.390
The problem statement is you will be given two numbers 

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.950
and you have to swap them using bitwise operators 

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.950
So what is swapping? 

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.150
See if the given numbers are  a equal to two and 

5
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.540
b equal to four after swapping a's value will be 

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.190
in b and b's value will be in a. 

7
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.270
That is after swapping, a will be equal to four and 

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.750
b will be equal to two 

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.700
So your task is to write the logic for this 

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.530
"Swap two numbers problem" and submit it using the below compile 

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.350
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs.

12
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450
If the input is a equal to 20 and b equal to 10,

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.940
the expected output is a equal to 10 and 

14
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.050
b equal to 20.
