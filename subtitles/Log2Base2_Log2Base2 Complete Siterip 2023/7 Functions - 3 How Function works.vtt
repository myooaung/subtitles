Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.460
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.859
how a function works 

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.550
So let us Discuss the working of a function with an example programme 

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.740
So we have this programme here and we have a 

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.259
function called sum here 

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.130
But we know that execution begins from main function 

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.540
So here three integer variables a, b and result 

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.099
is created and a and b are initialised with values 

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.340
10 and 20 Now we have result=sum(a,b)

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.760
So we are calling the function some by passing 

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.270
A and B So when we call the function the 

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.360
data passed to that function is called the arguments here 

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.959
A and B are the arguments here 

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.460
If you see the main function is calling the sum 

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.990
function 

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.870
So it is called the calling function 

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.170
So the function which contains the actual function call is 

18
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.790
called the calling function 

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.790
Now the control will go to the function definition 

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.940
Here the values passed by the main function that is 

21
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.440
A and B that is 10 and 20 will be 

22
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.420
stored in X and Y these are called the parameters 

23
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.200
of the function 

24
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.929
So a parameter is a variable in the declaration of 

25
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.890
function. Here X and Y are the parameters and here 

26
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.090
main function called the function sum 

27
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.200
So it is known as the called function 

28
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.840
So the called function is the function which is being 

29
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.160
called here 

30
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.890
Sum is the called function 

31
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.780
When the main function calls the sum function the execution 

32
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.110
of main function will be stopped and the called function 

33
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.670
sum will be executed 

34
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.270
Now the sum function statement will get executed and x+y 

35
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.330
 is calculated and stored in variable ans. ans is returned 

36
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.280
to the calling function main and it will be stored 

37
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.020
in result 

38
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.820
Now the sum function's task is over now its main 

39
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.020
function's turn to start executing the remaining statements Hence printf 

40
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.460
statement will be executed and it will print result 

41
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.530
equal to 30 

42
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.660
This is how the function is called and executed 

43
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.810
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
