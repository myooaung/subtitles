00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
The problem statement is you will be given a string 

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.190
and you have to reverse every word in it 

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.730
For an example,

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.980
If the given string is "Programming is an art" 

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.430
the output should be every word reversed which will be like 

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.880
this.

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.720
So your task is to write the logic for this 

8
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.220
problem and submit it using the below compiler. See some sample inputs 

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.800
and corresponding outputs. 

10
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.890
If the input is programming is an art, the expected

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.950
output is this. If the input is "Welcome to Log2Base2" 

12
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.250
the expected output is this.
