1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.440
you will be given an unsigned individual as input 

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.860
Your task is to count the number of set bits 

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.750
present in it 

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.060
For example if the input is 15 it has four 

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.960
set bits 

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.650
So we need to return four 

7
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.480
If the input is ten it has two set bits so in this case we should return 2.
