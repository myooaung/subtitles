Hello everyone in this video let us learn about the 

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.650
top K elements pattern and solve problems using it 

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.350
So how can we identify the top K elements pattern 

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.720
If any problem that ask us to find the largest 

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.450
or smallest of frequent K elements among a given set 

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.640
of elements we can use top K element pattern 

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.350
to solve it 

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.480
What will be the best data structure to keep 

9
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.100
track of top K elements 

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.570
It is heap data structure because after the heapify 

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.390
process the largest or smallest element in the group 

12
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.550
will be present at the top of the heap 

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.840
So if we want to find top K elements from 

14
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.770
the given set of elements we can apply the same 

15
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.900
heapify process for K times and get the decide 

16
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.470
elements from the next videos 

17
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.970
Using this top K elements pattern 

18
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.950
Let us solve some of famous problems such as Top K Numbers, Kth Smallest Number, Top K Frequent Numbers etc.

19
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.700
K numbers Kate smallest number and top K frequent numbers 

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.050
etc
