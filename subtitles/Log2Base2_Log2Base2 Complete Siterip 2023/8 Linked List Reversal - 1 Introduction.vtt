1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.960
we have learned how to create a linked list and 

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.410
solve problems using it 

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.950
linked Lis Reversal is one of the famous interview problems 

4
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.310
The main thing about that problem is we will be 

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.480
asked to solve it in list 

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.490
That is we should not use additional memory to solve 

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.750
it 

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.620
In this pattern we will learn how to reverse the 

9
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.270
linked list without using additional memory 

10
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.610
After that we can apply the linked list reversal logic 

11
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.820
and solve famous problems such as reverse only specific sub 

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.740
list reverse every K node of a linked list etc.
