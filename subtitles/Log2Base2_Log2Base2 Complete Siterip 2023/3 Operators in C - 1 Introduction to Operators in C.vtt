Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.480
In this video we are going to discuss about operators in C

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.570
the operators are used to perform mathematical and 

4
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.450
logical calculations in a programme 

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.400
So when we talk about operators we definitely need to 

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.200
know about operands as well 

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700
So what is an operand? So if you have an 

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.430
expression A + B than the operands in this expression 

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.250
are A and B and the + here is the 

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.930
operator 

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.470
So basically you have an operator which performs an operation 

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.610
on the operands

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.850
Now let us discuss about the classification of operators 

14
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.060
So we have unary operators, binary operators and ternary

15
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.950
operators. The first is unary operator and we just 

16
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.760
need single operand for this operation to work 

17
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.559
Some examples are the increment operator and the decrement 

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.710
operator and see how it can be used ++a

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.990


20
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.050
So in this expression you have an operator ++

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.709
and an operand which is a

22
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.640
So a single operand is needed here 

23
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.850
Next we have binary operators and here we need  

24
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.800
2 operands. examples  are + - * % etcetera 

25
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.810
and a +b  is an example for that 

26
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.490
So you have 2 operands A and B and 

27
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.720
one operator which is + here. next is ternary operator 

28
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
and here to perform calculation you need three operands

29
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.710
And this is an example for that which is called 

30
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.600
the Conditional Operator in C and see this example 

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.220
a greater than b ? print a:print B; so it works 

32
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.910
Like if a greater than b then Print a else 

33
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.600
print b

34
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.550
So these are the three types of operators 

35
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.229
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
