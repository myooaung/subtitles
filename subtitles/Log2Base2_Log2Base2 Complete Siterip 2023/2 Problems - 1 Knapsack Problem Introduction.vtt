00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.230
the problem statement is we will be given a back 

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.870
that is a knapsack and its capacity 

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.980
And then there will be n number of objects with 

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.640
its weight and profit 

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.860
Now our task is to fill the knapsack with the 

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.250
given items such that the profit is maximum 

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.790
Here the knapsack capacity is 30 kilograms but available 

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.460
items weight will be 5 12 plus 20 plus 10 

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.050
which is equal to 47 kilogrammes 

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.460
So we need to pick the only 30 kilogrammes of 

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.450
items from the available items with maximum profit 

12
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.550
Since this problem requires maximum results from all feasible solutions 

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.340
this is in optimisation problem and we can solve it 

14
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.750
using the greedy method 

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.250
So how can be solved that using the greedy method 

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.380
shall we take items with the higher profit or 

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.650
Shall we take more items with smaller weight for example 

18
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.080
here the item C has the maximum profit that is 

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.020
140 but it's for 20 kg per kilogramme 

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.420
We will get 140 divided by 20 which is 

21
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.450
equal to seven 

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.920
But even though the item A has small profit it's 

23
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.820
per kg value will be higher than the item 

24
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.920
C that is if we picked the item A per 

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.820
kg we will get 50 divided by five that is ten 

26
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.050
But with item C we will get only seven 

27
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.910
So what we can do is we can calculate the 

28
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.830
per Kg profit that is profit divided by weight for 

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.620
each item and then we can sort the items based 

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.850
on profit versus weight ratio 

31
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.990
After that we can start picking the item one by 

32
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.450
one 

33
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.640
So first pick all items of A it will occupy 

34
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.710
five kilogrammes of the knapsack so the remaining capacity will 

35
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.750
be 25 

36
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.490
And for this we will get a profit of â‚¹50 

37
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.930
Next pick all items of be and it will occupy 

38
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.360
another 20 kg of the knapsack 

39
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.150
So the remaining capacity will be five kg 

40
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.570
For item B we will get a profit of rupees 

41
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.860
140

42
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.470


43
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.810
So the total profit will be 50 place 140 

44
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.610
that is 190 After this 

45
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.340
The remaining capacity of knapsack is five kilogrammes 

46
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.040
But the item C has 10 kg of items so 

47
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.540
we can take only five kg of item 

48
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.590
C For this we will get the profit 60 into

49
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.250
5 by 10

50
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.640
that is equal to 30 

51
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.110
That is we are taking only five kg from a 

52
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.940
total of 10 kg 

53
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.820
So we are multiplying the total profit of 60 with five 

54
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.000
by 10 now our knapsack is filled with 30

55
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.590
kilogramme of items and the total profit we will get 

56
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.170
from this will be 220 

57
00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.850
 

58
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.670
Here we have picked the fractional part of the last 

59
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.350
item to fill the knapsack 

60
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.650
Hence this method is called the fractional knapsack problem 

61
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.840
We have solve this fractional knapsack problem with a greedy 

62
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.590
solution 

63
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.750
Suppose if we say we cannot take the items in fractions 

64
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.720
either we can take the item fully or leave it 

65
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.980
That is as zero or one 

66
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.540
Will that problem be solveable using the same greedy 

67
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.750
approach Let us discuss it in the next video.
