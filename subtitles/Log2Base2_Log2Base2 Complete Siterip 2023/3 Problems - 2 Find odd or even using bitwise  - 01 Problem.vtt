00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.410
The problem statement is you will be given a number 

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.150
and you have to check if it is odd or even.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.650
using bitwise operators.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.410
So firstly let us see the binary equivalents of 

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:22.550
first few numbers. For 0, it is 0000. For 1, it is 0001. For two, it is 0010 

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.480
for three it is 0011, for 4 it is 0100. For five it 

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.370
is 0101. For six it is 0110. For seven it is 0111

8
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.740
For eight, it is 1000 and for nine it is 1001

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.540
Now if we observe, we can clearly see that 

10
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.860
for even numbers, 

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.910
The LSB or least significant bit is zero 

12
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.250
And for odd numbers the LSB is one 

13
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.430
So your task is to write the logic for 

14
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.680
this "Odd or even number problem" and submit it using the below 

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.750
compiler. See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

16
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.650
If the input is the number 10, the expected output 

17
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.680
is the message "Even".

18
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.840
If the input is five the expected output is "Odd".
