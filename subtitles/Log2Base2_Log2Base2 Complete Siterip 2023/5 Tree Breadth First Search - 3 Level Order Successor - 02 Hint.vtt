00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.410
We know how to do level 

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.230
Order traversal 

3
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.140
In this problem, we need to find the level order 

4
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.450
successor of the given node value 

5
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.410
So what we can do is, do the level order 

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.820
Traversal as usual using queue 

7
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.340
And when the current node value is equal to the 

8
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.630
given value, we can break out of level order traversal loop 

9
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.950


10
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.670
At this te

11
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.190
The current node will be popped out of stack  

12
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.780
and it's next node or level order 

13
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.820
Successor will be present in the queue as the front 

14
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.150
node

15
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.140
For example, if the given key is 40 when we 

16
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.940
break out of the loop, the node 40 will be 

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.080
popped out and the level order successor of 50 will 

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.050
be present at the front of the queue 

19
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.170
So after we break out of the loop, just return

20
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.320
the front node's data that will be level order successor 

21
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.350
of the given node 

22
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.530
If the data is null, we can return -1

23
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.640
So using this logic you can try to solve the problem.
