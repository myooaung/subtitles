Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.280
In this video we are going to learn how to 

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.920
print the value of a variable 

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.570
So we can use the printf function to print the value 

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.160
of a variable and to do that we need to 

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.600
specify two things in the printf function 

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.169
One is the format of the variable we need to 

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.240
specify corresponding format specifier and next is the name 

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.150
of the variable which we want to print 

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.450
Now let us see some basic format 

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.760
specifiers. For integers we have %d and

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.910
the syntax to print an

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.850
integer variable is printf ("%d",name of integer variable)

16
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.350
Next for float type we have %f and the 

17
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.900
syntax to print a float 

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.000
Variable is printf("%f",name of float variable)

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.180
 for double 

21
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.080
We have the format 

22
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.380
Specifier %lf 

23
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.340
and the syntax is printf("%lf",name of double variable)

25
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.050
Next 

26
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.140
For character data type we have %c and see and 

27
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.770
the syntax to print a character 

28
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.180
Variable is printf("%c",name of character variable)

31
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.780
Now we can use many format 

32
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.980
Specifiers  in the same printf function 

33
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.350
Let us see how. If printf function encounters any 

34
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.750
format 

35
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.979
Specifier for the first time it will take the first 

36
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.600
variable after the coma and print it so here for  

37
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.479
%d, First Variable var1 will be taken next time 

38
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.170
If it sees another format specifier it will take 

39
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.670
the second variable after the coma and print it

40
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.970
So for %c, var2 will be taken 

41
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.250
and this will continue 

42
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.650
So let us see this code here 

43
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.110
First 

44
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.479
We have the integer variable declaration for i and i is 

45
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.530
initialised to 10 

46
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.690
Next we will have character variable c created and a 

47
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.580
stored in it 

48
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.580
Now we have a printf function and it will print 

49
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.910
value of i = and in position of this format 

50
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.440
specifier %d 

51
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.310
It will take the value from Variable i which is 

52
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.590
10 so the value of i equal to 10 will be 

53
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.150
printed 

54
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
Next we have another printf function and it will print 

55
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.380
value of c = and in position of this 

56
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.840
format 

57
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.850
specifier %c, it will take the value from 

58
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.870
variable c which is a. So the value of c

59
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.549
equal to a will be printed 

60
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.579
Now we can also print both variables in a single 

61
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.150
printf function like this 

62
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.369
So for the first format specifier %c value 

63
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.090
from first variable after coma will be taken 

64
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.070
So i = 10 will be printed next for 

65
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.540
the second format specifier %c

66
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.750
Value from second variable c will be taken and 

67
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.450
c=a will be printed 

68
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.970
So this is how we can print two variables in 

69
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.450
a single printf function 

70
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.329
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
