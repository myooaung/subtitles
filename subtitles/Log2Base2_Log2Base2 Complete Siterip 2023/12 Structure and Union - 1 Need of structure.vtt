Hi friends

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.155
In this video we're going to discuss about the need of structure. 

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.389
Assume that we are going to develop a software for the college

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.600
library to manage all student's information. 

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.430
Student information includes roll number, name, age, weight etcetera. 

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.740
and all 

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.470
these are of different datatypes. So here can 

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.950
we use array? 

9
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.450
Definitely not! because an array is homogeneous data type were we 

10
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.190
can store only data of the same datatype.

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.550
So we need a solution to this and that is

12
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.020
Structure and a Structure can store data of different data 

13
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.110
types and hence it is sometimes called as the heterogeneous 

14
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.650
data type.

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.980
Now this is the syntax of structure. 

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.780
Here struct is the keyword used and we can 

17
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.550
give any name to our structure. 

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.330
And within curly braces we should declare the structure members 

19
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.750
which can be a combination of any data type.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.390
And at last we should put a semicolon;

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.839
Now let us see an example, we have to store student information 

22
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.620
including roll number, name, age, and weight 

23
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.039
So here we can create a structure called Student with 

24
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.289
structure members roll number of integer type,  name of 

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.340
character type, age of integer type and weight of  

26
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.120
float type. 

27
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.030
Now we can easily get and manage this information. 

28
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680
So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
