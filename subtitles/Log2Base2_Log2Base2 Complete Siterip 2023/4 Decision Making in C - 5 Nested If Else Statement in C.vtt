Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.240
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.900
the nested If - Else statement in C. 

3
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.430
So nested if else statement can 

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.230
be used, if you have more than 2 cases to 

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.120
handle and this is the syntax for nested

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.340
If else statement and it will check each condition sequentially 

7
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.930
and once the condition succeeds it goes to the corresponding 

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.619
block and if none of them are true then the 

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.010
else code part will work 

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.750
here suppose the first condition is false 

11
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.020
So the statements won't work and say second condition is 

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.830
also false 

13
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.980
So that block will also not work and say third 

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.809
condition is true and this block will be executed now 

15
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.960
suppose all the conditions here are false now first three 

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.820
blocks will not be executed and the else part will 

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.940
work. now see a program here which selects a grade

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.019
based on the score and we can use nested If-Else

19
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.230
statement since we have more than two options here and 

20
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.490
we are declaring an integer variable score and we ask

21
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.419
the user to enter the score and it is stored

22
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.890
in the variable score. The objective of this programme 

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.030
is if the score is more than 90 print S grade

24
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.440


25
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.539
And if the score is in between 80 and 90 

26
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.230
print A grade. If it is in between 70 and 80 print B 

27
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.980
grade. If it is between 60 and 70 print C grade. 

28
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.320
If it is between 51 and 60 print D grade and if 

29
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.750
the score is 50 print E grade and if it is below 

30
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.720
50 then print U grade 

31
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.259
Suppose user enters 65 it is stored to variable score. 

32
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.710
And now we want to find the grade so first

33
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.220
we have if score is less than or equal to 100

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.250
and greater than or equal to 90 

35
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.750
But the condition is false 

36
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.080
So we check the next condition which is score less 

37
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.550
than 90 and it is greater than or equal to 

38
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.400
80 

39
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.500
again it is false

40
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.490
So we go for the next condition 

41
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.580
Score is less than 80 and it is greater than 

42
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.200
or equal to 70 again 

43
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.650
This is also not true 

44
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.580
So leave that block and check the next one Here 

45
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.859
we have score less than 70 which is true so 

46
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.240
check if score is greater than or equal to 60 

47
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.030
and that is also true so the AND here will 

48
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.959
return TRUE 

49
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.070
And this block will be executed and it will print 

50
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.579
C and that's all

51
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.829
And next suppose user enters 150 and it will be 

52
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.329
stored in variable score 

53
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.640
And we have the nested 

54
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.730
If else here. The first condition score is less than 

55
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.829
or equal to 100 and greater than or equal to 90 is 

56
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.280
wrong

57
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.740
second one is wrong. third and forth is also wrong 

58
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.190
Next fifth condition it is also wrong 

59
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.490
And remember when the condition is wrong, we skip that 

60
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.960
block and now sixth and seventh is also wrong And 

61
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.190
we have the else part. 

62
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.760
So none of the condition is true Which means it 

63
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.090
will execute the else block and it will print 

64
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.180
"Enter a valid score between 0 and 100" and execution of the 

65
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.510
programme is completed 

66
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.380
And that is how we use nested

67
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.850
If else statement where we have more than two options 

68
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.320
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
