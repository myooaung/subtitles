00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.630
So what can we do to implement do stacks in 

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.890
a single array? A simple method is to divide the array

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.140
into two halves. 

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.510
First half becomes the first stack and second half becomes 

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.650
the second stack. 

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.450
So here indices from 0 to 2 becomes first stack

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.080
 and 3 to 5 becomes second stack 

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.360
with -1 being the top of first stack and two that 

9
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.990
is mid-1 being the top of second sack 

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.700
initially. 

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.800
So these are the empty conditions and if top1 

12
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.460
equal to mid-1 and top to equal to size-1

13
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360
 then stacks are full 

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.680
So with these conditions, we can define push and pop 

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690
for both stacks accordingly.
