00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.110
in this video let us learn how to implement the find 

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.910
operation 

3
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.700
As we discussed earlier the find operation will return the 

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.650
parent of a particular element 

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.000
In other words it is used to find out which 

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.570
set a particular element belongs to let us take the 

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.550
disjoint set which we created in the previous video 

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.940
Let us perform find of six 

9
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.070
The value at index six is minus one since it 

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.430
has a negative number 

11
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.250
The elements six itself is a parent node 

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.980
So find of six will be six only now let us 

13
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.490
perform find of seven the value it index seven is 

14
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.950
four 

15
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.470
Since it's a positive number it is not a parent 

16
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.620
node and it is connected with the element four so 

17
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.050
go to index four and check its value 

18
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.730
The valued index four is minus six and it is 

19
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.390
a negative number So the element four is a 

20
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.930
parent node So we need to return four here so 

21
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.600
find of seven will be four 

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.000
So what does that mean The parent node of seven 

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.470
is four that's it 

24
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.650
So the logic of find operation is very simple 

25
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.930
First check The value of given index If it has 

26
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.910
a negative value that will be the parent node so 

27
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.150
we can return this index straight away 

28
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.280
If the index has a positive value we need to 

29
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.000
visit every index till we find the negative value 

30
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.310
Once we find the negative value we can return that 

31
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.300
particular index as it is the parent node of the 

32
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.250
given element 

33
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.370
Now let us implement the find operation 

34
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.460
Let us write a function named find and it will 

35
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.780
take two arguments set array arr and Element U whose parent 

36
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.300
needs to be found so write find of int arr 

37
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.580
int U this find function will return the index of parent 

38
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.350
node so write written type as int 

39
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.370
Now let us copy the index value in some 

40
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.260
temporary variable say x so write int X equal to 

41
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.600
U 

42
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.080
Next we need to check the value of given index 

43
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.580
If it is a negative value we can return the 

44
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.640
index straightaway 

45
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.000
Otherwise we need to visit every index till we find 

46
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.050
a negative value 

47
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.090
So let us write a while loop till array of 

48
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.660
X greater than zero and change the index till the 

49
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.150
value becomes negative 

50
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.390
So write While array of X greater than zero x 

51
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.720
equal to array of X 

52
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.420
Basically what the while loop actually does is it will 

53
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.120
continuously update the index of parent node in variable X 

54
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.350
until the value of array of X becomes negative 

55
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.600
If it has a negative value the control will come 

56
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.780
out of the while loop 

57
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.050
So if array of X becomes a negative number the 

58
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.850
while loop will be terminated 

59
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.460
We will have the index of parent node in the 

60
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.750
variable X so we can return it 

61
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.280
So after the while loop write written X 

62
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.360
And that's it 

63
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.510
So that's all for this video in this video we 

64
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.300
have learned how to implement the find operation 

65
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.190
In the next video we will learn how to implement 

66
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.850
the isConnected operation.
