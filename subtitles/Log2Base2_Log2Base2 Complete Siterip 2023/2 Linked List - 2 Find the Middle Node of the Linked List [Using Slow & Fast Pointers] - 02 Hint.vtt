00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.150
So we need to find the middle node of the 

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.440
linked list. Here we can use two pointers slow and 

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.620
fast and traverse the list 

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.430
Using these two pointers. As the names, slow pointer will 

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.170
move slowly and fast 

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.090
will move fastly. In each iteration slow will move one 

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.650
node ahead and fast will move two nodes ahead 

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.750
And when fast point reach the end, slow will be 

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.950
at the middle node. 

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.920
So when fast reach the end or null we can 

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.810
print the node pointed by slow which will be the 

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.650
middle node.
