Hi friends 

1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.250
In this video we are going to learn 

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.550
the printf function in C programming 

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.629
So why do we need this printf function? It's just 

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.380
that when the program needs to communicate with the user 

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.050
Like if the program wants to take some data from 

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.939
the user or give some data or some information to the 

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.430
user 

8
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.740
In such cases we need to display data on the 

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.130
screen 

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.980
And for that we need a function 

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.130
And that is printf now see the syntax of printf

12
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.010
function here 

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.800
So right printf and inside parenthesis inside double quotes

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.660
you write whatever data you want to print and never 

15
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.600
forget to add a semicolon at the end and what 

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.230
you have inside this double quotes, it will be printed 

17
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.900
on the screen 

18
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.780
Now this printf is a function from the header 

19
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.680
file stdio.h

20
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.320
So it is important that you include stdio.h 

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 header file in your  programme 

22
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.990
If you're going to use the printf function. Now let's 

23
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.270
see an example programme 

24
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.390
So we are going to print "welcome to the C 

25
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.380
programming" using printf function 

26
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.120
And so we must include stdio.h

27
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.770
header file first and in main function we have 

28
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.160
the printf statement and inside double quotes 

29
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.100
We have "welcome to the C programming" 

30
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.890
and end it with the semi colon 

31
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.250
So when the programme executes it will print whatever is 

32
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.350
inside the double quotes

33
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.830
And here it will be welcome to the C programming 

34
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.890
And now let us discuss about the return value of 

35
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.770
printf function 

36
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.500
So printf function will be returning the character count 

37
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.620
So see this example here and we have 1 2 3 4 5 characters 

38
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.309
here so 5 will be the return value of this 

39
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.900
particular printf function and see another example 

40
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.310
And here we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 11 characters 

41
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.399
we have and that will be the return value 

42
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.990
And remember white space is always considered as an individual 

43
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.309
character so that will also be counted 

44
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.330
So here the return value will be 11 and not 10

45
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.790


46
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.930
So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
