Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.890
In this video let us learn how to write  

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.789
 algorithm, pseudo code and draw flow chart 

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.270
for the task to check if a number is zero or non zero 

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.590
For example, if we have a number 10 given as input 

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.490
we have to check if it is equal to zero 

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.620
and if it is print "Zero" otherwise print "Non-zero" 

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.999
So for number 10, the output will be "Non-zero"

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.970
And for number 0, the output will be "Zero" 

10
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.090
So that is our task.

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.340
And how can we perform this task? 

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.890
Let us write the algorithm first.

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
So first step of the algorithm is to start the process

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.060
and we will need a variable num to store the input number.


15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.750
So second step is to declare this variable num. 

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.110
Now we have the variable ready.

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.490
But we don't have the number to be checked. 

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.580
It should be read from the user to variable num. 

19
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.370
So that is the third step.

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.960
Read the number from user to num.

21
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.490
Now the number is ready. 

22
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.920
Now we have to check if it is equal to zero.


23
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.329
And if it is true, print "Zero" 

24
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.600
And if it is false, print "Num is non-zero" 

25
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.830
and the last step is to stop the process. 

26
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.230
So that was the algorithm. 

27
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.930
Now let us write the pseudo code. 

28
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.459
First begin and get input to num. 

29
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.200
and check if num is equal to zero 

30
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.820
And if it is, print "Zero". Else print "Non-zero" 

31
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.950
and end.

32
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.940
So that was the pseudo code 

33
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.570
Now let us draw the flow chart for this process 

34
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.130
First start.

35
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.680
and we will use the oval symbol for start and stop of a process. 

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.340
Next we have to get input to num

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.160
And as we learnt, we will use a parallelogram symbol

38
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.460
for input and output functions 

39
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.060
Next check if num is equal to zero 

40
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.010
And for these kind of decision making statements, we use a diamond symbol.

41
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.500
We can go to different stages from this point 

42
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.250
And if this condition is false print "Non-zero" 

43
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.960
And if it is true print "zero" 

44
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.290
And as we learnt since these are output functions  

45
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.890
we will use a parallelogram symbol.  

46
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.840
And both cases will then go to end stage 

47
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.840
So our task was to read a number from user

48
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.769
and check if it is zero or non zero 

49
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.910
and print the result on the screen.

50
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.740
And we learnt how to write the algorithm, pseudo code and draw flowchart for this task.
