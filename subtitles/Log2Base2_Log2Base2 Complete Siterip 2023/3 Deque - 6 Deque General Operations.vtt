00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.590
in this video let us discuss some general functions of 

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.950
Deque data structure 

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.310
The first one is the  isEmpty function 

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.090
This function will check whether the Deque is empty or not 

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.830
If it is empty it will return true 

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.310
Otherwise it will return false the Deque is empty when either 

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.860
the front or rear pointer is Null we can just null 

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.850
check anyone of the pointers 

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.980
Here we will take the front pointer and check 

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.250
it 

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.910
if front equal to null return true 

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.580
Otherwise we can return false that's it and the next 

13
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.940
function is get front 

14
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.100
The get front function will return the value of front 

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.970
node so 

16
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.030
First we need to check whether the deque empty or 

17
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.480
not 

18
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.250
If it's empty we can return minus one 

19
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.050
Otherwise we can return the front node data 

20
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.730
So at the end returned front data that's it and 

21
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.750
the last one is Get rear Function 

22
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.260
get rear function will return the value present at the rear 

23
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.660
Node 

24
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.890
So check if deque empty if it's empty 

25
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.980
return minus one 

26
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.510
Otherwise return data present in the rear node that is 

27
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.650
rear data 

28
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.170
That's it and this is all about deque data structure 

29
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.080
You can find the full implementation code in the next module.
