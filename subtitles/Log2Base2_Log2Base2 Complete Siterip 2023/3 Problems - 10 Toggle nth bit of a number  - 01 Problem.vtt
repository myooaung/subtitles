00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.340
The problem statement is you will be given a positive 

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.820
number and the value n and you have to toggle 

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.120
the nth bit in that number. 

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.070
That is, if the bit is currently set, then change 

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.060
it to unset.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.050
And if it is unset, change it to set.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
For example if given number is 65, this is it's 

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.310
binary representation 01000001. And if we have n 

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.270
equal to seven, we need to toggle seventh bit in 

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.610
this number and since it is set, we need to 

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.320
change it to unset.

12
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.320
That is, this one should be changed to zero and 

13
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:49.030
the resultant binary representation 00000001 will correspond to decimal one 

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.250
if this is the given number and n equal to six

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.340
we need to toggle the sixth bit. Here it is zero 

16
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.110
so after toggling it will become one and hence the 

17
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.920
resultant binary value will be 01100001 which corresponds to the 

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.370
to decimal 97 

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.560
So your task is to write the logic for this 

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.470
"Toggle nth bit problem" and submit it using the below compiler 

21
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.090
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs if the input is 

22
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.250
65 and 7, the expected output is one. If the  

23
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.750
input is 65 and 6, the expected output is 97.
