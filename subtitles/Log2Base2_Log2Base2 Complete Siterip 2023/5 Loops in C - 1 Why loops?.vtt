Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.710
In this video we're going to discuss the need of 

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.950
loops in C

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.990
So to really understand the need of Loops 

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.340
Let's assume a situation where we need to print good 

6
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.550
morning 10 times 

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.430
So what can we do? One thing we can do 

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.520
is write 10 printf statements separately to print each 

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.450
good morning like this so the output will be good 

10
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.080
morning printed 10 times 

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.500
Now it's fine because 10 is a small number 

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.950
But what if we want to print it 100 times 

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.770
Oh maybe 1000 times? it's impractical to write the same 

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.610
statements again and again So this is not a great 

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.200
solution 

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.910
So what is the real solution to this issue? The 

17
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.210
real solution is looping statements 

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.480
Instead of printing it N times we can use looping 

19
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.370
statements looping statement allows us to execute a block of 

20
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.870
code repeatedly until the given condition is true and when the

21
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.080
condition becomes false 

22
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.160
It will stop executing the statements 

23
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.620
We can easily remember loops using this 

24
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.760
See we have loop energy run so as long as 

25
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.370
the person has energy he will run and when he 

26
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.900
doesn't have energy he'll stop running further 

27
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.620
So this is exactly how loops also work 

28
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.920
It will execute a block of code as long as 

29
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.080
the given condition is true and here the condition is 

30
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.660
having energy and the block of code is run.

31
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.890
In C we have different kinds of loops

32
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.280
We have the for loop, we have the while loop 

33
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.090
and we have the do while loop and will be discussing 

34
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.660
each in the coming lessons So that's all and thank you for watching this video.
