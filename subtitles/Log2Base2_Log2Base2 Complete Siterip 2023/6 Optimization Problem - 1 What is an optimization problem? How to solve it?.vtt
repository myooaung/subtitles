Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.350
In this video let us discuss about optimisation problems 

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.780
So what is an  optimisation problem ? A problem that requires 

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.500
either the minimum or the maximum result is called optimisation 

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.050
problem 

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.450
For example let us take this problem 

7
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.350
The problem is to reach from the source to destination 

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.150
This problem might have many solutions like this 

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.410
Let us add one condition to this problem that is 

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.990
the person should reach the destination within 45 minutes 

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.550
Then the will be lesser number of solutions 

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.650
These solutions are called as feasible solutions 

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.210
That is a solution that satisfies the condition given in 

14
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.750
the problem is called as the feasible solution 

15
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.450
So here three solution satisfies the given condition 

16
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.880
The first route takes five minutes time and cost rupees 

17
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.550
100 

18
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.880
The second road takes 10 minutes to reach the destination 

19
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.560
and cost rupees 50 and the third road takes 15 

20
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880
minutes to reach the destination and cost rupees 

21
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.450
Five 

22
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.050
Here 

23
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.530
If we want to pick the route which takes the 

24
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.500
minimum cost there will be only one solution which will 

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.550
be road three as it takes 

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.830
Just five rupees to cover the end 

27
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.050
The entire journey hence road three is called the optimal solution 

28
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.140
so the feasible solution that gives the minimum or maximum 

29
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.150
result is known as the optimal solution 

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.700
There can be more than one solution for a problem 

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.150
and more than one feasible solution 

32
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.830
But there must only be one optimal solution so simply 

33
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.200
the problem can have many solutions 

34
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.860
The solutions which solve the given condition is known as 

35
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.930
a feasible solution and there can be more than one 

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.750
feasible solution for a problem 

37
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.830
A feasible solution which gives the minimum or maximum result 

38
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.810
is known as the optimal solution and there should be 

39
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.550
only one optimal solution for a problem 

40
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.190
We can solve the optimisation problems using three methods 

41
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.520
The first one is greedy method 

42
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.060
The second one is dynamic programming and the third one 

43
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.060
is branch and bound let us discuss one by one in 

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.180
