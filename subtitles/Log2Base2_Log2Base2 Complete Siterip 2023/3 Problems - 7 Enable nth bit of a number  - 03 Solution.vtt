00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.630
Now let us see how to write the code to 

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.300
enable nth bit of a number. Declare integer variables 

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.360
'num' to store the number and 'n' to store the 

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.180
bit position. Now read the values of num and n from 

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.080
the user. Now we need to create the bit mask

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.680
 by doing n-1 left shifts on number one

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.490
and then performing bitwise OR on this bit mask

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.280
 and the number. So write num equal to 

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.250
num OR 1 left shift n-1 

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.230
Now the nth bit will be enabled and the resultant 

11
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.650
value is in num 

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.450
So to print the result, write printf num
