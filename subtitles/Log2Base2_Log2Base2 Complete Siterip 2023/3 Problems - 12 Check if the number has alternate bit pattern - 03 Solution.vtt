1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.510
to solve this problem 

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.090
Let us write a function has alternate bit pattern which 

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.850
takes an integer and returns in integer the first step 

4
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.770
is to perform right shift on the original number by 

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.750
one position 

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.160
So right int rshift equal to num right shift 

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.550
one 

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.780
The next step is to perform bitwise XOR 

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.810
on the original number and right shifted number so write 

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.350
int result equal to Num bitwise XOR OR shift 

11
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.420
The next step is to check 

12
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.950
If the resulted number is a power of two 

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.320
So right if result and result plus one equal to 

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.550
zero then returned one else written zero.
