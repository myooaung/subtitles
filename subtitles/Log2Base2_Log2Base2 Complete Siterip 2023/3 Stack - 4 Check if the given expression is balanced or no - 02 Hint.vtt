00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
So how can we check if parantheses is balanced?

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.440
We can create a stack, scan the expression and 

3
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.380
if the scanned element is an opening bracket then push it 

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.350
into the stack.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.800
So first and second characters here are pushed into the 

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.350
stack.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.050
And if the scanned element is a closing bracket

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.590
then perform pop operation and check 

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.050
If it matches the last scanned closing bracket 

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.020
If it is, everything is fine so far. Otherwise parantheses

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.650
is is unbalanced. 

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.250
Here it matches. So it is good we can continue 

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.860
And the next character is also a closing bracket 

14
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
So pop from stack and check if it matches and 

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.260
here it matches.

16
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.120
So again it's all fine and we reached the end 

17
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.540
of the expression and nothing is left in the stack 

18
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.320
that is all openings were balanced by closing brackets. 

19
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.370
So the expression is balanced 

20
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.650
Now see another example. 

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060
We have opening bracket first. So push it 

22
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.350
next we have another opening 

23
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.700
So again push 

24
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.050
Next we have closing. So pop and check

25
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.720
if it matches and it matches 

26
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.820
so scan next character 

27
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.100
And again it is a closing bracket. 

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.250
So perform pop and check

29
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.460
If it matches the scanned symbol but it does not 

30
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.970
match.

31
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.450
We have opening curly bracket and closing round bracket so 

32
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.150
this expression is unbalanced.
