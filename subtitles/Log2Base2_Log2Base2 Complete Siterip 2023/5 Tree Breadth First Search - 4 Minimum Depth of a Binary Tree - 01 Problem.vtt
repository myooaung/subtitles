00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.830
You will be given a binary tree and your task 

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.950
is to find its minimum depth. 

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.310
So the minimum depth of a binary tree is the 

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.690
number of nodes from the root to the nearest leaf 

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.050
node.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.850
See here.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
The nearest leaf node is 20 and its depth is 

8
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.550
two.

9
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.350
So the minimum depth of this binary tree is two 

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.190
And here the nearest leaf node is 60 and it's 

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.350
depth is three. So the minimum depth of this binary tree 

12
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.950
is 3.
