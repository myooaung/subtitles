00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.540
So how to reverse words in a string? For that we have 

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.460
to identify the words first. After each word there will 

3
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.900
be a white space. So use a start index variable 

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.850
and traverse the string till we reach a white space 

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.370
And when we reach a white space we got one word.

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.950
So we can reverse it. Now start the next 

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.650
word after the white space and do the same

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.500
move to the next character continuously till we reach white space 

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.660
and that will be the next word and we can 

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.880
reverse it using the same logic that we lerant. Again 

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.180
continue till we reach the end of the string to reverse all the words of a string.
