00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.660
You will be given a sorted array of numbers and you 

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.970
need to remove duplicates from it and return the new 

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.450
length 

4
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.870
But in this problem, the duplicate can appear at most twice

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.350
which means each number can appear twice and not 

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.240
more than that.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.850
For example, given an array with elements 5 5 5 6 6 6 and 8 

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.330
Here we have number 5, three times. Also the number 6 

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.910
three times and one 8. We can have the same number twice 

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.150
and not more than that. 

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.010
So the expected output is two times 5 , two times 6, 

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.480
and one time 8 and the new array length is 5.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.440
