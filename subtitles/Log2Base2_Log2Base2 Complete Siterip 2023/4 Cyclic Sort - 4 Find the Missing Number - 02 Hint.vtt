00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.820
This problem follows a cyclic sort pattern as it 

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.130
is required to find the missing number in the given 

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.650
range.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.450
So first sort the elements using cyclic sort  

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.100
After the sort,

6
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.490
each element will be placed in its correct index except 

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.500
the missing element.

8
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.780
So just check

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.510
If each index and its value are the same.

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.320
If it is not the same, just return that particular index 

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.540
See this example 

12
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.050
We have the array elements 3 5 1 4 0 

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.320
After the cyclic sort, the order of elements will 

14
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.450
be 0 1 5 3 and 4

15
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.510
Now the elements 0 1 3 and 4 all are present in 

16
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.110
their correct indices. But in index two, instead of element 2

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 we have 5 there.

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.300
Hence we can easily return the missing element which is 

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.050
two here.
