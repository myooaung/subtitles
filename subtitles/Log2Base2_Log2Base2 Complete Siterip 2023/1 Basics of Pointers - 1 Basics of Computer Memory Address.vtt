hi friends 

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.710
In this video we are going to have an introduction 

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.530
to pointers 

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.300
So first let us learn some basic concepts of computer 

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.200
memory address

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.380
So every memory location has an address in a computer 

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.940
and a pointer is a variable which stores this 

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.650
address. so we can say a pointer refers to a 

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.420
memory address 

10
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.520
And using this reference we can access the data stored 

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.560
in this location 

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.869
And when we talk about this computer memory, it is 

13
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.520
linear in nature. that is we can see here, this memory is 

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.140
organised in a contiguous address space. Here each block 

15
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.950
represents one byte of memory 

16
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.870
And as we said each block will have a unique 

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.410
address 

18
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.080
For our easy understanding 

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.010
We have represented the address decimal number but actually computer 

20
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.150
memory address is a hexa decimal value 

21
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.990
A basic unit of memory is a byte and a 

22
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.560
byte consist of eight bits and each bit can either 

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.850
be zero or one 

24
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.059
The entire computer memory is made up of zeros and 

25
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.330
ones. and each data type requires a specific amount 

26
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.899
of memory 

27
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.810
For example character type requires one byte 

28
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.760
where as an integer or float requires 4 contiguous

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.560
bytes of memory and double requires eight contiguous bytes 

30
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.539
So these were some basic concepts and we will learn

31
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.649
more in the coming lessons

32
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.330
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
