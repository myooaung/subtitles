00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.160
the delete rear operation is same as to delete front 

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.950
operation 

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.080
The only difference is for deleting the front node 

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.830
We need to move the front pointer to its next 

5
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.430
node but to delete the rear node we need 

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.260
to move the rear pointer to its previous node so let us 

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.590
Take the delete front logic and modify it first 

8
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.590
let us change the function name to delete rear and 

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.330
inside that backup the rear node instead of the 

10
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.880
front 

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.110
So write node start temp equal to rear to remove 

12
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.910
the rear node 

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.670
Make the rear pointer point to its previous 

14
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.830
node so write rear equal to rear Prev And then 

15
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.960
if rear becomes null We need to reset the front 

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.780
pointer to null So change it to if rear equal to 

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.380
null front equal to null and then in general case 

18
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.180
after the removal rear next will point the old node 

19
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.020
So we need to make it null So change it 

20
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020
to rear next equal to null 

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.450
And that's it this is the implementation of the delete rear operation.
