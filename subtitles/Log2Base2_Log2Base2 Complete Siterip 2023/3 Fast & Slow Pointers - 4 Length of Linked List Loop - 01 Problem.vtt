00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.930
In the previous problem we have learned how to find 

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.150
a loop is present in a linked list 

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.290
In this problem, your task is to find the length 

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.000
of the loop.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.120
For example, if this is the given linked list

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.670
Here we have a loop and it has four elements. 

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.150
So the length of the loop is four.

8
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.260
And if there is no loop present in the given 

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.350
linked list just return zero.
