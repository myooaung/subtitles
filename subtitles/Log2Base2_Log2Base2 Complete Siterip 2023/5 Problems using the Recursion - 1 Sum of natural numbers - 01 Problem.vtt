00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.900
the problems statement is 

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.170
You have to find the sum of first n natural numbers 

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.470
using recursion for example if given value of n 

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.310
is three the output should be the sum of first three 

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.990
natural numbers which is one plus two plus three that 

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.050
is six 

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.850
And if the value of n is five then the 

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.190
output should be one plus two plus three plus four 

9
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.250
plus five which is equal to 15.
