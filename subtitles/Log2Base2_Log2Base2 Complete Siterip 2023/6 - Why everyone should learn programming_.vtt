Hello friends 

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.020
In this video you will understand 

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:12.070
why is it so important to study programming The purpose 

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.750
of programming is to make human life better and easier 

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.300
and it has revolutionised and changed the world for the 

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.800
better 

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730
Let us analyse some real life scenarios 

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.050
where programming made 

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550
A significant difference 

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.750
Let us first analyse a billing process at a supermarket 

11
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.420
What was the old method? The cashier will write the 

12
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.940
bill on a paper manually so it may have some 

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.640
errors. And this error will cause loss either to the 

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.060
customer or to the shopkeeper 

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.450
So that is a very serious disadvantage of this method 

16
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.690
And also suppose it is a festival time 

17
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.040
and many number of customers are coming 

18
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.240
Then it will be very difficult to handle the situation 

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.620
But nowadays we cannot see these situations 

20
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.330
Often programming has definitely solved these problems 

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.710
Rather than calculating bill manually every time we can use 

22
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.520
a billing software or programme it would operate very fast 

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.350
so that customers need not wait in a queue for 

24
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.170
a long time 

25
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.509
Also we can handle many customers easily which increases the 

26
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.350
productivity 

27
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.300
It would calculate bills with 100% accuracy rate so that 

28
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.360
customers get satisfied every time we know supermarkets have many 

29
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040
customers always and what would be the situation If we 

30
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.480
still use the old billing method it would be total 

31
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.040
chaos 

32
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.550
So Billing programme has definitely revolutionised many industries 

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.720
Another area is in communication at old times 

34
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.670
It was very difficult to communicate with people in other 

35
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.250
country or state 

36
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.410
If we have an emergency news to be conveyed even 

37
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.070
that would take a long time 

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.480
But now there are no such issues because we have 

39
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.550
the social networking sites using social networking softwares like Facebook 

40
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.040
Whatsapp we can communicate with any person with a 

41
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.920
matter of single click 

42
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.490
Now one other interesting use of programming is in a 

43
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.240
dictionary 

44
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.549
We all have depended on the conventional dictionary to find 

45
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.970
meanings of words 

46
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.240
It is a book with thousands of pages and even 

47
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.910
if it is sorted with a lot of words in 

48
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.500
a single page finding one word takes time and it 

49
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.450
is difficult 

50
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.230
But now hardly anyone uses it. Because there is a 

51
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.550
much easier way 

52
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.070
We only have to find dictionary applications or we can 

53
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.549
simply search it in Google and get the result in 

54
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.850
milliseconds getting a new word meaning in milli seconds!! 

55
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.510
This was never possible with our conventional dictionary so programming 

56
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.050
can make things this simpler in our real life 

57
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.350
These were some of the examples and this is how 

58
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.950
programming has changed the world for better 

59
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.359
As Stephen Hawking said "Whether you want to uncover 

60
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.910
the secrets of the universe or you just want to 

61
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.210
pursue a career in the 21st century basic computer programming 

62
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.850
is an essential skill to learn" 

63
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.550
So in this 21st century learning programming is inevitable
