00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.870
This problem involves eliminating the same numbers and finding 

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.130
the odd occurring number. As we already know using bitwise

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.950
XOR we can eliminate the same numbers. 

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.650
So we can use bitwise XOR to solve this problem.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.970
Just declare a variable to store the result 

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.950
on that result XOR all the numbers one by one 

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.560
while doing bitwise XOR all the same numbers 3 3 

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.950
and 4 4 will cancel out and it will become 0.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.440


10
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.490
Finally the remaining numbers are zero and five 

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.320
If we XOR a number with zero we will get 

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.450
the same number. 

13
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
So zero XOR five will give five which is 

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.950
our expected output. 

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.530
So the logic for this problem is very simple.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.260
Just XOR all the numbers in a common variable. It's the result 

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.870
and finally return it.
