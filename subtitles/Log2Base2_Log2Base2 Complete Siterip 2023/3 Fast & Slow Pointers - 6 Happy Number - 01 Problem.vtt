00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.370
You will be given a number and your task is 

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.670
to check whether the given number is a happy number 

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.350
or not. 

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.000
So what is a happy number? See if you take 

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.660
a number and repeatedly replace the number with its sum 

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.730
of squares of its digits and finally you're getting the 

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.580
number one.

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.050
Then that number is a happy number. 

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.420
For example, let us take the number 19, add squares 

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.520
of digits one and nine. So one square + nine square

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.450
equal to eighty two.

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.010
Now do the same. Eight square + two square equal to sixty eight.

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.380
Now six square + eight square equal to hundred

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.380


15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.490
So now one square + zero square + zero square 

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.420
equal to one.

17
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.430
So after repeatedly finding sum of squares of each digit 

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
finally we got the number one. So we can say 

19
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.150
19 is a happy number. 

20
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.730
All other numbers which does not lead us to number one

21
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.200
 will get stuck in a loop of numbers which 

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.400
never reach one.

23
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510
For example, take the number 15. One square 

24
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.120
plus five square equal to twenty six. 

25
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.210
Two square plus six square equal to forty.

26
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.130
Four square plus zero square equal to sixteen. One square plus six square

27
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.850
equal to thirty seven. 

28
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
Three square plus seven square equal to fifty eight. 

29
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.850
five square plus eight square equal to eighty nine. Now eight square 

30
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.500
plus nine square equal to 145. 

31
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.680
Now one square plus four square plus five square equal to forty two.

32
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.650
 

33
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.660
Now four square plus two square equal to twenty and 

34
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.910
two square plus zero square

35
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.560
equal to four and four square equal to sixteen. Again see 

36
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.110
here four is again going back to sixteen so it will 

37
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.780
never reach number one. 

38
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.020
The same numbers after sixteen will repeat again and again 

39
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.590
so 15 is not a happy number.
