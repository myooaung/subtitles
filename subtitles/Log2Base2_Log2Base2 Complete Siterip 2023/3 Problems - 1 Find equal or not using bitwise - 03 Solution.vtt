00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.670
This is the implementation of the equal or not problem 

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.880
So in the implementation, first we need two integer variables 

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.710
to store the input numbers. 

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.650
So declare integer variables num1 and num2 

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.630
Now read the numbers from user to num1 and num2

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.460
using the scanf function.

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
So as we discussed, if the bitwise xor 

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.940
of num1 and num2 is equal to zero 

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.640
then number1 and number2 are equal. Otherwise they 

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.710
are not equal. So check 

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.290
if it is zero. So write if num1 xor num2 

12
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.980
 is equal to zero and if so 

13
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.580
we have to print the message 'Equal' else we have 

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.450
to print a message 'Unequal'.
