00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello friends 

2
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.920
In this video we are going to discuss about the binary number system. 

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.730
We know that for a base N number system, we will have N numbers from 0 to N-1 

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.070
And the numbers of that system will be a combination of these 0 to N-1 numbers 

5
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.140
So the binary number system is the Base 2 number system. 

6
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.700
Hence it will have the numerals from 0 to 2-1 

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.510
that is 0 to 1 

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.710
So that's just the two numbers 0 and 1

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.390
And for us humans we use the decimal number system 

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.450
We express numbers in positional decimal format 

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.570
But the computer can't store decimal numbers directly

12
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.990
The computer can understand only binary number system 

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.870
which is also called as the base 2 number system 

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.340
So the computer automatically converts the decimal number to binary format before using it 

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.860
Whatever be the data

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.120
The computer always converts it into its only known language 

17
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.249
which is binary 

18
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.340
So learning binary number system and its conversion will be very helpful in programming 

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.200
So if we have a number in decimal system  

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.950
how can we convert it into its binary format? 

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.889
Let us understand it using an example 

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.990
so we have the decimal number 22 

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.920
To convert this into its binary, we have to divide the number by 2.

24
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.909
It is because, the base of the binary number system is 2.

25
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.190
Similarly if you need to convert a decimal number to it's octal number

26
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.390
We have to divide it by it's base 8 

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.310
and to convert a decimal number to it's hexa decimal number,

28
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.390
We have to divide it by it's base 16 

29
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.250
so that is the first step in decimal to binary conversion 

30
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.550
Divide the number by two and write down the remainder of the division 

31
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.390
So here 22 by 2 is equal to 11 

32
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.210
and remainder is equal to zero 

33
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.990
again divide the result 11 by 2 

34
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.840
and we get the result five and remainder is equal to 1 

35
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.880
so note it down 

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.100
and this procedure should be continued until we get zero as the result

37
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.230
 So here the result is five 

38
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.760
So divide five by two and we get 2 as the result 

39
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.890
and remainder equal to one 

40
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.450
again divide two by two and we get one 

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.450
and remainder equal to zero 

42
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.100
So divide one divided by two and we get the result zero

43
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.510
 and remainder equal to one 

44
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.790
So now the result equal to zero and we can stop 

45
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.820
And to get the binary value of this number

46
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.640
 just write the remainders of the operation in the reverse order 

47
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.040
that is from bottom to up

48
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.110
So we get 10110 

49
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.910
So this is how we can get the binary value of any decimal number 

50
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.970
Let us revise the procedure. 

51
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.690
 Divide the number by two and note the remainder.

52
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.070
again divide the result of division by two and note the remainder 


53
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.220
And continue this until we get the result as zero 

54
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.270
And finally write the remainders in the reverse order 

55
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.130
And that will be the binary value of that number 

56
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.160
Now we have to by heart 

57
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.470
the binary values of the numbers in decimal number system  

58
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.830
and it will help us in many cases 

59
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.410
So the 4 bit binary value of 0 is 0000 

60
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.170
and the binary value of 1 is 0001 

61
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.750
The binary value of 2 is 0010 

62
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.410
the binary value of 3 is 0011 

63
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.030
and the binary value of 4 is 0100 

64
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.690
The binary value of 5 is 0101  

65
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.380
the binary value of 6 is 0110 

66
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.970
The binary value of 7 is 0111 

67
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.080
The binary value of 8 is 1000   

68
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.400
And finally the binary value of 9 is 1001 

69
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.939
So we learnt how to convert decimal number to binary 

70
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.820
If we have a decimal number we can easily convert it into its binary form

71
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.810
And what if we have a binary value and we have to convert it

72
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.690
 into its corresponding decimal value 

73
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.020
How can we do that? 

74
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.360
We know that a binary number will be a string of zeros and ones 

75
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.780
see an example 

76
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:15.670
We have a binary value 10110 

77
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.120
We have an easy method to convert this into its decimal value 

78
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.370
And for that first we need to count the positions 

80
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.710
and we count the positions from right to left 

81
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.430
So the position of 0 is zero,  

82
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.850
1 is one, next 1 is two 

83
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.360
And next 0 is three and final 1 is four 

84
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.660
Now that we have got the positions, 

85
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.830
multiply these values  with two raised to position number and find the sum 

86
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.780
that is 1 x 2 raised to its position 4 

87
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.350
+ 0 x 2 raised to its position 3  

88
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.250
+ 1 x 2 raised to its position 2 

89
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.710
+ 1 x 2 raised to its position 1 

90
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.260
+ 0 x 2 raised to its position 0 

91
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.860
 which is 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0

92
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.330
That is 22 

93
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.340
So this is the decimal equivalent of binary 10110 

94
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.930
So  what we did is take each value and multiply with 2 raised to its position

95
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.430
 and find the sum and we will get the decimal value 

96
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.260
So today we discussed about the binary number system or 

97
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.660
the base 2 number system which is the computer language 

98
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.870
and we discussed about decimal to binary and binary to decimal conversion 

99
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.000
So that's all 

100
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.790
And in the next video we will discuss about the octal number system 

101
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.510
So that's all for this video and thank you for watching.
