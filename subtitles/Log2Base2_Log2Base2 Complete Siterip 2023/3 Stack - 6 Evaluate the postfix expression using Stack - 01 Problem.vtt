00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.990
The problem statement is you will be given a post fix

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.600
expression and you have to evaluate it. 

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.950
So what is the post fix expression? The expressions in 

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.370
which the operators come after operands are called post 

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.480
fix expressions.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.680
For an example, if they given post fix expression is 

7
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.070
8 2 + we need to evaluate it and print the 

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.650
result.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.060
So for this expression, its corresponding infix expression is 

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.050
8+2 which is 10 

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.890
And if the given post fix expression is 1 2 5 * +

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.090
we need to evaluate it and it's infix 

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 expression will be 1 + 2 * 5 which 

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.250
is 11 

15
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.610


16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.050
So your task is to write the logic for this problem and 

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350
submit it using the below compiler. 

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.260
See some sample inputs and corresponding outputs 

19
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.000
If the input is 8 2 + the expected output is 10.

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.650


21
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.340
If the input is 1 2 5 * + 

22
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.050
the expected output is 11 

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.400
If the input ease 5 2 5 * + 5 / 

24
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.530
then the expected output is 3.
