Hi friends 

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.990
In this video we are going to discuss about the do while loop in C.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.940
So we can use do while loop in

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.880
cases where we want to execute a block of statements 

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.940
at least once 

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.300
Now this is the syntax of do while loop 

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.310
do then write statements within curly braces and then while 

8
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.029
condition semi colon Now let us see how do while 

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.480
works so it will execute the statements first and then 

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.410
check the condition. And if it is true the statements 

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.000
will be executed again and then it will check the 

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.900
condition again 

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.190
Suppose it is true again. so the statements will be 

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.250
executed and condition will be checked 

15
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.800
Now suppose the condition is false so it will come 

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.550
out of the loop 

17
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.390
So in each iteration the statements will be executed first 

18
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.559
and then condition will be checked now let us see

19
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.490
simple C programme which gets an input from the user 

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.080
and print it until the input is 100 

21
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.190
So we have the main function and an integer variable 

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.330
num is created 

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.880
And then we have our do while loop here and 

24
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.860
in each iteration it reads the input and store it to 

25
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.869
Num and print it and then check if it is not 

26
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.450
equal to 100 

27
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.720
So we go to first iteration 

28
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.520
We ask the user to give a number and suppose 

29
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.430
user enters 12 so it will be printed and 

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.370
the condition is checked which is true 

31
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.640
So we go for the second iteration and ask the 

32
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.810
user for a number and let it be 10 

33
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.570
now and it will be stored in num and it 

34
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.510
will be printed 

35
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.980
Now the condition is checked and it is still true 

36
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.070
So we go for the third iteration and we ask

37
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.320
the user for the input and let the number 

38
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.100
entered by the user be 100 

39
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.960
Now it will be stored in Num and it will 

40
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.740
be printed 

41
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.640
And now the condition will be checked and it fails 

42
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.869
So the control comes out of the loop and execute 

43
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.360
the next statement which is return zero here 

44
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.820
And the major difference between while and do while loop is 

45
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.520
that while loop will check the condition first and if 

46
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.190
it is true then the block will be executed and 

47
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.730
do while will execute the block first and then check the 

48
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.310
condition 

49
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.130
So that's all and thank you for watching this video
