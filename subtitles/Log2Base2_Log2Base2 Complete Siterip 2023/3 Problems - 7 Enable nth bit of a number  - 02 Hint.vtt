00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
To enable the nth bit in a number, which bitwise 

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.550
operator can we use?

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.750
We can use bitwise OR operator, Because if we do 

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.990
bitwise OR between zero and one, we will get one.

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.030
and if we do bitwise OR between one and one 

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.450
also we will get one.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.300
So what we can do here is, we can create 

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.550
a bit mask with nth bit alone set to one. 

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.330
And then if we perform bitwise OR between the 

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.740
number and the bit mask, the nth bit will be 

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.180
set to one and the remaining bits will remain as 

12
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.200
the same as it is in number. 

13
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.290
So what we can do here is, we can create 

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.850
a bit mask with nth bit alone set to one.

15
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.940
Now if we do bbitwise AND between the number 

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.950
and this bit mask, we will get zero 

17
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.580
if the nth bit in the number is not set or zero

18
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.850
 else we will get  non zero number 

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.770
Now let us see how to create a bit mask 

20
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.150
with nth bit alone set to one 

21
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.970
Let us see an example.

22
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.370
Here let us create a bit mask with seventh bit set 

23
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.650
to one. That is, here n equal to seven 

24
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.670
To do this we can make use of left shift 

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.420
operator 

26
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.360
Now let us take the number one where the first bit

27
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.620

28
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.650
alone is one and the other bits are zero 

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.650
Let us perform left shift operation to move this one 

30
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.950
to the seventh bit.

31
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.360
For that we have to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 left shifts to 

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.660
reach the seventh bit. So do one left shift six 

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.710
And if we want to create a bit mask with 

34
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.910
fifth bit alone set to one, we have to perform 

35
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.490
1 2 3 4 left shifts on number one. That is one left 

36
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.120
shift four. Thus to set nth bit alone to one, 

37
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.340
we have to perform n-1 left shifts on 

38
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.020
number one. 

39
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.650
So let us take an example 

40
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.130
Here the number is 35 and we have to 

41
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.580
enable the fifth bit. 

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.280
So here n is equal to five. So let us 

43
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.850
create a bit mask with fifth bit set to one. 

44
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.170
To do that take one and perform n-1 

45
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.210
left shifts. That is, one left shift four and the 

46
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.950
bit mask is now ready. 

47
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.360
So perform bitwise OR on the number and the 

48
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.050
bit mask.

49
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.250
Thus the fifth bit is set to one here and 

50
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.260
the remaining bits will remain unchanged because when we perform 

51
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.790
bitwise OR operation with bit value zero, the bit's value will 

52
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.730
not change 

53
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.990
That is one OR zero is one and zero OR zero is 

54
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.550
zero 

55
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.640
So we have thus enabled fifth bit in the number 

56
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.040
35 and after enabling the fifth bit the value in 

57
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.150
num is 51
