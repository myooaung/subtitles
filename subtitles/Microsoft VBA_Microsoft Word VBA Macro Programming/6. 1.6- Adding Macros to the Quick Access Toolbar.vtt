00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.480
in this video,

2
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.200
we'll look at how you can add a button to the quick access toolbar,

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.510
which launches and runs a macro when clicked.

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.650
We'll also look at how you can customize the appearance of the body and also the tool tip,

5
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.450
which appears when you hover over it.

6
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:39.050
The macro that we want to use is the one we recorded in the last video,

7
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.850
and if you remember,

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.020
we saved it in our adding the ad in In,

9
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.050
which will be saving all the macros that we create on this course.

10
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.950
Because the Adan is in our Exercises folder and not in the words startup folder,

11
00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.930
the macro as it contains no automatically available because the ad in itself is not

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.450
automatically activated.

13
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.650
To activate it,

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.510
we have to go to file or office button on 2000 and seven.

15
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.450
Choose options,

16
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
Maddin's Manage Word,

17
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.250
Adan's and then finally in global templates and Adan's.

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.050
You'll see GCS word VB a training,

19
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.150
and we can simply activate it.

20
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.290
And,

21
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.660
of course,

22
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.740
if it's not listed,

23
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.630
simply click on,

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.650
add and then browse for this file.

25
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.450
Now that this is activated,

26
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.530
we can go up to the quick access toolbar and on the right hand side,

27
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.550
we have the customized quick access toolbar dropped out,

28
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.490
and from this we choose more commands by default.

29
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.150
It lists popular commands.

30
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.850
Family Simply change this to Mac Rose,

31
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760
and here's our macro,

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.450
with its very long name,

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.430
which consists of both The module,

34
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.940
which is called Eso,

35
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.150
won getting started.

36
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.350
Then there's a dot and then we have the name of the macro,

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.250
which we can see on the tool tip.

38
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.350
So we highlights it.

39
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.550
Click on add.

40
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.360
It's added,

41
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.750
and it has that default icon and that default very long name.

42
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.620
Luckily,

43
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.250
we can click on modify to customize both of those.

44
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.950
So at the top here we can choose any of these icons.

45
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.450
Since this is a document,

46
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.050
let's look for a document icon.

47
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.850
And here we've got a very good one.

48
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.080
Writing in bolt on a page and then the display name weaken certainly shorten.

49
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.250
So let's delete everything apart from the name itself.

50
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.770
And it might be a good idea to put the word macro at the start so that we can distinguish

51
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.950
between those icons that run other commands and those which will run Mac Rose.

52
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.710
We don't have to keep this cryptic name anymore so we can put spaces in to make it more

53
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.150
readable.

54
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.650
And that's it.

55
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.850
We click OK,

56
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.950
and our button is now added to the toolbar.

57
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.750
When we hover over it,

58
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.990
we get out.

59
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.550
Tilt it.

60
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.250
Best test that it still works.

61
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.310
So we open up the file that were used in the last video to test it inside,

62
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.950
01 getting started.

63
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:46.740
And then it's called 0102 recorded and macro and we click to run the macro and everything

64
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.450
works Fine.

65
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.850
Now,

66
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.370
if you are using this technique on your own,

67
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.050
Mac Rose,

68
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.650
it only makes sense to a sign Buttons.

69
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.350
But those macros which you know are going to be permanently available.

70
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.550
So in our case,

71
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.150
Al Macro is saved in a template which we activate when we want to test our Mac Rose.

72
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.010
So clearly,

73
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.200
if we haven't activated,

74
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.550
the ad in the macro won't be available and would run.

75
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.670
It's although we've done this for illustrative purposes,

76
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.750
just to show you how the technique works.

77
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.540
Yeah,

78
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.250
in a real life situation,

79
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.710
it only makes sense to use this technique if you know that the macro is permanently

80
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.350
available.

81
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.640
So let's just quit word for the moment.

82
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.250
We won't say there are changes to this test file,

83
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.050
and then we'll go straight back into it.

84
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.520
But of course,

85
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.530
the differences.

86
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.750
Our Adan is not currently activated.

87
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.550
So when we click on the button,

88
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.350
no,

89
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.350
we'll get an error message because the macro cannot be found.

90
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.750
So it's If you are doing this at work,

91
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.710
then ah,

92
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.440
reserve this technique for those macros,

93
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.830
which you know the user will always have access to.

94
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.350
Perhaps because they saved in the normal template.

95
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.890
Well,

96
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.240
because the template that they're in will be saved in the words startup folder and will

97
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.650
therefore automatically load when you launch word.

98
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.060
And I'll just finished by reminding you how you can verify the location of the word startup

99
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.450
folder.

100
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.850
It's file options,

101
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.450
office button word options on 2007.

102
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.650
Then it's advanced.

103
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.050
Scroll to the bottom and file locations.

104
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.380
And then here you got started so you can kick on,

105
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.240
modify on,

106
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.150
perhaps just copy that location,

107
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.960
and then any templates that has saved in there will automatically be activated so you won't

108
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.950
have to do the Adan's activation,

109
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.750
which we have to do for our training added.

110
00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:11.140
To add a button to the quick Access toolbar,

111
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.270
which runs a macro,

112
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.880
choose more commands from the customized Quick Access Toolbar menu.

113
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:25.170
Both the icon and name displayed on the Q 80 can be customized.

114
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.270
Only Macros,

115
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.470
which have permanently available to the user,

116
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.220
should be assigned a button on the Q 80.
