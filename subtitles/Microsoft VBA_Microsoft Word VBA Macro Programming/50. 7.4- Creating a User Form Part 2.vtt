00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.090
having ensured that every control has a name,

2
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.430
we could then think about the start in values,

3
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.890
starting attributes that we need to give it to the controls.

4
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.490
So one thing I'll do is just to make all of my labels bold.

5
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.450
So I'm gonna hold down the control key,

6
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:44.690
click on each one and then just go into the form of property and switch on bold and formed

7
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.100
on.

8
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.180
Second thoughts would look better in regular.

9
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.850
We can also think about set in a default fund and a default size.

10
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.650
And think about whether we want bold to be a default by talent to be a default.

11
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.550
And also which of these sizes we might like us a default.

12
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.250
So let's start with the phones.

13
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.940
Let's say we have impact as our title.

14
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.150
In times New Roman is our author default.

15
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.970
We simply select the combo box,

16
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.800
go down to the Value property and actually enter the font name in there.

17
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:38.630
So impact in this one and times new Roman in this one been for the size.

18
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:48.050
Let's say we're gonna have a default of 30 for the title and 16 for the author,

19
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.620
and let's say we're gonna have times New Roman bold.

20
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.650
So you want bold to be switched on by default.

21
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.030
To do that,

22
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.950
we simply change the value from falls to true.

23
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.950
Now,

24
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.580
logically,

25
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.650
having set these Fontane tributes,

26
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.760
the text that anyone types in here should match those attributes so we could now select

27
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.710
each of those text boxes going to fund and just choose the same size.

28
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.550
So we said 30 on the same fonts We said impact.

29
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.560
And then here we said,

30
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.350
16 times New Roman and bold.

31
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:50.650
So let's just save our changes and test that this works.

32
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.700
This looks like impact,

33
00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.650
and that looks like times New Roman bold.

34
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.010
Another thing we'll need to do is to make this textbooks multi line.

35
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.460
Although we've made it two lines high as we type,

36
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.560
you'll see it doesn't actually go on to two lines and the attribute that will make that

37
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.010
happen.

38
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.620
It's to switch on multi line,

39
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.010
make sure I'm on the right.

40
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.250
Control fast and multilane becomes true.

41
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.150
The difference is if I now type,

42
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.450
you will just wrap onto two lines automatically.

43
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:47.270
We should also lock these two controls so the user is unable to type their font size they

44
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.720
actually have to use the spin buttons so I can click on this one control click on that and

45
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.550
locked them simultaneously by Simply put in a lot to truth.

46
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.180
So we're gonna run,

47
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.570
You'll see.

48
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.150
I can't actually type the value in there.

49
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.450
So now the spend buttons.

50
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.750
If you highlight a spend button,

51
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.860
the three most important or the three key attributes are going to be Max Men and small

52
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.780
change Max and Mina.

53
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.850
Self explanatory.

54
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.350
And the small changes really just the trained,

55
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.030
how much the value changes each time you click the up or down arrow.

56
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:46.380
So we want tohave increments of north 0.5 and the change has to be and in Georgia So the

57
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.250
trick is you simply multiply the value that you want by 10.

58
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.860
And then when you read the value from the spend button to your tax box,

59
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.680
you then divide it by 10 and he set In our case,

60
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.950
you set the small change and I need to five.

61
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.870
So we've said the title is in the range 24.2 36.

62
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:17.760
So that's gonna be 2 40 and the max is gonna be 3 60 then the small change is going to be

63
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.350
five.

64
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.950
And when we read the value when we come to code in in the next video,

65
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.140
when we read the value from the spend button into the tax box,

66
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.750
we simply divide the current value by five.

67
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.350
The final thing we need to do is to make sure that the start in value of the spin button

68
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.050
matches that off the textbooks.

69
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.500
So we just go down to value.

70
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.680
And we set that 2 30 you know?

71
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.550
Or rather,

72
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.350
300 forgot about the multi blown by 10 300.

73
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.650
Let's then do this one.

74
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.250
So let's do the value first.

75
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.810
1 60 No,

76
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.650
we can't value first because obviously we have the default min and Max in place.

77
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.550
So let's do goes first,

78
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:24.220
Max 2 40 men,

79
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:36.110
1 40 and now we can do value 1 60 Okay,

80
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.850
the final thing will need to do is to set up these fellas,

81
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.520
and when you're working with radio buttons or option buttons as they called in B B A two

82
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.050
things to bear in mind.

83
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.480
First,

84
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.150
do you want to set a default value?

85
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.130
So let's say in our case,

86
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.450
we want five by eight to be the default,

87
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.870
so we'll just switch on value.

88
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.350
True,

89
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.980
and that selects the radio button,

90
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.250
and they can obviously leave it as the default.

91
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.250
Change it to one of the other three.

92
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.850
The second thing you'll need to do is to give all the radio buttons a group name,

93
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.470
and that makes them behave as a group on this occasion will get away with it because Theo

94
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.950
nly radio buttons on the form are all related.

95
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.430
But if we were to introduce something else,

96
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.750
for example,

97
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:34.780
let's just click here and do Prince,

98
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.930
so this is no longer a size.

99
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.920
This is something else on its control.

100
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.850
Drag that and make it a book.

101
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.650
When we test it,

102
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.450
If I click on Prince,

103
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.930
you'll see that my book size is now de selected.

104
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:05.840
So all of these are behaving as one group because they all have the same default group Name

105
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.220
off blank.

106
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.810
In other words,

107
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:08.950
no group name it all.

108
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.650
So the way around that is,

109
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.950
you select the whole set of radio buttons or option buttons that are related,

110
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.770
and you give them a common group name,

111
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:27.950
so these can now be called book size and these temporary ones that I put in there.

112
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.880
Let's just call them Ah,

113
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.650
medium.

114
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.190
So now,

115
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:42.550
because they've got different group names when I test them these four behaviors a group and

116
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.150
these two behaviors a completely separate group.

117
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.530
Okay,

118
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:52.250
so we can now get rid of out to Kim pre radio buttons,

119
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.440
and hopefully that's given you a flavor off how you work with use of forms and how you

120
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.370
create that various controls.

121
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.190
Obviously,

122
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.150
we haven't covered everything that user forms gonna do,

123
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.450
but we will create other use of forms during the course off these tutorials.

124
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.940
So for the moment,

125
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.650
let's save our changes.

126
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.320
And in the next video,

127
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.610
we'll move on to look at adding code to control the way that the user for allows

128
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.350
interaction with the user.

129
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:38.200
Applying attributes such as font and text color to the user form itself allows you to

130
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.710
change the default attributes of all form controls that you subsequently create.

131
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:53.900
The locked property is used to prevent a user from changing the value of the control to

132
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.750
create a multi line textbooks,

133
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.830
as well as making the control several lines deep.

134
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.100
Multi line property must be set to truth,

135
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:09.350
the value property can be used to set a default value for text boxes,

136
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:18.110
combo boxes and spin buns to activate a check box or option button by default,

137
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.460
set its value property to truth.

138
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:28.670
The group named Property is used to ensure that eat set of option buttons created on the

139
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.380
form behaves as a distinct group.
