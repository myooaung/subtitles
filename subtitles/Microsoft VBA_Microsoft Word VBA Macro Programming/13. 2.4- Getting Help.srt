00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,460
When you're creating your word macro solutions,

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,250
you're obviously going to get stuck from time to time.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,010
In this video,

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,660
we'll discuss some of the strategies that you could use to find help on Microsoft Word.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,770
The topics.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:31,730
There are five main tools that you have at your disposal when you're getting help.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,650
Onward Lee B.

8
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:32,850
A.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,870
First of all,

10
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,650
we have the Internet,

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,600
so Web searches.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,190
I'm not going to say very much about this.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,160
It's such a part of our lives nowadays that if you're stuck on something,

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,020
you go to the Web and you type in precisely what you're stuck on.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,090
The more precise,

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,650
the better,

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,950
and you get some help.

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,850
So if you're writing a macro from scratch and you're not quite sure how to start,

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,750
you could basically do a search on exactly what you're trying to achieve with the back row

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,750
,

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,340
and you'll find people who have had similar requirements and look at some of the solutions

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,310
that they found again.

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,830
If you're stuck on a particular problem,

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,980
an error message perhaps keeps cropping up.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,550
Every time you try and run a macro,

26
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,440
you type in the exact error message that you'll get in do a Web search on that and look at

27
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,050
solutions that have been suggested for people who had the same problem.

28
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,290
Then,

29
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,730
of course,

30
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,980
we've got the built in help reference.

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,410
Next,

32
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,850
we have a facility called the Object Browser.

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:48,110
This is access from the visual basic editor and gives you a structured presentation off all

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,210
of the elements,

35
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,410
which constitute word Vehbi,

36
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,750
eh?

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,750
Next we have the macro recorder,

38
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,310
and this provides an excellent method off Generating Co.

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,350
Just to get you started so that you can actually see what things are called.

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,110
One of the problems of using the help reference or using the object browser as we'll see in

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,550
a moment,

42
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,000
is basically that it's quite difficult sometimes.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,370
Didn't know what the lanes of the elements that you're trying to manipulate.

44
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,170
What's it actually called?

45
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,450
I can't look it up because I didn't want it school.

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,850
So this is where the back Rory Cup record it becomes by useful.

47
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,800
And then finally,

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,850
we have a nice feature called intelli Sense.

49
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,450
This is something that's built into the visual basic editor,

50
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:42,890
which anticipates what you're about to do and displays in context help,

51
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,120
which you can then use instead of having to type everything himself,

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,450
Rely purely on your memory,

53
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,950
so Web searches.

54
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm not going to say anything more about.

55
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,560
As I said,

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,250
It's basically something that is inherent to everything we to in this world now.

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,580
Ah,

58
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,650
so let's move on to the help reference.

59
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,680
And of course,

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,450
we're not talking about the general word help which we've got here.

61
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,840
Um,

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,450
so I was closed that down.

63
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,700
We specifically want word vb a help.

64
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,560
So we need to go into developer visual basic or,

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,030
of course,

66
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,700
press old F 11 the keyboard shortcut on from here.

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,950
We either choose help.

68
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,850
Microsoft Visual Basic for applications help.

69
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,850
Well,

70
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,360
we click here or,

71
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,820
of course,

72
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,010
repressed F one by default.

73
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,080
The help will appear online.

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,340
If you spent a lot of time off line when your code in you might find it convenient to

75
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:55,520
download the word 2013 db a reference and then we click on download on activate theme

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,880
specific VB,

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,600
a reference that we want to download,

78
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,750
assuming you're happy to use the online reference.

79
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,950
As I said,

80
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,640
the main problem that people find is where do I start?

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,820
What are we're actually looking for First of all,

82
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,910
obviously start with word 2013 development reference,

83
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,840
and he's got three sections.

84
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,630
Concepts.

85
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:24,000
How do I and reference the concepts contained topics on that useful things that people

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,150
often do at the sort of introductory and intermediate level.

87
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,660
Let's say,

88
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,230
for example,

89
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,180
you want some help or format in text.

90
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:40,950
You might start off by reading this section on the pliant format into text so as you go

91
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,450
through,

92
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:47,560
it will give you a brief description of each technique and then give you some sample code,

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,750
which economically copy and uses a starting point for your own code.

94
00:04:51,750 --> 00:05:00,250
Let's just go back to the development reference.

95
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,950
Then we got How do I?

96
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,180
This is a similar Siris of topics,

97
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:15,320
but they are more advanced says You can see they are referred to things like content

98
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,120
controls,

99
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,650
building blocks and connected to databases.

100
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,130
And then thirdly,

101
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,050
we have the reference itself,

102
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,590
and because it is comprehensive,

103
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:34,300
obviously it has on awful lot of things that you will never actually need or use in your

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,750
coded.

105
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,560
At stake is an example.

106
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,600
The front object.

107
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,860
Let's say you're working with character formatted,

108
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,330
so here you will see you have three ways of proceeding,

109
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,250
you can look at every piece of syntax,

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,150
which is fond members.

111
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,700
Here,

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:05,950
you've got links to everything that could be done with the foreign objects or,

113
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,850
if you want to focus either on properties which are essentially attributes that you can set

114
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:11,850
.

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,550
And if we go back to the word interface in the home tab.

116
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,150
Obviously,

117
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,490
the found object equates to the front group on the ribbon.

118
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,260
All of the character formatting attributes that we might said,

119
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,750
such as the font color,

120
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,850
the forms name the phone size.

121
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,650
All of those are essentially properties.

122
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,550
So when we click here,

123
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:48,750
everything that we see is equivalent to one of those options.

124
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:55,530
If we now just go back to the forms,

125
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,150
object,

126
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,620
by contrast,

127
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,650
the methods,

128
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,850
our actions that you can perform on the front.

129
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:06,740
And,

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,240
as you can see,

131
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,000
that's not a huge amount of them grow and shrink,

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,530
probably the two most frequently used in this list and,

133
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,190
of course,

134
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,550
their equivalent to click in on these two elements.

135
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,960
So a method,

136
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,950
basically is an action that you can perform on the object.

137
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,950
So if you think about it,

138
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,580
if we compare,

139
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,110
grow and shrink to size.

140
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,790
Size is a specific attributes.

141
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,550
Grow is an action.

142
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,750
It's a similar thing to the contrast of saying that the child is four feet six inches tall

143
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:44,750
.

144
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,250
That would be basically a property of the child,

145
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,750
as opposed to saying the child has grown by three inches since I last saw her.

146
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,350
Okay,

147
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,220
so that's Ah,

148
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:02,570
quick overview of using the reference from cold,

149
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,180
if you like.

150
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,670
In other words,

151
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,050
you just jump in and you navigate through.

152
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,520
This method tends to be the hardest.

153
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:08,840
Because,

154
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,410
obviously,

155
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,730
as we've said,

156
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,780
the main problem is,

157
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,720
where do I start?

158
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,050
What are things called?

159
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,350
What am I looking for?

160
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,250
So let's just close that.

161
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,270
Let's now have a look at the object browser.

162
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,940
So again,

163
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,050
developer visual basic and it's under the view menu.

164
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,350
It's structured in exactly the same way as the help reference that we just saw,

165
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,450
so we would start by choosing word as the library.

166
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:43,290
Then we have the same west that we saw so we could go down to funds as we did the help

167
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:43,910
reference,

168
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:51,250
and here we can see all of the members off fund.

169
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,350
So here's the grow method.

170
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,250
You can see that methods have this green icon,

171
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,420
whereas property have this old index card icon with the hand holding the index card so we

172
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,190
can see here.

173
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,630
If you want to make something bold,

174
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,950
it's gonna be the front object on the bold property off the front object.

175
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,230
So what the Object browser shows you?

176
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,950
Basically,

177
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,750
it's simply structure.

178
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,030
It shows you where a property is or where a method is in the context of what's called the

179
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,700
word object model.

180
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,350
In other words,

181
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,200
every piece of syntax,

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
which it's legitimate.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,760
Inward.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Vehbi,

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,450
eh?

186
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,640
What are the V B A equivalents to each of the elements within word.

187
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,450
So as you work in the word interface,

188
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,760
using all the options on the different ribbons,

189
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,880
the Object browser basically tells you what the equivalent vb A's to each of these commands

190
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,010
that we have in the word ribbon.

191
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,150
But what it doesn't give you a course is much help.

192
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,650
So having isolated whereabouts within the structure of V B.

193
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,450
A A particular elements lives.

194
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,510
If you want,

195
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,350
we'll help on it.

196
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,450
You're then press F one or click on this help.

197
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,550
It has to be this help button,

198
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,650
as opposed to this one.

199
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,120
If you click on this one,

200
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,910
even if you have something highlighted in the Object browser,

201
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,350
you're always going to end up on the starting screen that we saw earlier.

202
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:29,270
So if you want to get contextual help on the currently selected elements,

203
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:35,860
you either press at one or you click on this icon sighs you can see with now on a

204
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,250
description of the font,

205
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:45,080
not bald property on DWI can see here basically that we need to put any expression that

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,350
refers to a formed object,

207
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,490
and then we can set it to true false or W d undefined.

208
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:02,490
I say we can set it because here the help reference confirms that it's a read write

209
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:02,990
property.

210
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,510
In other words,

211
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,950
that property which weaken both check to see what it currently is and modify.

212
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:13,730
Then further down.

213
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:18,850
We've got a quick example off using the fund stop bold property.

214
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,080
Okay,

215
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,550
so that's the Object browser.

216
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,170
And as I said with both of those,

217
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,600
both the help reference in the Object browser.

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,390
The key issue is if you're starting to write Vehbi,

219
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:34,650
eh?

220
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,620
What am I looking for?

221
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,400
What are things called?

222
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,510
So this is where the macro recorder becomes so useful.

223
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,250
Whatever you're trying to do with your VB a code inward,

224
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:52,290
you can actually record yourself performing that step most of the time.

225
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,630
This won't actually write the back row for you,

226
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,550
but what it will give you is code that you can use as a starting point.

227
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:05,450
So let's take a couple of examples or using the macro recorder.

228
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,050
Let's say that we want to find out how to,

229
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,890
as part of our macro,

230
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,450
how to delete the third qallab of the currently selected table.

231
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,950
So let's just insert a quick table,

232
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,540
give it a few rows and columns.

233
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,750
Say this many.

234
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,680
Let's just put some text in so you know which call him is which.

235
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,150
So I'm just gonna put one,

236
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:40,520
234 So now we simply go to the developer tab and we record a back room.

237
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,150
We click on record macron.

238
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,690
We won't bother giving in the name,

239
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,050
which is using it as a help feature,

240
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,750
and we won't save it in the normal template for the same reason we'll just save it in this

241
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,750
current document.

242
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:02,460
So now we can't do any clicking while you're recording the macro you can click on a cell,

243
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,250
for example.

244
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,050
So what we need to do is to make sure that we're in column three.

245
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,250
And the logical way to do that is to use the keyboard shortcut.

246
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,250
We're going to the first column.

247
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,650
A man just used the tap key twice to go to the third column.

248
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,340
And,

249
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:21,750
of course,

250
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,470
if you then use the delete column,

251
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:23,950
come on,

252
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,650
you must then delete the third column.

253
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,750
So the keyboard shortcut for going to the first column in a table,

254
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,350
its old home.

255
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,850
It doesn't really matter which row of the table I happened to be on.

256
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,550
I now know that I am in the first column,

257
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,350
so now I just press the tab key twice.

258
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,350
This means I now must be in the third column on any road.

259
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,530
I dont goto layout all the options in the ribbon or find while you're recording America.

260
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,350
It's just the click in within the document that's not permitted,

261
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,150
and I go to delete two's daily columns back interest of the third row.

262
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,080
That's all I wanted to check,

263
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,450
so I go to developer and stop recording.

264
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:17,250
I could go to visual basic and retrieve the macro when you record a macro model is created

265
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,250
,

266
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,850
it's usually called new back rose.

267
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,950
We double click to open it,

268
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,150
and there's our code.

269
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,650
So here is where I pressed Walt home.

270
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,950
Then I press the tab once and twice,

271
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:41,950
and finally I chose to delete the current collar so I can now copy these lines.

272
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,540
Typically,

273
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,750
I'd sort of take them out.

274
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,680
Andi,

275
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,050
slot them into the macro that I'm actually created.

276
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:56,450
Let's look at another example of how you can use the macro recorded to check syntax.

277
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,450
Let's I want to do some work on format in and page set up,

278
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,180
and I really want to get ah,

279
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:11,510
handle on some of the since accidental need to use to prepare a report and make sure that

280
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,250
it's formatted in the right way.

281
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:19,450
Let's again go into developer and recorder macro in the current document.

282
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,850
Now let's go back to the home tab,

283
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,050
and rather than chosen individual components,

284
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,910
the most trick you can use is wherever there's a dialogue available,

285
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,600
you simply record yourself open in the dialogue and clicking.

286
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,150
OK,

287
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,150
so if we want to know everything about fonts,

288
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,360
you just click on the launch button here,

289
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,140
which brings up the front dialogue.

290
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,590
Don't need to change anything.

291
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,160
We just click.

292
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,650
OK,

293
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,630
let's do the same for paragraph.

294
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,800
Click on The Lordship Barton up comes the paragraph.

295
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,490
Dialogue.

296
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:56,950
We click.

297
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:57,450
OK,

298
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,600
then we wanted to do some work on page layout.

299
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,910
So we go across the that again.

300
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,120
We've got the laundry Barton,

301
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,150
which brings up the paid set up dialogue we click okay with without making any changes.

302
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,470
Then we stopped recorded.

303
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,640
Now,

304
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,150
when we go back to visual basic,

305
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,350
you'll see we've now got macro.

306
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,380
To added,

307
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,850
it was the first on the recorded in his back road to and look what it's done,

308
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,530
so we didn't actually choose anything.

309
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,610
But simply by open in the dialogue and clicking,

310
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,150
OK,

311
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,870
all the want properties are now available,

312
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,650
so whatever it is we're trying to do,

313
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,960
we can find it in this list on try and get a handle on how it works.

314
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,090
Similarly,

315
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,350
we scroll further down.

316
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:53,200
We've got all of the paragraph formats in and the down still everything to do with page set

317
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,350
up.

318
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:00,140
So that technique is very useful just to sort of get a whole bunch of code that you can

319
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,150
then analyze,

320
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,160
as well as simply looking at the code.

321
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,150
You've now got a context,

322
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,160
but you can use as a starting point when you use in the help reference and when you use in

323
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,110
the object browser.

324
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:19,700
So let's look at how you can go from code to help reference or from code to object browser

325
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,260
in context.

326
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,930
First of all,

327
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:28,350
let's say you want to just verify how vb a handles for names.

328
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,590
Is this a special piece of text or can I put anything I like?

329
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,850
How do I know what to put?

330
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,530
So basically,

331
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,220
you highlight these in tactical elements question in this case,

332
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,250
by doing that,

333
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,190
I'm I light in dot form stopped name because this structure,

334
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,260
as we'll see later,

335
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,740
basically saves me type in selection,

336
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,160
not fond at the start of each line.

337
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,660
So it's equivalent to have in selection dot for dot name selection dot for dot size

338
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,550
etcetera.

339
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,450
So when I select dot name,

340
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,170
I'm effectively selected form stop made.

341
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,700
If I want the help reference at this point,

342
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,660
I can simply press F one.

343
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:15,450
I can't think of anything I can do in the men used to get to the right place as we've seen

344
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:15,450
,

345
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,550
these will take me to the start in page rather than the context that I'm after.

346
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:27,610
So I press F one on the keyboard and up comes to help specifically on the full name

347
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,220
property.

348
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,780
It tells me here it's read,

349
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,040
write,

350
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,160
which means I can check it and also modify it.

351
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,260
But it's a strange so that this means it can be anything.

352
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,470
So,

353
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,660
having verified that,

354
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,660
I could say Go along to the home tab,

355
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,550
choose a particular forms and simply copy the name of the font as a string.

356
00:18:51,550 --> 00:19:00,500
Then I can go back to the visual basic editor pace that inside the quotation marks because

357
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,890
I now know that this is simply a strain.

358
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:05,550
I know that that's gonna work,

359
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,730
that that line of code will change the current selection to back,

360
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,210
formed that Mike and do exactly the same thing with the object browser.

361
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,690
Let's I just wanted to get an idea of the structure of where the font dot name actually

362
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,760
fits into the general scheme of things.

363
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,720
Again.

364
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,660
I select dot for dot name and instead of President one.

365
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,160
What you do is to right click in twos definition,

366
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,550
and this is also a good way of checking whether something exists.

367
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,260
If you type something and you're not sure whether it's legit,

368
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,930
right,

369
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,610
click it and choose definition.

370
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,850
And if you get an error,

371
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,050
you know that it's not the JIT.

372
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,450
So when I choose that up comes the object browser in context,

373
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,510
the font object is selected.

374
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,610
All the members of displayed and the name property is highlighted.

375
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,670
Okay,

376
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,720
so as you can see,

377
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,710
the macro recorder is a really useful way or actually just getting yourself started and

378
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,570
getting to know what things are called.

379
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:19,720
What the various components within Microsoft Word or called when you're automating those

380
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,850
particular elements.

381
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:27,350
And then the final thing I wanted to say as a help feature Waas intelli sense.

382
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,260
This kicks in basically when you're right in your own back roads.

383
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,960
So let's say we want to create a back row between these two.

384
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,760
For example,

385
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:46,780
Mrs Cool it test and let's say that we want to use selection,

386
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,450
not forms,

387
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,660
as we did in the macro that we've just recorded.

388
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,120
So if I start typing myself with selection thoughts,

389
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,160
can you see that as soon as I type the dot.

390
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,850
All of the members of selection are displayed,

391
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,870
so I know that whatever it is,

392
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,760
I type has to be something in that list.

393
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:13,350
And as soon as I start typing it so f o is all I need to type to get font to be highlighted

394
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,620
as soon as it is highlighted by then press the tab key.

395
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,000
This boat saves me time.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,160
And,

397
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,670
of course,

398
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,390
with longer syntax,

399
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,160
it's going to save me typos.

400
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,980
Then let's say we want to do exactly what we did in very recording.

401
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,630
We want to change the fault name.

402
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:38,050
So again I typed dot and what I'm seeing now is everything to do with funds.

403
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,450
All of the members of the fault object.

404
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,850
Just as I saw a moment ago,

405
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,450
all of the members of this election object.

406
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,110
So we said it was dot name again.

407
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,350
I've just typed and a and then press tab equals.

408
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,330
Then we know it goes in quotes,

409
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,030
and I think it's still on the clipboard.

410
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,410
I have a copy anything since not space that in close quotes,

411
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,090
let's have a look at another example of intelli sense.

412
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,130
So let's I want to change the color of the phone.

413
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:15,120
So I type in dark color and I can see from the list that it's gonna be color index.

414
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,590
So I press the tab key.

415
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,200
Just lock that in and watch what happens when nights I've equals.

416
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,160
You'll notice that I get a list of options,

417
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,550
and these basically are called in Yuma rations,

418
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,950
which is equivalent to making a choice,

419
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,950
usually in one of the dialogue boxes.

420
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,190
All of these integrations start with W.

421
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,590
D.

422
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,690
So let's I want Dark Blue.

423
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,050
It was gonna be W d dark blue And again,

424
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,160
I can look these up so occasionally when you take the equal sign,

425
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,750
nothing comes up.

426
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,450
So you have to do it from memory.

427
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,670
But to check that you've got it right,

428
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,760
you can just highlight it.

429
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,160
I'm going to definition if it exists,

430
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,850
the object explorers displayed,

431
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:08,650
and you can check all of the different options again to find them in the list when you're

432
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,450
in the word library.

433
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,440
As I said,

434
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,540
they will start with W.

435
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:12,850
D.

436
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,950
And then it's just a case of guessing what they're called.

437
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:20,050
So these ones are called WD color index,

438
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:26,870
and you'll find there are a lot of these in the word interface in terms of what they quit,

439
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,060
too.

440
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,550
If we go back into the home tab,

441
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,080
look at paragraph,

442
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,850
for example,

443
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,550
and take alignment.

444
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,120
So here I've got centered right and justified.

445
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,900
Wherever you've got choices like this in the word interface,

446
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,560
it never uses simply strings that's too much room for error.

447
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,210
It uses thes W.

448
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,850
D in Yuma rations.

449
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,510
Onda entirely sense provides a great way of checking the So if I go back in,

450
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,350
for example,

451
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,550
let's say we want to send to the text mail.

452
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,550
We'll just do another with blood,

453
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,260
which is a technique very favored by the macro recorder.

454
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,550
Let's leave it blank line as well.

455
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,760
So this will be with selection got paragraph formats.

456
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,140
And as you can see,

457
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,660
I've just type p a r than I press tab.

458
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,660
And with then if I move back up inside dots,

459
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,450
a l alignment of it comes and I press tab.

460
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,960
And then again,

461
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,020
when I suppress equals here these items they all start with W.

462
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,450
D.

463
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:41,760
And as soon as I start typing center happens to be the 1st 1 So I just pressed tab to pop

464
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,050
it in,

465
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:49,780
so you'll find that using intelli sense is a great way as your type in your code of getting

466
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,460
interactive in context.

467
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,760
Help,

468
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,450
uh,

469
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,390
would saves you keystrokes and saves you typos.

470
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,850
And as we go through the course,

471
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:04,280
I also mentioned ways in which you can maximize the occasions on which this intelligence

472
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,350
will actually kick in.

473
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,050
Just save you having to rely on the old memory all the time.

474
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,420
Okay,

475
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,080
so that's about it for this tutorial.

476
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,600
That's an overview off the five different techniques that your use as you're trying to get

477
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,590
help to speed up the process off,

478
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,050
creating your back rows and automated Microsoft Word.

479
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:38,580
The macro recorder is an excellent tool for identifying the names of word elements,

480
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,710
which you want to manipulate with your BB a code to get help on a particular object,

481
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,720
property or method from the code window.

482
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:56,740
I like the appropriate syntax element and press F one to navigate to a particular object,

483
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,890
property or method or to a word W d in,

484
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,690
um oration.

485
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:09,900
Highlight the appropriate syntax element in the code window and then press have one to get

486
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,200
help on a particular object,

487
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,660
property or method from the object explorer.

488
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,450
Navigate to the appropriate method or property that President one
