00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.020
in this video,

2
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.550
we'll look at how you assign a keyboard shortcut to a macro.

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.040
Now.

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.660
Naturally,

5
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.550
word has a lot of built in shortcuts itself.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.580
So it's important that when you assign your own keyboard shortcuts,

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.960
you avoid clashing with words many built in shortcuts.

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.950
The macro to which will be assigning a short cut is the one that we recorded two videos ago

9
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.950
.

10
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:57.900
So we'll start by activating the template or added that contains it now.

11
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.750
Windows 2007.

12
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.660
You got to the quick access toolbar and choose more commands.

13
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.160
Then,

14
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.350
at the bottom of the screen,

15
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:17.980
click on the customized button next to keyboard shortcuts on Windows 2010.

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.050
In 2013 go to the file menu Jews Options and then click on customized ribbon.

17
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.690
At the bottom of the dialogue.

18
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.540
You'll see keyboard shortcuts with the same customized button in the top left of the

19
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.620
customized keyboard.

20
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.850
Dialogue in the category section.

21
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.850
Scroll down to find back Rose.

22
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.350
Then on the right,

23
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.850
you'll see our macro listed next week in the box marked Press New short Cut key.

24
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.930
And of course,

25
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.470
what we want to do here is to come up with a shortcut,

26
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.250
which we know is available.

27
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.150
Let's do something that we know is not available.

28
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.720
So,

29
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.580
for example,

30
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.280
control,

31
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.750
See?

32
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.970
Yes,

33
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.450
you can see it tells us this is a sign to edit copy.

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.550
So let's delete this.

35
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:20.650
A simple way of avoiding these classes is to use old in combination with two letters,

36
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.150
so this may not be as fast.

37
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.760
A keyboard shortcut is some of the built in ones,

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220
but it's still useful,

39
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.050
and it does avoid the possibility of clash in with the built in shortcuts.

40
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.170
So our macro is called cleanup text.

41
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.050
We could therefore use Walt.

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.150
See you.

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.110
So we hold down the old key and instead of press Inches,

44
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.770
one letter,

45
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.950
press two,

46
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.250
the key thing that we're looking for is that it's currently unassigned.

47
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.660
Once we're happy with that,

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.860
we click on the assigned button on that short cut,

49
00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.580
then gets listed as the short cut associate ID with our macro That's close.

50
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.550
Click OK,

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.650
and then let's test it.

52
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:15.250
So let's go into the getting started folder and use the file that we've used before.

53
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:36.410
So now we press old see you and this runs out macro to assign a keyboard shortcut to a

54
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.270
macro inward 2007.

55
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:50.050
Choose more commands from the customized Quick Access Toolbar menu in where 2010 in 2013

56
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.310
which is file options,

57
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.680
customize ribbon to avoid clashes with other keyboard commands.

58
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.610
It is a good idea to use a short cut.

59
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.680
It combines the old key with two key strokes.
