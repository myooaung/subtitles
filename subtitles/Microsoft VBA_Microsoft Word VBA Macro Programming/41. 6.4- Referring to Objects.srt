1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,950
I haven't had a look at working with events and properties in this video.

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,700
Well,

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,990
look at the Centre Axe for home in in on individual objects.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,500
The basic syntax involves referring to the object,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,380
either by its name or by its position within the collection.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,780
However,

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,770
as we'll see,

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,130
there are one or two other sent tactical variations,

9
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,280
which it's worth discussing.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:48,450
Let's open up the Section six folder and then inside that let's open up 0601 tables.

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,450
Then we can go across the developer document template and attach.

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:05,270
Then let's work our way into the Exercises folder and attach our word VB a training

13
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:05,950
template.

14
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,450
When we then go into visual basic,

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,350
we have access to all the modules in the template.

16
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,850
Let's just scroll down to the bottom here,

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:32,170
and I sat in a macron on Let's simply cool it reference in objects and then let's switch

18
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,650
across to procedure view.

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,750
The normal method of referring to a document is to use its name as an index.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,790
The reason for this is that it's quite difficult to know what position the document will

21
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,450
occupy within the documents collection.

22
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,530
The documents collection,

23
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,000
of course,

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,550
is all the documents that are currently open inward,

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,970
and it's the order in which documents are open or created that determines their position

26
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,040
within the collection.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,190
So you'll normally only identify documents numerically when you're looking through all of

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,450
them,

29
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,250
perhaps making modifications to each one or examining each one in some way.

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,950
So let's say we want to create a reference to the document we've just opened.

31
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,460
We could declare a variable doc tables as documents,

32
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,450
and then to identify it.

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,850
We would use its name so set Doc tables,

34
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,960
equals documents and then in brackets and double quotes,

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,150
we would put its name.

36
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,610
That's just co p it.

37
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:59,560
And then we contest our code by saying a mystery box and I won't bother put in the

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,050
perimeter name because I'm going to take this out in a moment.

39
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,160
Stock tables dot tables don't count.

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:21,150
Family should get 12 tables when working with objects within the document,

41
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,270
such as tables,

42
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,210
paragraphs,

43
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:23,700
words,

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,410
etcetera again,

45
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,150
there is always a possibility that you'll need to look through them,

46
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,050
but the norm is usually that you use a numeric method of index in them.

47
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,450
So in the case of the tables,

48
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,250
the number of each table is set up by its position within its container.

49
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,260
As you probably remember,

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,650
each table is headed by a month,

51
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,650
and so obviously the January table will be the first,

52
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,950
and the December table will be the last.

53
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,750
Let's put that to the test.

54
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:09,750
So we say Doc tables the tables and then brackets 12 dots select when we run in our code.

55
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,820
If we move back to the document,

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,050
you'll see it selected the 12th and last table.

57
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:27,980
Let's just de select it if we weren't sure what the last table waas and we still wanted to

58
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,610
target it and we could use the Count property of the Tables collection.

59
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,250
Since the first item is one,

60
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,220
then,

61
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,920
however many tables there are,

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,360
which is what Count tells us must also be the index of the last one.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,820
So here we could say,

64
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,050
Doc tables,

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,050
no cables,

66
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,950
not count.

67
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,780
If we were going to use this number for something else,

68
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,150
we would put it into a variable and then used the variable thereafter.

69
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,120
Okay,

70
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,740
so let's delete this select statement and let's just finish off.

71
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,800
Our macro will say that we want to insert some text in the tables correspondent of the last

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,300
month in each quarter,

73
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,730
and we want to complete all four columns.

74
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,450
So we've got our head ins and we want to actually write some text in each of these cells.

75
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,740
So you want to put in a report name,

76
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,680
Author due dates,

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,770
percent complete.

78
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,650
Zero and departments.

79
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,750
Let's say I t.

80
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:40,750
So the first thing is we'll need a counter to control the Lupin.

81
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,250
And because we don't want to process every single item,

82
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,150
a numeric counter will be best.

83
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:57,400
So then I as integer and then we can create a for loop fel.

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:06,590
I equals three by either third month to 12 and we then need to go up in drums of three.

85
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:15,720
So Step three Next I then let's create a range variable for ourselves.

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:29,430
So let's dim RMG data as range and we can now inside the loop set our energy data equal to

87
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,150
God.

88
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,150
Tables don't tables.

89
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,650
I So we're living through a war the rather than tables.

90
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,350
Then we want the second road not rose to.

91
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:49,800
And let's target the first cell don't sells one and finally don't range.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,420
What we're interested in here is the text inside the range and then the text inside the

93
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,950
range next to that and so forth.

94
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,600
So to target the text inside that cell,

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:10,770
we can now say orangey data text equals on.

96
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,750
Let's say it's going to be quarter 1/4 to etcetera.

97
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:22,010
So we have quarter m percent.

98
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,490
I mean,

99
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,490
I want 123 and four,

100
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,900
as opposed to a 369 and 12.

101
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,660
We can get that by divided.

102
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:43,910
I buy three and let's finish off with the word report that takes care of the text inside

103
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,590
the first cell in the second cell.

104
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,430
We want the author and let's use application.

105
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,850
Don't use the name for that.

106
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,150
So we've got our NGDATA set to the first cell,

107
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,750
and we now want to right into the second cell.

108
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,340
Fortunately,

109
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,850
the range object has a special method which enables us to do that.

110
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,950
It's the next method,

111
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,750
so we can simply say orangey data don't next.

112
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,270
And then we've got two parameters,

113
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,380
both optional.

114
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,550
But the charity will use both of them,

115
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,970
so the unit will be W.

116
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,450
D.

117
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,300
So and the count.

118
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,440
Well,

119
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:30,940
of course,

120
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,870
for the 1st 1 B one,

121
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,410
and I put a space.

122
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,750
But I've now realized that we haven't finished the statement.

123
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:46,150
So we will need to have brackets around these parameters so that we can now say not text

124
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,580
equals application,

125
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,970
Don't use the name.

126
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,250
And then we've got three more cells to do.

127
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,050
We have date,

128
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,250
do percent complete and department.

129
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:09,550
So we'll just copy this and increased account.

130
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:20,390
So here we want the day to do.

131
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,970
And let's say it's gonna be 30 days from the current date so we can generate it by saying

132
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,550
format now plus 30.

133
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,150
So now will give us the current date.

134
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,350
And then we had 30 days to it,

135
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:48,250
and then the format can simply be de de slash m m slash y y next.

136
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,850
We want percentage complete at this point in time,

137
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,580
it 0%.

138
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,330
And finally we have department,

139
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,680
which we said we were going to make I t.

140
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,250
So let's test our code.

141
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,150
You save and then run.

142
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,050
So there's November,

143
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,850
September gin and March.

144
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:27,850
Just one last thing to mention before we close this topic.

145
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,150
And that's a couple of special objects that you can use which refer to document objects.

146
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,020
First of all,

147
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,890
we have the active document,

148
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,750
which is self explanatory.

149
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,120
It's the document at the forefront in the Microsoft word interface.

150
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,950
And then we have this document,

151
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,330
which is a special object,

152
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,550
refer into the document that contains the macro that's currently running.

153
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,260
So let's write a quick macro,

154
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,050
which will test to see whether the macro is running in the active document.

155
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,590
Well,

156
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:14,880
not so I'm just gonna go back to full model view and then some 060 full be That's cool it

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:26,600
active documents and we can simply say it's active.

158
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:36,360
Document is this is a special key word that you use when you're comparing two objects you

159
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,010
can't be used.

160
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,620
For example,

161
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,060
on regular data variables,

162
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,800
that would be an equal sign.

163
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,750
It's purely for either document variables or document object references as me using here.

164
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,090
So if active document is this document,

165
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,550
then MSD box.

166
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:13,030
You're going current macro run in and active documents else chemistry box your name current

167
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:27,960
micro run in and another document and if so,

168
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,950
at the moment,

169
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,050
the active documents is tables.

170
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,140
And of course,

171
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,550
our macro is running in GCS word VB a training.

172
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,060
So when we run it,

173
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:55,770
we should get the second the elf that this document object is very useful because it means

174
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:13,050
that you can use that code in a different document and it will still run to reference.

175
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,590
An object within the collection by name used the syntax name of collection and in

176
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,580
