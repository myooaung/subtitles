1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,610
so far we've been created.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:19,100
Code designed to be executed as and when required in this section will shift our attention

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,530
to a different style of coded where the code executes automatically based on events that

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,450
take place in the world environment.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,320
This is called event programming,

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,550
and in this first video,

7
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,150
well,

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,370
just get an overview of how event programming works.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:47,750
Let's go into the Exercises folder and then into the Section seven folder,

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,050
and here you'll find a file called Overview.

11
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,400
Let's go inside this.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,750
It's simply a blank macro enable document.

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:06,370
So let's go to the visual basic editor on what we've been doing up till now is creating a

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,950
module or using a module that was already there.

15
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,990
And then inside the module,

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,700
we place outside procedure,

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,650
which automatically is treated as a macro.

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,650
We then run the macro as and when we need it.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,080
Events up procedures.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,590
A slightly different the first way have created them is to go inside the this document

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,130
object,

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,450
which you'll find inside every project.

23
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,650
For every document that you open in Microsoft Word.

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,340
You can either double click on that this document object Well,

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,010
you can right click and shoes view code to create some procedures,

26
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:53,760
you can either type them yourself or you could have them automatically generated for you at

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
least the shell,

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,820
obviously the code,

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,250
and you'll have to do yourself to do this.

30
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,990
You go to the object.

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,760
Drop down menu in the top left of the code window in twos.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,510
Document the default document event handler Document New is then generated for you

33
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,720
automatically to create some procedures for other events.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,730
Go to the procedure menu in the top,

35
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,250
right.

36
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:30,550
The other events relating to documents well open and clothes.

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,450
And obviously there's nothing to stop you creating these sub procedures completely manually

38
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:37,450
.

39
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,450
But these names have a special significance,

40
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,600
and these are the names that you have to use in your procedures in order to get your code

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,350
automatically to run when that particular event occurs.

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,720
Any code that you place in this some procedure will execute automatically when you close

43
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,610
this document.

44
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:03,950
If this document were a template when you close any documents based on that template,

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,020
the code will also run the document.

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,150
New sub procedure.

47
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,150
Apply specifically to templates.

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,920
Any code that you place inside this of procedure will run automatically when you create a

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,250
new document based on this template.

50
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,250
So let's test this functionality.

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,880
Currently,

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,350
we're working on a document rather than a template.

53
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,250
So this saad procedure won't apply.

54
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:40,250
And all we want to do for the moment is to have a line of code which should be executes.

55
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:51,090
So I'm just gonna say MSG Books goodbye and hello.

56
00:03:51,090 --> 00:04:01,430
Although we can execute these sub procedures within the visual basic editor just to test

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,850
them from the user point of view,

58
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,350
it's really a case off these actions taken place document being closed,

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,150
the document being open or the document being closed.

60
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,700
So let's test that will close and up comes out Good bunny.

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,110
We click.

62
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,650
OK,

63
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,950
save our changes.

64
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,450
When we go back in,

65
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,240
up comes out.

66
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,150
Hello message.

67
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,610
Let's now save the document is a template,

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:48,650
so they will choose template.

69
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,290
And of course,

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,750
it has to be macro enabled.

71
00:04:51,750 --> 00:05:02,590
We'll go back to the Section seven folder and save visual basic.

72
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:19,750
We can now reinstate our new sub procedure and to test it,

73
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,950
we could close and save.

74
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:34,480
So it's open a template weaken right click into his open to create a new document Based on

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,150
the template,

76
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,370
we can either choose new well,

77
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,650
we can just double click on it.

78
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,350
Up comes at a message.

79
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,650
If we now save the file,

80
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,540
you'll notice it's an ordinary document.

81
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,500
It doesn't need to be macro enabled.

82
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:06,050
And when we close it,

83
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,850
there's a goodbye message when we open it,

84
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,840
that's how.

85
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,750
Hello message.

86
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,550
Let's go back into our macro enable document.

87
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:30,070
So that's a quick look at how you can add code,

88
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,550
which executes automatically inside the this document object.

89
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,190
Let's just close the code window and let's look at the other way of implemented event

90
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,850
programming.

91
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,350
This is via user forms.

92
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,050
As with models,

93
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,850
you can right click on a project and then choose insert user form.

94
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,500
Or,

95
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,990
of course,

96
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,160
you can go to the insert menu and she's using form.

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,750
From there on the standard toolbar,

98
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,210
there's 1/3 method you can just from the insert button.

99
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,850
Here you can choose years of full up comes a default user form,

100
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:12,440
and also the toolbox window pops up for you if you close it at any time,

101
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,390
like all the other floating windows,

102
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,550
you make it visible black owns of the View menu and he ages.

103
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,410
Toolbox.

104
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,500
The use of form is basically a sophisticated dialogue box in which you can create

105
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,040
functionality similar to that found in dialogue boxes that you use in the Microsoft word

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,850
environment.

107
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,050
You can add any of these controls to the user form,

108
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,750
and you're then able to add CO two Your user Fall,

109
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,070
which enables you to create interactivity so that as the user interacts with the various

110
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,650
control,

111
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:52,600
your code responds and makes changes to the use of form itself two variables to the

112
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,370
document and indeed to the Microsoft word environment.

113
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:03,300
So let's create a really simple user for and obviously we'll get more sophisticated as we

114
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,210
go through the different tutorials in this section.

115
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:14,740
Going hand in hand with the toolbox on the user for itself is the properties window on any

116
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,250
control that you click on.

117
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,850
You'll see the properties appear relations of that control.

118
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,870
So the moment we have no control,

119
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,350
you've just got the user form itself,

120
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,450
and we can start my name in the use of form.

121
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,520
We'll use a three letter prefix of fr m for the full unless is cool.

122
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,150
It frm basic.

123
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,200
From here,

124
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,440
we can change the caption.

125
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,950
This is the text is displayed at the top of the form,

126
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,700
so we'll say a basic user form.

127
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,820
And then we had our controls.

128
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,740
So I'm just going to add a label tag by clicking on the label tool on the toolbox and then

129
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,740
just by either clicking or dragon on the form itself that I can change the caption.

130
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,350
Either here or I could go back into the properties window,

131
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,220
make my changes there.

132
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,350
Whatever is convenient.

133
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:18,690
So let's just put please and your name and I'll just make that a bit wider and that a text

134
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,040
box,

135
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,280
which is the next control along insolence,

136
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,150
the user can enter that name.

137
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,050
And finally,

138
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,550
I'll add a button.

139
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,790
Come on,

140
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,250
button.

141
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,710
Can I just click in and changing the caption to continue?

142
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:53,400
Let's just put that a bit closer to its label Ventoux.

143
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,850
Handsome functionality.

144
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,750
I can start by name in each of the controls,

145
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:13,780
using a prefix so unused lbl full label l VL name txt for text box Txt name and C M D for

146
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,630
command button.

147
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:23,510
Next someone to put some code on this button so that when they click it,

148
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,250
the code will execute.

149
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,820
To do that,

150
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:33,510
I double click on the control itself and that opens the user full code window and gives me

151
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,810
the default event handler for a command button.

152
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,800
And since the click event is the default,

153
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,150
that's the one I want.

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,850
If it weren't,

155
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,750
I go to the procedure.

156
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:52,850
Drop down menu and choose a different procedure on the object drop down menu.

157
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,850
I have access to each of the objects on the user form,

158
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,350
including the use of form itself.

159
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,310
When I choose any of these,

160
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:09,210
the default event handler is automatically created and the other events available for that

161
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,880
control a displayed on the procedure Drop down menu.

162
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,610
So I don't actually need this.

163
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:21,780
I'll just get rid of it when the user clicks to continue button.

164
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
All I want to say is Hello,

165
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,750
followed by the name that they've entered.

166
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,910
So MSG box,

167
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:34,560
hello ampersand to refer to controls on their properties.

168
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,830
I can use a special keyword inside the use of form,

169
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,650
which is me,

170
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,650
and this refers to the user form itself.

171
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,760
I could also say FRM basic,

172
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,750
but if I then take the code and place it somewhere else inside a different form of the

173
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,650
different name.

174
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,620
The code won't work.

175
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,930
I'll need to change the name to master new form by using the keyword me wherever I use this

176
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,230
code inside of form,

177
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,090
it always refers to that form.

178
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,750
The form that contains it tends me.

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,450
So I'm looking inside of textbooks.

180
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,470
I know that text boxes always start with txt because that's my name in convention,

181
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,080
so assumes eyesight.

182
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
Txt There it is.

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,950
Tab in goes the name.

184
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:25,860
And then I put a dot as per usual to drill down inside the control on the property that I

185
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,200
want,

186
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,090
the one that contains the text that the user has typed inside the control is the value

187
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,550
property and that's it.

188
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,850
The final thing is,

189
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,450
how do I actually make the user form itself visible?

190
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,530
Because this code will only execute when they click the button.

191
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,150
If they haven't seen the form,

192
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,450
they're not gonna click the button.

193
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,160
So in this example,

194
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,850
let's go back into this document and ice modify the document open.

195
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,790
So instead of giving a message,

196
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,450
it displays the use of form.

197
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,190
To do that,

198
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,950
we use the name of the four fr and basic,

199
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,030
not show okay,

200
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,090
lets test everything.

201
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:13,150
So I'm gonna close and save and then go back into the document.

202
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,360
Up comes the use of form,

203
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,840
and when I click continue,

204
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,280
I get my message and I can man just dismiss the full.

205
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,240
Okay,

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,510
so that's just a quick overview of event programming,

207
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:38,390
how you can create procedures which will execute automatically when a given event occurs in

208
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,520
the upcoming videos.

209
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,560
We're looking more detail at this process and look at ways in which event program it can be

210
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,970
used to.

211
00:13:45,970 --> 00:14:00,740
Our benefit event program in refers to the creation of special sub procedures called event

212
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,460
handlers,

213
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,080
which,

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:10,360
triggered by actions taken place in the Microsoft Word environment code placed in the this

215
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,540
document object and inside user form objects executes automatically when the event

216
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,600
specified in the name of the men procedure occurs
