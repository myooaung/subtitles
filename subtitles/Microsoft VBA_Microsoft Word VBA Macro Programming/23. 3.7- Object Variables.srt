1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
in this video,

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,340
we'll take a closer look at the use of variables that story in references to word objects.

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,110
We'll be talking about using variables to store references to the document.

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:24,740
Object,

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,380
the range object,

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,720
the table object and the row objects.

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,000
However,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,880
as you'll see throughout the course,

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,450
variables could be used to store references toe any word object.

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:56,650
Let's scroll down to the bottom of the Section three module,

11
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:06,490
and we'll we'll do in this tutorial is to create a macro that creates a new document,

12
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,580
then creates a new table in that document and adds headings to the first row of the table.

13
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:21,350
And let's just call it object variables.

14
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,640
Well,

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,590
switch across to procedure view,

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,650
and we'll begin by declaring the variables.

17
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,850
So it's logical to start from the top of the hierarchy.

18
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,470
So the first object that we be creating is the container for everything else,

19
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,970
Which is the document so dim D.

20
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:43,090
O.

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,510
C.

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,060
New,

23
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,820
since it's a new document that will be created as documents next,

24
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,250
we'll drill down inside our new document and access the range object.

25
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,650
The range object can refer to 100 pages to a paragraph to a word to any range you specify

26
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,050
Inside a blank document that has just been created,

27
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,750
the range object refers to the insertion point to the blinking cursor instead of them.

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,870
Our energy,

29
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,350
new as range inside the range,

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,280
will place a table object.

31
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,160
So did Tvl,

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,250
new as table,

33
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,310
and in order to put some text inside,

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,350
it will refer to the first row of that table.

35
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:41,350
So let's dim row headings as road.

36
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,280
So those there are four objects and it's obviously logical that will start at the top of

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,750
the hierarchy with the object that contains all the others.

38
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,710
So we start with the document object to populate an object variable.

39
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:03,850
We use the keyword set as opposed to let which is optionally used for data variables so set

40
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,450
folk knew equal to,

41
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,650
and we then put any statement which refers to a document.

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,910
In this case,

43
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,580
we want the statement that creates one.

44
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,350
So it's documents your God,

45
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,150
that gives us our new document.

46
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,550
We now want to populate our range object to point to the contents of this new document so

47
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:38,290
we can say set Florentine you equal to dock new don't range because the document is blank.

48
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,450
Are Engy new equates to the current insertion points within the documents about that

49
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,450
insertion point.

50
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,020
I mean,

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,310
I want to create a table.

52
00:03:47,310 --> 00:04:01,350
So now it's said TV l knew equal to on what we can say is doc new dot tables don't add.

53
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,210
And then in brackets,

54
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,450
we specify three parameters.

55
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,570
First of all,

56
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,950
the range within that document where was like the new table to appear?

57
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,460
And of course,

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,690
this is where we put in our in Genoud.

59
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,050
Secondly,

60
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,450
the number of Rosie like,

61
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,250
let's say to and thirdly,

62
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,150
the number of columns so that will create our table.

63
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,620
Andi by default it won't have any borders,

64
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,810
so the table itself won't be visible.

65
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,150
Let's say we prefer to be visible.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,340
A nice,

67
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,690
simple way of doing this is to say,

68
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,400
tbl new got borders,

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,550
enable equals true.

70
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,550
And now let's add headings to the first row of the table.

71
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,900
First of all,

72
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:58,220
we'll set our variable row headings equal to tbl.

73
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,900
New don't rose brackets one.

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,250
We can now target the text in each of the cells in that robe object.

75
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,580
So road head ins Nope.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,780
Cells one no range,

77
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:25,230
no text vehicles on Let's say name and we can then copy this line.

78
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,810
So just move the cursor to the left edge of the line.

79
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,960
One click to select the line control,

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:41,580
see for copy control the four times 23 4 and then we change these two to three and four.

81
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,940
So we have name,

82
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,750
let's say date,

83
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,750
amount,

84
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,650
details,

85
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,750
and that's it.

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,900
So obviously,

87
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,210
this is a fairly small sample off working with these objects,

88
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,670
but in a typical macro,

89
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,340
you would be doing the more manipulation with each of these objects.

90
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,020
So having them in a variable is a very efficient way off,

91
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,500
being able to manipulate them simply by using the name for this variable.

92
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,970
Let's just test that this works so well.

93
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,250
Save and run.

94
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:27,250
Let's check out new documents so everything seems fine.

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:38,040
We've got our table with four Collins and two runs just one final point before we leave

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,850
this topic.

97
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,650
And that's the technique for removing objects from memory.

98
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,900
It's obviously not very important in this specific example,

99
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,240
because it's a brief,

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,990
but if you want to do some memory management and just free up memory by reset in variables

101
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,850
that you no longer will be using.

102
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,950
Here's the syntax for doing that.

103
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,750
So let's say we've now finished without table.

104
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:09,930
We want to remove it for a memory we would use Set tbl view.

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,020
He cools nothing.

106
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,240
So there nothing Keyword is reserved for use with objects.

107
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,050
Variables.

108
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:29,050
Let's just running again and obviously we get the same result.

109
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,450
But from memory management point of view,

110
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,950
that variable is no longer taking up any memory.

111
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,350
Let's just save,

112
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:49,340
and we'll finish this section by looking at the use of the with and with structure.

113
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,040
Those of you who have done some B B A will probably be asking yourselves,

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,550
Why didn't we actually use with an end with in this context?

115
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,950
And that's the topic of our next video.

116
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:16,170
Using variables to store references to word objects helps to make your code faster and more

117
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,850
efficient.

118
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,250
When a signing objects to a variable,

119
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:28,600
remember to use the keyword set to remove an object from memory,

120
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,150
use the syntax set my object equal to nothing
