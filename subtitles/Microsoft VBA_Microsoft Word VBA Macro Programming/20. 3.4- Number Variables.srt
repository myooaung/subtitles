1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,910
in this video pulled its and more work on number variables will look at a couple of useful

2
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,230
number functions.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:24,910
I've also looked at how VB A handles the distinction between raw numbers as used in

4
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,860
calculations and formatted numbers,

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,820
which have characters added to them,

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,830
such as commerce,

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,940
in order to enhance readability.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:42,790
Let's go into the word BB,

9
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,150
a train in template,

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:57,580
and we want the Section three model variables and Constants and let's add a couple of

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,350
Micro's.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,580
The 1st 1 will do is a simple macro,

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,100
which will convert a Farron night value to Centigrade and to give us a chance to practice

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,550
on useful techniques.

15
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:17,870
What will do is to display the result in a formatted fashion.

16
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,170
So instead of simply displaying the raw number that the calculation returns will format it

17
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,050
to make it more user friendly.

18
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,190
And we'll put the degree symbol,

19
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:28,620
Um,

20
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,150
at the end of the the number.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,670
No,

22
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,010
we compare V B A with Excel,

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,550
so let me just go across to excel enter a random number,

24
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:46,280
and I'm sure you're aware that in excel you conform at numbers to look exactly as you want

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,750
them to,

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,630
so I can choose currency and here I've got thousands separators and I brought two decimal

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,730
places with,

28
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,610
in my case,

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,510
the pound sign.

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,250
But the raw number that I entered is still stored by Excel.

31
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,350
So Excel takes care of both the wrong number and the formatted number for you,

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,850
Aaron v.

33
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,450
B A.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,960
You have to take care of both parts.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,450
Both numbers yourself.

36
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,830
So what we'll do for our temperature conversion example will have to number variables.

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,750
They can use this single data type,

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,660
but then we'll have to string variables which were equivalent to the but which will contain

39
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,850
formatted versions off those two numbers.

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:39,690
So let's create our macron s 030 full macron a and we'll call it tempt conversion.

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:45,850
And then I'm going to switch across to my preferred procedure view.

42
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,140
If you prefer for model of you,

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,870
feel free to stay in that Do.

44
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:58,490
Let's begin by declaring our variables so dim sng far,

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,750
which will be the paranoid value as single.

46
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:12,450
Then sng sent a single and then let's do the string equivalents.

47
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:20,850
So then str far a string and then str sent a strength.

48
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:29,850
Now let's populate the Fahrenheit variable by using the import box function.

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,060
I'm gonna keep using the optional keyword.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,620
Let again just to draw your attention to the fact that these are data variables.

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,150
They're not object variables,

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,780
but sng,

53
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,380
huh?

54
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,540
He cool in four books.

55
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:57,550
Isn't ah number in Charing Points?

56
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,390
Then we've got to convert that to center.

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,860
Great.

58
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:15,560
So let's sng sent equals on the conversion as soon as I remember is you take off 32 so sng

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,390
for minus study,

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,950
sir.

61
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,890
Then you multiply by five divided by nine.

62
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,950
So now we've got the numerical value sorted out.

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,420
We want to display the result,

64
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,650
but use formatted number values.

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,110
So this is where our string variables come in.

66
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:47,350
So let str far a cool and to actually generate a formatted number,

67
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,850
we can use the format function.

68
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,980
This is a string function which can take a numerical input value and return a formatted

69
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,950
version off that number which includes non numeric characters.

70
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,340
So for meant,

71
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:12,610
the expression will be sng far and then the format goes in quotes and it's done in the same

72
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,750
way as excel custom formats.

73
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:29,120
So let's put hash coma Hush hush 0.0 So these placeholders means that if there is a number

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,030
in that position,

75
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,450
it will be entered in the result.

76
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,610
Otherwise,

77
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,350
no zero will be inserted where zero means if there is a significant number at that point,

78
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,560
it will go in.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,850
But if there's not,

80
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:48,510
zero will be inserted in its place and similarly will have two decimal places and it will

81
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:53,520
round 22 If there are more than two decimals in the results on,

82
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,750
we can do the same thing for SDR sent.

83
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:03,650
So we're gonna copy this line on the way I normally did is just move the cursor to the left

84
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,350
click ones to select the whole line and control See followed by control V twice.

85
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,740
Because the line is highlighted.

86
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,270
The first control of the which is,

87
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,670
of course,

88
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:18,830
paste pastes over the selection so effectively nothing happens.

89
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,850
So you then just repeat control V to get the second line.

90
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:29,350
So this now becomes str sent and snd sent.

91
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,350
So now that we have our formatted numerical values,

92
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:44,150
we can output the But why don't we just add in the degree symbol since you've got words

93
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,050
very convenient insert symbol at our disposal.

94
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,750
I'm just gonna nip across to that insert symbol and more symbols.

95
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,850
And then let's scroll up,

96
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,960
Scroll down again and there's our degree.

97
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,520
Sign me.

98
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,780
Insert that now I'm gonna use cut.

99
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,160
We don't really need to leave it here,

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,650
So just cut it into the clipboard return and then we could paste it in here on in here.

101
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,750
So now we can output these two variables in a message.

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,550
Let's just put that on that blank line.

103
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,350
Chemistry box.

104
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:41,050
Presti off ampersand Karen Heights It cools and percent str sent 10% centigrade.

105
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,150
What's test our code,

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,510
But before doing that,

107
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,590
it's always a good idea to save and then run.

108
00:07:51,590 --> 00:08:02,790
So let's see what 85.52 Fahrenheit is equivalent to 35.52 degrees Fahrenheit equals 29.73

109
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,360
Sent a great So see him in.

110
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,650
We've got the right formula that looks fine Before we leave this example.

111
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,900
There's a very useful function that you can use whenever you ask the user toe.

112
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,350
Enter a numeric value and this is the valve function.

113
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,980
Well,

114
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:25,420
to show you why it's useful if we run the macro again on the user says I'm interested in 79

115
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,350
degrees as my input.

116
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,050
When we click OK,

117
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,520
we get a type mismatch error because of the presence of those textual characters That's

118
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,750
just like on end.

119
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,760
Now,

120
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,860
as we go through the course,

121
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,600
we'll learn more facilities for test in values that you're about to place in variables.

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,550
But Vow is a very simple way of ignoring those textual characters.

123
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:55,850
So if we wrap the malfunction around our input box like so,

124
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,750
then when the user enters degrees,

125
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:08,230
the valve function simply stops reading characters when it encounters something that's not

126
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,750
numeric,

127
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:15,550
so very often that will just make the input box function bit more robust.

128
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,760
Okay,

129
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,770
I'm going to switch back now.

130
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:25,440
It's a full model of you on the reason I do this is so that I can be sure that the next

131
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,450
macro we create goes exactly where I wanted to.

132
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,050
So let's write our second macro,

133
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:39,250
and what we're gonna do this time is to work with inter jizz.

134
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,450
We're going to ask the user to enter their age,

135
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,850
and then whatever age they enter,

136
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:51,050
we will take off 20% and then display a message which says,

137
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,280
Really,

138
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,000
you don't look a day over whatever.

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,870
So if they enter 50 as the age we take off 20% leaving us 40.

140
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,600
So we display a message that says,

141
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,460
Really,

142
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,900
you don't look a day over 40.

143
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,330
So let's call this one greet user,

144
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,650
and then I'll just get across to procedure view.

145
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,110
So we'll dinner variable to the user's name.

146
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,750
Str name.

147
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,150
Just string Ben for their age.

148
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:28,620
Brianti age as integer,

149
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,250
and then we'll have a separate variable to store the age that we want to display.

150
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:44,250
So let's call that dimmer pence like that age as anti Gia.

151
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,750
And then let's populate the 1st 2 variables.

152
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:57,650
So let str name equal input books.

153
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,930
Please answer your main.

154
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:15,100
Then let's I n t age equal and then we'll use the valve function input box.

155
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,350
By the way,

156
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:25,650
empath and STL name 10%.

157
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,650
How old are you?

158
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:36,250
And then we closed both the input books from the vowel functions.

159
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,100
So now we calculate in flatter age.

160
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:54,750
So let's say in AIDS multiplied by no 0.8,

161
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,550
and we display our message.

162
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,910
So really,

163
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:14,050
you don't look a day over I m percent flat age,

164
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,550
So let's save and test.

165
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,550
So who's running our macro.

166
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,750
Let's say Barack Obama,

167
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,000
By the way,

168
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,770
Barack Obama,

169
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,650
How old are you?

170
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,450
52

171
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,590
Really?

172
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,250
You don't look a day over 42.

173
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,110
So 42 is probably a bit too precise.

174
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,550
It would probably be nicer if we could round the age to the nearest five.

175
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,240
So 42 were drowned down to 40.

176
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
43 would round up to 45 so forth.

177
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,150
Although we working with an integer we can still use the round function to do this.

178
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:07,950
So what we do is we put the round function around the calculation that we've got so far.

179
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,380
Then we divide by the number that we want to Round two,

180
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,450
which is five.

181
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:20,150
And then we multiply the whole thing by that same number high by five.

182
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,460
And as if by magic,

183
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,220
we end up with the original number rounded to the nearest five.

184
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,780
So let's try it again.

185
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:39,550
Onda 56.

186
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:46,700
So that then rounds 2 45 And again,

187
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,950
let's save our changes.

188
00:13:47,950 --> 00:14:02,580
The format function could be used to create a formatted string version of a numeric value.

189
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,980
When asking the user to enter a numeric value,

190
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,590
the valve function can be used to remove any trailing textual characters.

191
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,250
The round function,

192
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,850
as well as round in floating point numbers,

193
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,230
could be used around to the nearest multiple of any whole number.
