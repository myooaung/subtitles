00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.820
in this video will move on to look at working with the properties of an object.

2
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.780
Properties are essentially the attributes of an object,

3
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.050
however,

4
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.980
toe access some of the properties you'll actually sometimes have to go via a child object.

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:36.050
Let's have a look at how this works when working with object properties.

6
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.250
One of the things you have to think about is the data type for each of those properties.

7
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.520
For example,

8
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.020
let's say we have some text.

9
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.900
We're looking to train some of the attributes clearly if we change in the front name but

10
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.450
dealing with text the name of the front.

11
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.420
What about the size in the drop down?

12
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.850
We only have whole numbers,

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.840
but here in this text box,

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.950
we can actually type decimals.

15
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.750
So to accommodate those decimals,

16
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.450
the type has to be single rather than integer.

17
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.860
Another thing to bear in mind is the fact that while some properties air applied directly

18
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.950
to the objects,

19
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.850
some properties air applied via a child object.

20
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.410
And in fact,

21
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.600
all of these settings here aren't applied directly to the selection or to the range object

22
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.600
,

23
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.550
which is how you format text.

24
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.050
But they're applied via a child object called Funt.

25
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.490
And that's roughly equivalent to clicking on the launch of button here and bringing up the

26
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.600
font dialogue.

27
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.720
So all of these settings in V.

28
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.930
B.

29
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.500
A.

30
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.840
R.

31
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.550
Accessed as part of this child object called the fund object.

32
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.450
So if I were working with the selection object,

33
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.190
this would be selection dot formed,

34
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.850
not name.

35
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.150
This would be selection dot for dot size.

36
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.540
And then here we have selection dot fund,

37
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.350
not bold or italic going back to the data type.

38
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.490
You'll find that a lot of words settings aren't actually regular data types.

39
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.730
They are simply a series of options,

40
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.250
which are built into a word on which have no meaning in any other context.

41
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.400
For example,

42
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.700
with the underlying style the user chooses one of these preset built in styles on the way

43
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.970
that VB actually allows you to replicate this functionality is to use a special type of

44
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.010
constant called an enumeration or in um,

45
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550
in Microsoft Word.

46
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.520
These Denham's are all prefixed with the letters W D Vietnam's rules have found in visual

47
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.250
basic.

48
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.140
So if you're using an imam with a V,

49
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.150
be a function,

50
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.510
it will be prefixed with the letters V B.

51
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.700
If you're working with Microsoft Excel Denham's,

52
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.350
there'll be prefixed with the letters X l.

53
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.480
So let's just click on council and let's delete out unwanted text and I'll just click undo

54
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.950
to go back to normal.

55
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.880
Let's go into visual basic editor and write ourselves a macro.

56
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.190
Well,

57
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550
this call this one object properties,

58
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.430
and I'll just click on the procedure.

59
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.690
View.

60
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.150
Button,

61
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.480
in this example will create a macro,

62
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.750
which creates a new documents suitable for a book.

63
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.180
Let's say we're writing a book in Microsoft.

64
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.250
Word on Let's say the size of the book is six inches by nine inches.

65
00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.030
We want tohave double spreads so that we've got a wider margin on the inside finding well.

66
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.030
Then ask the user to enter a title and will pick up the author name from application dot

67
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.910
User Name will then enter the title at a suitable size on Follow that with the author name

68
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.910
.

69
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.850
So let's begin by declaring variables for all of APS.

70
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.640
We'll start with a document.

71
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:30.590
Variable the dog book six by nine as document to enter text inside the document,

72
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.350
we can either use the selection object or the range object.

73
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.250
Whenever you're faced with that choice,

74
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.990
it should be no contest.

75
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.250
You should always use the range object.

76
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.350
It's much more efficient and leads to much faster and clearer code.

77
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.150
So them orangey book six by nine as range.

78
00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.140
But let's create a string variable to hold the title and another one to hold the author.

79
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.350
Now we can populate those four variables,

80
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.170
so we have to object,

81
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.650
variables for which will use the keyword set.

82
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.070
And we have to data Variables,

83
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.810
which will use the keyword Let,

84
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:29.360
which will simply admit so Set Doc Book six by nine equal to documents Don't Bad and then

85
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:39.880
set Rong Book six by nine equal to Not Book six by nine Don't range well,

86
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.850
then get the title from the user so testy our title equals input box.

87
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.750
We then need brackets because the input box method is not the only thing on that line,

88
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.200
and although it's slightly overkill,

89
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.530
will follow the best practice off name in all our parameters.

90
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.340
Please enter a title.

91
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:13.430
Then we'll populate str author from the Application objects application,

92
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.550
not use the name.

93
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.650
So now we're ready to format the document so it's suitable for a book.

94
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:26.070
Let's just say what we've done so far and then just go back to word for a moment across the

95
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.150
page layout and then paid set up.

96
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.150
I've changed the unit of measurement two inches since we're working in interest.

97
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.350
I'll just remind you how you do that.

98
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.850
Oil options advanced,

99
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.950
and then we scroll down to the display section,

100
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:50.650
and here you'll find show measurements in units off just transplants interest.

101
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:57.520
So let's go back to paid set up The things that we want to change in our baby a code are

102
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.650
the four margins,

103
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.650
but we also want tohave this option.

104
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.350
Mary margins.

105
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.730
This is gonna be a boolean value,

106
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.130
isn't it?

107
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.750
It's either true or funnels,

108
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.350
and you'll notice that when I switch it on,

109
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.610
it's the left margin that becomes the inside.

110
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.110
So when I have normal left is one.

111
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.050
And then there are large ins gives me,

112
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.850
um inside in place of left outside in place of right.

113
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.750
So we want the white of the two margins to be the left.

114
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.850
The other things will need Ah,

115
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.690
the with and height.

116
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:43.990
We want the width of six inches and a height or nine Let's then go back into the visual

117
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.450
basic editor because we'll be changing several parameters within the paint sets up object

118
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.550
We can use the with end with construct.

119
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:59.890
So with Dr Book six by nine Built,

120
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:11.020
paid set up and with and then when we tied the dot the auto completion promptness so we

121
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.170
could start with our margins.

122
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.250
I'll start with the top,

123
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.010
and I'm set in.

124
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.810
That 2.75 inches,

125
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.750
trained in the units of measurement has no impact on B B A.

126
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.950
He be a always inspect your margin to be in points.

127
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:32.890
So if I were simply to enter nor 0.75 that would be no 0.75 points,

128
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.150
which is minute.

129
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:39.750
So the normal solution to this issue is to use a special function,

130
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:45.850
which converts whatever units of measurement you want into the required points.

131
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.640
So because we're working on six by nine book,

132
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.550
it's convenient to work in inches.

133
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.150
So let's say we want the top margin to be 1.25 inches.

134
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:03.280
We can use application Dr Ingest the points and then in parentheses.

135
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.450
We put the measurement in inches,

136
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.760
which of course,

137
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.430
is no 0.75 Now the interest of points method,

138
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.450
as well as being a member of the application object,

139
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.950
is also a member of a special class of objects called Global's.

140
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.150
And that means that you can use it without qualification.

141
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.200
In other words,

142
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.200
you don't have to say applications on interest appoints.

143
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.650
You can simply say,

144
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:39.110
in just two points in order to check which objects you can use without qualification,

145
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.650
just going to view object browser and looking Global's.

146
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:52.480
So in Global's you'll see we have in just two points another global that we've used several

147
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.900
times his documents.

148
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.250
So because document,

149
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.950
which in fact is a member of application,

150
00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.150
is also a member of Global's,

151
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.170
we don't need to say application dot documents.

152
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.810
We can simply say documents,

153
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.650
so we can now copy this for the other margins.

154
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:18.250
Then we've got top and then left.

155
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.820
And as we said,

156
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.250
we want left to equate to inside and write equates to outside.

157
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:35.950
So this was going to be 1.25 Let's say that the inside all left margin will be one,

158
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:43.770
and then the right and bottom can stay as they are the final thing we have to do regarding

159
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.950
margins is to say,

160
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.900
Don't mirror margins equals True.

161
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:56.050
This means that on left pages will have the wide margin on the right,

162
00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.890
and all right pages will have the wide margin on the left.

163
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.320
Next,

164
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.750
let's think about the size of the document.

165
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.180
So,

166
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.520
Doc,

167
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.900
age height and again we can use interesting points.

168
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:15.270
So the height is nine.

169
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.440
Do you?

170
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.750
And the with is six.

171
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.450
That's the document set up,

172
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.090
and we have our text sitting in our two variables.

173
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:36.250
Str title and str author So we can now right to the page.

174
00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:44.050
Let's start by entering the title and let's say we want a couple of blank lines first,

175
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.210
so it's gonna be orangey.

176
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.330
Book six by nine Look,

177
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.060
text equals a couple of returns,

178
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.390
so leave VCR ampersand.

179
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.910
The VCR ampersand.

180
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.600
Our title,

181
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.470
which is str title.

182
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:13.850
We'll buy another couple of returns and then we conform at all of that.

183
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:20.750
Let's do the funds don't name.

184
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.750
This is a string.

185
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:31.350
Let's use impact and then we want the size.

186
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:41.570
Let's say 36 or 24 perhaps so we repeat in r N g six by nine.

187
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.610
Quite a lot on me So shall we just put another with block in there?

188
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:56.150
Let's copy that and paste that in and then we can lose these three occurrences.

189
00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:01.840
Just tap these lines end on and with.

190
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:12.180
If we were doing lots of things to the font object,

191
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:18.550
it may be tempting to put another with inside this with I hope that that's a legitimate It

192
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.970
does make your coat very difficult to read.

193
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.830
So wouldn't advise ever use in a nested with and in fact,

194
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:29.250
my own personal preferences to use with very sparingly if a tool.

195
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.790
Okay,

196
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.480
so we've got our title in,

197
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.260
and we're just gonna make it centered.

198
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.130
So this time,

199
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.750
instead of the front object,

200
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:46.350
we've got a child object called paragraph format and inside that will pine alignment.

201
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:52.510
And we have our first occurrence of one of these items.

202
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.250
You'll see there will start with W.

203
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.910
D so w D.

204
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.350
And in fact,

205
00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.450
the 1st 1 is the one we're after Center.

206
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.750
That's our title.

207
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.450
Sort it out.

208
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.750
We now want to go to the end of the document.

209
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.260
At the moment,

210
00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.750
our ranges point into the entire title.

211
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.810
So if we were simply to sort of change the text.

212
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.500
At this point,

213
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.050
we would just overwrite the title with something else.

214
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.950
So we want to do the equivalent of going to the end of the document.

215
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.050
And to do that you use the collapse method.

216
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.940
So it's simply are n g.

217
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.580
Book six by nine which,

218
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.020
of course,

219
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.400
we are already inside,

220
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.040
so we can just say dot collapse with the collapse method.

221
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.800
You then specify the direction so again,

222
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.490
overkill.

223
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.770
But we will put the name of the parameters of first and you'll notice.

224
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:49.890
There's a slight inconsistency in the visual basic editor in that sometimes you don't get

225
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.150
the list of Vietnam's that you're supposed to get.

226
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.120
When that's the case,

227
00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.470
you can,

228
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.070
of course,

229
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.860
look it up.

230
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.050
Just go to the object browser and check.

231
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:03.370
You can also try and guess the 1st 2 letters are easy enough.

232
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.200
It's gonna be W.

233
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.610
D.

234
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.260
And you may then be tempted to think,

235
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:07.850
well,

236
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:14.220
W d starts or W d end which of the two options.

237
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.280
But in fact,

238
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.560
that is too ambiguous because in the context of Microsoft,

239
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.050
word,

240
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.450
end and start are just too general.

241
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.680
So from there,

242
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.750
you can deduce to make it less ambiguous.

243
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.510
You need to say collapse and or collapse start,

244
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.170
and in fact,

245
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.010
that's what it is.

246
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.150
Another tip is,

247
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.150
if you are guessing,

248
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.250
always type it in lower case.

249
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.600
So we type collapse,

250
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:50.050
end and then presente you'll see that collapse end and changes with the first letter of

251
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.550
each word in upper case.

252
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.950
So that tells us that we've guessed at least a word that exists in V B A.

253
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:59.250
Which is probably enough,

254
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.370
especially if you sort of half knew it.

255
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.470
You just weren't sure.

256
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.250
Another thing you can do.

257
00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.900
If you want to verify one of these before you test your code,

258
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.050
you could just double click on it and shoes definition.

259
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.290
And then if it does exist,

260
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:21.250
it will just open up the object browser for you and jump specifically to that constant.

261
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.610
Okay,

262
00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.040
so now we've got ourselves an insertion points a flashing cursor at the very end of the

263
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.850
document.

264
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:37.290
So now we want the author we already have our returns in so you could go straight to doc.

265
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:44.770
Tax equals str author and let's make that slightly smaller.

266
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.110
So let's do not formed not name.

267
00:16:49.110 --> 00:17:02.060
He calls times new Roman not formed start size equals 16.

268
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.510
So I think that's everything we wanted to do.

269
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.050
Let's then save our changes on test.

270
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.510
So let's call that word.

271
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.690
Be three b A Palm picked trouble,

272
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.430
please.

273
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.850
Let's look at the result of documents.

274
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:37.150
So there we have our impact 24 and then V b A simply looked at whatever was here for user

275
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.550
name.

276
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:46.920
Place that inside str author And then we've got our returns in there so that all seems to

277
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.550
be working.

278
00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:56.560
Okay,

279
00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.450
so these are some of the features related to working with object properties.

280
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.910
In the next video,

281
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.930
we'll move on to look at how you can target and isolate the specific object within a

282
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.260
collection of objects.

283
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:22.850
Several properties in the word object model and set in directly by way of a child object.

284
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:28.160
When set in the properties of objects,

285
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:36.810
value of the appropriate data type must always be supplied as well as regular data types.

286
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:42.770
Such a string and Boolean object properties can also require constant values known as

287
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.750
immune orations or e nuns.

288
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:51.300
The nuns related to a word objects beginning with the letters W.

289
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:51.720
D.

290
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.720
Wiley Nam's relations of baby A begin with the lettuce VB
