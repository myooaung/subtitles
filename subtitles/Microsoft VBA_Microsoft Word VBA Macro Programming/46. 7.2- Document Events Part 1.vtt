00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.650
Now that we've had a brief introduction to the idea of event procedures and event handling

2
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.570
in this video,

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.800
we'll look a bit more closely a document.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.270
Events will take a practical example how document events could be implemented within a

5
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.820
Microsoft Word workflow.

6
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:37.450
Let's go into the Exercises folder and in the Section seven folder,

7
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.850
you'll find a document called Document Events.

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.950
Let's just double quick to open it on.

9
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.350
What we have here is simply a macro enabled document.

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.250
Let's go into the visual basic editor.

11
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.600
So as we discussed in the last video to work with document events,

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.400
you edit the code module off that this document object so he could just double click to

13
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.650
open up the code module.

14
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.250
And then we've got the to drop downs at the top of more deal.

15
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.270
On the left hand side,

16
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.120
we have the object drop down.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.990
So the only object relative to this document inside which we can place BB a code is the

18
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.950
document object.

19
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.650
So we choose document and the program automatically creates the default event procedure,

20
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.050
which were the document object is document new to check which procedures relate to the

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.250
document object on the procedure dropped out.

22
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.950
We can choose any of these options.

23
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.020
The ones related specifically to documents are new,

24
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
which is the default close and open.

25
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.380
You'll notice that there are several other event procedures available.

26
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.450
Many of them relate to content controls,

27
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:11.650
and we'll be looking at these in section 15 content controls and the interactive forms.

28
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.550
Only two of the three document event procedures could be used with macro enable documents,

29
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.250
the clothes and open procedures.

30
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.950
The document new procedure can only be used with macron able templates.

31
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:44.670
Any Cody place inside this event procedure will be executed any time the user creates a

32
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.450
document based on the template in question.

33
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.990
What will do in this tutorial is to create a little bit of functionality on each of these

34
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.650
events.

35
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.900
Let's start with document close and let's say that what we want to do here it's the very

36
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.550
form a.

37
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.750
If document has been saved,

38
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.640
let's say that we want to get everyone into the habit of saving a document before closing

39
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.750
it so we could put in if statement.

40
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:35.250
So let's say if active documents not saved equals false then and let's say chemistry books

41
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:50.080
don't colon equals please and show that you save documents before closing.

42
00:03:50.080 --> 00:04:01.350
And let's continue on to a new line and use the buttons parameter and Phoebe explanation.

43
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.650
So this will just generate a friendly message.

44
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.350
It won't actually prevent the user from closing,

45
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.350
just a friendly reminder that the best habit is to save the document before you close it.

46
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.650
So let's put it to the test.

47
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.380
We haven't saved the document,

48
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.550
So when we closed up comes out exclamation mark message books.

49
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.380
Then when we click OK,

50
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.550
the Microsoft Word interface takes over.

51
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.350
We got the normal message.

52
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.870
Would you like to save on Weaken?

53
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.500
Say yes and we're back in business.

54
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.950
Let's go back in and now let's move on to the open event.

55
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.750
So for the open event,

56
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.840
let's say we want to display document properties,

57
00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.150
thus allowing the user to verify that document properties exist.

58
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.400
Let's say we're working for an organization where document property such as title and

59
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.940
author,

60
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.660
a very important and we want to make sure that all our users keep this matter information

61
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.100
constantly updated just to remind you where this information resides.

62
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.590
In the word,

63
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.410
it's a face.

64
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.120
When we go to file in,

65
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.450
uh,

66
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.260
here.

67
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.530
Under properties,

68
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.980
we can go into advanced properties on the meta information.

69
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.850
Ah is displayed here,

70
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:39.650
So let's take probably the fall most important title subject author and keywords,

71
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:47.100
and we'll display those in the use of full will read the current values from the system,

72
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.500
display them in the user form,

73
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.100
but allow the user to body.

74
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.610
Find them from the user forms when they click.

75
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.150
OK,

76
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.550
we write the values from the user form back into the document.

77
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:09.770
So here we simply need to use user form don't show in order to display the user form and

78
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.550
then the user form will do the rest.

79
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.030
So I'm going to cool.

80
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.150
It frm properties.

81
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.750
So even though it doesn't yet exist,

82
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.390
I can put FRM properties,

83
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.350
not show,

84
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.050
and then we can go ahead and create it.

85
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.500
So just right.

86
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.610
Click on the project inserts use a phone and the first thing I always do is to give the

87
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:44.400
toolbox to the rights had underway on Let's change the names that frm properties.

88
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:55.370
Then let's trains the caption to document properties and the captions just displayed at the

89
00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:02.780
top of be useful in the next three videos will be focusing on creating user forms and

90
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.410
setting up the event handlers behind the various controls.

91
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:07.920
So this video,

92
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.450
we're gonna keep it very simple.

93
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.650
Just gonna create four label andi textbooks pairs.

94
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.300
So just use in these two controls,

95
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.250
the label control on the textbooks.

96
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.400
We're just gonna go with the default sizes of everything.

97
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.680
So has our label.

98
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.180
Maybe the default size is a bit big.

99
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.250
So just resize that changed the caption.

100
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:48.450
So we had title and then the textbooks to go with that.

101
00:07:48.450 --> 00:08:02.850
Now that I can select both of these using the standard techniques.

102
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.550
So click,

103
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.920
shift,

104
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.890
click drag on.

105
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.050
Then to copy them,

106
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:15.280
I can hold down the control key and just tracked down control Shift doesn't work,

107
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.850
by the way.

108
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.050
It's just control.

109
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.020
But the grid makes it very easy to keep them straight.

110
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.860
Is you drag So there.

111
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.380
Before that,

112
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.360
we wanted to do so.

113
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:40.700
We had title subject off the by the way,

114
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.810
As you're doing this,

115
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:43.800
if you accidentally double click,

116
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.850
this happens.

117
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:51.820
Eso we've got the current name of the label and then the program has just automatically

118
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.280
created the event hand left with the thing I double quick time.

119
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.150
So if this does happen to you,

120
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.350
simply delete the unwanted event handler because we don't want to track an event for the

121
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.340
label control on.

122
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:08.420
Then you close the code module if it keeps happening.

123
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.110
But instead of doing what I've been doing,

124
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.050
which is to change the which is to change the text in the control itself?

125
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:20.150
Just use the caption on Just Pop the text in the caption box.

126
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.010
In properties,

127
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.150
the properties is invisible.

128
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.650
Of course,

129
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.450
it's news and properties windows.

130
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.520
So this one was a final one that we needed to change.

131
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.350
This is keywords.

132
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:40.250
Let's just needs to be at the bigger where the full and I'm going to make keywords,

133
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.850
perhaps a couple of lines,

134
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:50.350
two or three lines deep on while it's selected.

135
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:58.510
Let's just set the multi online property to True so that we can actually display several

136
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.450
lines of keywords if necessary.

137
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.870
And finally,

138
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:03.620
let's create an O.

139
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.880
K.

140
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.260
Button.

141
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.250
So that's the command button control,

142
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:15.570
and then just click making form of it bigger to accommodate it on.

143
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:24.450
Then reposition at changed the caption on resize it.

144
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:36.850
So these are all the various controls now what we need to do is to name the controls.

145
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.440
No two approaches for this.

146
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.870
By the way,

147
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.450
you can either name everything.

148
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.420
So every single control,

149
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.930
the form itself and everything you put on it has a name that's a good philosophy to follow

150
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.550
because it leads to clarity.

151
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:56.150
On the second philosophy is that you name only those controls,

152
00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:02.480
which you intend to manipulate with your code in some way for which you intend to attach

153
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.620
code to the first philosophy obviously means more were hurt.

154
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.520
But in the long run,

155
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.050
it probably leads to more clarity because if you don't name objects,

156
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.290
then they end up with default names that you end up with a mixture of default names and

157
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.230
your names,

158
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.650
which can give it confusing.

159
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:28.850
So in these videos I'll be naming everything in the interests of completion and clarity.

160
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.250
So these four are all labels,

161
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:39.350
and the prefix I'm going to use for labels is the common one.

162
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:58.050
Lbl So lbl title l VL some chick I'll be out author on lbl keywords.

163
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:25.350
Then we have textbooks is we'll use the prefix txt txt title subject also on keywords.

164
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.330
Finally,

165
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.620
the command button CMD
