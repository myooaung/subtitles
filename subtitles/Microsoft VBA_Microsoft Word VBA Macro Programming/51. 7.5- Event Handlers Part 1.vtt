00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.260
in this video will create a series of event procedures to convert the form that we created

2
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.540
in the last video into an interactive form which responds to the use.

3
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.290
That's choices and when the user clicks,

4
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.950
okay,

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.590
creates a document based on their specifications.

6
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.550
So here's the form that we created in the last video.

7
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.590
Let's now think about the various types of interactivity that would like to add to this

8
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.990
form.

9
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.170
The best place to start is to think about the form itself when the former peers is there

10
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.650
anything that needs to be in place before the user has even interacted with the form.

11
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.650
In this case,

12
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.310
we want to ensure that we've got the drop downs populated with all the funds on the user

13
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.950
system.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.050
We don't want the user toe have to interact with the form before this happens.

15
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.350
So for this type of event,

16
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.450
we could go into view code and let's choose the user form.

17
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.850
Let's just delete the code that's been put in there and look at the alternative.

18
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.870
We can simply double click on any part of the form apart from one of the controls.

19
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.390
So in any of the space between the controls and we get to the same place on the object

20
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.870
dropped down.

21
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.670
We have used a form selected and on the procedure dropped down.

22
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.650
We have Click,

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.910
which is the default event for the use of force.

24
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.260
On this occasion.

25
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.250
Click isn't what we really want.

26
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.850
So from the procedure drop down which is initialized.

27
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
So rather than having to wait for the user to click the form which clearly is not a good

28
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.750
idea,

29
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.090
we used the initialize event,

30
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.350
which happens before the form is actually displayed.

31
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.050
And what we wanted to is to populate the font combo boxes.

32
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.780
So that's create a variable said we can create a full loop.

33
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.540
So we're looking inside application.

34
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.410
Not fond names on the count Property will tell us how many funds there are.

35
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.860
Two loop through inside the loop.

36
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.750
We need to add each formed to our combo boxes.

37
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.850
Certainly not CBO.

38
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.750
Let's do title first senses at the top.

39
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.410
Don't add item and the ice and we add in will be application.

40
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.600
What font names brackets?

41
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.650
I So by using I as the index because I changes each time we loop,

42
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.910
we effectively are added.

43
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.250
Each item So I is normally inside a loop.

44
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.750
I is normally each.

45
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.950
Then we could just copy and paste control C control V Control.

46
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.790
Be and change the combo box,

47
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.980
which,

48
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.530
of course,

49
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.760
is CBO author,

50
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.730
and that should be that.

51
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.250
So we contest.

52
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.650
Let's just save and we contest either from the code or from the form itself.

53
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.550
So we've still got impact in times New Roman in place.

54
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.550
But you'll notice that we also have all of the fonts installed on this system.

55
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.850
Now let's think about the interaction between the spin buttons and the related textbooks.

56
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.980
This is gonna be when the spin button changes from one value to another,

57
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.280
and this is actually the default event.

58
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.550
So if I simply double click on the spin button,

59
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.750
then the default event handled it is created for me,

60
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.050
as you can see is the change event on.

61
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.350
All we need to do here is to read from the spin button into the text box,

62
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.750
the value divided by 10.

63
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.810
So just remind you why.

64
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.550
Let's just have a look at the men and Max.

65
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.450
So you got a max of 3 60 in a minute to 40 whereas we actually want font sizes in the range

66
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.410
24 to 36 and we increase in in units of five.

67
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.590
So we've done that because we can't have in tinges as the change.

68
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.950
So we've made everything 10 times bigger than it should be.

69
00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.650
So when we divide by 10 will then potentially have increments of five.

70
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.600
So just going back to the code,

71
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:21.180
we simply say me dot txt title size don't value equals may dot spn title size don't value

72
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.050
divided by 10?

73
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.450
Well,

74
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.730
we may as well do the author before we test it.

75
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.650
So just copy paste paste that becomes also.

76
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:41.390
And this becomes also so you can see that having a name in system so you can see that

77
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.320
having the name and system for your controls makes it easy to actually ah,

78
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.700
code as well.

79
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.950
So this becomes author as well and less test.

80
00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:04.810
So we go from 30 and you can see it's increase in up to its maximum off 36.

81
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.950
Let's just test the other one up to its maximum.

82
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:16.340
So I've obviously made an error on this 2nd 1 because it's going up in increments of one,

83
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.270
so it must have left the small change value at its default of one.

84
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.150
So if you spotted that well done,

85
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.460
if you spot it that in the last straight here,

86
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.950
well done,

87
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.350
I'll just catch up with you.

88
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:39.160
So we want this spin button to have a small train set in off five that will kill that

89
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.650
problem.

90
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.190
We also had a problem with truncate in on the text field,

91
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.140
so just control.

92
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.950
Click on this to select them both.

93
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.050
We just need to know to them across slightly.

94
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.250
And a nice way of doing this is just to increase this measurement.

95
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.980
So if I increase it by,

96
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:12.100
let's say it's 216 Now let's make it 219 and then click control Click on both of these.

97
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.450
And of course now we want the width,

98
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.770
and let's increase that by approximately three as well.

99
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.590
So that becomes 27 and hopefully that will stop the truncation.

100
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.650
Let's just check.

101
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:36.370
So now we can see the 0.5 in both of these boxes on by changing the small change to five

102
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.050
that's cured that problem as well.

103
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:44.240
So next we have the farmed old and I talic for war,

104
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.850
both the title and the author text boxes.

105
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:53.150
Let's do the forms first so I'll just double click on my combo box.

106
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.640
And again,

107
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.550
the default event of change is exactly the one we want.

108
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.470
Obviously,

109
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.940
Click wouldn't be a good idea,

110
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.170
because when you click,

111
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.010
you haven't yet chosen anything on the combo box.

112
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.050
So the change event is the one that happens when you make a choice.

113
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.620
And again,

114
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.830
this is a one liner,

115
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.450
so the target control is me dot txt title.

116
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:24.250
On the property with changing will be the front property and inside the front property.

117
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.850
We're after the name.

118
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.840
We want that to match me.

119
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.630
Don't CBO title font don't value.

120
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:41.360
And again we could just copy the event handler for author.

121
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:56.650
So let's test save test.

122
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.550
Let's put a title in,

123
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.300
Um,

124
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:11.030
let's change and then it goes.

125
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.550
It's still the same here,

126
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:18.650
so they're working fine.

127
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.130
Let's close,

128
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:26.190
and we then go to do the same with the font size as well as Thea Bold metallic.

129
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:31.010
So I'll just double click on the font size again changes a default event,

130
00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.950
so that's fine.

131
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.070
So again,

132
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.800
we're looking inside the phone property,

133
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.850
so meat odds txt title not formed on this time.

134
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:52.250
Don't size equals may dot Txt title size overvalued and we do the same for the author.

135
00:09:52.250 --> 00:10:19.320
So we've got some text in both increase the font size earned up it goes You can keep your

136
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:19.920
finger on it.

137
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.590
Teoh,

138
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.650
make it go quickly.

139
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.750
Uh,

140
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:31.150
down So they're working and then we're going to do the same with these.

141
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.700
So this time the default event is click,

142
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.950
which is obviously too early We really want the change event.

143
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.800
So from the procedure dropped down,

144
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.550
which is change and then we can get rid of the unwanted click.

145
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.650
So again,

146
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:57.670
we're working with the font object made up txt title not formed This time it's not bold

147
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.740
equals And although it's prompted us for true or false,

148
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.880
what we can do is to read the value off the track box because if you remember,

149
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.000
the value of check boxes and option buttons can only be true or false.

150
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.050
So we simply read whichever value is currently in place.

151
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:21.380
So made out chk title be don't value.

152
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:32.440
We can copy this to get my italics so that will be titled I don't change and of course

153
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:40.050
stopped fund Got my Talic and Chk title I don't value.

154
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:50.650
Then we can call p these two and change all the titles to order.

155
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.080
When you've got a few to do,

156
00:11:53.080 --> 00:12:01.050
you can highlight all the relevant text control H for fine change or at it lying change.

157
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:08.550
So I edit replace from then fine change and we find title,

158
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:15.850
replace with author within selected text and then replace all.

159
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:21.850
So let's test those two as well.

160
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.490
Se and run get a text here.

161
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:27.550
Bit of text there.

162
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.450
Hold on.

163
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:36.850
Impact is such a bold front that it's bold already.

164
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.220
So let's just go to Ariel.

165
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.850
Bold on bold off.

166
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.610
That's how I go on.

167
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.550
I started golf on the same here.

168
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.020
Hold on,

169
00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.550
bold off like on my tonic off.

170
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:58.050
So that completes the interaction between the various controls themselves.

171
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:05.050
Eso Now we really want to focus on the buttons when the user has made their choices
