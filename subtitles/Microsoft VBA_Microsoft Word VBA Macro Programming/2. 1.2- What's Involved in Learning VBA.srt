00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,750
In this video,

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,280
I will briefly discuss what is involved in learning Microsoft Word.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,350
VB A programming.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,400
What skills do you need to have in place before you can comfortably write your own macros

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,270
from scratch?

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:33,650
There are basically four elements that you need to have in place.

7
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,940
The first of these is not going to be provided by this course.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,780
It's assumed that you already have this knowledge.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,170
You need to know Microsoft Word very well.

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,580
In order to be able to automated,

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,800
you need to have an intermediate or advanced knowledge of Microsoft Word.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,860
You need to be familiar with beaches such as sections,

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,160
headers,

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,300
footers,

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,320
the distinction between paragraph format in character formatting,

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,350
how tables are created and modified.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,750
It's also useful if you're familiar with advanced features such as content controls.

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,050
Without this knowledge,

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,440
it's going to be difficult for you to understand the significance of some of the code that

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,950
you're writing as well as this.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,270
You may find yourself right in Macron's to perform steps in Microsoft Word,

22
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,320
which can be done perfectly well without the assistance of macros.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,850
The second skill you'll need is a knowledge of programming.

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,990
If you already have experience of programming.

25
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,010
This is a distinct advantage because this is one thing you won't have to learn.

26
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,830
However,

27
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,350
this course does not assume that you have any programming experience whatsoever.

28
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,650
So when we introduced new features,

29
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,020
new programming features,

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,350
we will discuss them in depth to make everything clear for you.

31
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,060
Next,

32
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,010
you'll need the knowledge,

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,150
specifically visual basic for applications.

34
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,450
This is the program in language,

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,550
which Microsoft used to automate all of the Microsoft Office suite.

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,320
And again,

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,080
if you have knowledge of visual basic and have used it in other contexts,

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,660
this is a distinct advantage,

39
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,620
because again,

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,550
this is one thing you won't have to learn.

41
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:37,400
The final part of the puzzle is that you need to become familiar with the word object model

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,400
,

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,660
and this is the programmatic representation of all of the various features within Microsoft

44
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,150
Word.

45
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,480
Now,

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,150
Microsoft Word has been around for a long time,

47
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,890
and it has over the years become extremely powerful,

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,560
and it has a vast array of features.

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,000
So the bulk of what you'll need to learn in order to program word is the syntax which

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
represents this vast array of beaches.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,150
So the object model is as huge as word itself.

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,760
The good news is you don't have to learn every single aspect,

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,940
just as no user uses every single featuring word.

54
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,470
When you write programs,

55
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,270
you'll be doing a limited and specific series of tasks.

56
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,970
They tend to involve objects such as documents,

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,900
ranges of text,

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,550
paragraphs,

59
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,480
characters.

60
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:43,590
So you'll find that you can achieve an awful lot in the wearable automation simply by using

61
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,750
a few features.

62
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:52,650
But do bear in mind that the object model is a very huge beast,

63
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,910
and it does take a while to become familiar with the syntax involved in its use.

64
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:12,670
Learning word.

65
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,110
VB a.

66
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,940
Programming it Bowles gaining mastery of four elements.

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,470
Microsoft Word itself,

68
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,350
programming in general,

69
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:30,900
Visual basic for applications for the D A and the word object model.

70
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,780
Learning the word object model is the largest,

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,030
most challenging and most important part of this endeavor.
