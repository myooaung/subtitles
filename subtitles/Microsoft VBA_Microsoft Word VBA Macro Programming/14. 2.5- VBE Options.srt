1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,350
in this video,

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,810
we'll look at how you can modify the way in which the visual basic editor works by

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:29,400
customizing the settings in the Tools Options Dialog Box in the Exercises folder and in the

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,850
Section two sub folder,

5
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:37,510
Let's Open 05 VB Options a Man.

6
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,050
Let's go into the visual basic editor,

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,850
and here you'll find we've got some code in a module just named Body or one,

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:54,150
which is really taken from some of the exercises that we've completed in previous tutorials

9
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,010
and will use this code as we discussed the way in which you could customise the operation

10
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,520
of the visual basic editor.

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,260
Given that the visual basic editor uses the old school Microsoft interface found in Office

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,950
2003 and earlier,

13
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,760
you won't be surprised to learn that in order to customize the way in which the program

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,450
functions,

15
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,350
you're going to tools choose options.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,150
Because,

17
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,700
of course,

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,610
this is the way in which Microsoft Office programs traditionally worked the options.

19
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,480
Dialog contains Four Tabs editor,

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,650
and it's a format General and daqian.

21
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:43,160
The options in the editor tab mainly relate to the help that you receive as your type in

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,950
your code in the visual basic editor.

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,090
The very first option is auto syntax.

24
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,520
Check on this,

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,130
I think,

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,350
is really something of an overkill option,

27
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,850
which alerts you every time you make an era.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,310
I'll give you an example of why I call it overkill.

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,850
Let's say that we're about to types and code at the end of this subroutine.

30
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,350
Let's eight an if statement,

31
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,200
Um,

32
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,280
I don't think we have discussed if statements yet,

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,250
but that's beside the point.

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,190
Eso I start my statement with the key word if and then I think of something else that I

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,090
need to track,

36
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,200
something I may have missed out.

37
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,370
So I want to leave the if statement incomplete and just go and deal with that other

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,110
situation.

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,450
So I move up the page,

40
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,140
and as soon as I leave the line up comes this rather going pop up to tell me I've made an

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,010
error and of course I know made an error because I haven't finished the line.

42
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,250
So I click OK,

43
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,610
and then,

44
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,560
from then on,

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,490
I'm fine.

46
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:51,350
So my preferred set in is to simply deactivate waters in tax track.

47
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,950
Let's just look at the difference,

48
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,140
so I start my F statement decided to do something else.

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,350
And when I leave the line,

50
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,800
I don't get the annoying pop up message.

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,080
However,

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,360
you'll notice that the incomplete and therefore incorrect line does go red so I can tell

53
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,170
that I made an era even without it,

54
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,320
sort of yelling at me.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,950
So it's sort of subtly reminds me that I've made an error rather than shouting at me,

56
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,150
so I'd advise you to leave that switched off.

57
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,900
Then we've got require variable declarations.

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,650
Variables are a very important part of V B A.

59
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,710
And in fact,

60
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,450
the next section is devoted entirely to working with variables.

61
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:45,610
And the very first video deals or includes a description off this feature require variable

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,900
declaration so you'll learn all about that in the next section.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,440
The next three options determine the intel ascents,

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,740
or auto completion options within individual basic editor.

65
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,650
And these are a big time saver as your edit in your code.

66
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,350
So let me just show you how these work festival alternate members.

67
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:17,170
So if you remember the keyword members when we would discuss in the Object browser as we

68
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,210
click on each class or objects on the left here on the right,

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,950
we see the members off that object.

70
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,330
In other words,

71
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,890
all of the methods properties on,

72
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,050
in some cases,

73
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,250
events which are associated with that particular object.

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,450
And this is what this option relates to.

75
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,610
So if you enter a key word,

76
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,950
which is descriptive off a particular object,

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,450
when you follow that with adults,

78
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,900
all of the members of that objects are displayed on.

79
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,460
In other words,

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,380
the list that's displayed tells you all of the legal syntax that you were allowed to put at

81
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,670
that point in your code.

82
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,250
So it's a very useful feature.

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,090
Let's take an example.

84
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,350
Let's say that at the end of this sub,

85
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,440
so if you remember,

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,790
this is just a dummy sub,

87
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,970
which simply displays a message in each of the subroutines that have called from the main

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,550
sovereignty.

89
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,110
So let's say at the end of the final message,

90
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,850
or perhaps at the end of each message,

91
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:28,100
we want to add the user's name on the syntax for picking up the user name from the Excel

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,150
interface is application dot user name,

93
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,320
and you're probably familiar with the concept of concatenation where you string text

94
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,450
elements together and you could do this when building string formulas in Excel.

95
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,280
So what we do here,

96
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,980
let's say we're doing it on all of them.

97
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,200
Put a space or perhaps commerce space.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,100
And then,

99
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,260
after closing the quotes,

100
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,500
who then put ampersand application dots.

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,430
And,

102
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,840
of course,

103
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,240
because the option to display members is activated up come all the members and no prizes

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,040
for guessing that user name is what I then put perhaps like an unfinished that off with

105
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,150
ampersand exclamation mark.

106
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,450
So I could then copy that on Place it on each of these,

107
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,990
say,

108
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,850
when I run.

109
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,650
My three messages now have my user name at the end of them.

110
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,250
So if I were to switch off the option waterless members,

111
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:40,410
it simply means that when I start type in application dot you'll see nothing happens.

112
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:46,850
So I can't think of any reason why a someone learning visual basic you would want to

113
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,650
deactivate that option.

114
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,620
Let's just don't do my lost changes.

115
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Believe that,

116
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,550
as is so that will remain switched on.

117
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,350
And then we have auto quick info,

118
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:11,350
and this is very useful when you're typing methods and functions.

119
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,220
So,

120
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,150
for example,

121
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,150
we recorded this code But if we were typing it,

122
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,810
let's Brie time that line,

123
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,650
for example,

124
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,450
not execute.

125
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,400
So that's the auto list members kicking in.

126
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,110
So I simply press tab when executed,

127
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,550
highlighted to insert it.

128
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,850
Then when I put a space,

129
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,450
the auto quick info kicks in,

130
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,350
and this basically tells me all of the parameters required by this particular method.

131
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,050
As in the case of Excel functions,

132
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,780
any parameter,

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,540
which is enclosed in square brackets,

134
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,450
is optional.

135
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,950
So again a useful feature.

136
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,710
It helps you to confirm the name of your parameters.

137
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,180
And,

138
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,580
of course,

139
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,570
it's useful,

140
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,210
as we'll see later to always name your parameters.

141
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,220
Justus.

142
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,710
The macro recorder did when we recorded this.

143
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,050
So let's just undo those changes.

144
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:23,640
The auto data sips feature is used in debug in your code when you're working in something

145
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,960
called Break mode and we'll discuss this in Section eight,

146
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,350
which is all about error handling and debugging,

147
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,750
I'll just briefly mention what it is just to give you a taste of what's to come.

148
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,370
We're trying to track down an error within this subroutine.

149
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,150
We can put a break points on any line to do that you fling in this column here.

150
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,950
And this means that whenever I run the macro,

151
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,750
it will automatically going to break mode at this point,

152
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,650
enabling me to execute the macro line by line and monitor how things are going at each

153
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,320
point safe.

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,150
I now run,

155
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,150
you'll see it stops on this line.

156
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,750
This line hasn't yet been executed,

157
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,450
and then I can step into,

158
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,650
which means basically execute each line one at a time.

159
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,640
And as I do this,

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,150
if I hover over various lines of code,

161
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,450
the data tip pops up and actually tells me what that element contains.

162
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,040
So you can see here.

163
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,180
It's telling me Replacement,

164
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,690
not text currently contains full stop space.

165
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,920
And the reason for that is that the line that's currently highlighted is the line which

166
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,350
will be executed when I next step into,

167
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,350
rather than which has already been executed.

168
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,050
In other words,

169
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,950
this replacement dot text is the last one that was executed.

170
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,350
When I step into again,

171
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,640
then if I hover over replacement,

172
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
not tax deals,

173
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,310
yet now contains the close parenthesis space.

174
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,560
So that's just a quick taster of what's to come.

175
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,350
We'll discuss this in detail.

176
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,010
Let's just come out of break boat and removed the break point.

177
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,950
We'll discuss this in detail in Section eight on error handling on deep Again.

178
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,250
So let's just get back to tools options.

179
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,480
Then we have,

180
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,770
ah,

181
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,560
Windows settings.

182
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,850
Dragon Drop texted it in very useful.

183
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,650
It allows you to move lines or any code around simply by dragon.

184
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,650
And,

185
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,150
uh,

186
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,550
it's It can also be used for copying.

187
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,740
So,

188
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,270
for example,

189
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,250
if I wanted to change the order in which some of these were executed,

190
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,950
let's say I want to do the question mark last.

191
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,850
I can just select all of these lines of code and just drank them down,

192
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,320
like so to copy.

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,950
As you probably know from other environments,

194
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,080
you hold down the control key,

195
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,610
so if I select these,

196
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,250
I've got control held down.

197
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,570
As I drag,

198
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,610
I now get a copy of those lines,

199
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,380
and you do this very often.

200
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,390
We've got similar lines of code just to get yourself started,

201
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,440
and the trick is to hold his.

202
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,870
Remember when you use that technique to modify the copy you've created,

203
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,360
and of course,

204
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,150
everyone always forgets to modify one bit.

205
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,350
But such is human nature,

206
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,810
and then we've got a couple of very simple,

207
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,950
that useful options defaulted Full module view.

208
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,010
Basically,

209
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,320
I've got several subroutines in here.

210
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
On full model of you is the default,

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,950
which basically shows all of them simultaneously at the bottom.

212
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,250
Here,

213
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,880
I can go to procedure view Andi.

214
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,680
At this point,

215
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,960
I'm only seeing one subroutine at a time in the top here.

216
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,790
I've got the procedure drop down menu,

217
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,450
and I can choose a particular procedure to go to it.

218
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,450
So if you find that as your macron's get longer,

219
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,480
you prefer to stay in this procedure view where you're just looking at one procedure at a

220
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:10,950
time,

221
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,250
then obviously you can just go in here and switch off.

222
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,690
Defaulted for Marty.

223
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,250
Old view.

224
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,550
If we credit new module,

225
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,950
you'll see it's now defaulted to procedure view automatically.

226
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,350
Let's just remove that model,

227
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:42,580
and then we've got a very simple one here.

228
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,150
The procedure separator.

229
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,530
That's this line,

230
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,580
which separates all the sub procedures,

231
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,250
and it's usually a good idea.

232
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,150
It makes that much easier to make sense off.

233
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,450
If we switch it off,

234
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,150
they simply disappear.

235
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,250
In the editor formats.

236
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,250
We can change the colors.

237
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,410
Probably another good idea mess.

238
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,230
You tend to use one machine exclusively all the time because every time you go to a new

239
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,790
machine,

240
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,450
you'll be faced with the default colors.

241
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,040
So if you want to,

242
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,380
you can click and specify what text looks like when it selected.

243
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,150
So that's it's normal appearance.

244
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:35,670
Do you want era text to be a color other than red and the break point text that we saw when

245
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,410
we would discuss in there This option bought her data tips.

246
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,950
Do you want the yellow highlight or do you want another highlight?

247
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,990
So,

248
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,350
as a general rule,

249
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,900
you'll want to leave all of these using the default colors again,

250
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:58,050
We have comment text as green so you can easily distinguish comments from ordinary code.

251
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,780
He would text things like End with end sub,

252
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,180
which are basically components of E B A,

253
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,650
rather than names that you have created for your own variables or literal text and so forth

254
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,350
on these going to dark blue.

255
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,170
Okay.

256
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,640
The other thing,

257
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,060
of course,

258
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,250
you conduce is to simply change the forms and size.

259
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,120
So courier issues because it's a mono spaced fund,

260
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,950
which makes it easier to get things toe line up.

261
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,350
Um,

262
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,940
and obviously if 10 if size,

263
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,670
tennis and comfortable you may like to increase that size.

264
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,150
Teoh.

265
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,940
Make it easy to work with,

266
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,120
then in the general Tab,

267
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,950
we have two main types of options.

268
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,350
We've got options relating to use of forms and working with those.

269
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,550
And then we have options relating to the handling of errors.

270
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,510
User forms.

271
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,440
Air used for customized interface is very straightforward there,

272
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,710
covered in detail in Section seven,

273
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,830
that just to show you quickly,

274
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:10,050
we can insert eight years of form and you'll notice that we have a grid on the user form.

275
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,050
So as we create in various controls,

276
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,650
such a strike zone pool your name.

277
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,700
This is a label control,

278
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,160
and then next to it,

279
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,050
we might put a textbooks control to the user to enter their name.

280
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,080
And as we work in with these controls,

281
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,450
the grid makes it easy.

282
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,590
It's a line them up so we can customize the grid space in,

283
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:43,150
and we can just specify how tight we want agreed to be.

284
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,130
So,

285
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:45,940
for example,

286
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:58,610
we might have 10 by 10 and you'll see we've now got a looser great let's just put that back

287
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,750
to the default so again.

288
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,160
I won't mention all of these options.

289
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,660
I won't discuss these options at this point when we come to the section on debugging and

290
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,850
error handling will have a look at them there.

291
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,620
These last two options here quite straightforward.

292
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,810
Show tool tips on collapse Project hides windows.

293
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,850
Uh,

294
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,670
when you hover over each of these,

295
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,150
you'll see it displays a tool tip.

296
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,510
And why would you not want that?

297
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,770
So if we switched that off General show tool tips And this time,

298
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,850
when we hover over the each of the tools,

299
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,750
no tool tip appears.

300
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,850
So I would imagine most of the time you'd want to leave.

301
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,650
This switched on.

302
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,760
Let's just reinstate show tool tips.

303
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,730
And finally we have here collapse project hides,

304
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,460
windows,

305
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,260
and all this means is when I click to collapse a particular project.

306
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,150
All of the windows related to that project disappeared,

307
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,850
so I had a couple of windows open.

308
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,100
As soon as I expand back,

309
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,670
they come,

310
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,020
and if I go to the window menu,

311
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,050
I can see them here,

312
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,840
and this is quite useful,

313
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,770
especially where you've got several projects open several workbooks open,

314
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,440
and obviously each workbook contains a project So you end up with lots of windows open as

315
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,170
you close or collapse.

316
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,450
Each of the project the windows related to that project will disappear.

317
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,300
A commitment easy to find your way around.

318
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:39,610
The final tab is simply docking.

319
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,450
And this relates to the way in which you can position the various floating windows,

320
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,360
which are available under the view menu so you can see by default.

321
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,210
They're all DACA ble once,

322
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:52,740
for example,

323
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,760
bring up the project sort of the properties window and it stopped on the side here.

324
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,080
So for some reason,

325
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,470
I wanted to dock it somewhere else.

326
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,510
I could just pick up,

327
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,660
knew that now it's docked at the bottom.

328
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,940
Now,

329
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,600
if you wanted above the project,

330
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,760
I could docket here and then made.

331
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:21,120
It suits normal position below the project so that behaviour is normally fairly useful.

332
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
You might want it to be switched off.

333
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,180
Perhaps if you're working on dual monitors and you want to sort of keep different windows

334
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,350
on different monitors.

335
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,480
But as a general rule have in the dock in features by useful in makes it easier to keep

336
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,550
your screen nice and tight and tidy.

337
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,930
Okay,

338
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,720
so those are the various options that you can set.

339
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,500
As I said,

340
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,500
there are a couple of them,

341
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
but we haven't discussed.

342
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:56,410
Just remind you require Variable Declaration will discuss in Section three,

343
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,160
which is coming up the next section.

344
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,450
Very first video.

345
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,660
We'll talk about that,

346
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:10,500
then Auto data tips on the options here all relate to error handling and debug in which the

347
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,710
topics discussed in Section eight on them.

348
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,930
I don't think we'll say any more about the form groups settings.

349
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,260
That's fairly straightforward.

350
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,300
So it relates to use of forms basically what you discussed in Section seven.

351
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:42,210
The settings in the Tools Options Editor tab allow you to dictate which auto completion and

352
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,570
help messages displayed.

353
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,300
Apart from the annoying auto syntax check,

354
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:55,720
it's best to leave all these options activated settings in the Tools Options Editor four

355
