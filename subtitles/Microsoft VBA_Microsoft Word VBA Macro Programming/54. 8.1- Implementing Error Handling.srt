1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
before you share your macro solutions with colleagues or clients,

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,820
it's always a good idea to think about shielding them from any unpleasant surprises on one

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,540
of the standard unpleasant surprises possible with Macros is that your users will encounter

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,270
sister mirrors when they try to run Your Mac.

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,600
Rose in this video will discuss ways in which you can implement error handling techniques

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,670
to prevent users from encountering such errors.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,930
We'll also discuss debugging techniques that you can use to track down these errors in the

8
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,760
first place.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,750
Let's go into the Section eight folder,

10
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,740
and here you will find that we already have a macro to work with.

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,550
Before we discuss this macro,

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,250
let's just talk a bit about what error handling attempts to achieve.

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,850
And the first thing to point out is that error handling really is designed to deal with run

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,030
time errors kind of Aris that people who run your Mac Rose may experience syntax and

15
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,390
compilers should be cleared up long before you get to the stage of actually thinking about

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,050
era Hedley.

17
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,250
So let me just remind you what syntax and compile hours are.

18
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,970
Let's just create a temporary sub.

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:42,620
Let's create a variable called STR and instead of type in strength,

20
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,950
let's make a deliberate typo put strength.

21
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:55,490
Then let's do another type SRT instead of str equals input box.

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:03,550
Please enter your name on.

23
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,340
Let's deliberately forget to close the parentheses now as soon as I leave this line,

24
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,120
of course,

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,750
the syntax era is indicated and that line will stay red until it's corrected.

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,150
So that's very straightforward.

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,510
The two compilers will be picked up as soon as I test.

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,850
The macron is the first usually find type not found.

29
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,410
There is no such thing as strong,

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,820
so that's reset and correct that one.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,250
And then we run again.

32
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:45,010
Variable not defined just to remind you the thing that's flag in,

33
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,160
that is the option explicit.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,150
So this means that I have to define or variables.

35
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,190
And of course,

36
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,440
I didn't define this.

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,750
I defined this so there We have examples of very straightforward syntax and compile errors

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,750
,

39
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:10,260
and these you'll clear up long before you think about actually releasing your solutions and

40
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,550
sharing them with your colleagues or your clients.

41
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,150
You may need to use some of the debunking techniques,

42
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,770
which will be discussed later in this section in order to track down some of the compile

43
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,080
hours,

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,650
but most of them common sense will actually enable you to solve them.

45
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,750
So let's delete that nights now turn our attention to run time errors.

46
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,870
These the more serious errors on the kind of errors that you want to shield your audience

47
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,350
from.

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,570
So in this macro,

49
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,950
what's happening is that we are first of all opening up the document,

50
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:54,250
and the document in question is accessed from the folder that contains this document.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,000
In other words,

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,430
our word.

53
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:56,770
VB.

54
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,050
A training template.

55
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,690
Let's have a look at that document.

56
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,400
It's in the section eight older and it's called Students Schools,

57
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,850
and it contains a table with number one exams taken and total school.

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,250
Al Macro,

59
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,160
first of all,

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,850
opens this document,

61
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,250
and it does so based on its location and the name of the file,

62
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,450
and then loops through the table,

63
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,650
starting on road to,

64
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:42,620
And it calculates the school the sort of average school by dividing the contents off column

65
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,540
three by the Convents off column,

66
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,050
too,

67
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:54,270
and then calculates a grade based on the school that it's the average called.

68
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,350
It's calculated.

69
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:02,810
It then works out the great to the personal and finally rights that grade into column four

70
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,970
off the table so it's taken.

71
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,750
Column three.

72
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,300
United it by call them,

73
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,750
too.

74
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,710
Calculating the Great based on that average pop in the grade into column four.

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,650
So let's see it working when everything's in place.

76
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:28,850
So where we run it populates The Falls column with the appropriate grade.

77
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,050
Now it's close without saving.

78
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,350
And let's think about situations where if someone else was running this macro,

79
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,750
they could get an error.

80
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,790
And,

81
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,170
of course,

82
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,230
the most obvious one is it.

83
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:48,580
The file in question is not in place or if someone has put it in the right folder,

84
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,980
but given it their own name,

85
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,500
let's just simulate that situation.

86
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:00,750
Let's remove the S so the file no longer exists.

87
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,440
And,

88
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,090
of course,

89
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,800
when we run,

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,740
we get a run.

91
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:13,070
Fine ERA number 5174 And this time we have a fairly user friendly Arab message,

92
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,410
it explains.

93
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,050
We come and find your file.

94
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,330
Maybe it was moved,

95
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,650
renamed or dilated,

96
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,950
and then it gives the path to the file that it's trying to open.

97
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,960
In spite of it being fairly friendly this time,

98
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,150
we don't really want the user to be exposed to this title era,

99
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,350
and it's this kind of situation.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,250
That era Hamlin is designed to prevent.

101
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:45,530
What happens when in error occurs was determined by a statement called On era Go to and the

102
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,670
default statements which kicks in.

103
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,000
If you make no provision for error,

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,850
handling is on error.

105
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,550
Go to zero.

106
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,120
So,

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,930
in other words,

108
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,850
go to a non existent line.

109
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,050
Heads,

110
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,190
let V b A.

111
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:08,650
Let's just put a comment in here that vb a handle errors.

112
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,140
And if you do nothing,

113
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,420
then on error,

114
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,910
go to zero is the statement,

115
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,050
which is in effect.

116
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,500
So the only time you ever need to use on their ago 20 is if you yourself have taken over

117
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,720
error handling and you then want to reinstate the default behavior.

118
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,130
Let V b A have letters from that all so clearly,

119
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,780
with or without this statement,

120
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,350
if we run it,

121
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,710
we know we're gonna get V B.

122
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,550
A displayed an era.

123
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,050
So let's just take that out of the picture.

124
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:51,050
Just make it into a comment line and let's look now at how we can take over error handling

125
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,350
shield the user from the visual basic editor.

126
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,250
I'm just display a user friendly era message.

127
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,850
So handlers ourselves,

128
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,850
we use the statements on era.

129
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,190
Go to label.

130
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:15,250
Onda label basically is a name which you could give to any points within a sub procedure.

131
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,450
Haven't created a label.

132
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,590
You can at any point say,

133
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,340
go to that label to use this technique in normal programming.

134
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,770
This very bad practice and the only time you should use it is in this type of error

135
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,040
handling that we're discussing.

136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,830
So first of all,

137
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,820
we come up with a name for the label on one just called era.

138
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,260
Happily,

139
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:44,660
the usual restrictions for names apply no spaces letters on Underscore character,

140
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:53,250
only the position where you place your labels should be just above the end sub.

141
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,490
So I just put in the name that I've said.

142
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,750
I'm gonna use error handling and to tell baby it's a label you simply put a kulak.

143
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,540
So whenever you say go to Sara Hamlyn,

144
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,450
it's going to go to that label and execute the lines that follow that label.

145
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,550
And let's just display an error message.

146
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:35,450
Let's have VB critical as the buttons style.

147
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,850
I'll go to simply takes us to our handling.

148
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,250
So if this is always put,

149
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,990
the next thing that's gonna happen is the end of the celebrity.

150
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,950
So we test our code again,

151
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,650
we get our message cannot continue,

152
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,750
and that's an end of it.

153
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:07,030
One thing to bear in mind is that there's nothing special about this line.

154
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,470
It's still part off the sub procedure.

155
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,350
So in the normal circumstances,

156
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,450
the compiler will actually get to this line.

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,150
If there isn't an error and it will display this under normal circumstances,

158
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,240
let's just prove that well,

159
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,550
I'm just going in here and reinstate in the S so that the name is now correct.

160
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:40,710
So this time our error handling won't kick in drugs because it's part of the subroutine.

161
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,950
This line is still going to execute.

162
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,430
Let's just test that so it opens the file.

163
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,070
As you can see,

164
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,910
it's popped all the grades incorrectly.

165
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,250
But because this line is part of the subroutine,

166
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,650
it's still displays the era so clearly what we've got to do is to stop that from happening

167
00:10:59,650 --> 00:10:59,650
.

168
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:07,370
Let's just close the students schools without saving and to stop it from happening,

169
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:16,950
we simply need to make sure that we always exit sub prior to the era handling label.

170
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:34,450
Let's just put a comment in there and then let's test again.

171
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:48,850
So this time it opens the file pockets the great in but doesn't display the Arab message.

172
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,920
Okay,

173
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,260
so that's a very basic technique that you can use to implement error handling in the next

174
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,250
couple of videos.

175
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,840
Well,

176
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,510
look at a few permutations on this basic theme.

177
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:13,450
Let's just do one last thing before we finish this video that's going to tools options.

178
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,950
And then in the general time you'll see here,

179
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,310
we've got this protracted section and by default,

180
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,230
break on.

181
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,480
Um,

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,350
handled errors is switched on.

183
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,880
So this means,

184
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,410
basically that any time you override the default on our go to zero v B,

185
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,850
A R handling won't kick in.

186
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,900
If your code includes those statements,

187
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,630
all reviews the statements on Eric Co 20 Then,

188
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,160
of course,

189
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,340
V be able handle errors if you have ever handling in place.

190
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,910
But for debugging purposes,

191
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,150
you want to deliberately look at every single error.

192
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,240
Then you can override your own our handling by switching on this option,

193
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,650
break on all errors.

194
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,150
This,

195
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,570
of course,

196
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,750
means that any time you have got error handling,

197
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,450
it simply ignored VB a handles or errors.

198
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,040
And of course,

199
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,350
it's then very important that you remember that you have got this option switched on.

200
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,870
And when you've finished your debugging session,

201
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,250
you'll then go back to break off level errors.

202
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:23,070
Another typical situation is where you get a client or colleague who's reported that they

203
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,890
constantly get in errors,

204
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,050
which take them into the visual basic editor.

205
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,200
Even though you know you have our handling in place annual solution and it's worth checking

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,650
with them by talking them through,

207
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,480
just ask them to look in tools.

208
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,700
General see which Aaron trapping option is currently set on the machine that they use in

209
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,830
and obviously,

210
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,130
if necessary,

211
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,110
Anson to put it back to the default break on handled errors.

212
00:13:49,110 --> 00:14:05,880
The statements on air ago 20 is used to reinstate Phoebe a default error handling,

213
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,310
whereby a system error messages displayed in the visual basic editor.

214
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:19,820
The statements on air ago to label is used to transfer code execution to the label.

215
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,380
All labels should be placed at the end of the sub procedure and the statement exit.

216
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,590
Some should be placed above each label to prevent the code that follows them from executing

217
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,590
.

218
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,300
When no errors are encountered
