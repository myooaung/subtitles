00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.710
This section has been a while about reference in objects within the word object model.

2
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.950
In this video will discuss on alternative,

3
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.720
which is to activate and select the objects that you want to work with rather than created

4
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.650
references to them.

5
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.120
And this is the technique used by the macro recorder.

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.780
In this video,

7
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.450
we'll look at wides a bad idea to imitate this technique when you're right in your own code

8
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.450
.

9
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.180
So for this example,

10
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.950
let's go into the Exercises folder into the Section six folder,

11
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.450
and that's open up the word file the tables file that we worked with earlier.

12
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.980
So here we've got the result of run in Ah,

13
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.250
last macro.

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:10.050
Let's go into developer on the macro I want to focus on is referencing objects.

15
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.960
So here we want to manipulate two types of object.

16
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.250
We want to first of all,

17
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.550
ensure that we working with a specific document,

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.250
and we do this by setting a reference to it inside an object variable and in general this

19
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.050
is the most efficient way off manipulating specific objects,

20
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.450
you create a reference to them and then you can manipulate them to your heart's content.

21
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.150
Similarly,

22
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.350
when we want to work with the tables within that document.

23
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.750
What we're interested in doing is mortifying the tables.

24
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.770
So we create a range object and we populate this range object with a reference to the first

25
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.850
cell of the first table that we manipulate inside Al Luke.

26
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.860
We can then use the text property of the range object and the next method of the range

27
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.640
object to efficiently target each so on the second row of each table and modify the text

28
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.750
inside that cell.

29
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.910
The main thing that makes this approach so efficient is the fact that at no time do you

30
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.650
have to activate the document that you want to work in.

31
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.780
And at no time do you actually have to select any of the cells inside of which you're

32
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.150
insert in your text.

33
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.890
So when you write code,

34
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.450
this is the most efficient way of style in it.

35
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.850
You targeting the elements that you want to modify or manipulate.

36
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
But you never activate all select them.

37
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.430
So basically,

38
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.750
this is the correct way.

39
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.280
But it's also worth looking at the more inefficient ways off working because you will

40
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.350
encounter a lot of word VB a code that uses this technique.

41
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.880
The technique is based on the weather.

42
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.500
The macro recorder produces its code for obvious reasons.

43
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.050
When your recording a macro,

44
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.850
the only way you can get something to happen is to perform that step.

45
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.450
So if you want to target an object in a particular document,

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.850
that document has to be the active document.

47
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.150
If you want to change a certain paragraph of text,

48
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.810
that paragraph has to be selected.

49
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.590
And in our case,

50
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.250
if you want to put some text into a table cell,

51
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.450
that cell has to be selected or activated before you can do so.

52
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.450
So let's begin by making a copy of this subroutine.

53
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:54.420
I'm just gonna go into full procedure view so I can make sure I paste it in exactly the

54
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.250
right position.

55
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.470
And then,

56
00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.920
of course,

57
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.850
we have to rename it.

58
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:09.050
So we now in Tutorial Five and let's call it simply selecting objects.

59
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:17.650
What we'll do is we'll modify the code to imitate the kind of code that the macro recorder

60
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.520
would produce.

61
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.750
A lot of people actually,

62
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.050
having started with the macro recorder,

63
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.380
continue to write their code in this manner on it does mean that you end up with code,

64
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.790
which is far more inefficient than it could be before we actually write that code.

65
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.810
Let's use this macro to clear the table.

66
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.560
So to do that,

67
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.950
we simply have to put the null string on each of these lines.

68
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.400
So,

69
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.780
yeah,

70
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.550
quite quotes on here again on here and finally here.

71
00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.550
So we're going to basically just loop through all the tables again.

72
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.380
But this time we're right in nothing into the cells,

73
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.350
effectively deleting the contents.

74
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.750
So let's run that trust on.

75
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.450
Just verify that it's work.

76
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.650
Okay,

77
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.850
so you've got a tables blank once more.

78
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.750
Now let's look at deliberately write in code,

79
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.050
which is Univision's.

80
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.030
So this tutorial is basically showing you what you should avoid doing,

81
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.330
what you'll encounter and see other people doing.

82
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.550
But what you yourself should have would like the play.

83
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.050
So let's switch across to procedure view.

84
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.350
So if we're imitating the style of code in use by the macro recorder,

85
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.710
the first thing is we wouldn't be using object variables.

86
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.580
So let's lose doc tables and instead,

87
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.850
what we need to do to work with a document is to activate it.

88
00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:02.430
So here this assignment statement would go on having identified the document that we want

89
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.850
you would then use don't activates.

90
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.380
And thereafter,

91
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.430
any time we want to refer to that document,

92
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.350
we would use active document in the same way we wouldn't have a range object.

93
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.580
And what we would do is tow activate,

94
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.350
each sold we want to work in,

95
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.050
send it here.

96
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:36.350
We would have active documents and then here cells worm don't select.

97
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.770
So that targets the first.

98
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.810
So I actually selected it rather than creating a reference to it.

99
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:52.120
And when I'm bangin it is just to switch back to reference in objects and grab this code

100
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.150
one small so that we have actually got the contents that we want to write into their cells

101
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.150
.

102
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.350
Now it's just based it over here.

103
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:08.610
So having made a selection every time we want to write to it,

104
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.050
we would then be used in selection dot text equals.

105
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:19.350
So let's change the 1st 1 And then we could just copy that reach of the other lines.

106
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:37.490
So as it stands,

107
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.250
of course,

108
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:44.350
the only sell that we've selected is the first soul on the second row off each table.

109
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.250
What we now have to do is that have been written into that first cell,

110
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.150
we have to select the next cell alone.

111
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.950
So to do that,

112
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.370
if we generated the code by recording a macro,

113
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.850
we would press the tab key or the right arrow key to move from cell to cell.

114
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.250
And the code which would be generated by the macro recorder,

115
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.350
would be something along these lines.

116
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.110
Says selection.

117
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:20.150
Don't move right by which unit so unit covered on equals.

118
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.970
And then w d cell would be the built in in,

119
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:31.250
um that we would use to say that we're moving right in units off table cells.

120
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.240
And then the second thing would be,

121
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.220
How many units do you want to move?

122
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:35.650
Right?

123
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.950
So that would be count.

124
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.230
Come on,

125
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.750
equals And,

126
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.300
of course,

127
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.750
one.

128
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.150
So before we put text in each of these,

129
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.550
we would have this line or moving rights.

130
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:59.030
So let's just copy that now we just need to paste it in front,

131
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.650
solved each of these lines,

132
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:08.050
okay said before each writes operation,

133
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:16.850
we have the move operation to make sure that we select the correct cell now effectively

134
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:22.920
were only modifying four tables with this code so there's not a huge overhead in terms of

135
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.340
the consequences or write in code,

136
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.650
which is slightly inefficient.

137
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:31.350
But from the point of view of automation of Microsoft Word,

138
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.610
you can imagine that as the projects that you work on become larger.

139
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.530
If you get into the habit of using this technique of always activating the things that you

140
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:40.800
want,

141
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.150
Teoh manipulate,

142
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.780
you will write code,

143
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.850
which takes an age to run.

144
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.530
And obviously,

145
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.450
um,

146
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.440
your macros,

147
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.380
they're not going to get a very good reputation.

148
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:59.660
So this macro basically gives us an example or coding techniques that should be avoided at

149
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.550
all costs.

150
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.630
Hopefully,

151
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.650
it still runs.

152
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.150
And the thing to note when it runs,

153
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:12.350
we start off with January selected at the top here.

154
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.210
And of course,

155
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.250
what's gonna happen is that the macro is gonna obey every command that we've given it.

156
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.110
So we've said select one.

157
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.550
So moved one.

158
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.730
So moved once.

159
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:24.990
Oh,

160
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:31.980
and all those steps basically will be laboriously obeyed and performed in the user

161
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.850
interface.

162
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.580
So let's just run.

163
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.150
It's still fairly fast because obviously it's not.

164
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.650
We haven't asked it to do very much.

165
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:47.250
You can see scrolled all the way down to December when we finished with that soul selected

166
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:59.420
throughout the course will be using object variables to create references to all of the

167
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.150
objects that we want to manipulate.

168
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:05.120
So this video basically is just to show you a couple of techniques,

169
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:11.060
which you will see as alternative methods to the methods that we use in in these tutorials

170
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:11.060
.

171
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.590
But I just want to explain to you why we're not using them and why.

172
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.450
I think you should try and avoid them,

173
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:30.150
creating a reference to each object that you need to manipulate with your code.

174
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.410
It means that your macron's will execute more quickly.

175
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:41.170
Since your code does not rely on interacting with the user interface instead of selecting
