ï»¿1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.080
the Earth object spelled E.

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.350
R.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.790
R.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.350
Is a resource that's built into VB A,

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.090
which provides information on errors as they occur.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.150
In this video.

7
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.570
We'll look at how you could use this resource to your advantage.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.650
To add flexibility to your error handling code.

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:38.210
Let's go back into the Section eight model and let's begin by taking a copy of the macro

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.850
that we used in the last video.

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:01:01.690
Now let's rename it So it's now macro 0804 I will just call it object and that switch

12
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.350
across to procedure view.

13
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.170
We have a look in the object browser we'll need to go into the V B a library,

14
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.650
and he will find the object.

15
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.450
And the two properties that will be using are the number,

16
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.150
which provides an excellent mechanism for identifying which type of object has occurred.

17
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.000
And the description,

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.610
which provides a sometimes not very user friendly error message,

19
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.350
attempted to tell the user what's gone wrong.

20
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.800
For so far.

21
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.650
Our code caters for two possible errors.

22
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.330
One is that we're attempting to set a document variable to a document that's not currently

23
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.950
available.

24
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.390
We can instigate this error simply by modifying the name.

25
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.090
So this document we know doesn't exist.

26
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.360
And if we do the same here in our second bit of error,

27
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.950
handling will also kick in in order to see what the arrows are.

28
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.070
Let's then display both the error number and the description,

29
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.560
so I'm just gonna put the line a mystery books.

30
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.690
Ah dot number.

31
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.400
Let's put a separator.

32
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.240
I'll put a hyphen and then the description.

33
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.830
Let's also put the same line,

34
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.260
you know,

35
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.650
error handling section,

36
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.050
perhaps just above the existing message box,

37
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.330
which displays are user friendly.

38
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.150
There a message.

39
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.550
So both of those errors should now kick in because of the changes we've made here.

40
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.450
Let's just test that.

41
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.930
So there's our first error number 4160 bat file.

42
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.310
Name is the description,

43
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.440
and here's our second.

44
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.210
This time it's a bit more user friendly.

45
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.300
Erin Number 5174 Sorry we couldn't find your file,

46
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.350
etcetera.

47
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.620
And,

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.970
of course,

49
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.240
I Mexico cable get out.

50
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.350
User friendly are a message with the baby critical.

51
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:26.830
The number property of the object provides an excellent mechanism for allowing your code to

52
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.260
actually do different things,

53
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.650
depending on which error occurs at the moment.

54
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.150
The code kind of assumes that the only thing that could go wrong is the file D and missing

55
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.150
.

56
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:47.220
What we can now do is to say we only want to display that if it's a 5174 if dot number

57
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:57.700
equals 5174 So let's modify our code and just make it conditional we'll use a select case

58
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.550
you.

59
00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:18.130
So this is gonna be case 5174 And obviously we could test for as many different cases as we

60
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.750
want to.

61
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.810
And then at the end,

62
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.850
we would say case else and we can put a generic error message.

63
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:33.750
So let's copy this message.

64
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:48.130
And in fact,

65
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.650
we can now make this one a bit more specific.

66
00:04:50.650 --> 00:05:11.750
Let's now add in the number and description to our generic error message.

67
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:26.220
So this would need to go in here So we'll start with a return and perhaps then open

68
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.550
parentheses that I'm just gonna paste in the era number,

69
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.910
the separator on the description and then close parentheses.

70
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.080
And,

71
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.440
of course,

72
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.060
I've left an extra message box in here that was on the clipboard.

73
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.650
So we just want the number on the description So we test now.

74
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.550
Obviously,

75
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.050
it's gonna be a 5174 at this point,

76
00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.590
and this user friendly message books should kick it.

77
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:08.860
But not before the 1st 1 kicked in.

78
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.150
I forgot about that 1st 1 so this obviously needs to come out.

79
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.880
So let's test again.

80
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.060
So we get our sorry.

81
00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.440
The required file can't be found because we've now tested for a specific type of error,

82
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.450
a current thanks to adult number.

83
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.760
So let's now try and introduce a different type of error.

84
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:43.150
We can fix these ones by put in the correct names back in so they won't generators anymore

85
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.150
.

86
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.750
But let's just open up the file.

87
00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.570
It's in the Section eight sub folder,

88
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.020
and it's cool student schools.

89
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.210
Let's introduce an era into the actual data.

90
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.150
So if we put zero exams taken,

91
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.750
total school zero.

92
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.250
When this line that calculates the grade is being executed,

93
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.010
we should then get an error.

94
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:19.370
And thanks to the code that we've got down here because it's not a 5174 we should get these

95
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.050
lines of code being executed,

96
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.910
and they,

97
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.590
of course,

98
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.350
will tell us what error number is in play.

99
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:35.750
So Let's run and we see scenario number six overflow.

100
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:44.990
So we can now think of a strategy for handling Erin number six.

101
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.950
So we have a look at the document.

102
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:56.010
What would probably want to do is to simply skip past Charlie Ross without giving him a

103
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.550
grade and move on to Liam Grant.

104
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:07.350
So let's just don't do those changes and see if we can adapt our code so that these lines

105
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.850
are only being executed,

106
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:20.330
Providing that DOT number is not currently equal to six and we can do this by using a

107
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.440
1,000,000,000 flag.

108
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:28.120
Let's begin by declaring a 1,000,000,000 variable.

109
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.950
We'll call it Bill and Skip.

110
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.980
And then before the line that does,

111
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.650
the calculation will make sure that BLN skip is always said to false.

112
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.850
Yeah.

113
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.960
Next,

114
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:52.350
we can adapt our select case statement to cater for er dot number equal six.

115
00:08:52.350 --> 00:09:00.650
So here we can say K six and we want to do two things.

116
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.810
First of all,

117
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.950
we want to make sure that BLN skip it's set to true,

118
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.310
and secondly,

119
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.340
we want to resume next.

120
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.270
In other words,

121
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:16.950
we want to continue code execution on the line following the line that generated the era

122
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:26.600
and then finally we want to make all of these lines conditional,

123
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:33.050
so I'll just tap them in a man above.

124
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.410
UM,

125
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:40.330
we test the value of BLN skip So we only want the following lines to be executed if BLN

126
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.150
skip is still false.

127
00:09:42.150 --> 00:10:01.150
So with each iteration,

128
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.650
Yellen skip starts.

129
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.650
Life is false.

130
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.420
We attempt to execute the problem line.

131
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.610
If there is an era bln,

132
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:21.010
skip switches to true and there is you next statement takes us onto this line which tests

133
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.970
bln skip and only if BLN skip is still falls.

134
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:26.640
In other words,

135
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.050
no error was generated.

136
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.150
Do these lines actually get executed?

137
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.620
Now?

138
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:48.200
Let's test our code so we can see that Charlie Ross has simply been skipped and everyone

139
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:55.990
else has been given the great and we could have caused Go back and implement the same

140
00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:04.060
technique to avoid having to use one error Resume next so you can see basically that using

141
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:12.310
the object and especially not number is a great way of making your error handling code much

142
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.100
more flexible.

143
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:25.960
The object is built into V V A that is automatically populated with information.

144
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.500
Whenever an error occurs,

145
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:34.970
the er doc number property could be used to verify which kind of error has occurred,

146
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.460
allowing each separate cyber very to be handled differently.

147
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:45.970
The ER doc description Property could be used to provide a default description of errors,

148
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.150
which your code does not explicitly handle.
