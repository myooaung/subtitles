00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.980
in this video,

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.610
we'll look at a statement which effectively allows you to tell the b A to simply ignore any

3
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.170
errors that occur an attempt to carry on as though nothing's happened.

4
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.450
Although this technique is not good for general error handling,

5
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.440
as we'll see in this video,

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.410
it definitely has its uses.

7
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.250
Let's go back into the Section eight model.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.350
Let's take a copy of the macro that we worked with in the first video.

9
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.350
I'm just going to copy and paste the whole thing.

10
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.350
A man just modify the name of the copy to be now on tutorial three.

11
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.200
Now that's cool.

12
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.450
It resume next.

13
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.950
So in the first video,

14
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.720
we discussed how you implement user friendly error handling by using the on error Goto

15
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.210
label.

16
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
We just use the label era handling the on air.

17
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.330
A resume next statement simply instructs Vehbi eh to ignore the era on going to the next

18
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.800
line.

19
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.280
Now,

20
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.770
of course,

21
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
this is no good for general purpose error handling,

22
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.560
because when an error occurs,

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830
the user gets absolutely no feedback.

24
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.910
Things just don't work,

25
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.640
probably from the user's left,

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.050
not knowing what's going on.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.170
Let's look at what would happen if we replaced the on air ago toe era handling with on our

28
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.610
resume.

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.250
Next,

30
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:55.620
let's introduce an era and watch what happens with me.

31
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.850
Attempt to run the macro.

32
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.550
Absolutely nothing.

33
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.450
This line fails,

34
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.150
so the document doesn't get opened.

35
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.730
And,

36
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.360
of course,

37
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.250
none of the other stuff works.

38
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.850
But because with the activated our handling by using on Emma on our resume next,

39
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.500
the user doesn't get any feedback.

40
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.100
They simply have a macro,

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.350
which doesn't work.

42
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.750
Let's on do our changes.

43
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.150
And let's look at a situation where on error resume next is actually useful.

44
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.050
Let's say that we want to cater for the possibility of the document that we want to open

45
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.810
already being open.

46
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.550
Before we perform these steps,

47
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.330
we can attempt to set DOC schools.

48
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.650
Our document variable equal to documents.

49
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.850
Students schools dot doc ex because we know that's the name of the document.

50
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.250
So I'm just gonna copy that.

51
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.010
Let's just put that light in and paste in quotes.

52
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.480
Yeah,

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.380
so of course,

54
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.950
this line won't execute because this document isn't currently open.

55
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.820
And since it's prior to the line that says on air ago to our handling V B A.

56
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.790
Will handle the era.

57
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.810
Forests safe.

58
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.650
I run now.

59
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.320
You'll see.

60
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.050
It tells me bad file name.

61
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.140
I'm when I debug,

62
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.050
it goes to the problem line.

63
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.450
So this is a situation where I can say what?

64
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.660
If any area does occur.

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.720
I know exactly why the error occurs.

66
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.950
It's because the document isn't open.

67
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.680
So what I can do is to say on air a resume next.

68
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:13.710
What I can then say here is if Doc Schools is nothing.

69
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.990
In other words,

70
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.750
if this line failed,

71
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.750
go ahead and open doc schools.

72
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.490
But of course,

73
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.350
if doc schools is not nothing,

74
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.910
this means that this line succeeded.

75
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.030
Hence,

76
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.150
there's no need to open dog schools.

77
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.850
So let's just put an if statement around this line.

78
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:44.410
Then we can tap these lines in and put.

79
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.680
And if and just to remind you this statement is nothing is a special statement that you can

80
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.250
use with objects is equivalent for a numeric variable of saying equal to zero,

81
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.950
or for a string variable of saying equal to the null string.

82
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.850
So if the variable hasn't been set,

83
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.130
this means that this line failed because the document wasn't open.

84
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.450
Hence it's appropriate to attempt to open the document.

85
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:21.850
Let me just reinstate Lee error.

86
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.960
If we now run the macro,

87
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.350
our error handling will kick in.

88
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.250
But this line won't actually calls a further era.

89
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:43.850
I don't know if I then take out the era that everything runs normally.

90
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:53.750
Let's just close the document and let's now reopen the document in its pristine state.

91
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.640
So in deep,

92
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.890
arcane and air handling,

93
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.690
we have students,

94
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.350
schools.

95
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:11.270
So this time this line should work ends.

96
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.650
This line doesn't need to be executed.

97
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.740
And again,

98
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:29.380
everything work smoothly and let me finish by emphasizing that on air A resume.

99
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.350
Next is being used here specifically to suppress errors on this line.

100
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.600
And it's very important that after using the statement,

101
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.450
you count amount the statement by using on error.

102
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.610
Go to our handling as a very minimum.

103
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.980
You should use on error.

104
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.050
Go to zero,

105
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.020
which means that at least the user has the benefits of VB,

106
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.050
a errors kickinin when something goes wrong instead of simply leaving them hanging.

107
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.860
But best practice,

108
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.700
obviously,

109
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.960
Still,

110
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.250
handlers yourself display user friendly error messages,

111
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:13.240
but it's very important that once you've suppressed a specific error that you know is not a

112
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.420
problem and that you're happy to ignore you immediately.

113
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.030
Reinstate proper error handling and with on error,

114
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:30.460
goto label the on air.

115
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.840
A resume next statement causes V B A.

116
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.760
To ignore way nearest that occur in an attempt to continue code execution from the next

117
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.150
line.

118
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:45.340
The on air Easy um next statement should only be used to suppress a single error whose

119
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.270
cause is known,

120
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.590
and it should immediately proceed the line of code,

121
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.900
which will generate the era.

122
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.960
The line of code which may cause the error,

123
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:03.550
should always be followed either by the statement on air ago 20 to reinstate VB A's default

124
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.290
error handling,

125
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:12.200
or preferably by on air ago toe label to reinstate your own user friendly error handling.
