1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,270
in this section,

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,380
we look at the VB a statements which are used to control the flow of execution within your

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,090
Mac rose.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,150
Their two main types of statement.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:27,220
Conditional statements allow you to control with Siris of steps have performed depending on

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,250
the result of conditional tests.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,980
The second type of statement is a loop which allows you to efficiently carry out a series

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,850
of steps several times,

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,050
and we'll begin by looking at if statements.

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:50,050
So let's go into the Section five model and let's create our first macro.

11
00:00:50,050 --> 00:01:00,790
I will call it simply if statement let's begin by looking at the structure of an if

12
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,250
statement.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,650
The basic structure is as follows.

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,710
If we used the key word,

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,820
it's followed by a logical test in other words,

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,220
a test which can only result in either true or false,

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,450
followed by the keyword Then.

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,030
Then we put the statements which will only execute.

19
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,250
If the test is true,

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:29,630
then we have the option of put in the keyword else.

21
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:40,140
Then we can put a series of statements which will only execute if the test is false and we

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,250
then closed the of statement with the keywords and if Let's take a simple example.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,410
Let's say that we want to have an application which will only run if the user is used in

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,850
Microsoft Word 2007 or later,

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,110
the statement that allows you to test the version of world that's being used his

26
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,650
application dot version.

27
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:13,260
So if I go into the immediate window imply question mark application version because I'm

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,280
using word 2013.

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,710
When I press enter,

30
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,050
I get 15 20 warts.

31
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,050
Now this result looks like the single day to try it,

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,550
doesn't it?

33
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,950
Because it's gonna decimal,

34
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,450
so it can't be an integer or along.

35
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,820
However.

36
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,500
In fact,

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,250
it's a strength.

38
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:37,250
So if I look in the object browser moved down to application,

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,950
don't version.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,450
You'll see it's a property,

41
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,850
which returns a string.

42
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,560
So when using this statement,

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,750
if I want to do a comparison such as Greater Band,

44
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,550
I first need to read this value into a numeric variable.

45
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,850
Let's look at how that would work.

46
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:10,360
So let's dim introversion as in Georgia and weaken venues the valve function to generate a

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,450
numeric value based on the string that we've just seen.

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,530
So this is a data variable,

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,950
so it uses the keyword Let which is we knows option also be admitted.

50
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,750
Introversion equals application version,

51
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,550
and we then just wrapped the valve function around that.

52
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,450
So I've been converted that into an insurgent.

53
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:43,800
We can then test whether it's greater than or equal to 12 because the number 12 denotes

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,230
were 2007.

55
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,220
14 denotes word 2010.

56
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,680
So we simply say,

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,040
If introversion greater than or equal to 12 then so that's our test,

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
and we'll just put one statement.

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,980
If truth MST box,

60
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,750
Welcome to the application else.

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,880
A mystery box.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:21,700
This application is designed word 2007 or later,

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,550
so we'll see if we running on this machine.

64
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,950
We should get this message.

65
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:35,150
This version of in if statement caters for only two possibilities.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,780
If the test is true,

67
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,850
we carry out one set of statements.

68
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,440
If the testes false,

69
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,750
we carry out another.

70
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,680
However,

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
there's a second variation,

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,510
which allows you to cater for as many eventualities as you want to do this.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,270
You use the keyword else.

74
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,780
If,

75
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,060
as an example,

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:59,200
let's create a macro which will calculate a grade based on a school entered by the user.

77
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:11,710
Let's just switch across to procedure view and let's dim in school,

78
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,650
as in Geagea and SD ah grade.

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,800
As strength,

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:36,950
we can then populate in school by the user using an input box and again we can use vow.

81
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:45,510
So now we can use an if statement to evaluate in school and to populate.

82
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,950
Str grade accordingly,

83
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,650
so we'll start with the highest values.

84
00:05:49,650 --> 00:06:06,090
If in school is greater than or equal to 80 then str grade equals a next we want to test

85
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,980
for Be on.

86
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,010
Let's say that B is between 70 and 80.

87
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,910
To do the second test.

88
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:26,430
We use Elsie so it's greater than or equal to 70 and and we can't simply say and less than

89
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,950
80

90
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:40,760
We have to repeat in school less than 80 and we also have to repeat the keyword then and we

91
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,180
can then just copy this line B A c okay,

92
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,880
and a So you see,

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:59,880
we would be looking at greater than or equal to 60 Lesson seven c and then that day created

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,450
honoree was 50 less than 60 and the final test will be full e,

95
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:18,170
which would be greater than or equal to 40 and less than 50 and anything less than 40 will

96
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,450
then be in F So we don't need a test for this.

97
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:36,700
It becomes the else and we end the statement with and it having populated str grade we can

98
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,650
now output it.

99
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:52,110
So let's simply say message box a school Volver I understand in school Abbas ends gives us

100
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:02,050
a grade happy sand str grade and the sand full stop and that's tested.

101
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:23,090
It's a little saved and run Man Center score of 75 Store 75 gives us a great be when using

102
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,800
an if statement to handle two possible outcomes,

103
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,880
use this Intacs if test then statements.

104
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,950
If test is true,

105
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,790
Pells statements it testes false.

106
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:43,640
And if when using an if statement a handle more than two possible outcomes.

107
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:51,370
Use this in tax if test one then statements if test one is true else.

108
00:08:51,370 --> 00:09:00,290
If tests to then statements if test to its true etcetera else statements.

109
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,550
If all above tests of false and this
