00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.250
so that completes the interaction between the various controls themselves.

2
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.250
So now we really want to focus on the buttons when the user has made their choices.

3
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.640
The cancel button is straightforward.

4
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760
That just means changed my mind.

5
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.740
So we just want to get rid of the form,

6
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.350
basically.

7
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
So we double click on Cancel Click is the default,

8
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.630
which is what you need for a button on.

9
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.790
We simply say unload.

10
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.360
May me,

11
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.870
of course,

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.550
is this keyword that we keep using every time we want to refer to the form,

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.160
so that if we take our code to a different form,

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.150
it still functions because me will refer to that new form.

15
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.900
Now we come to create.

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.290
So here we're interested in reading the choices that they've made Andi use in those choices

17
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.950
to generate a new document.

18
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.520
So the values we're going to read are the text,

19
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.100
both the title in the order and the attributes associated with them.

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.890
The font,

21
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.390
the bold,

22
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.630
the italic and,

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.990
of course,

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.910
the size and the other thing will need is the book size which option button have they

25
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.650
selected?

26
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.590
So let's declare our variables so well.

27
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.000
Dim D O.

28
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.350
C.

29
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.080
book as documents and to right inside.

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.930
It will dim R N g book as range,

31
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.090
and it would also be a good idea to create a couple of single variables to hold the values

32
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.960
for the with and white of the book based on the option buttons that the user chooses.

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:10.250
So let's dim SNG with a single on SNG height as single.

34
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.330
So there are variables.

35
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:22.530
Let's first populate our document variable so sets don't book equals documents.

36
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:31.350
Start add on sets or injury book equal to Don't book that range.

37
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.350
Let's then calculate the required within height for the book.

38
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.070
And,

39
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.430
of course,

40
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.950
to do that,

41
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.250
to use an if statement.

42
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.120
So if I may got opts and we'll just do them in the same order and Mr Listed Point only

43
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.050
eight I don't value it is true.

44
00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:01.050
Man SNG with equals five Sng Heights,

45
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.850
he calls eight,

46
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:22.550
and then we can just copy that and inside and else and inserts 25 25 and then 0.25 0.25

47
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.300
that we can copy this again.

48
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.710
Now we want 5.5 8.5 on.

49
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.950
If it's none of the above,

50
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:47.150
we won't s entry with to be six and sng height to be nine.

51
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.760
And I think it might be an idea to actually have 58 at the bottom since that's our sort of

52
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.950
prefer default.

53
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.440
So I'm just gonna switch these around.

54
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.570
So if we make this five eight,

55
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.890
then we can have six line here.

56
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.250
Not a big deal.

57
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.350
But it just seems logical that if five biases our default,

58
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.120
that should be the value which actually kicks in on the else safe.

59
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.350
None of the above the truth.

60
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.750
Then the default becomes the else.

61
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.380
So that's the size sorted out and were then ready to use the paid set up object to apply

62
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:40.750
those attributes so we can use them with statements with TOC book No paid set up and with

63
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.410
Let's Start With the Page with and height Docked Age Heights he caused.

64
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:48.470
And of course,

65
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.650
we can't simply say sng height because that would be treated as points so we can use this

66
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.980
useful function interest two points on,

67
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.850
then SNG height goes in parentheses.

68
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.470
Then we do the same for the wit,

69
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:17.270
and then we can do the margins.

70
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:28.750
Don't left equals month went to five.

71
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:39.250
And then let's just copy those for top and bottom,

72
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:49.950
so we'll have top as 1.25 bossem as one.

73
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.280
So that's how documents set up.

74
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.510
You know,

75
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.950
we can put some content in it.

76
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.970
We sets our are N G to be the range inside the book,

77
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:00.140
which,

78
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.570
of course,

79
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.630
is a blank range.

80
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.610
Hence is equivalent to the flashing cursor.

81
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.450
The insertion point so we can simply say orangey book,

82
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:23.910
no text equals made up txt title value and perhaps follow that with the VCR carriage return

83
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.880
and also proceeded with a couple Cree VCR after sand,

84
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.950
the VCR on the side.

85
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.620
Then we can set the front.

86
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.350
So let's say with orangey put,

87
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:46.960
don't hunt So not name we can read from me.

88
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:56.760
Don't CEO title from the size may not txt.

89
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:14.520
Title size valued the bold May don't chk title be and the metallic So that's the title

90
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.250
sorted out.

91
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.250
And then we've just got to insert the author at the end.

92
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.560
Possible collapse.

93
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:34.380
The range orangey book Don't Collapse Direction W Day collapse and and then we'll insert

94
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:51.750
out text and we can use exactly the same pattern to format it so here.

95
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.000
I'm just going to use replace control.

96
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.650
Late Skytel author Selected texts Replace all.

97
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:07.050
So let's save journalist test.

98
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:34.550
Let's make it 36 points and 18 There's on your document,

99
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.650
but I can't scroll down because my dialog box is still visible.

100
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:45.050
So the final thing we need to do is to make the dialog box go away.

101
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.650
Once we've created the new document,

102
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:54.250
so cancel for the moment and just add the unload me line that we saw earlier.

103
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.270
So unload me.

104
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.950
Let's get rid of our unwanted documents.

105
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.350
There's Ah,

106
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.050
Skytel and author,

107
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.550
and I'll just add in a line to actually center all of that.

108
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.610
And then we're done.

109
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.750
So let's just put it here.

110
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.450
Orangey book.

111
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:30.200
Don't paragraph formats don't alignment equals center on that.

112
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.950
We can just do one final test.

113
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:49.940
There we are.

114
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.040
And just before we finish,

115
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.470
let's create a macro which can show the form.

116
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.650
So we're going to modules section seven.

117
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:09.910
So this will be sub Yes,

118
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.220
dear.

119
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:16.190
705 I so form on,

120
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:44.370
and it's gonna bay this form Not so Double click in a user form.

121
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.480
Control creates an event handler which uses the default event for that control.

122
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.900
If this is not the required event,

123
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.350
choose another event from the procedure dropped down in the top right of the code window

124
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:08.690
and deletes the default event procedure to synchronize the value of a spend button with

125
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:14.280
that of a text field at a line of code to the change event procedure of the spin button.

126
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:20.150
Using this syntax text box name dot value equals spin,

127
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.850
but in the name dot value,

128
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:30.200
similar syntax can be used to read values from combo boxes to text feels etcetera.
