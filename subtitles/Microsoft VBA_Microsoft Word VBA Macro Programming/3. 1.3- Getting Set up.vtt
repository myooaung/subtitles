00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.760
in this tutorial will be download in and install in all of the exercise files that will

2
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.150
need to complete.

3
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.100
The various practical tutorials during the course will also be installing a global template

4
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.070
or added inside,

5
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.150
which will save all the macros that we do during the tutorials place.

6
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.450
In all,

7
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.230
our code in this global container will make it easy for us to access.

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.380
Run and test our code from any word document.

9
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.550
To download the exercise files,

10
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.450
switch across to the download section at the top here.

11
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.750
This is a ZIP file,

12
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.050
which contains all of the documents that will need for the course sensibly.

13
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.150
Click the download it,

14
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.050
and if your browser lets you,

15
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.110
then choose the location,

16
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.350
so I'm going to choose the guest op.

17
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:20.050
So here's the file that's been downloaded and it's a zip file.

18
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.820
Civil needs one.

19
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.250
Zip it.

20
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.020
Remember that you don't need any special software to unzip a file on Windows.

21
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.750
You can simply choose right click open with Windows.

22
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.410
Explorer just made this across,

23
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.550
and you can then use copy and paste.

24
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.950
Or you can simply drag the folder out of this window into another location.

25
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.700
Mr.

26
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.150
Striking out holes in the desktop.

27
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.440
And,

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.850
of course,

29
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.860
this doesn't move it from the Zip file.

30
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.550
It simply copies it to the given location.

31
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.950
That's dumb,

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.980
Andi,

33
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.230
if you want to,

34
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.000
you could then delete the ZIP file.

35
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.550
It's no longer required.

36
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.450
Here are our extracted files.

37
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
Now let's look at setting up the ad in which will be using throughout the course to store

38
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.450
all the macros we create inside the train In Folder,

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:24.630
you'll find two files with the file extension D O T M and these other word templates,

40
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.650
their global templates or Adan's.

41
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.190
And what we'll do is we'll save all of our code in the because these files a templates when

42
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.360
you want to edit them,

43
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.450
you can't simply double click if I double click on a template.

44
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.280
Work gives me an untitled document based on that template rather than open in the template

45
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.950
itself.

46
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.940
If I want to open the template itself,

47
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.950
I have to right click and she was open.

48
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.020
Or of course,

49
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.650
I could use file open and admit that way.

50
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.550
But the key thing is,

51
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.050
is you could see this is not an untitled version.

52
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.750
This is the document itself,

53
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.830
so we'll be referring to this document throughout the course and saving most of the

54
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.520
microbes that we create in this one document in order to test the Mac Rose Weaken set this

55
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.950
up is a global template.

56
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.050
You have to be inside word to be able to do this,

57
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.850
but the template itself doesn't have to be open.

58
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.950
So just to prove that I'm going to close it than to set it up is a global template.

59
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.250
I go to file options,

60
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.060
then in the word options dialog on the left,

61
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.650
click on the add ins category.

62
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.450
Next,

63
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.550
choose manage,

64
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.450
word added and click Go.

65
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.790
We want to have our fire listed in this section,

66
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.450
Global Templates and Adan's.

67
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.750
So we click on the add button.

68
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.950
Word takes us to the templates folder.

69
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.450
We simply ignore this location and let's go across to the desktop.

70
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.850
Open up the Exercises folder,

71
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.250
and we can now install out templates.

72
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.460
The first file,

73
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.350
the one that will be using currently has no Mac rose in it.

74
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.750
It simply has containers waiting for us to create the macros if you want to,

75
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.050
you can also add in this 2nd 1 which has the completed version of all the macros,

76
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.810
so you could add both of them and then activate whichever one you want to work with by

77
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.750
clicking on these checked boxes.

78
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.590
So for the moment,

79
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.150
let's leave them both activated and click OK,

80
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.850
and let's quick word.

81
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.950
Now when we go back into a word,

82
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:07.450
I just want to show you that those templates won't be activated.

83
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.950
If you click on options,

84
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.950
add IDs.

85
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.750
Word Adan's you'll see they're listed,

86
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.000
but they've become deactivated,

87
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.310
and this is the normal behavior inward.

88
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.950
And this is probably the most convenient solution,

89
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.010
because after all these macro czar the training,

90
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.350
they're not macron's that you're actually using in your own work.

91
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.820
If,

92
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.240
however,

93
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.050
you would like to have this ad in permanently activated,

94
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.550
word does enable you to do this.

95
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.960
Any template,

96
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.950
which is saved in the startup folder,

97
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.250
will automatically be activated by any launch word.

98
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:54.250
Let's just cancel to find the location of the startup folder,

99
00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:01.650
simply go to file options and then click on the advanced category.

100
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:10.050
Scroll down and right at the bottom.

101
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.650
You'll find file locations,

102
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.050
and at the bottom again,

103
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.250
we have the startup location,

104
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:26.450
so we click on modify this takes us to the default because I haven't changed it,

105
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.220
and I could man just click at the top here and copy this address.

106
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:42.850
Let's close and cancel And then back in Windows Explorer,

107
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:48.950
I could paste this in press enter and that takes me to the startup folder.

108
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.190
No,

109
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.850
I can move back and forth between these two locations,

110
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.550
and if I want to,

111
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:09.250
I could now copy these files into the start up location.

112
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:22.860
Macro saved in an activated added,

113
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.390
are available to all documents opened inward.

114
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.700
The macro enabled,

115
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.650
adding called GCS word VB.

116
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.060
A train in dot d o T.

117
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.360
M will be used as the container for the Mac Rose.

118
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:46.760
We will create in these tutorials to activate an ad in use the command file or office

119
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.020
button word options.

120
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.970
Adan's Manage Word,

121
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.580
Adan's Global Templates and Adan's
