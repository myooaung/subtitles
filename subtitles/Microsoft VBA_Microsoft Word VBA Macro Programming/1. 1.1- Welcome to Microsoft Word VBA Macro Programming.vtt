Hello and welcome to Gamble Computer Solutions Word VD,

2
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.290
a macro program.

3
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.910
Video tutorials.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.630
In this course designed to give you a worthy ammunition,

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.000
you'll need to start creating your own custom Macron's to automate Microsoft Word

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.820
operations.

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.380
Would users decide to learn maybe a programming for a variety of reasons?

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.550
I want to learn word VB a programming so I could make myself totally indispensable to my

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.040
company.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.090
I want to learn word.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360
Deviate for Jeremy to enhance my career.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.000
I don't have a record macros,

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.250
but I can't write that grows from scratch.

14
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.790
I want to learn word BB A programming save money.

15
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.540
We've had some bad grocery for our company automate document creation,

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.860
but trouble waas that for every single modification we've gotta paint outside company,

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.200
I wanna learn word BB,

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.440
a programming toe automate one very time consuming operation that I have to do at the end

19
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.350
of each month.

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.050
Whatever your reasons for wanting to learn BBMak Rose,

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.050
this course aims to equip you with everything you need to know to get started.

22
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.560
We'll begin with a brief look at the macro recorder.

23
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.760
We'll discuss its benefits and limitations,

24
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.550
but we'll very soon move into words visual,

25
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.050
basic editor and begin right in our own Mac Rose.

26
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:45.070
We look at the use of variables both to keep track of data and to store references to

27
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.710
Microsoft objects such as documents,

28
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.680
paragraphs,

29
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.380
tables.

30
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:58.490
Anything which you may need to manipulate with your code will discuss how to make your

31
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.110
solutions.

32
00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.600
Markkula,

33
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.760
by writing and calling separate sub procedures and functions way learn how to use

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.730
conditional logic to enable your code to branch off in different directions,

35
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.490
depending on the circumstances it encounters on how to use the loops to carry out batch

36
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.150
processing,

37
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.990
such as Before Miniseries of Steps on Every Filing a Given folder.

38
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:32.780
Once we've looked at these essential Phoebe A techniques will move on to an examination of

39
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.660
the word object.

40
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.640
The programmatic representation of all the various elements which are manipulated by

41
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.280
Microsoft.

42
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.540
Word will discuss the Sin Jackson programming techniques used to target manipulates

43
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.220
Microsoft word objects.

44
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.920
Next we look a T gent programming and learn how to write interactive code,

45
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.350
which is triggered automatically when certain actions performed by the user,

46
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.340
both within word documents and in custom dialogues called user forms.

47
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.180
We'll talk about debunk in your code and how to use the tools available to track down there

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.310
is when they have crept in.

49
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.720
We'll also look a writing code,

50
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.610
which anticipates possible errors and handles them when they occur.

51
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.060
In short,

52
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.460
this calls will equip you with everything you need to know to confidently start right in VB

53
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.360
a Mac rose,

54
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.240
which automate procedures inward and which will enhance your own profile as a word user and

55
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.250
a word developer.

56
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.450
Let's get started.
