00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.740
having named all the controls with and decide which controls need to have code attached to

2
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.980
them.

3
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.680
So in this case,

4
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.750
we need toe have code attached to two controls.

5
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.930
One of them is obvious.

6
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.150
The okay button.

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.050
The user enters text into the various tax fields.

8
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.780
We don't want anything to happen at that stage when they click.

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.530
OK,

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.160
we then want to read the values from these tax fields into the document.

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.230
Meta information.

12
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.550
The document properties.

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.450
That's the obvious one.

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.350
The less obvious one is that when the former loads,

15
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.680
we want the current title subject or that,

16
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.690
and keywords to be loaded into the appropriate feels from the user interface from the

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.250
document meta Internation automatically into these text fields.

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.530
Now we don't want the user to have to click to make this happen.

19
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.120
We just wanted to happen instantly when the four loads on.

20
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.260
The way to do that is to attach it to one of the four events,

21
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.150
one of the events of the form itself.

22
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.930
So the simplest way to generate an event procedures we've seen is to double click on the

23
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.050
appropriate control,

24
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.650
so we simply double click on the form as opposed to one of the controls on the form.

25
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.130
So anywhere in the space between the controls,

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.620
basically I just double quick on.

27
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.020
What happens then is that the default event procedure is generated on the default event

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.490
procedure,

29
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.050
for the form is click.

30
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.020
Clearly,

31
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.250
this is what we want.

32
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.150
We don't want to have to wait for the user to click the four before it's updated.

33
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.850
So the default events on mess occasion is not the one we want.

34
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.120
By double clicking on the user form,

35
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.310
we've automatically set the object dropped down to use a form which means that on the

36
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.780
procedure dropped down with and have ALS,

37
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.300
the event procedures which relate to the use of form itself on the one that we need is

38
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.450
initialized.

39
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.370
This happens when B B.

40
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.150
A is actually creating the full just before the form is shown.

41
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.750
So let's choose initialize,

42
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.350
and then we can lose the default event.

43
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.550
Click so before the form is shown while it's being built in memory,

44
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:52.870
we want to display document properties in tech students,

45
00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.580
So having named our text feels and prefix them with txt to access them,

46
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.350
we then use this keyword me and that relates to the form.

47
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.950
And it's a good idea to use me as opposed to fr and properties,

48
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.250
so that if you work to move the code to another fall,

49
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.550
it would still work because me means the current form before that contains this code.

50
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:30.880
So me dot txt and let's student in the same order Title don't value I the text inside the

51
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.750
textbooks and we're now looking inside document properties.

52
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.000
So no prizes for guessing that it's gonna be inside the document object so we can say

53
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.360
active document,

54
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.410
not built in document properties.

55
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.110
We can then use one of the W.

56
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.550
D.

57
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.390
Denham's,

58
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.510
and they all start with W D property.

59
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.290
So W D property title.

60
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.620
When you type in these genomes there obviously,

61
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.350
sometimes difficult to remember.

62
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.730
A nice way of checking whether you've got it right is just a double click on it to

63
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.450
highlight it.

64
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.790
Then right click and choose definition.

65
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.010
If it exists,

66
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.010
the Object browser opens and it's then selected so we can see they're all the obvious names

67
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.010
.

68
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.740
They start with WD property,

69
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.750
and then it's the name of that particular property.

70
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:41.330
So we could just call me this line way that I did is just moved the cancer to the left when

71
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.190
it changes to that arrow that you can see that point in right,

72
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.580
You click once to highlight online that I do control,

73
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.040
see and then control V repeatedly.

74
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.350
So control V 123 full.

75
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.420
So we're doing them in the same order.

76
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:19.450
So it was subject on keywords.

77
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:29.350
So let's test it.

78
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.940
We'll save and then just go back into the word interface in,

79
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.450
uh,

80
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.450
advanced,

81
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.770
Um,

82
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.870
unless just put it in.

83
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.950
So I'm gonna put test.

84
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:58.450
So all four now have an entry.

85
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.670
Let's see if they're picked up and there they are.

86
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.350
So the first part is complete.

87
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.750
The second pound then is on the OK button.

88
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.650
When they click the OK button,

89
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.350
we want the values in the text fields to overwrite the values in the document.

90
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.870
So again,

91
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.480
we double quick on the OK button this time on.

92
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.650
What we want to do now is simply the reverse of what we did here.

93
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:36.950
So here we're assigning a value to each of the tax fields and the value Where is assigning

94
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.250
is each of the corresponding document properties.

95
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.520
So when they click the OK button.

96
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.950
We effectively want to do the opposite of this,

97
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.720
so we want to assign a value to the document property,

98
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.440
said the document.

99
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.750
Property goes on the left,

100
00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:01.850
so I'm gonna hold down the control key and just drag into that position on Just tap that in

101
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.750
equals.

102
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.850
And then I'm gonna control drag place.

103
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.740
So that's what we want,

104
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.350
the reverse of what we have here.

105
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:20.760
So it's set in the value of the built in document property to match the value that the user

106
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.550
has put in our text field.

107
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:28.350
Let's just do the same for each of the others.

108
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.700
Sanders.

109
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.630
He is in control.

110
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.750
Drag equals control,

111
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.350
drank.

112
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.150
I'm not sure if this is the fastest way of doing it back her.

113
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.350
It's as good as any other.

114
00:07:41.350 --> 00:08:03.050
The next thing we want to do is to get rid of the form.

115
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.350
Once it served its useful purpose,

116
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.410
you'll probably remember we did use a form dot show to make it visible.

117
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.550
And of course,

118
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.520
the opposite would be user form,

119
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.210
not hide.

120
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.400
However,

121
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.350
this hides the form but doesn't remove it from memory.

122
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:27.600
So better syntax is unload me may as we've seen can be used to refer to the form on unload

123
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.090
both hides it and removes it from memory.

124
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:36.650
Another thing that we should do is to save the document,

125
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.450
and I'll just show you why.

126
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:48.120
Let's just save out changes and close the document and then let's reopen it.

127
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:54.950
So here the titles that I put in last time,

128
00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.850
let's sound want to simply delete them all.

129
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.850
Click OK,

130
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.950
then I save my changes.

131
00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.150
And when I go back in,

132
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:15.350
the changes that I've made didn't register.

133
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.170
And the reason is simple.

134
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.050
I made a change to the document properties,

135
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.150
but I made no change to the document itself.

136
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:33.350
The change to the Document properties doesn't register as a change in its own right.

137
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.800
So if you've made no changes to the document on,

138
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.570
all we've changed is a document properties then the user will find.

139
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:48.230
But those document property changes have simply been ignored to show you that's true.

140
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.710
Let's click.

141
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.350
OK,

142
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.050
make a change to the document itself.

143
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.450
Save close.

144
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.700
And then when we reopened the change of the document,

145
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:05.890
properties did register because there was a changed in a document hands when we saved the

146
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.850
document property changes were saved at the same time.

147
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:14.960
So clearly it's a good idea to make sure that we save the document property changes as part

148
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.920
of our It's part of our code so that if they use the changes,

149
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.350
nothing else at least their document property changes have registered.

150
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.550
So let's get rid of that text,

151
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:36.090
go back into code the way to do this I'm just double clicking on the first of all the

152
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.670
object and then the form itself to get into code.

153
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:46.140
The way to do this is to use the saved property that we saw earlier.

154
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.450
You remember here we tested whether the saved property was true or false.

155
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.440
One of the nice things about this property is that you can actually change it for your own

156
00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.210
purposes.

157
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:06.050
So here we would say active document don't saved equal false.

158
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:13.050
So that's telling word this document needs saving because it hasn't been saved.

159
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.930
And unless we do that,

160
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.710
as we saw when we use the safe command,

161
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.440
if there are no physical changes,

162
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.850
if only document properties have been changed,

163
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.880
then ah,

164
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.510
it's not going to save the document.

165
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.860
But by doing this,

166
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.850
we're forcing it to save the document because we've told it the document hasn't been saved

167
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:32.850
.

168
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.650
So now when we say active documents,

169
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.750
we'll save.

170
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.710
It's always going to save the document,

171
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.750
even if there are no physical changes.

172
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.150
So let's test now,

173
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:51.790
so we just need to go in,

174
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.150
make a change.

175
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.840
It's like,

176
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.650
OK,

177
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.250
close.

178
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:00.630

181
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.750
