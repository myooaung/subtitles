1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,350
in this video,

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,160
we'll take a closer look.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,550
It created a use of form and at in various different types of control to the user form

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,950
we've already encountered.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:25,720
Labels and text boxes in this video will work with combo boxes,

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,630
option buttons,

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,420
check boxes and spin buttons.

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,970
Let's go into the Exercises folder.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,640
Let's return to a word VB,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,090
a training template and in the visual basic editor.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,050
We simply right click on the project and insert a user form.

12
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,250
Now we can start by set in the properties of the form itself.

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,750
Let's give it a name.

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,400
There were in Section seven,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,930
Tutorial four a.

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,350
Let's call it F R M Book because the theme that will be using is the creation of a book.

17
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,150
The user will be able to enter the title in the author of the book,

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,700
Choose the Size,

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,290
set the properties for the title and all the text on,

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,050
and then click OK to create the book.

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,750
Next we can enter a caption.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,150
It's always better than having it's say Use a form one.

23
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,250
So let's say create book.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,450
If you know you want to use a particular forms as the default,

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,290
then you can just click here into something different from the built in default off to

26
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:41,750
Homer,

27
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,280
we'll leave it as is similarly,

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,080
If you wanted a different text color,

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,250
then you could choose it from this drop down.

30
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,460
If you want a specific height and with you consigned them in where you can just use the

31
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,550
resize handles to resize is you go.

32
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,850
So let's go for 300 by 300.

33
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,410
And that is,

34
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:05,860
of course,

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,650
pixels.

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,750
So that's our form set up.

37
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,350
Now we can think about our controls.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,150
So the top I'm gonna have a large text box into which they contrite the title of the book

39
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,390
and then above the text box,

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,450
they'll be able to choose the font,

41
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,250
the size and whether they weren't bold italic.

42
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:37,290
So let's put a label in here that will be titled.

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:51,400
Then let's have a text box below that all the way across,

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,850
and let's limit the font size to 24 to 36 in increments of North 0.5.

45
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,720
So if 36 is the maximum,

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,150
let's say we want to have two lines of text.

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:12,790
You normally need something like 1.5 times the font size in pixels to accommodate that

48
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,750
particular size.

49
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:23,150
So we've got 36 as the max 1.5 times 36 is 36 plus 18 which is 54.

50
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,050
So let's say we want to lines of text.

51
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,150
That's gonna be 100 night.

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:40,360
So we set the height off the books 2108 So now above the box,

53
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,500
we want to have the formed attributes.

54
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,450
So I'm just gonna hold down the control key and just drag Sure you come across this in

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,480
other contexts,

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,950
control drag to copy.

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,350
And then this will be front and we won't next to it.

58
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,350
That dropped down for them to choose the front.

59
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,800
So here's the combo box that will give us a drop down,

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,400
and I'll just click to create it on reposition it and make it a bit wider.

61
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,850
Next,

62
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,950
we'll have the phones,

63
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:22,760
and what we'll do here is we'll have a text box first of all like so,

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:31,100
and this could be very swollen just wide enough to display two significant numbers and a

65
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,650
decimal,

66
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,920
and next to that will have this very useful control called a spin button.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,350
This is the control just here.

68
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,780
Let me show you how it works.

69
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,050
So we just drag out to draw.

70
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,950
To control the same height is the textbooks.

71
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:54,310
We could just not that up against the textbooks like so So the idea is the user is now

72
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,090
gonna be able to click on these tiny arrows to increase in,

73
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,550
decrease the font size,

74
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,350
and we'll lock the text box so they can actually type in the number.

75
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,840
And then finally,

76
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,390
here.

77
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,530
Let's have Boulder,

78
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:08,830
right,

79
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,330
Alec,

80
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,610
as check boxes.

81
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,750
So we click on the track box tool and create a check box,

82
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,420
which only needs the letter.

83
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,950
B for Bold doesn't need to be anywhere near its.

84
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,850
Why does that?

85
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:37,800
So we could just move that next to the boned size while it's highlighted.

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,550
I'm just going to go into the phones and make that bold.

87
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,690
Then,

88
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,380
having got the size correct,

89
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,050
I'm going to control drag to get a copy.

90
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,210
You'll probably find if you try control shift.

91
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,350
Can you see how the plus sign disappears?

92
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:08,030
So it's logical to assume that control shift will give you a copy aligned horizontally but

93
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,750
the original aligned vertically with the original.

94
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,000
But in fact,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,300
it doesn't work,

96
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,620
so you can just use the grid to align,

97
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,550
and then it's just controlling its own to copy.

98
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,150
So here we want Italic I,

99
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,080
and I'll just switch off bold on her metallic or a bleak.

100
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,850
Instead,

101
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:40,600
let's select all of those.

102
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,460
You'll notice that when you drag select,

103
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,250
you don't need to enclose the objects you want to select.

104
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,250
You simply need to define a rectangle which touches them,

105
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,330
and then that select all of them and use full.

106
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,850
That's the line bottoms.

107
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:09,890
So now we can copy all of these and modify it for the author.

108
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,700
So just drag select,

109
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,450
hold down the control key A and distract down to copy.

110
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:26,550
This now becomes author.

111
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,350
Or perhaps authors like so.

112
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:38,750
And let's say that the limits this time in terms of font size are going to be 14 to 24.

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,520
So 24 to the max 1.5 times 24 is 36.

114
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:54,450
And let's say we only need one line so we can set the height 2 36 and finally,

115
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,950
in this area at the bottom,

116
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,850
we can put our different book sizes,

117
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,750
so I'm just gonna control drag to get a copy of my label.

118
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:13,550
Let's just put in book size,

119
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,850
and this time we use in option buttons or radio buttons,

120
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,850
as they called in every other environment.

121
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,850
So let's just click to create the 1st 1 Ah,

122
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,850
let's change this to five.

123
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,750
My eight.

124
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,890
We can decrease the height slightly,

125
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,950
then control drag to get a copy.

126
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,880
Ah,

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:57,840
let's make the 2nd 1 5.75 by 8.25 We'll do four in total.

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,550
So let's copy these to control track to the right.

129
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:11,050
This one can then become 5.5 by 8.5.

130
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,550
And then finally,

131
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,850
this could be six by nine.

132
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,850
So those are full size is.

133
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,710
And finally,

134
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,770
let's put in ah,

135
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,150
couple of command buttons.

136
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,670
So this will be the okay button.

137
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,950
Let's make it creates.

138
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:48,250
Then we can take the size down control drag up and on the co P.

139
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,650
We could change the caption to cancel.

140
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,350
Let's just a line.

141
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,930
The bottom edges off these three Eisen's so I'm just gonna drag,

142
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,650
select and in the format menu.

143
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,210
I haven't actually gone over these options,

144
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,950
but they're very self explanatory,

145
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,550
and here we need a line bottom edges.

146
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:18,770
I think we have got a better result if the create button had moved up to align with these

147
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,150
rather than vice versa.

148
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:26,350
So let's don't do on the order of selection is what determines it.

149
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,650
So if I drag from left to right,

150
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,350
this is the last item to be selected.

151
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,250
And then when I do for Matalin Bottoms,

152
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,750
it moves up to align with these.

153
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,490
So that's our form.

154
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,710
Now we can think about renaming all the controls I say renaming because no control that you

155
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,050
had to use a form it's ever without a name.

156
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,440
The program simply assigns their name to the controls as you create them.

157
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,350
So textbooks one textbooks to label one label to etcetera.

158
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,030
So what we'll do is to name everything,

159
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,830
give everything a meaningful name.

160
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,620
So when we're working with code,

161
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,150
we can identify each item very quickly based on recognising the naming conventions that

162
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,850
we've used.

163
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,410
So even though we're not gonna actually do anything to,

164
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:27,250
the labels will still give them a name and we'll use the prefix lbl so lbl title,

165
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,250
lbl font,

166
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:36,150
or to be going precise lbl title funds.

167
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:52,620
I'll be a law tha LBO author Front and finally lbl size.

168
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:04,050
Then we've got our textbooks is T X t will be the prefix txt title and txt also.

169
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:11,300
Then we've got out two text boxes here said Txt.

170
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:17,650
Title size and txt author size.

171
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,100
Next,

172
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,650
let's to our combo boxes.

173
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,850
So CBO is a common prefix.

174
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:41,250
CBO title funds CBO author funds next less to our spin buttons.

175
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:49,230
