00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.100
the developer tap contains all of the options that you'll need to start working with.

2
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.970
Word B b A.

3
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.600
However,

4
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.700
when you first install word develop,

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.850
attack is not visible on the ribbon.

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.090
In this video,

7
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.850
we'll look at how to make the development tab visible.

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.560
Will also discuss how you can modify your macro security settings so that word doesn't give

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.760
you unnecessary warning messages every time you open macro enabled files,

10
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:55.060
which you yourself a development to make the developer time visible inward.

11
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.650
2010 in 2013 which is what I'm used in here,

12
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.140
you go to the file menu and choose options in the word options dialog.

13
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
Click on the customized ribbon category on the left,

14
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.350
then in the list of tabs on the right,

15
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.750
scroll down to find developer and simply click in the checkbooks to activate it.

16
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.650
When you click OK,

17
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.650
you'll see that you have an extra tab on the end of the ribbon called Developer Inward 2007

18
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.650
.

19
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:41.670
Go to the office button in the top left of your screen and choose word options here in the

20
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.750
popular category.

21
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.730
Activate the option show,

22
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.010
develop it out in ribbon and click.

23
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.550
OK,

24
00:01:49.550 --> 00:02:03.450
There are six groups of controls on the developer tab,

25
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.980
but it's the 1st 1 The code group that were mainly interested in clicking on the visual

26
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.150
basic button brings up the visual basic editor or VB,

27
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.450
and it's here that you'll write macros and edit them.

28
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.550
We'll start working in a visual basic editor from Section two onwards,

29
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.850
so you will soon become very familiar with it.

30
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:40.060
The code group also contains controls for playing Mac Rose recording and pours in them and

31
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.880
also for changing macro security settings will discuss recording and playing Micro's later

32
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.750
in this section.

33
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.530
For the moment,

34
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.150
let's talk a bit more about macro security.

35
00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:06.750
Let's go into the Exercises folder and into 01 getting started and then into project.

36
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.150
And here you'll find a couple of macro enabled files.

37
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.950
Double click on the 2nd 1 Recording a macro end.

38
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.710
When we opened the file,

39
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.750
word displays a security warning message.

40
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.090
These messages are quite useful for files that you yourself haven't created,

41
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.350
but if it's your own file,

42
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.550
it's clearly unnecessary to be given these warning messages.

43
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.050
So we go across to the developer tab.

44
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.380
Let's click on Macro Security and see if we can stop word from display in these messages

45
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.050
when we opened files which were perfectly happy to work with,

46
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.750
the simplest thing you can do is enable macros,

47
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.380
but this is not recommended,

48
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.850
and it's probably not a good idea because it means that you never get warned,

49
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.250
even in those circumstances where it might be useful.

50
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:13.390
A better solution is to go into trusted locations on the left and add the subdirectories in

51
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.270
which you're saving your files to your trusted locations.

52
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.250
So let's do that now.

53
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.210
We simply click on add new location.

54
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.150
Browse.

55
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.860
I've got my exercises folder on my desktop,

56
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:38.100
so I click on desktop and scroll down to word Phoebe a macro programming and then click OK

57
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.100
,

58
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.050
Very importantly,

59
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.650
we need to switch on sub folders of this location or also trusted.

60
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.750
Let me click OK,

61
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:57.180
click OK again and let's put it to the test So quick word and just go back into the exact

62
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.950
same file.

63
00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.450
And this time,

64
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.250
as you can see,

65
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.450
I'm not given the warning message.

66
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.350
Let's close the file,

67
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.110
and I'm just going to copy the same file,

68
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:23.550
go back to my desktop and just temporarily paste a copy at that location,

69
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:30.210
So this location is obviously outside the trusted location I've just specified when I go

70
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.780
back in,

71
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.450
here's my error message again,

72
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.350
which is just a zit should be.

73
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.050
That's just close word once more,

74
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.750
and let's delete this file.

75
00:05:43.750 --> 00:06:02.110
The developer tab is not visible on the word ribbon.

76
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.040
By default,

77
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.200
it has to be made visible.

78
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.520
Using the word options,

79
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.210
dialog,

80
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.120
the controls and the code group of the developer tab allow you to record,

81
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.870
run and edit macros.

82
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:23.890
Add in your VB A development folders to trusted locations provides a safe method of

83
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.940
overriding words.

84
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.990
Warning messages on macro enabled files.
