00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
Yeah,

2
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:15.150
in this video.

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.860
Well,

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.350
look at recording a macro and then edit in the code generated by the macro recorder.

5
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.670
Before you record a macro,

6
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.950
it's always worth thinking whether you actually need one.

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.820
For example,

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.890
there's very little point in recording a macro,

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.050
which does nothing but format your text.

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.850
You can simply create a style.

11
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.050
Similarly,

12
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.680
there's no point in creating a macro,

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.160
which does nothing but inserts,

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.340
um,

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.750
text on the page.

16
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.250
You can go to insert water text,

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.660
and you can save a selection to the auto text gallery and just insert your text whenever

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.680
you need it from the auto text gallery again.

19
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.230
You wouldn't create a macro,

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.540
which sends the same document out to several people because,

21
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.260
as you know,

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.950
word has a mail merge feature.

23
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.610
So the need for macros is really where you have something that's very labor intensive and

24
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.050
consists of several operations.

25
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.850
So we're going to take a very simple example of this.

26
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.950
Let's go into the Exercises folder and into Section one getting started,

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.550
and here you'll find a document called Recording a Macro.

28
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.610
In this example,

29
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.150
we're going to take the scenario where you're creating a publication but you received

30
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.450
documents from lots of different sources,

31
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.260
and some of these documents have typographic conventions,

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.150
which you don't want in your publication.

33
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.750
So to look at a few examples,

34
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050
let's switch on hidden characters.

35
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.550
And first of all,

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.070
you'll notice that after every paragraph,

37
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.690
we've got an extra return.

38
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.550
And this is a habit that a lot of people have,

39
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.950
which tends to create too much space in a publication.

40
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.720
Another form of doubling up is after its sentence.

41
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.850
We've got two spaces instead of one,

42
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.770
and again that's not really necessary.

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.150
It tends to draw attention to itself in the final publication,

44
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.370
and then a final example of something you might want to clean up is to hyphens instead of

45
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.750
the EM dash character.

46
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.950
So we want to record a macro,

47
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.550
which could get rid of all those typographical quirks in one hit.

48
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:03.250
Now let's go back to the main train in Folder,

49
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.650
and if you remember from the last video,

50
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.550
we're going to be saving all our code in this,

51
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.150
adding,

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.150
because Adan's are essentially templates inward,

53
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.160
you can't double click to open it,

54
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.450
you right click and choose open.

55
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.180
Then to record the macro,

56
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.680
we go across the developer and click on the record macro button.

57
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.750
We'll leave the default name for the moment and later I'll show you how you can change that

58
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.750
.

59
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.350
And then we'll specify that we want to save it in the template.

60
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.250
It actually says documents based on the template.

61
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.230
But of course,

62
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.330
we're going to use our template is and adding essentially rather than a template on which

63
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.750
other documents are based.

64
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.800
When we click OK,

65
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
we go into recording mode and you'll notice that the cursor changes.

66
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.250
And if you click with the left or right mouse,

67
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.750
nothing happens.

68
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.050
So when you recording the macro or cursor movement has to be done with the keyboard,

69
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.750
um selection has to be done with the keyboard and so forth.

70
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.780
So now we can go across to the home tab and use the replace command or,

71
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.150
of course,

72
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.550
speaker type control age.

73
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:33.750
So let's deal with the problem of two returns after every paragraph.

74
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.840
If we expand by clicking on the more button at the bottom.

75
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.150
Here we have the special pop up menu and right at the top paragraph mark.

76
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.010
So this code stands for a paragraph Markle Carriage return So we're looking for two of

77
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.950
those in succession,

78
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.150
and wherever we find that,

79
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.750
we want to replace it with a single paragraph mark.

80
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.050
That's our first replace all.

81
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.660
Now let's deal with two spaces.

82
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.750
After a sentence,

83
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.550
sentences can end with full stop close in parenthesis.

84
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.300
Question mark exclamation mark in a neat way of catering for all these different

85
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.080
possibilities would be to use a regular expression.

86
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.650
I don't know if you've come across regular expressions,

87
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.710
but since they were little complicated,

88
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.990
I don't want to get sidetracked for a multi doing,

89
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.410
which is recording that Cruz.

90
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.520
So we're going to do it in the most simple manner,

91
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.750
which is to do four separate replace operations.

92
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.670
So,

93
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.250
first of all,

94
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.700
we'll start with full stop all period,

95
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.850
as they say in the States.

96
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.750
Two spaces replaced with full stop single space.

97
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.250
Replace all next we'll have close in parenthesis.

98
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.470
Two spaces closing parenthesis,

99
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.420
single space.

100
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:08.490
Replace all question marks based space question mark one space and finally will do.

101
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.050
Exclamation mark.

102
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.980
Two spaces,

103
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.510
exclamation mark one space.

104
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.050
Replace all The fact that we're not finding anything is irrelevant.

105
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.820
All we want to do is to record the operation and the results we get will depend on the

106
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.270
document that's active.

107
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.710
When we run the macro,

108
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.960
the final change we want to make is an em dash.

109
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.240
We want to hyphens to be replaced with an em dash.

110
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.370
Now there is a short cut for doing this,

111
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.760
which we could use its control,

112
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.550
Ault and hyphen.

113
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.510
And it's got to be the hyphen on the numeric keypad.

114
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.710
Not on the main area of the keyboard,

115
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.050
however,

116
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.380
let's pretend,

117
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.150
but we've for gotten a short cut,

118
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.250
so we need to actually copy an em dash and paste it into the fine and replace.

119
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.350
If we did that,

120
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.170
we would actually record those steps so would have some extra editing to do before our

121
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.350
macro is usable.

122
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.080
However,

123
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.280
you probably noticed that there's a nice feature.

124
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.750
Let's just cancel this on the developer tab,

125
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.070
which allows you to pause the recording so you can pause it for as long as you like.

126
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.670
Go away and do something else.

127
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.790
Maybe someone's asking you to do some work in excel,

128
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.850
so you switch across.

129
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.500
Then when you're ready.

130
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.450
If you could remember where you got to,

131
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.350
you just hit the resume record a button and you're back in business.

132
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.170
So to get our em dash,

133
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.850
let's say we're going to insert symbol,

134
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.510
more symbols and special characters,

135
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.550
and here it is at the top,

136
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:50.250
so we'll just insert it close and put it on the clipboard.

137
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.210
We can't do a right click,

138
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.350
so it's control.

139
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.340
See,

140
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.860
or X would be better because we don't really want it.

141
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.550
So I'm just going to do it by going to home and hit in the cut icon.

142
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.060
Now,

143
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.380
before we go any further,

144
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.640
we go to develop resume recorder,

145
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.250
and now we can do our final replace operation.

146
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:22.650
So it's two hyphens in the find what and paste our M dash into the replace with box.

147
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.700
Replace all,

148
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.750
click OK,

149
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.950
and that's our final operations that we can now stop recording.

150
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:37.050
So we've got the macro recorded in our adding we can now save those changes,

151
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.950
closed the adding,

152
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:48.750
and let's go back into Section one getting started and open the document to what we want to

153
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.250
apply the macro.

154
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:57.210
You'll probably remember from the last video that unless you save and add in in the Starter

155
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.850
folder,

156
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.880
you actually have to activate it each time you launch word.

157
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:09.850
So we go to file options at its word,

158
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.300
Adan's and here's the one we're after.

159
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.650
So we activate that.

160
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.000
If for any reason yours is not in the list,

161
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.250
simply click on add,

162
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.340
navigate your way to the train in Folder,

163
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.850
The Exercises folder,

164
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.560
and then just choose GCS Word.

165
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.750
Levy a training dot D o t m.

166
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.260
Now that that's activated,

167
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:41.760
when we go to developer and look at the available Mac Rose by clicking on the microbes

168
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.020
Barton in all active templates and documents,

169
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.260
you'll see Macro one.

170
00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:47.820
If you remember,

171
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.090
that's the default name,

172
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.750
and we accepted it without changing it.

173
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.170
And then we run.

174
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.390
And then very quickly we've got everything cleaned up.

175
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.120
So single space,

176
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.620
after all,

177
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.250
sentences here,

178
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.640
we've got out em dash,

179
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.250
and we only have one return after each paragraph.

180
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.670
So let's close this document on.

181
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.850
We won't save the changes in case we need to test our macro again.

182
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:24.150
Let's move back into the main exercises folder and look at edit in the macro we've created

183
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.150
.

184
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:31.850
So we need to right click and open and to edit macros in the developer tab,

185
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.250
you click on the visual basic button.

186
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:43.690
Mac rose a store in modules these various modules will be using to store the macron's that

187
00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.070
will be created throughout this course above it.

188
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:53.280
We have new Mac Rose and this is the module that was automatically created by the macro

189
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:53.950
recorder.

190
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.650
So if we double quick it,

191
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.150
here's the code for macro one,

192
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.350
which is the macro that we recorded.

193
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.900
Now we're not gonna analyze the code.

194
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.410
You will get plenty of opportunity to analyze VB a code and to actually look at how it all

195
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.950
works.

196
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.390
So for the moment,

197
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:18.230
all we want to do is to move this code into our model and to get rid of the new Macron's

198
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:23.450
model that was automatically generated civil selected,

199
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.550
all and issues copy.

200
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.080
Move across to the model for this section.

201
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.850
Section one,

202
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.050
just double click and then we'll paste in our code.

203
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.870
We can now get rid of new Macron's by right.

204
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.310
Click in and choose in.

205
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.880
Remove normally when you're deleting something,

206
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.580
if you see a warning message,

207
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.880
it's almost always.

208
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.950
Are you sure you want to delete?

209
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.310
You click Yes,

210
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.050
and it goes ahead and elites This message is different.

211
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.800
What?

212
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.950
It's actually saying is,

213
00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.870
Is this an important model on?

214
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.750
Do you therefore want to export it before removing it?

215
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.650
Of course,

216
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.050
it's not an important module.

217
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.250
You don't want to export it.

218
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.420
So we ignore the default.

219
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:12.910
Yes,

220
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.600
let me click.

221
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.000
No,

222
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.550
the final thing will do is to rename our macro.

223
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:27.750
The rules are name in your macro bar that you can't new spaces.

224
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.150
You can use letters,

225
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.650
numbers and under school,

226
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.650
but you can't start with a number.

227
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.850
The convention that will be using its festival.

228
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.410
Which section we in?

229
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:50.580
So we're in Section 01 Which video tutorial is this It 05 and then which macro?

230
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.850
It's our first,

231
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.750
so we'll call it a.

232
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.350
Then we can put a short description.

233
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:03.950
And let's call this one clean up text because we're not allowed to use spaces.

234
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:09.350
Capitalizing the first letter in each word makes the name easy to read,

235
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.620
and that's it.

236
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.850
So we could now save our template,

237
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:20.350
and we can refer back to that code anytime we need it.

238
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:37.070
When recording macros left and right mouse clicks are not allowed,

239
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:41.950
you can pause and resume macro recording at any time.

240
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:50.130
Macron's that you record a placed in a module called Numac rose in the document or template

241
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.050
that you specify
