00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.250
having had a look at the role of the Project Explorer window.

2
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.920
In this video,

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.050
we'll have a look at some of the other available windows in the visual basic editor.

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.350
Let's go into the Exercises folder,

5
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.770
an intersection to and let's once more at it,

6
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.050
the template that we used in the last video.

7
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.470
So just right click and choose open and then developer and visual basic to enter the visual

8
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.350
basic editor.

9
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.320
And this time,

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.010
let's start with a clean slate.

11
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.400
Let's just close down every single window.

12
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.250
So we've established that the Project Explorer is usually the starting point.

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.580
So we bring that up and we condense.

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.080
See all of the objects,

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.110
which are available for attaching code to each of the documents that you currently call

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.550
open.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.180
The next type of window that you probably will encounter is a code window,

18
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.690
and there are a number of ways of opening code windows.

19
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.250
The simplest is to double click on one of these objects,

20
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.650
and that brings up the code window.

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.050
In the case of a form double,

22
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.850
click in simply opens the form,

23
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.410
so to get to the code in one hit,

24
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.680
you can right click and choose view code.

25
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.830
And,

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.230
of course,

27
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.280
in the view menu,

28
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.750
you also have code.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.160
The short cut.

30
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.950
As you can see there is F seven.

31
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.910
Each code window that you open doesn't close any of the existing code windows.

32
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.550
They simply accumulate on the right here.

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.600
If we look at the bottom of the window menu,

34
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.250
all of the currently available code windows could be accessed,

35
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.600
and you may well have come across the short cut for switching windows in other programs.

36
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.450
It's controlled and tab,

37
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.700
so you can see that as I press,

38
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.750
control and tab,

39
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.250
the appropriate object correspondent of the currently active window is also highlighted.

40
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.930
We'll obviously be doing a lot of work in the code window,

41
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.040
so you'll become very used to using it during this course moving down the View menu.

42
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.450
The next window we have is the object browser,

43
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.650
and this is a built in reference facility,

44
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.510
which enables you to check the syntax for all the VB,

45
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.850
a code that you may be thinking of writing.

46
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.810
The code is divided into different libraries.

47
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.180
So,

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.780
for example,

49
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.160
if you're doing something which relates to VB A itself rather than a particular program,

50
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.950
within the Microsoft Office Suite U two's Vehbi eh?

51
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.530
So here you'll find syntax,

52
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.710
which is common on which could be used when,

53
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.750
right in programs using Vehbi eh?

54
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.370
In Microsoft Word or Excel or Power Point.

55
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.880
So,

56
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.530
for example,

57
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.950
when we're dealing with the document object will discuss the file system object.

58
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.120
And this is where you would come if you wanted to check the syntax to see,

59
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.050
for example,

60
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.140
how to change the current directory past the command that does it.

61
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.370
Current directory.

62
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.630
C U R D I r herder When you want to work with word and of course,

63
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.850
you look in the word library,

64
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.010
and here you'll see all of the objects which relate to Microsoft Word.

65
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.380
So,

66
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.960
for example,

67
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.850
if you're working with a document object,

68
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.050
you can scroll down and check the available syntax.

69
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.950
So if you want to say the document,

70
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.260
you will go down.

71
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.980
Of course,

72
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.860
to say that,

73
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.220
as will save us to,

74
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.550
is it now is on here.

75
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.150
You'll get an idea of all of this in tax.

76
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.010
We'll talk more about the object browser in Section six,

77
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.690
the word object model.

78
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.480
You'll notice that the Object browser opens in the same areas,

79
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.250
the code windows and indeed it's displayed at the bottom of the window menu,

80
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.550
and you can switch to and from it when it's open,

81
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.350
using control in time.

82
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.480
The next section in the View menu relates to debug in,

83
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.740
so we have immediate locals.

84
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.760
Watch and call.

85
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.100
Stack will discuss these windows in detail in Section eight,

86
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.050
debug in and error handling.

87
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.470
For the moment,

88
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.950
I just want to mention that the immediate window is a bit more versatile,

89
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.650
as well as its role in debug in which will come to later.

90
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.650
It can also be used to execute a single line of code.

91
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.910
This makes it a very useful tool,

92
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.790
both for very fine or check in syntax,

93
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.450
and also just for carrying out a single action use in code.

94
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.980
I'll give you a very simple example.

95
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.350
Let's go back to Microsoft Word.

96
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.450
Just using this icon here or old 11 and then in the file or office button.

97
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.250
Let's choose options or word options on in the user name section.

98
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.650
You'll see I've got my name Grant Gamble.

99
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.910
As a user,

100
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.010
I have the ability to change this as well.

101
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.850
Let's see what it is so it's a property of the application object,

102
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.620
the application object being,

103
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.020
of course,

104
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.100
Microsoft Word,

105
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.400
which is read,

106
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.990
write.

107
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.550
And this is exactly how it works in code.

108
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.850
So in the immediate window,

109
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.750
if I want to read that property,

110
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.090
I would use a question mark and then application docks and no prizes for guessing it's

111
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.250
going to be using name when I press enter,

112
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.950
it shows me the user name because it's a read write property.

113
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.250
I can also change it.

114
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.950
So to do that,

115
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:16.970
I delete the question Mark I simply a sign a string because obviously this is a string

116
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:17.750
parameter.

117
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.560
I assign a string to it because it's a string.

118
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.840
It has to go in quotes.

119
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.110
So let's say just grant.

120
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.850
When I press enter,

121
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.450
that line is then executed.

122
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.250
So if I go back into word options,

123
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.160
you'll see the change has been made programmatically.

124
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:48.940
Let's just put it back to what it waas so as well as its role in debug in which will come

125
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.550
to later.

126
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.190
Just remember that that facility exists.

127
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.350
You can just execute a line of code to quickly check and set in,

128
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.220
or to check a parameter and it very often saves you having to create a macro for that

129
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.250
purpose or to use the recorder as we've done before.

130
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.590
Then we have the project explore,

131
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.440
which we've seen and the properties window.

132
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:22.550
So this basically allows you to choose to change attributes of the selected object.

133
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.750
So if we click on this document,

134
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:33.550
we have a lot of feedback basically relating to the settings off this current document.

135
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.150
But it's mainly with user forms that you'll be used in properties.

136
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.250
So whatever control I click on,

137
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:50.180
I can see a number of properties relating to that control like a neither view them as an

138
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.550
alphabetical list.

139
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.540
Or I can switch across to the categorized tab where the various attributes are grouped

140
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.550
under headings,

141
00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.300
and you have the ability here to collapse the headings,

142
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:06.840
which makes it much easier to sort of navigate and find the attribute that you're looking

143
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.090
for as well as this.

144
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.250
With years of forms,

145
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:15.800
you can choose the control from this drop down as well as obviously clicking under control

146
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.100
on the use of warm itself,

147
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.350
and it just switches across.

148
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.450
So if I wanted to change the name of my label for example,

149
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:30.780
the reason that the name hasn't been changed is because it's not going to be manipulated

150
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.500
programmatically so it's name is irrelevant.

151
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.060
But if it were to be given the name,

152
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.630
it would probably begin with L.

153
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.150
B L for clarity,

154
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:45.880
using a three letter prefix to indicate that it's a label Andi name because that's what it

155
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.070
relates to with models and class modules.

156
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.850
The only thing that you really change is the name of the module.

157
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.300
So let's say that this is going to be called main.

158
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.370
We then got a couple of options,

159
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.070
which relates specifically to use the form.

160
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.640
So if I highlight the user form,

161
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.150
they become available.

162
00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.310
On one is toolbox,

163
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.480
which we saw briefly,

164
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.750
which allows you to act controls to the form.

165
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.690
And then there's tab order.

166
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.110
And that's the order in which elements are highlighted as the user presses the tab key when

167
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.870
the form is visible on this form.

168
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.250
Because the cancel button was created after the continue button,

169
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.850
it's last in the tab order.

170
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:37.140
So to prove that if we run the form and I just press the tab key,

171
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.050
you'll see it goes throb the textbooks to continue and then to counsel,

172
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.770
which is not a big deal,

173
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.380
but to make things neat and tidy.

174
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.450
If we bring up tab order,

175
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:53.250
and if I simply click on Bt and cancel and move up,

176
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.850
it's now in a more logical left to right top to bottom order.

177
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.990
So when we run from this tax books,

178
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.080
we go the council and then tap again takes us to continue.

179
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:12.710
So that's a look at the various windows.

180
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:13.350
And as I said,

181
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:20.750
we will cover the debugging windows when we come to the debug in section in detail.

182
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:26.030
Then we've got four tool buzz the standard tour bars,

183
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.350
the one which is currently visible.

184
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.590
And if you're a word user who has been using one for some time,

185
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:37.550
then these tool bars will be very familiar from previous versions of the Microsoft Office

186
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.250
suite.

187
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.300
So we've got things like obviously,

188
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.450
cut copy paste on do,

189
00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.800
um,

190
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.850
play to run code on indeed to run a years of four.

191
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:56.320
And then we've got some icons here for making the some of the windows visible so they

192
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.350
duplicate the functions that we've seen in the View menu.

193
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.790
The Edit in Toolbar has options,

194
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.050
which refer specifically to code,

195
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.750
so soon as I switched to a code window,

196
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.090
then they will become visible.

197
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.540
I will discuss these options,

198
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.440
will use them as we go through the course and we start type in code,

199
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:30.890
will discuss them as we need them will discuss the tools on the debugging tool.

200
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:37.000
But when we come to the debug in section and the final toolbar is for user forms,

201
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:45.250
so I'll just switch back to the user form and it's got a few options relating to

202
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.450
structuring and formatting your controls.

203
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.100
So,

204
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.850
for example,

205
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.080
here I've got the ability.

206
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.550
If I wanted to group these together or to change the alignment,

207
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.700
so if they weren't a line,

208
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.390
I can tow line the bottom edges,

209
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:06.090
and I could make them the same with so whichever one I selected first,

210
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:06.950
I can't remember,

211
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.260
but that will become the basis of the common with,

212
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.550
and then when I choose that they will become that with.

213
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.090
So based on the results,

214
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.300
we can assume that I dragged from right to left when I selected it,

215
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.220
and the continue button was selected first,

216
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.650
and they both the same with as Theory Journal with on the continued up Let's just don't do

217
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.490
so.

218
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:30.600
Very straightforward.

219
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.750
So that's a quick look at the windows and tool bars that you have available.

220
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:42.800
I haven't looked at these interface elements in the next video will move on to look at

221
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:57.970
write in code code Windows Air used to create and edit code inside modules.

222
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.660
News of forms that this document object and class modules,

223
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.370
in addition to its role in debug in the immediate window,

224
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.250
could be used to execute a line of the V A code.

225
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:16.550
The Object browser is a built in reference,

226
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:20.760
which details this intact structure of the B A on the word object model.

227
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:28.530
The properties window is most frequently used when a sign in attributes to controls on a

228
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.350
news a form.

229
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:36.560
There are four tool bars available in the visual basic editor debug,

230
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.760
edit standard and use of forms
