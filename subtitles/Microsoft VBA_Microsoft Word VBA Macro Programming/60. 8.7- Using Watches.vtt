00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.320
in the last two videos,

2
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.140
we've seen how you can explore the values of expressions and variables by hovering over

3
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.880
different elements of code while you're working in break mode.

4
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.060
And also,

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.940
by using the immediate window in this video,

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.760
we'll look at a tool which is slightly more convenient and dynamic than these two methods.

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.650
The watch window.

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's go back into our debug in practice file and just open up on a module.

9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.250
Let's work with the same procedure that we saw before.

10
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.450
Let's say that we want to monitor the following expressions of values.

11
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.420
First of all,

12
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.850
we want to keep tabs on the value of I.

13
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.480
Secondly,

14
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.250
we want to know the number of tables still remain in using this document or tables,

15
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.050
not count.

16
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.650
Thirdly,

17
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.750
we want to know whether I is greater than this document dot tables not count,

18
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.590
which will indicate to us whether it's possible to delete the table whose index is the

19
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.850
current value of I.

20
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.480
And finally,

21
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.420
let's say we want to display the first paragraph within the table that's about to be

22
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.130
deleted because,

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.590
of course,

24
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.950
that's the name of the month.

25
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.450
We can add all four of these items as watches in the watch window.

26
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.930
To do this,

27
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.510
we display the wash window.

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.070
Like all the other floating panels,

29
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.190
it's under the view menu and the first technique we can use his dragon drop.

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.330
So if we want to monitor,

31
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.220
I weaken,

32
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.350
simply highlight it and drag it into the waters window.

33
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.950
You can also use this technique simply to save yourself some type in.

34
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.450
So we want this document dot tables not count.

35
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.650
We've got part of that code here.

36
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.370
So he contract that into the waters window and then simply edit the watch by right clicking

37
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.350
on it and choose in edit watch.

38
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.250
And,

39
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.880
of course,

40
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.350
that option is also available under the debug menu.

41
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.250
So here we just go and complete our statement,

42
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.200
so we just add in dot com.

43
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:38.050
We can use the same technique again for the third thing that we wanted.

44
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.050
So let's just drag that back in on and edit the watch.

45
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:53.560
So this time we wanted to test whether I is greater than this document start tables that

46
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.150
counts,

47
00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.750
and we can use the same technique again for the full thing that we were after,

48
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.150
which is the first paragraph of the table that's about to be deleted.

49
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.050
So this time we would highlight all the way up to here,

50
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.100
and I'll just track that in,

51
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.850
then edit it.

52
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:29.600
So we want this document that tables I not range off paragraphs one in the first paragraph

53
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.350
and then to pick up the actual text.

54
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.350
We need not range,

55
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.000
don't text.

56
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.450
And we can just make this color a bit wider so we could see the whole statement.

57
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.750
Now we're ready to use all of these.

58
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.350
And all we've got to do,

59
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.000
basically,

60
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.350
is as we step through,

61
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.660
we just constantly monitor them.

62
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.150
So they are dynamic.

63
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.110
As soon as we start to run the code,

64
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.700
all step through the code,

65
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.350
then they'll come to life and display the current value as the program runs.

66
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.610
So F eight and three out of the four have come to life.

67
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.970
Obviously,

68
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.520
this one's a bit premature.

69
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.640
We haven't got into the for loop yet,

70
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.790
so I hasn't been set toe one.

71
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.110
I think that a bit wider.

72
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.110
So this could read.

73
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.600
The requested member of the collection does not yet exist because,

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.990
of course,

75
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.050
it will do shortly.

76
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.850
So basically,

77
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:40.200
we keep President F eight and as soon as we get into the loop I becomes one Ondas.

78
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.710
You can see we have January picks up as being the first paragraph in the table.

79
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.600
It's picks up the end of cell marker as well,

80
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.250
but that's not a big deal.

81
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.500
It helps us to identify which table is currently being dilated and then we just keep

82
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.350
stepping through.

83
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.000
And of course,

84
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.520
when we get to this point,

85
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.350
as soon as I becomes seven and this document dot tables not counters fall into six,

86
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.590
the requested member of the collection does not exist,

87
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.350
so we execute this line.

88
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.550
We know that we're going to get the era.

89
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.170
So although we do know what the problem is,

90
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.830
you can see how we can highlight the problem on what's causing the that the error by using

91
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:37.790
the watch window and just keep in tabs on what's going on by displaying the values off thes

92
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.050
key expressions and variables.

93
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.350
So I'm just gonna come out of break modes,

94
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:51.860
go back to word and just used the global on do to get rid of everything we've done using

95
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.550
our macro.

96
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.250
So what we've created there are basically called watch expressions,

97
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.860
and this is the default type of watch.

98
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.100
So when you create a watch,

99
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.050
it's called a watch expression,

100
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.850
and you simply monitor its current value.

101
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.550
As you step through your code.

102
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.940
However,

103
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.750
there are other types of watches,

104
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.450
so let's take an example of one of those.

105
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:23.100
Let's take this watch and just edit it and you will see here we've got in the what type

106
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:30.250
section two other types of water is break when value is true on break when value changes.

107
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.190
So in this case,

108
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.150
rather than step in through the code,

109
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.050
we could have this as a break when value is true.

110
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.250
Watch so soon as the value of I is greater than the number of tables remaining,

111
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:53.020
this watch expression will become true and will go into break mode so we don't need to step

112
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.280
through,

113
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.350
be simply run the macro as normal.

114
00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.430
And then,

115
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.640
at the point where this statement becomes true,

116
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.100
that's when we're going to break mode so we can see we got to that critical point where

117
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.350
we've got six tables left and I has reached seven.

118
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.750
So we're attempting to delete the non existent Table seven.

119
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.160
Let's just reset again,

120
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:35.240
undo everything and just edit the type one small break when valued changes in this

121
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.750
particular case will give us the same result.

122
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.660
Because,

123
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.510
of course,

124
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.910
up until that point,

125
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.750
this statement will be true.

126
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.250
When it reaches that critical point,

127
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.150
it then changes the false.

128
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.220
So at that point,

129
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.460
we're going to break mode,

130
00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.410
so the same thing basically will happen.

131
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.470
Actual fact.

132
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.120
What's happened here is it's changed from true to false because obviously ah,

133
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.100
we've been used it previously,

134
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.890
and its previous Paddy was true has now changed to false.

135
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.110
So we've got into brake mode at this point.

136
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.450
If we run again,

137
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.420
then of course,

138
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.540
the next change occurs at that critical point.

139
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.050
So again we go back into brake mode.

140
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:26.990
So both of these alternatives are very useful techniques where you don't so much want to

141
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.420
monitor expressions.

142
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.270
You simply want to jump to those critical points in the code where the value of those

143
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:33.980
expressions,

144
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:48.420
all those variables suddenly changed by default.

145
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.500
The watch window is used to create watch expressions to dynamically monitor the values of

146
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.650
variables and expressions as you step through your code.

147
00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.750
In addition,

148
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:06.940
the alternative watch types break when value is true break when value changes could be used

149
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.970
to create conditional break points
