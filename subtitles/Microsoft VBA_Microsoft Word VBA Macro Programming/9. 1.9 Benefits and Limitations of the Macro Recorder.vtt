00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.780
in this video will have a brief discussion of the benefits and limitations of using the

2
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.750
macro recorder.

3
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.690
Basically,

4
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.380
macro recorder is a great way to check syntax that you're unsure.

5
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.850
You simply head the recorder and look at the code that's been generated.

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:37.200
What it's not so good at is giving you an example of how to actually write a usable,

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.480
inefficient macro.

8
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.260
So let's take an example of a macro,

9
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.350
or perhaps a fragment of a larger macro that we might use the recorder to generate.

10
00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.250
Let's say that in this section we're interested in having the macro recorder create a table

11
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.950
for us.

12
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.830
And let's say we want to form at the table and two headings in the first row and perhaps,

13
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.980
um,

14
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.950
placeholder text in the second row.

15
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.270
So as we seen before to record a macro,

16
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.350
we go to developer record Macro,

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.400
we're not going to save this,

18
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.790
so let's just save it in on untitled document and to insert our table,

19
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.130
we go to insert table and let's just do one row.

20
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.150
So let's say four columns and then insert our headings,

21
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.950
so I'm going to take a real estate example,

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.050
so this will be room type.

23
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.450
And then let's say we want to merge these two cells to have a wider cell for description

24
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.050
because we can't use the mouse.

25
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.580
I'm going to hold down the shift key and press the right arrow twice to select both of

26
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.530
those cells granted merged cells.

27
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.750
I'll just goto layout and click on mode cells.

28
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:17.020
Then I'm in the correct cell to type description on time along,

29
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.810
and let's say that this is dimensions.

30
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:30.540
Then we press tab and put in some placeholder text to tell the user what goes into this

31
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.950
cell.

32
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.320
So e g bathroom,

33
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.650
a J large main bathroom,

34
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.710
nearly fitted dimensions and for dimensions.

35
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.790
Let's say I'm working in feet in interest and I want to enter feet as an apostrophe and

36
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.650
inches as double quotes.

37
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.880
Now,

38
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.670
of course,

39
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.350
if we have the auto correct switched on,

40
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.350
then when we typed these characters,

41
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.750
we'll get basically curly quotation marks on da curly apostrophes.

42
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.950
So to avoid that,

43
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.550
let's go into file options,

44
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:32.180
prove it also correct options and just go across to auto format as you type and to switch

45
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.550
off the option straight quotes with smart quotes.

46
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.150
And now we can typing out I mentioned.

47
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.550
So I'm going to say 15 feet six inches by 14 feet,

48
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:52.950
six inches.

49
00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.480
So we have basically gone into the options for the specific purpose of getting rid of smart

50
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.250
quotes.

51
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.150
But as you'll see shortly,

52
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.250
the macro recorder will insert a lot more code that we actually asked for.

53
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.150
The final thing we wanted to do was to form at the table.

54
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.250
So I'm going to go across the design and just choose one of these formats and we're done.

55
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.600
So developer stopped recording.

56
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.340
Let's then move across to the visual basic editor and in models.

57
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.210
As always,

58
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.050
the recorder has called the module Numac Rose.

59
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.850
So let's see what's going on.

60
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.880
Our first command is,

61
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.450
too,

62
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.750
at the table.

63
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.650
Then here we apply the default style.

64
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.170
We didn't actually ask for this,

65
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.070
but because word actually formats the new table,

66
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.650
it also in the code generates that default format in.

67
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.250
Then we've got ourselves type in the text,

68
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.520
and here we can see one of the first bad habits.

69
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.900
If you like that,

70
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.230
the macro recorder will actually get you into.

71
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.550
If you were to get into the habit of basing your Mac rose on recorded code.

72
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.550
It uses the selection object constantly,

73
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.930
so it's not a very good tutor in terms of getting you used to the variety off objects and

74
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.650
elements that you can have inward.

75
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.620
This,

76
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.450
for example,

77
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.650
is all to do with tables,

78
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.750
but there isn't very much that tells you it's to do it tables.

79
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.860
Basically,

80
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.250
it's simply saying selection,

81
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.820
selection,

82
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.650
selection and it doesn't matter what you work with.

83
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.050
It always selects the object that you work with and then uses the selection object to

84
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.150
actually manipulate that element.

85
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.850
The second problem is that when we went into options,

86
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.050
we were interested in one thing only this line.

87
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:21.040
Now it's very useful if you want to find out what the syntax is to actually get rid of

88
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.250
smart quotes,

89
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.250
to do exactly what we did,

90
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.360
record yourself switching on smart quotes or in this case,

91
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.150
which in them off.

92
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.040
But in actual fact,

93
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.460
what happens is lots of commands which are completely relevant for our purposes also end up

94
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.450
in the code generated by the recorder.

95
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.820
So it's still very useful in order to grab this Intacs that you want and take it into one

96
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.350
of your own Mac Rose.

97
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.170
What it's not so useful for is to give you code that you can actually use as the starting

98
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.150
point for your own Mac Rose.

99
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.750
So it's a bad idea to actually record code and say,

100
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.910
Well,

101
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.920
this is my macro.

102
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.350
I'm going to start with this and then I'm going to try and make it into something usable.

103
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.670
It's much better to treat the macro recorder as a way of generating syntax,

104
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.940
which on some occasions can be quite useful,

105
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.450
in which you can then grab and put into your own macros.

106
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.590
Yes,

107
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.920
we could tidy this up.

108
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.850
We could delay tal the elements which are irrelevant for our purposes.

109
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.580
Surfer.

110
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.350
It's all bull.

111
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:35.850
All of these options set is that we don't want Is that all of these.

112
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.350
We can get rid off all of those we can get rid off,

113
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.840
and since we now just got one line,

114
00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.350
we don't really eat the with,

115
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.250
so that can go.

116
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.650
That's all we need in terms of options.

117
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.270
And we could also get rid of TheStreet.

118
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:04.400
I'll the default style that we've got up here because in terms of styling or were

119
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.220
interested in,

120
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.550
is this pelant,

121
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.980
where we actually apply great table for accent five,

122
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.100
that blue style that we actually wanted.

123
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.440
So,

124
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.750
yes,

125
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.950
you can tidy things up.

126
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.350
But for the reasons I've mentioned is not really a good starting point for your own macros

127
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.350
,

128
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.850
and you'll find that as you try and scale up the macro,

129
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:33.170
the performance is really quite poor because the recorder constantly relies on selecting

130
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.950
elements,

131
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.190
activating them,

132
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.650
and then work in on their those active or selected elements.

133
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.550
As you'll see when we start writing our own macros,

134
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:48.730
there are far better ways of structure in your code so that as you scale up and start

135
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.450
tackling larger projects,

136
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:55.250
your code is efficient and the performance is acceptable.

137
00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:08.700
The macro recorder is a useful tool for verifying unfamiliar scent tax,

138
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.270
which may be buried within the word off Jake model.

139
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.790
Unfortunately,

140
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:20.250
the code generated by the macro recorder is not a good base from which to start creating

141
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.620
your own.

142
00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.350
Macron's
