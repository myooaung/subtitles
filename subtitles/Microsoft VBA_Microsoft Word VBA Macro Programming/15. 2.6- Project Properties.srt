1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,650
in this video.

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,430
Well,

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,090
look at Project properties.

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,480
These settings allow you to customize the way in which products are displayed in the Object

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,500
browser and also to lock project from viewing so that users could only see your code once

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,150
they supplied the appropriate password in the Exercises folder.

7
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:41,350
Let's go back into zero to and then 05 vb e options.

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,650
And this is the file that we worked with in the last video.

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,670
And here is everything.

10
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,390
As I left it,

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,050
I save my changes.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,650
There are two ways of specifying project properties.

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,750
You can either right click on a project to his project properties from the right click menu

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:02,750
.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,400
Or you can highlight the project.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,550
Go to tools.

17
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,350
It's his product properties from there.

18
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,950
The option that you see displayed in the menu depends on the name of the project,

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,750
which is one of the things that the project properties allow you to change.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,950
So here the name of the normal project is actually normal.

21
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,850
Hence,

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,830
when I right click,

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,150
I see the choice normal properties,

24
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,420
and similarly,

25
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,460
in the tools menu,

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,720
it reads local properties.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,150
Whichever method you choose,

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:46,090
the product properties dialog is displayed and it has two taps General and protection in

29
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,950
the general town.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,550
You can enter a unique name for the project,

31
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,590
and this is quite useful.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,300
If you typically work with several projects at a time,

33
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,330
they may have a couple of Adan's a couple of templates,

34
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,450
all at the same time.

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,850
Having a unique name for each one becomes school useful.

36
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,450
So what will be a descriptive name for this project?

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,170
Well,

38
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,060
we were using it to practice Lee B E Options.

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,370
So let's use that is the name.

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,450
No space is allowed so I could put it under school or nothing at all.

41
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,150
They will call it VB Options,

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,580
and then we can give it the description.

43
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:30,250
Let's just put practice on set in be options.

44
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,020
These options of the bottom relate into the help file,

45
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,050
and conditional compilation arguments are fairly advanced.

46
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,340
And unfortunately,

47
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,180
we won't have time to delve into them.

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,250
In this course,

49
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,150
let me click OK,

50
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,620
you'll see instead of the word project.

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,380
We don't have V B E options and you'll notice in the properties window.

52
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,120
We have yet another way of trading today as well as this.

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,420
We go into the object browser in the library's drop down menu,

54
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,750
you'll notice that Alavi be a options is displayed.

55
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,050
It would have been displayed even if we'd left the default name Project in placed.

56
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:18,020
But clearly giving it a descriptive name of our road makes it easy to recognize when we

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,650
choose it,

58
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,970
You'll notice that the description that we wrote is displayed in the description tab at the

59
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,550
bottom of the object browser.

60
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:32,550
So when I click on Module one,

61
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,800
you'll see all of the subroutines that we've got are displayed.

62
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,600
So when you've created a complete VB,

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,350
a solution,

64
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:46,850
this facility is point useful because it gives you a way off this monitoring exactly what

65
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,550
you've developed and of navigating to specific parts of your solution.

66
00:03:52,550 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's just go back into tools you'll notice instead of project properties.

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:10,030
We don't have VB options properties and let's look at the protection time and here we have

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,150
the facility off lock in the project for view it.

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,540
So if we switched that on and I'll just pop in a simple password,

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:28,470
let's just take it 12345 In order to see this work in,

71
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:35,650
I'll just need to closed the document cancels his clothes word for a moment,

72
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,150
then just go back into the document.

73
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,050
And this time you'll notice that the project is collapsed.

74
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,950
Normally it opens in the state in which you left it.

75
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,110
But obviously once it's been locked,

76
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,400
it's always collapsed.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,010
So when I try to expand it,

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,650
it asks me to supply the password.

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,960
12345 And only then will it allow me to expand.

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,450
Explore the project.

81
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay,

82
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,150
so those are the two tabs that you have available for set in project properties.

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,240
And as you can see,

84
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,780
both camps a fairly straightforward and they are quite useful as you start developing more

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:38,290
projects and put it more more code inside the the general tab of the Project Properties

86
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,450
Dialog allows you to name the project and provide a description,

87
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,460
both of which it displayed when the project issued in the Object browser.

88
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:55,890
The protection tab allows you to lock the project so that it can only be viewed after

89
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,920
supplying the passport that you specify.
