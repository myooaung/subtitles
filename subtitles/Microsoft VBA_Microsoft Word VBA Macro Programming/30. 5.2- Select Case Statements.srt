1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,190
in this video will look at the Select case statement,

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,800
which provides an alternative to use in if and else it when testing for several different

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
possibilities.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,880
In this example,

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,510
let's say that we want to create a new document,

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:31,150
insert a title and then below the title inside the creation date.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,450
However,

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,010
after the day components off the date,

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,670
we'd like to insert the correct ward inal such as S,

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,110
T,

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,690
N de R D or TH will create a function which will calculate the orginal based on the current

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,150
date.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,290
So that's first created,

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,360
Macron said.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,600
The macro will create a document,

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:09,110
so let's just switch across to procedure view and then here we could dim stock you as

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,850
documents.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,550
I'm also create str orginal as string.

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:28,560
So first we create a new documents and then we want to calculate the orginal so we'll

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,420
create a separate function which does this so it's gonna be str orginal equals and then we

21
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,960
do a function called So a function is gonna be s 050 to be on.

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,880
Let's say it's called calculates.

23
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,170
Orginal will need to pass the function an argument which could be today's date which is

24
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,650
generated by using the function now.

25
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,000
Once we calculated the orginal,

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,450
we can then write our head in and today's date in the new document.

27
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,680
So that will be broken.

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,550
You not content.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,950
Since it's implying document equals on our headed.

30
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,100
Let's just call it status report,

31
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,470
and we'll follow that with a return.

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,180
Three b.

33
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,560
C.

34
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,750
R now has to split the line,

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,120
and now we want the formatted date,

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,450
including the orginal.

37
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,190
So we'll put the day component first.

38
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,750
And for that we can use thief format function that we saw before.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,180
So we four met in today states and the day component.

40
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,360
Let's say we want four days,

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,180
which gives us the name of the day and then a number with no lead in zero representing the

42
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,850
day of the week.

43
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,050
So that's the day component.

44
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:05,900
Close that then we insert str orginal and then we finish off with the month and year again

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:05,900
.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,610
We format in today's state.

47
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,750
We put a space,

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,010
let's say four m.

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,450
So we get the full name of the month on a space followed by a four digit year.

50
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,050
So now all we need to do is to write this function.

51
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:30,890
Let's just go back to full model view so we can ensure that our function goes in right

52
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,350
place.

53
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,150
So it's private function and paste controlled me.

54
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,050
So this now becomes the name of the parameter that we want to use.

55
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,290
Which,

56
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:42,700
of course,

57
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,150
will be a date parameter.

58
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,050
So d 80 inputs as date.

59
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,780
Then after the closing parenthesis,

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,160
we specify the type of data that are function returns,

61
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,920
and this will return a string such as nd or SD,

62
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,550
representing the orginal.

63
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,510
Now let's return to procedure view.

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,150
So now comes our select case statement.

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,910
And let's just look at the overall syntax four selected case.

66
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,240
So it's select case.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,850
Then you have the test expression to be evaluated.

68
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,430
So we have case test expression and then,

69
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,120
for each possible value,

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,950
we use case and we can either put a single value for a list of values.

71
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:51,930
So let's say value list one that we put the statements if valueless one contains the match

72
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:51,930
,

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,850
and we can then repeat that as many times as necessary.

74
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,440
In our case,

75
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:07,310
there are four orginal so we've got S t that we have nd rd and th in fact,

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,070
having tested for S,

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,560
T,

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,070
N,

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,350
d and R D.

80
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,320
If it's none of those three,

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,440
it must be th So Instead of having another case test,

82
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,250
we can use the statement case else.

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,000
So if none of the above the truth,

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,450
then these statements will execute.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,680
And to close a select case,

86
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,170
you simply use and select.

87
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,200
So that's the skeleton of a select case.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,550
Let's now flesh it out.

89
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,050
So our test expression is gonna be the day component of D 80 input.

90
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,850
And to extract this,

91
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,490
we can use the day function,

92
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,250
which is simply day and then in parentheses.

93
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,680
We put in this case the variable,

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,050
which is D 80 input.

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,850
So that's what's being evaluated in the select case.

96
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:09,130
The first list of values were interested in considering will be one 21 and 31 if the day of

97
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,050
the month is any of those three.

98
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,050
We want our function to return S t.

99
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,480
To specify the value returned by the function,

100
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,950
we use the name of the function,

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,610
so I'll just copy it.

102
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,550
Since it's a bit low.

103
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:31,180
Then we simply say equal and the value in question because we've specified that the

104
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,450
function returns a string We have to put the value in quotation marks.

105
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,970
So s to how we can then just copy this and paste it in.

106
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:55,580
So here will have nd Yeah,

107
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,950
I'll be yeah,

108
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:12,090
th on the days of the month when we require n d will be too and 22 and will require RD in

109
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,110
the day of the month is three or 23.

110
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:24,470
It's none of these values in our case else will kick in and our function will return th So

111
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:34,500
let's return to full model of you and we could now test down macro that save and let's run

112
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,080
Let's see the document that's been generated So we've got a title status report and we've

113
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,950
got our orginal inserted S t because it's the 21st old Bartsch.

114
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:57,950
So that's a quick rundown of how select cases used.

115
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,380
As you can see,

116
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,890
there is a certain amount of crossover between if and else if and select case.

117
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:13,750
But the key difference is you select case where you're evaluated just a single expression,

118
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,050
whereas with the if and else if structure,

119
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,980
you can have a completely different test with each else.

120
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:34,820
If that you actually use the Select case statement is used in preference to if else,

121
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,160
if when testing an expression all variable which may contain one of several possibilities.

122
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:50,550
The selected case statement uses the following syntax Select case test expression,

123
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,610
usually a variable case value list.

124
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,860
One statements,

125
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,360
if any,

126
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:05,360
of valueless one matches Test expression case Valueless to statement if any of valueless

127
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,010
two matches test expression,

128
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,050
etcetera.

129
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:17,450
Case else statements if none of the above matches test expression and select.
