00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.010
- The landscape of web-based application development

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.090
is constantly changing

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.060
and no change in the last 15 years

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.020
has been more significant than the advent

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.060
of so called cloud computing.

6
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.090
Today, we must build systems that are globally available,

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.010
leveraging limited human capital resources,

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.020
and doing so in a way that is maintainable

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.090
all the while, getting to market first.

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050
This massive demand on software engineers

11
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.060
has caused us to respond with new patterns

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.010
in developing our software.

13
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.040
Enter into the picture, the 12 factors

14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.020
of cloud native application development.

15
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000
This pattern emerged based on a large number of deployments

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.030
by agile teams developing web application software.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.010
As such, it has become the defacto pattern

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.080
in this space.

19
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.030
Hi, I'm Frank Moley, a Software, Technology

20
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060
and Security Architect.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.020
I spend most of my time these days

22
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.060
working on designing applications and systems

23
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.040
that perform at high levels

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.030
and are highly available.

25
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000
This course is designed to explain

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.080
the core tenants of the 12 factors

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.030
in a development language agnostic format.

28
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.030
I will share with you my experiences in this space

29
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.010
and in doing so, help you to see opportunities

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
to impact your overall ecosystem

31
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.000
and build modern applications.

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.060
We will focus on each of the factors individually,

33
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.050
dissect them, and how they apply

34
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.000
to cloud native development.

35
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.090
As we evaluate each factor,

36
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.050
we will also look specifically at some key points

37
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.010
of what is needed to move a legacy application

38
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.020
into a 12 factor compatible application.

39
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.000
So let's get ready to dig in.
