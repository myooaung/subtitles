00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.070
- Admin tasks or management tasks are a necessary evil

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.010
in software development.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.090
All too often, we have to build a task to warm a cache

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.000
or clean up data that is expired.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.030
In legacy applications, this is often accomplished

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.000
by building the task into the application

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.040
and either spawning it at regular intervals

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.040
or as asynchronous actions based on some event that occurs

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.090
in the main application.

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.040
These tasks usually complete their function

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.020
and then shut themselves down when they are done.

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.030
In a 12-factor world,

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
these tasks are treated as first-class processes.

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.030
They are themselves applications

15
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.030
that are spawned when needed,

16
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.020
usually by some overall management application.

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.070
Other shell type technologies can be leveraged

18
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.040
but essentially result in the same behavior.

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.060
Something, maybe a deploy, will trigger the process to run.

20
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.060
These processes run in their own execution environment,

21
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.010
to completion, and then shutdown.

22
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.040
It really is that simple.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.020
When dealing with legacy applications,

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.020
the process for this is relatively straightforward.

25
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
You need to refactor your application.

26
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.010
Instead of containing these admin tasks themselves,

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.040
migrate them into another code base.

28
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.080
This code base will then be treated

29
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.020
as its own 12-factor application,

30
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.080
including all of its own deployments.

31
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.090
If the task needs to be part of a release,

32
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.020
such as a process that sets feature flags,

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.050
you need to do some triggering on the deploy

34
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.080
of the main application.

35
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.090
But that is usually not the norm.

36
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.050
Often these tasks are batch processes

37
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.060
that run at regular intervals,

38
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.010
or asynchronous message listeners

39
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.050
that react to a message on a queue or a topic.

40
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.040
Though we can't remove the necessary evil of the admin task,

41
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.080
by moving to cloud native,

42
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.000
we can treat it like any other application.
