00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.050
- I want to thank you for taking the time

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.050
to learn more about twelve-factor applications with me.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.000
Twelve-factor application development

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a complete mind-shift within the organization.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.090
This is not a change that can be taken lightly

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.070
and really needs buy-in from the entire

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.070
development organization and management.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.050
There are companies that even provide

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.020
professional consulting engagements

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.060
to move teams into this model.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.020
To be fair, your developers have to have a complete shift

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.000
in how they develop and deploy applications.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.050
The results, however, are worth the challenges.

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.070
Once your customers see a deployed feature

15
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.060
in days instead of months,

16
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.090
the return on investment

17
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.010
for the development team becomes apparent.

18
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.080
If your team is already embracing Agile methodologies,

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.090
this transition will be almost natural.

20
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.010
But it is still a transition.

21
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.020
What I would recommend is to begin

22
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.060
with a new greenfield application.

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.010
Start with the pipeline to manage the deployment

24
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.030
before you add any features to that application.

25
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.080
It can even be a simple

26
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.080
"Hello World!" application to start with.

27
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080
Once you have the pipeline, you can add features

28
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.030
and get rapid deployments to see the value quickly.

29
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.010
You could even start twelve-factor development

30
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.010
using existing VM or big iron infrastructure.

31
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.020
That is part of the benefit.

32
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.060
You don't need Docker or APAS to get started,

33
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.020
because these apps are designed

34
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.090
to run in any execution environment

35
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.040
that supports the language.

36
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.060
These twelve-factors are based on empirical information

37
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.050
from Adam Wiggins' work in Heroku.

38
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.060
As such, the twelve-factor methodologies

39
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060
are not the silver bullet

40
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.050
for solving distributed computing.

41
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.050
As more systems move into this space,

42
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.010
the pattern itself evolves.

43
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.010
For more information, check out your favorite Cloud provider

44
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.050
or visit 12factor.net,

45
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.050
where you can find more from the original contributors.

46
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.050
Also, you can reach out to me on Twitter.

47
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.000
I want to thank you for your time.
