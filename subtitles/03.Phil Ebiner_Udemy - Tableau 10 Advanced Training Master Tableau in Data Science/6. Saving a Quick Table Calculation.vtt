00:00:01.900  -->  00:00:06.840
Welcome back to the advanced course on

2

00:00:06.840  -->  00:00:06.850

3

00:00:06.850  -->  00:00:08.730
Tableau. In the previous tutorial, we

4

00:00:08.730  -->  00:00:08.740

5

00:00:08.740  -->  00:00:09.989
created this beautiful-looking

6

00:00:09.989  -->  00:00:09.999

7

00:00:09.999  -->  00:00:13.680
visualization which now shows us the

8

00:00:13.680  -->  00:00:13.690

9

00:00:13.690  -->  00:00:16.680
idle capacity in tons and today we will

10

00:00:16.680  -->  00:00:16.690

11

00:00:16.690  -->  00:00:19.230
learn a new skill. We'll learn how to save

12

00:00:19.230  -->  00:00:19.240

13

00:00:19.240  -->  00:00:22.019
our Tableau calculations. So let's start

14

00:00:22.019  -->  00:00:22.029

15

00:00:22.029  -->  00:00:24.779
with the first, next step that we need to

16

00:00:24.779  -->  00:00:24.789

17

00:00:24.789  -->  00:00:27.089
perform and that is to change this idle

18

00:00:27.089  -->  00:00:27.099

19

00:00:27.099  -->  00:00:29.040
capacity from tons to

20

00:00:29.040  -->  00:00:29.050

21

00:00:29.050  -->  00:00:31.829
percentages and that is very easy to do.

22

00:00:31.829  -->  00:00:31.839

23

00:00:31.839  -->  00:00:33.300
All we have to do is click the

24

00:00:33.300  -->  00:00:33.310

25

00:00:33.310  -->  00:00:36.930
drop-down and we clear.. change the table

26

00:00:36.930  -->  00:00:36.940

27

00:00:36.940  -->  00:00:38.970
calculation to from a change from

28

00:00:38.970  -->  00:00:38.980

29

00:00:38.980  -->  00:00:42.660
difference to percent difference and

30

00:00:42.660  -->  00:00:42.670

31

00:00:42.670  -->  00:00:45.360
that this Tableau calculation is being

32

00:00:45.360  -->  00:00:45.370

33

00:00:45.370  -->  00:00:47.160
conducted across so what we need to do

34

00:00:47.160  -->  00:00:47.170

35

00:00:47.170  -->  00:00:49.230
once again is we need to say compute

36

00:00:49.230  -->  00:00:49.240

37

00:00:49.240  -->  00:00:50.730
using Tableau down so it's called

38

00:00:50.730  -->  00:00:50.740

39

00:00:50.740  -->  00:00:52.920
conducted down, downwards using those

40

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:52.930

41

00:00:52.930  -->  00:00:57.360
hidden rows for the nominal capacities.

42

00:00:57.360  -->  00:00:57.370

43

00:00:57.370  -->  00:01:00.030
Now what this calculation is showing us

44

00:01:00.030  -->  00:01:00.040

45

00:01:00.040  -->  00:01:01.980
is exactly what it what we want it is

46

00:01:01.980  -->  00:01:01.990

47

00:01:01.990  -->  00:01:03.720
taking the noiminal capacity so which is

48

00:01:03.720  -->  00:01:03.730

49

00:01:03.730  -->  00:01:05.219
hidden we can't see it right now so

50

00:01:05.219  -->  00:01:05.229

51

00:01:05.229  -->  00:01:07.020
between these two there's a nominal

52

00:01:07.020  -->  00:01:07.030

53

00:01:07.030  -->  00:01:09.780
capacity for RL2. It is taking the

54

00:01:09.780  -->  00:01:09.790

55

00:01:09.790  -->  00:01:11.310
nominal cap.. it is taking actual

56

00:01:11.310  -->  00:01:11.320

57

00:01:11.320  -->  00:01:13.500
capacity for RL2 minus the nominal

58

00:01:13.500  -->  00:01:13.510

59

00:01:13.510  -->  00:01:15.870
capacity for RL2  and it is

60

00:01:15.870  -->  00:01:15.880

61

00:01:15.880  -->  00:01:19.230
dividing by the nominal capacity for RL2

62

00:01:19.230  -->  00:01:19.240

63

00:01:19.240  -->  00:01:21.960
and therefore this is the idle capacity

64

00:01:21.960  -->  00:01:21.970

65

00:01:21.970  -->  00:01:24.360
in percentage that we're looking for.

66

00:01:24.360  -->  00:01:24.370

67

00:01:24.370  -->  00:01:27.210
Now what we can see here is that the

68

00:01:27.210  -->  00:01:27.220

69

00:01:27.220  -->  00:01:28.980
idle capacity is represented by

70

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:28.990

71

00:01:28.990  -->  00:01:30.719
percentage but this percentage is

72

00:01:30.719  -->  00:01:30.729

73

00:01:30.729  -->  00:01:32.070
negative.

74

00:01:32.070  -->  00:01:32.080

75

00:01:32.080  -->  00:01:34.890
Now it does make sense because idle

76

00:01:34.890  -->  00:01:34.900

77

00:01:34.900  -->  00:01:37.890
capacity is a metric which is showing us

78

00:01:37.890  -->  00:01:37.900

79

00:01:37.900  -->  00:01:39.570
how poorly a machine was performing any

80

00:01:39.570  -->  00:01:39.580

81

00:01:39.580  -->  00:01:41.880
given hour, so for instance this machine

82

00:01:41.880  -->  00:01:41.890

83

00:01:41.890  -->  00:01:46.440
RL2 at signal during the hour of six

84

00:01:46.440  -->  00:01:46.450

85

00:01:46.450  -->  00:01:48.750
o'clock in the evening afternoon on

86

00:01:48.750  -->  00:01:48.760

87

00:01:48.760  -->  00:01:53.789
September the six. It was a processed 24

88

00:01:53.789  -->  00:01:53.799

89

00:01:53.799  -->  00:01:56.340
percentage or 24 points only eight

90

00:01:56.340  -->  00:01:56.350

91

00:01:56.350  -->  00:02:00.000
percentage of call less than its nominal

92

00:02:00.000  -->  00:02:00.010

93

00:02:00.010  -->  00:02:03.660
capacity. So it is a metric that is

94

00:02:03.660  -->  00:02:03.670

95

00:02:03.670  -->  00:02:05.789
talking about how it's like a negative

96

00:02:05.789  -->  00:02:05.799

97

00:02:05.799  -->  00:02:07.770
metric it's impacting the business

98

00:02:07.770  -->  00:02:07.780

99

00:02:07.780  -->  00:02:09.570
negatively it's impacting revenue and

100

00:02:09.570  -->  00:02:09.580

101

00:02:09.580  -->  00:02:11.190
everything negative so does make sense

102

00:02:11.190  -->  00:02:11.200

103

00:02:11.200  -->  00:02:13.470
that it is negative. However, best

104

00:02:13.470  -->  00:02:13.480

105

00:02:13.480  -->  00:02:15.309
practices of visualization

106

00:02:15.309  -->  00:02:15.319

107

00:02:15.319  -->  00:02:17.860
tell us that it is easier for humans to

108

00:02:17.860  -->  00:02:17.870

109

00:02:17.870  -->  00:02:20.739
interpret data when it is not upside

110

00:02:20.739  -->  00:02:20.749

111

00:02:20.749  -->  00:02:22.959
down. So this chart right now, it's upside

112

00:02:22.959  -->  00:02:22.969

113

00:02:22.969  -->  00:02:25.690
down and it'll be harder for people to

114

00:02:25.690  -->  00:02:25.700

115

00:02:25.700  -->  00:02:29.020
understand this chart in this way. It'll

116

00:02:29.020  -->  00:02:29.030

117

00:02:29.030  -->  00:02:32.559
be easier if we turn it into a correct

118

00:02:32.559  -->  00:02:32.569

119

00:02:32.569  -->  00:02:35.679
chart where it is above zero and let me

120

00:02:35.679  -->  00:02:35.689

121

00:02:35.689  -->  00:02:37.809
show you an example to explain a bit

122

00:02:37.809  -->  00:02:37.819

123

00:02:37.819  -->  00:02:38.949
better what I mean.

124

00:02:38.949  -->  00:02:38.959

125

00:02:38.959  -->  00:02:40.720
So I'm going to add a reference line to

126

00:02:40.720  -->  00:02:40.730

127

00:02:40.730  -->  00:02:41.979
this chart. I'm going to right click,

128

00:02:41.979  -->  00:02:41.989

129

00:02:41.989  -->  00:02:44.619
click add reference line and I

130

00:02:44.619  -->  00:02:44.629

131

00:02:44.629  -->  00:02:46.300
want to add a constant reference line

132

00:02:46.300  -->  00:02:46.310

133

00:02:46.310  -->  00:02:48.250
that is the 10-percent line so that is

134

00:02:48.250  -->  00:02:48.260

135

00:02:48.260  -->  00:02:49.869
that cut-off point that will be using in

136

00:02:49.869  -->  00:02:49.879

137

00:02:49.879  -->  00:02:52.479
our analysis going forward in this

138

00:02:52.479  -->  00:02:52.489

139

00:02:52.489  -->  00:02:55.629
section of the course. So how do I add a

140

00:02:55.629  -->  00:02:55.639

141

00:02:55.639  -->  00:02:57.580
10-percent reference line? In order to

142

00:02:57.580  -->  00:02:57.590

143

00:02:57.590  -->  00:02:58.899
add a constant reference line you have

144

00:02:58.899  -->  00:02:58.909

145

00:02:58.909  -->  00:03:00.849
to click this drop-down here and this is

146

00:03:00.849  -->  00:03:00.859

147

00:03:00.859  -->  00:03:03.220
where a lot of people get confused the

148

00:03:03.220  -->  00:03:03.230

149

00:03:03.230  -->  00:03:04.420
first time because they start looking

150

00:03:04.420  -->  00:03:04.430

151

00:03:04.430  -->  00:03:07.000
for the constant here or the here but in

152

00:03:07.000  -->  00:03:07.010

153

00:03:07.010  -->  00:03:08.860
reality the constant should be selected

154

00:03:08.860  -->  00:03:08.870

155

00:03:08.870  -->  00:03:11.379
here. So you select the constant here and

156

00:03:11.379  -->  00:03:11.389

157

00:03:11.389  -->  00:03:14.379
then you type in the value so minus ten

158

00:03:14.379  -->  00:03:14.389

159

00:03:14.389  -->  00:03:16.929
percent. Now how would you go about

160

00:03:16.929  -->  00:03:16.939

161

00:03:16.939  -->  00:03:19.449
analyze, analyzing this chart or more

162

00:03:19.449  -->  00:03:19.459

163

00:03:19.459  -->  00:03:21.249
importantly, how would the user of your

164

00:03:21.249  -->  00:03:21.259

165

00:03:21.259  -->  00:03:24.159
dashboard go about analyzing this chart?

166

00:03:24.159  -->  00:03:24.169

167

00:03:24.169  -->  00:03:25.719
Let's say they're looking for machines

168

00:03:25.719  -->  00:03:25.729

169

00:03:25.729  -->  00:03:28.089
that are exceeding the ten percent mark,

170

00:03:28.089  -->  00:03:28.099

171

00:03:28.099  -->  00:03:29.020
right. So machines that are

172

00:03:29.020  -->  00:03:29.030

173

00:03:29.030  -->  00:03:31.030
underperforming they'll be looking for

174

00:03:31.030  -->  00:03:31.040

175

00:03:31.040  -->  00:03:34.179
spikes that are exceeding this ten

176

00:03:34.179  -->  00:03:34.189

177

00:03:34.189  -->  00:03:35.920
percent more and notice that I'm using

178

00:03:35.920  -->  00:03:35.930

179

00:03:35.930  -->  00:03:37.839
the word exceeding here and that's

180

00:03:37.839  -->  00:03:37.849

181

00:03:37.849  -->  00:03:40.149
exactly what your engines will be saying.

182

00:03:40.149  -->  00:03:40.159

183

00:03:40.159  -->  00:03:42.129
They'll be saying, did this machine

184

00:03:42.129  -->  00:03:42.139

185

00:03:42.139  -->  00:03:44.920
exceed the ten percent threshold? Or did it not

186

00:03:44.920  -->  00:03:44.930

187

00:03:44.930  -->  00:03:46.539
exceed the ten percent threshold in that

188

00:03:46.539  -->  00:03:46.549

189

00:03:46.549  -->  00:03:50.559
hour? Well exceed in in normal language

190

00:03:50.559  -->  00:03:50.569

191

00:03:50.569  -->  00:03:54.610
assumes and something is above something.

192

00:03:54.610  -->  00:03:54.620

193

00:03:54.620  -->  00:03:57.909
Here exceed for to find things that are

194

00:03:57.909  -->  00:03:57.919

195

00:03:57.919  -->  00:04:00.459
exceeding you have to look at the spikes

196

00:04:00.459  -->  00:04:00.469

197

00:04:00.469  -->  00:04:01.839
that are below the ten percent line and

198

00:04:01.839  -->  00:04:01.849

199

00:04:01.849  -->  00:04:04.059
that is counter-intuitive. It is not hard

200

00:04:04.059  -->  00:04:04.069

201

00:04:04.069  -->  00:04:08.199
to understand it for the user

202

00:04:08.199  -->  00:04:08.209

203

00:04:08.209  -->  00:04:10.390
they can quickly take a grasp it but

204

00:04:10.390  -->  00:04:10.400

205

00:04:10.400  -->  00:04:12.969
still every single time in their head

206

00:04:12.969  -->  00:04:12.979

207

00:04:12.979  -->  00:04:15.490
they're going to be doing the inverse to

208

00:04:15.490  -->  00:04:15.500

209

00:04:15.500  -->  00:04:18.039
what their nature is telling them to do.

210

00:04:18.039  -->  00:04:18.049

211

00:04:18.049  -->  00:04:19.990
They are looking for something that is

212

00:04:19.990  -->  00:04:20.000

213

00:04:20.000  -->  00:04:23.439
exceeding but visually they're going to

214

00:04:23.439  -->  00:04:23.449

215

00:04:23.449  -->  00:04:26.680
be comparing whether this spike is below the

216

00:04:26.680  -->  00:04:26.690

217

00:04:26.690  -->  00:04:28.300
ten percent line, and that is not good.

218

00:04:28.300  -->  00:04:28.310

219

00:04:28.310  -->  00:04:28.719
That

220

00:04:28.719  -->  00:04:28.729

221

00:04:28.729  -->  00:04:30.369
means that you're forcing this

222

00:04:30.369  -->  00:04:30.379

223

00:04:30.379  -->  00:04:32.230
visualization is forcing your user your

224

00:04:32.230  -->  00:04:32.240

225

00:04:32.240  -->  00:04:34.089
end user to conduct an additional step

226

00:04:34.089  -->  00:04:34.099

227

00:04:34.099  -->  00:04:37.540
in their brain to gain the insights that

228

00:04:37.540  -->  00:04:37.550

229

00:04:37.550  -->  00:04:39.879
utilization is telling them and we want

230

00:04:39.879  -->  00:04:39.889

231

00:04:39.889  -->  00:04:41.679
to take care of our user remember that

232

00:04:41.679  -->  00:04:41.689

233

00:04:41.689  -->  00:04:44.619
everything we're doing is to take care

234

00:04:44.619  -->  00:04:44.629

235

00:04:44.629  -->  00:04:46.390
of the end user and make our dashboards

236

00:04:46.390  -->  00:04:46.400

237

00:04:46.400  -->  00:04:48.579
as intuitive as possible, as user-

238

00:04:48.579  -->  00:04:48.589

239

00:04:48.589  -->  00:04:51.339
friendly as possible and the best way to

240

00:04:51.339  -->  00:04:51.349

241

00:04:51.349  -->  00:04:53.439
resolve this situation here is to flip

242

00:04:53.439  -->  00:04:53.449

243

00:04:53.449  -->  00:04:55.659
the chart and to flip the chart what we

244

00:04:55.659  -->  00:04:55.669

245

00:04:55.669  -->  00:04:57.850
can do is we can click edit axis and

246

00:04:57.850  -->  00:04:57.860

247

00:04:57.860  -->  00:04:59.860
click reverse over here, click apply

248

00:04:59.860  -->  00:04:59.870

249

00:04:59.870  -->  00:05:01.959
that will flip the chart but what that

250

00:05:01.959  -->  00:05:01.969

251

00:05:01.969  -->  00:05:03.790
will do the same time is everything will

252

00:05:03.790  -->  00:05:03.800

253

00:05:03.800  -->  00:05:06.879
still stay negative and that can also be

254

00:05:06.879  -->  00:05:06.889

255

00:05:06.889  -->  00:05:08.769
a confusing because how can nev..

256

00:05:08.769  -->  00:05:08.779

257

00:05:08.779  -->  00:05:10.839
negative values be above zero and how

258

00:05:10.839  -->  00:05:10.849

259

00:05:10.849  -->  00:05:13.149
they can be growing that way. That will

260

00:05:13.149  -->  00:05:13.159

261

00:05:13.159  -->  00:05:14.920
require the user also to think a little

262

00:05:14.920  -->  00:05:14.930

263

00:05:14.930  -->  00:05:15.549
bit.

264

00:05:15.549  -->  00:05:15.559

265

00:05:15.559  -->  00:05:18.100
We don't want that, we want to flip it

266

00:05:18.100  -->  00:05:18.110

267

00:05:18.110  -->  00:05:20.139
but make everything positive so let's

268

00:05:20.139  -->  00:05:20.149

269

00:05:20.149  -->  00:05:22.510
undo the reversed click apply, click OK

270

00:05:22.510  -->  00:05:22.520

271

00:05:22.520  -->  00:05:25.600
and in order to achieve a flip and

272

00:05:25.600  -->  00:05:25.610

273

00:05:25.610  -->  00:05:27.700
making everything that we see here

274

00:05:27.700  -->  00:05:27.710

275

00:05:27.710  -->  00:05:30.639
positive making access positive what we

276

00:05:30.639  -->  00:05:30.649

277

00:05:30.649  -->  00:05:32.980
would do is we would multiply the value

278

00:05:32.980  -->  00:05:32.990

279

00:05:32.990  -->  00:05:35.469
that visualizing by minus one, correct

280

00:05:35.469  -->  00:05:35.479

281

00:05:35.479  -->  00:05:37.869
right? So once we multiply by minus one,

282

00:05:37.869  -->  00:05:37.879

283

00:05:37.879  -->  00:05:39.790
everything will automatically flip access

284

00:05:39.790  -->  00:05:39.800

285

00:05:39.800  -->  00:05:42.309
the values everything but the challenge

286

00:05:42.309  -->  00:05:42.319

287

00:05:42.319  -->  00:05:45.129
here is that we don't have this value in

288

00:05:45.129  -->  00:05:45.139

289

00:05:45.139  -->  00:05:47.199
our measures or dimensions we don't have

290

00:05:47.199  -->  00:05:47.209

291

00:05:47.209  -->  00:05:49.360
this values of field and that is

292

00:05:49.360  -->  00:05:49.370

293

00:05:49.370  -->  00:05:51.369
completely normal that is because what

294

00:05:51.369  -->  00:05:51.379

295

00:05:51.379  -->  00:05:52.779
we're visualizing here is a table

296

00:05:52.779  -->  00:05:52.789

297

00:05:52.789  -->  00:05:55.480
calculation and it's signified here by

298

00:05:55.480  -->  00:05:55.490

299

00:05:55.490  -->  00:05:58.089
this triangle and as we discussed table

300

00:05:58.089  -->  00:05:58.099

301

00:05:58.099  -->  00:06:01.239
calculations are not sent back to the

302

00:06:01.239  -->  00:06:01.249

303

00:06:01.249  -->  00:06:03.999
data storage facility to calculate. They

304

00:06:03.999  -->  00:06:04.009

305

00:06:04.009  -->  00:06:05.679
are conducted, they are calculated by

306

00:06:05.679  -->  00:06:05.689

307

00:06:05.689  -->  00:06:07.959
Tableau within your visual. So they're

308

00:06:07.959  -->  00:06:07.969

309

00:06:07.969  -->  00:06:10.420
calculated in fact they are calculated at the

310

00:06:10.420  -->  00:06:10.430

311

00:06:10.430  -->  00:06:12.850
level of granularity of your visual and

312

00:06:12.850  -->  00:06:12.860

313

00:06:12.860  -->  00:06:15.040
that's why Tableau has to do them within

314

00:06:15.040  -->  00:06:15.050

315

00:06:15.050  -->  00:06:18.939
itself and that is why it is completely

316

00:06:18.939  -->  00:06:18.949

317

00:06:18.949  -->  00:06:21.309
normal for the table calculation to only

318

00:06:21.309  -->  00:06:21.319

319

00:06:21.319  -->  00:06:23.529
exists in your columns and rows or

320

00:06:23.529  -->  00:06:23.539

321

00:06:23.539  -->  00:06:25.089
basically in any of your panes, in your

322

00:06:25.089  -->  00:06:25.099

323

00:06:25.099  -->  00:06:27.610
visualization but not exist in your

324

00:06:27.610  -->  00:06:27.620

325

00:06:27.620  -->  00:06:30.579
measures of dimensions. So how can we

326

00:06:30.579  -->  00:06:30.589

327

00:06:30.589  -->  00:06:33.070
actually get this table calculation to

328

00:06:33.070  -->  00:06:33.080

329

00:06:33.080  -->  00:06:34.959
become a calculated field in our

330

00:06:34.959  -->  00:06:34.969

331

00:06:34.969  -->  00:06:36.370
measures so that we can work

332

00:06:36.370  -->  00:06:36.380

333

00:06:36.380  -->  00:06:38.080
with it further down the track. Well

334

00:06:38.080  -->  00:06:38.090

335

00:06:38.090  -->  00:06:39.400
that's pretty easy all you have to do is

336

00:06:39.400  -->  00:06:39.410

337

00:06:39.410  -->  00:06:41.260
take your table calculation and drag it

338

00:06:41.260  -->  00:06:41.270

339

00:06:41.270  -->  00:06:42.460
into measures.

340

00:06:42.460  -->  00:06:42.470

341

00:06:42.470  -->  00:06:44.200
This creates a new calculated field

342

00:06:44.200  -->  00:06:44.210

343

00:06:44.210  -->  00:06:46.060
which you can give a name, so we'll call

344

00:06:46.060  -->  00:06:46.070

345

00:06:46.070  -->  00:06:52.120
it idle capacity percent and we'll click

346

00:06:52.120  -->  00:06:52.130

347

00:06:52.130  -->  00:06:55.570
ok. So there's our idle capacity percent, as you

348

00:06:55.570  -->  00:06:55.580

349

00:06:55.580  -->  00:06:58.390
can see it has updated here and also it

350

00:06:58.390  -->  00:06:58.400

351

00:06:58.400  -->  00:07:00.310
is still a table calculation, so that

352

00:07:00.310  -->  00:07:00.320

353

00:07:00.320  -->  00:07:01.960
triangle is still telling us that this

354

00:07:01.960  -->  00:07:01.970

355

00:07:01.970  -->  00:07:04.420
is a table calculation but now we can

356

00:07:04.420  -->  00:07:04.430

357

00:07:04.430  -->  00:07:07.270
work with it as a calculated field. So

358

00:07:07.270  -->  00:07:07.280

359

00:07:07.280  -->  00:07:10.360
we'll right click, click create calculated

360

00:07:10.360  -->  00:07:10.370

361

00:07:10.370  -->  00:07:13.000
field and this one we'll call idle

362

00:07:13.000  -->  00:07:13.010

363

00:07:13.010  -->  00:07:17.140
capacity percent and also pause for

364

00:07:17.140  -->  00:07:17.150

365

00:07:17.150  -->  00:07:22.480
positive and here we'll say minus one multiplied by

366

00:07:22.480  -->  00:07:22.490

367

00:07:22.490  -->  00:07:27.280
idle capacity and click OK. That gives us

368

00:07:27.280  -->  00:07:27.290

369

00:07:27.290  -->  00:07:29.890
a new calculated field and if we drag it

370

00:07:29.890  -->  00:07:29.900

371

00:07:29.900  -->  00:07:32.410
in to replace idle capacity percent,

372

00:07:32.410  -->  00:07:32.420

373

00:07:32.420  -->  00:07:35.470
you'll see that the charts flip and also

374

00:07:35.470  -->  00:07:35.480

375

00:07:35.480  -->  00:07:36.910
you'll see that the triangle is still

376

00:07:36.910  -->  00:07:36.920

377

00:07:36.920  -->  00:07:39.310
there meaning that this new field idle

378

00:07:39.310  -->  00:07:39.320

379

00:07:39.320  -->  00:07:42.370
capacity percent pause is also a table

380

00:07:42.370  -->  00:07:42.380

381

00:07:42.380  -->  00:07:45.130
calculation which makes total sense. Now

382

00:07:45.130  -->  00:07:45.140

383

00:07:45.140  -->  00:07:46.690
the last thing we have to do is change

384

00:07:46.690  -->  00:07:46.700

385

00:07:46.700  -->  00:07:48.730
this ten percent line. So let's click

386

00:07:48.730  -->  00:07:48.740

387

00:07:48.740  -->  00:07:51.610
here, right click edit reference line and

388

00:07:51.610  -->  00:07:51.620

389

00:07:51.620  -->  00:07:53.320
change it from minus ten percent to ten

390

00:07:53.320  -->  00:07:53.330

391

00:07:53.330  -->  00:07:55.450
percent. Now there we go, we flipped on

392

00:07:55.450  -->  00:07:55.460

393

00:07:55.460  -->  00:07:57.310
visual and everything is positive now.

394

00:07:57.310  -->  00:07:57.320

395

00:07:57.320  -->  00:08:01.630
All we have to do is format the axis or even

396

00:08:01.630  -->  00:08:01.640

397

00:08:01.640  -->  00:08:04.930
this format, this value and change it to

398

00:08:04.930  -->  00:08:04.940

399

00:08:04.940  -->  00:08:07.930
a percent so it's ten percent and same

400

00:08:07.930  -->  00:08:07.940

401

00:08:07.940  -->  00:08:12.670
thing for the axis percent, ten percent, so it

402

00:08:12.670  -->  00:08:12.680

403

00:08:12.680  -->  00:08:15.940
doesn't have any decimals. So that's

404

00:08:15.940  -->  00:08:15.950

405

00:08:15.950  -->  00:08:18.340
that's great now, it's much easier if

406

00:08:18.340  -->  00:08:18.350

407

00:08:18.350  -->  00:08:22.210
you're looking for a machine that

408

00:08:22.210  -->  00:08:22.220

409

00:08:22.220  -->  00:08:23.740
exceeded the 10-percent line you just

410

00:08:23.740  -->  00:08:23.750

411

00:08:23.750  -->  00:08:26.020
look at the spikes and you see that

412

00:08:26.020  -->  00:08:26.030

413

00:08:26.030  -->  00:08:28.240
they're above this ten percent line and

414

00:08:28.240  -->  00:08:28.250

415

00:08:28.250  -->  00:08:31.180
that is perfect that means that you can

416

00:08:31.180  -->  00:08:31.190

417

00:08:31.190  -->  00:08:33.969
very easily and quickly find what you're

418

00:08:33.969  -->  00:08:33.979

419

00:08:33.979  -->  00:08:34.839
looking for.

420

00:08:34.839  -->  00:08:34.849

421

00:08:34.849  -->  00:08:36.700
So there you go, that is how you save

422

00:08:36.700  -->  00:08:36.710

423

00:08:36.710  -->  00:08:38.560
your table calculations in Tableau and

424

00:08:38.560  -->  00:08:38.570

425

00:08:38.570  -->  00:08:39.580
this brings us to the end of this

426

00:08:39.580  -->  00:08:39.590

427

00:08:39.590  -->  00:08:41.650
tutorial. I look forward to seeing you next time and

428

00:08:41.650  -->  00:08:41.660

429

00:08:41.660  -->  00:08:43.510
until then, Happy Analyzing!

430

00:08:43.510  -->  00:08:43.520

431

00:08:43.520  -->  00:08:51.910
