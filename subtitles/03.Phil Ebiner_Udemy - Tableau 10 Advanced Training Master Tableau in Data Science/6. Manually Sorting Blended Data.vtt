00:00:01.710  -->  00:00:06.680
Hello and welcome back to the Advanced

2

00:00:06.680  -->  00:00:06.690

3

00:00:06.690  -->  00:00:08.990
Course in Tableau. And in today's quick

4

00:00:08.990  -->  00:00:09.000

5

00:00:09.000  -->  00:00:10.910
tutorial we're going to learn an

6

00:00:10.910  -->  00:00:10.920

7

00:00:10.920  -->  00:00:12.799
advanced technique which relates to

8

00:00:12.799  -->  00:00:12.809

9

00:00:12.809  -->  00:00:15.890
blending data and let me show you why we

10

00:00:15.890  -->  00:00:15.900

11

00:00:15.900  -->  00:00:17.540
will need this technique in this

12

00:00:17.540  -->  00:00:17.550

13

00:00:17.550  -->  00:00:20.150
specific visualization. So when I play this

14

00:00:20.150  -->  00:00:20.160

15

00:00:20.160  -->  00:00:22.670
animation that we've created here

16

00:00:22.670  -->  00:00:22.680

17

00:00:22.680  -->  00:00:24.679
what you'll notice is I'm just going to

18

00:00:24.679  -->  00:00:24.689

19

00:00:24.689  -->  00:00:26.690
play it on medium speed. Actually let's

20

00:00:26.690  -->  00:00:26.700

21

00:00:26.700  -->  00:00:29.060
play on fast speed which you'll notice is

22

00:00:29.060  -->  00:00:29.070

23

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:32.870
watch this big red bubble. So let's go

24

00:00:32.870  -->  00:00:32.880

25

00:00:32.880  -->  00:00:34.970
again let's go to that again, if you look

26

00:00:34.970  -->  00:00:34.980

27

00:00:34.980  -->  00:00:36.500
at the big red bubble you can see that

28

00:00:36.500  -->  00:00:36.510

29

00:00:36.510  -->  00:00:39.410
it's so big that it's covering up a lot

30

00:00:39.410  -->  00:00:39.420

31

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:42.380
of smaller bubbles underneath it. So blue,

32

00:00:42.380  -->  00:00:42.390

33

00:00:42.390  -->  00:00:44.509
yellow, orange bubbles are hidden under

34

00:00:44.509  -->  00:00:44.519

35

00:00:44.519  -->  00:00:48.139
it and we want like a big big bubble

36

00:00:48.139  -->  00:00:48.149

37

00:00:48.149  -->  00:00:50.000
like that should be underneath all these

38

00:00:50.000  -->  00:00:50.010

39

00:00:50.010  -->  00:00:51.410
small bubbles because you'll still be

40

00:00:51.410  -->  00:00:51.420

41

00:00:51.420  -->  00:00:53.509
able to see it but at the same time

42

00:00:53.509  -->  00:00:53.519

43

00:00:53.519  -->  00:00:54.979
you'll better understand what's going

44

00:00:54.979  -->  00:00:54.989

45

00:00:54.989  -->  00:00:57.889
with the little smaller ones and that is

46

00:00:57.889  -->  00:00:57.899

47

00:00:57.899  -->  00:00:59.479
the case for instance with this bubble

48

00:00:59.479  -->  00:00:59.489

49

00:00:59.489  -->  00:01:02.119
which is representing India. It is under

50

00:01:02.119  -->  00:01:02.129

51

00:01:02.129  -->  00:01:04.369
the other bubbles and therefore it looks

52

00:01:04.369  -->  00:01:04.379

53

00:01:04.379  -->  00:01:06.440
good but this red bubble is above

54

00:01:06.440  -->  00:01:06.450

55

00:01:06.450  -->  00:01:08.389
everything and so are all other red

56

00:01:08.389  -->  00:01:08.399

57

00:01:08.399  -->  00:01:10.819
bubbles they're at the top and that is

58

00:01:10.819  -->  00:01:10.829

59

00:01:10.829  -->  00:01:13.249
because they are ordered in that way in

60

00:01:13.249  -->  00:01:13.259

61

00:01:13.259  -->  00:01:16.160
our color legend over here. So let's see how

62

00:01:16.160  -->  00:01:16.170

63

00:01:16.170  -->  00:01:18.800
we can correct that. What would we normally do

64

00:01:18.800  -->  00:01:18.810

65

00:01:18.810  -->  00:01:20.179
with this color legend. I'm just going to

66

00:01:20.179  -->  00:01:20.189

67

00:01:20.189  -->  00:01:22.399
move this legend over here so we can see

68

00:01:22.399  -->  00:01:22.409

69

00:01:22.409  -->  00:01:24.319
the color legend. What we normally do?

70

00:01:24.319  -->  00:01:24.329

71

00:01:24.329  -->  00:01:26.749
Normally would just drag around our

72

00:01:26.749  -->  00:01:26.759

73

00:01:26.759  -->  00:01:30.139
marks or colors in the color legend and

74

00:01:30.139  -->  00:01:30.149

75

00:01:30.149  -->  00:01:32.359
would put them above or below each other

76

00:01:32.359  -->  00:01:32.369

77

00:01:32.369  -->  00:01:34.279
like we want. But in this case we can't

78

00:01:34.279  -->  00:01:34.289

79

00:01:34.289  -->  00:01:36.020
do that right? We were trying to I'm

80

00:01:36.020  -->  00:01:36.030

81

00:01:36.030  -->  00:01:37.730
trying to click-and-drag but nothing is

82

00:01:37.730  -->  00:01:37.740

83

00:01:37.740  -->  00:01:40.190
happening, it's not moving and moreover

84

00:01:40.190  -->  00:01:40.200

85

00:01:40.200  -->  00:01:42.200
if i click the drop-down here I don't

86

00:01:42.200  -->  00:01:42.210

87

00:01:42.210  -->  00:01:44.690
have an option to sort or if i click

88

00:01:44.690  -->  00:01:44.700

89

00:01:44.700  -->  00:01:46.819
here I don't have an option to sort my

90

00:01:46.819  -->  00:01:46.829

91

00:01:46.829  -->  00:01:49.160
data and why is that? Well the reason

92

00:01:49.160  -->  00:01:49.170

93

00:01:49.170  -->  00:01:52.130
for that is because the color legend or

94

00:01:52.130  -->  00:01:52.140

95

00:01:52.140  -->  00:01:55.969
this region column is coming from a

96

00:01:55.969  -->  00:01:55.979

97

00:01:55.979  -->  00:01:57.440
secondary data source and you can tell

98

00:01:57.440  -->  00:01:57.450

99

00:01:57.450  -->  00:02:01.130
by this indicator here which is like a

100

00:02:01.130  -->  00:02:01.140

101

00:02:01.140  -->  00:02:03.499
database with a yellow mark instead of

102

00:02:03.499  -->  00:02:03.509

103

00:02:03.509  -->  00:02:05.240
blue mark and because it's coming from a

104

00:02:05.240  -->  00:02:05.250

105

00:02:05.250  -->  00:02:08.210
secondary data source you cannot sort by

106

00:02:08.210  -->  00:02:08.220

107

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:11.000
it just like that in your visualization.

108

00:02:11.000  -->  00:02:11.010

109

00:02:11.010  -->  00:02:12.920
You have to apply an advanced technique

110

00:02:12.920  -->  00:02:12.930

111

00:02:12.930  -->  00:02:14.340
which we'll learn right now.

112

00:02:14.340  -->  00:02:14.350

113

00:02:14.350  -->  00:02:17.790
So in order to sort your data by a

114

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:17.800

115

00:02:17.800  -->  00:02:19.440
column which is coming from a secondary

116

00:02:19.440  -->  00:02:19.450

117

00:02:19.450  -->  00:02:21.660
data source, you have to go to the data

118

00:02:21.660  -->  00:02:21.670

119

00:02:21.670  -->  00:02:24.180
source in your data pane, there it is,

120

00:02:24.180  -->  00:02:24.190

121

00:02:24.190  -->  00:02:27.360
our metadata countries and here you need

122

00:02:27.360  -->  00:02:27.370

123

00:02:27.370  -->  00:02:29.610
to find that column, you need to right click

124

00:02:29.610  -->  00:02:29.620

125

00:02:29.620  -->  00:02:31.560
that column and you need to go to

126

00:02:31.560  -->  00:02:31.570

127

00:02:31.570  -->  00:02:35.370
default properties and here you need to

128

00:02:35.370  -->  00:02:35.380

129

00:02:35.380  -->  00:02:40.650
select sort and here you can manually

130

00:02:40.650  -->  00:02:40.660

131

00:02:40.660  -->  00:02:44.640
specify a sort which you want to prevail

132

00:02:44.640  -->  00:02:44.650

133

00:02:44.650  -->  00:02:49.380
in visualizations involving this column.

134

00:02:49.380  -->  00:02:49.390

135

00:02:49.390  -->  00:02:52.110
So we want the red bubbles to be at the

136

00:02:52.110  -->  00:02:52.120

137

00:02:52.120  -->  00:02:54.060
bottom, so let's take east asian pacific

138

00:02:54.060  -->  00:02:54.070

139

00:02:54.070  -->  00:02:56.760
and move them all the way down to the

140

00:02:56.760  -->  00:02:56.770

141

00:02:56.770  -->  00:03:00.870
bottom and click apply and there you go

142

00:03:00.870  -->  00:03:00.880

143

00:03:00.880  -->  00:03:02.790
you can see that the red bubble has

144

00:03:02.790  -->  00:03:02.800

145

00:03:02.800  -->  00:03:04.560
moved to bottom and it's much better

146

00:03:04.560  -->  00:03:04.570

147

00:03:04.570  -->  00:03:06.960
this way, you can still see it but at the

148

00:03:06.960  -->  00:03:06.970

149

00:03:06.970  -->  00:03:08.280
same time you can see all the other

150

00:03:08.280  -->  00:03:08.290

151

00:03:08.290  -->  00:03:10.380
bubbles that are hidden underneath it.

152

00:03:10.380  -->  00:03:10.390

153

00:03:10.390  -->  00:03:12.420
Let's go ahead and play our visualization one

154

00:03:12.420  -->  00:03:12.430

155

00:03:12.430  -->  00:03:15.120
more time. So there you go you can see

156

00:03:15.120  -->  00:03:15.130

157

00:03:15.130  -->  00:03:16.590
that it's it's flying the same way it

158

00:03:16.590  -->  00:03:16.600

159

00:03:16.600  -->  00:03:18.630
was but now it's at the bottom and all

160

00:03:18.630  -->  00:03:18.640

161

00:03:18.640  -->  00:03:20.940
the red bubbles are now underneath and

162

00:03:20.940  -->  00:03:20.950

163

00:03:20.950  -->  00:03:23.370
that's a tip relating to best practices

164

00:03:23.370  -->  00:03:23.380

165

00:03:23.380  -->  00:03:25.020
in Tableau. You want to take care of your

166

00:03:25.020  -->  00:03:25.030

167

00:03:25.030  -->  00:03:27.690
users not sufficient to just deliver a

168

00:03:27.690  -->  00:03:27.700

169

00:03:27.700  -->  00:03:29.370
dashboard where all the informations

170

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:29.380

171

00:03:29.380  -->  00:03:30.510
present you have to make that

172

00:03:30.510  -->  00:03:30.520

173

00:03:30.520  -->  00:03:32.640
information accessible so the user can

174

00:03:32.640  -->  00:03:32.650

175

00:03:32.650  -->  00:03:34.650
put the mouse over every single bubble

176

00:03:34.650  -->  00:03:34.660

177

00:03:34.660  -->  00:03:37.200
and find out what country it is and find

178

00:03:37.200  -->  00:03:37.210

179

00:03:37.210  -->  00:03:39.390
out additional information relating to

180

00:03:39.390  -->  00:03:39.400

181

00:03:39.400  -->  00:03:41.520
that country. So there we go that's how

182

00:03:41.520  -->  00:03:41.530

183

00:03:41.530  -->  00:03:45.420
you can sort by field that come from

184

00:03:45.420  -->  00:03:45.430

185

00:03:45.430  -->  00:03:48.660
secondary data sources in Tableau. And I

186

00:03:48.660  -->  00:03:48.670

187

00:03:48.670  -->  00:03:50.100
look forward to seeing you next time.

188

00:03:50.100  -->  00:03:50.110

189

00:03:50.110  -->  00:03:56.640
Until then, happy analyzing.
