00:00:02.580  -->  00:00:06.559
Alright let's get started with this

2

00:00:06.559  -->  00:00:06.569

3

00:00:06.569  -->  00:00:08.179
section and right away I've got a

4

00:00:08.179  -->  00:00:08.189

5

00:00:08.189  -->  00:00:09.949
question for you, did that visualization

6

00:00:09.949  -->  00:00:09.959

7

00:00:09.959  -->  00:00:12.140
that you saw in the previous tutorial in

8

00:00:12.140  -->  00:00:12.150

9

00:00:12.150  -->  00:00:13.039
the video,

10

00:00:13.039  -->  00:00:13.049

11

00:00:13.049  -->  00:00:15.860
did it seem complicated? Well actually

12

00:00:15.860  -->  00:00:15.870

13

00:00:15.870  -->  00:00:18.740
it's not it's not hard to put together

14

00:00:18.740  -->  00:00:18.750

15

00:00:18.750  -->  00:00:20.510
all and you will be surprised how

16

00:00:20.510  -->  00:00:20.520

17

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:22.429
quickly we will deliver that

18

00:00:22.429  -->  00:00:22.439

19

00:00:22.439  -->  00:00:24.259
visualization. It will take us literally

20

00:00:24.259  -->  00:00:24.269

21

00:00:24.269  -->  00:00:25.939
three tutorials in this tutorial. We'll

22

00:00:25.939  -->  00:00:25.949

23

00:00:25.949  -->  00:00:27.679
connect to the datasets in the next

24

00:00:27.679  -->  00:00:27.689

25

00:00:27.689  -->  00:00:28.880
tutorial. We will create the

26

00:00:28.880  -->  00:00:28.890

27

00:00:28.890  -->  00:00:31.099
visualization and in the tutorial after

28

00:00:31.099  -->  00:00:31.109

29

00:00:31.109  -->  00:00:34.430
that we will add their animations all in

30

00:00:34.430  -->  00:00:34.440

31

00:00:34.440  -->  00:00:36.200
three tutorials, that's quick. So let's

32

00:00:36.200  -->  00:00:36.210

33

00:00:36.210  -->  00:00:37.579
get right into it.

34

00:00:37.579  -->  00:00:37.589

35

00:00:37.589  -->  00:00:39.799
So here's the data that we downloaded.

36

00:00:39.799  -->  00:00:39.809

37

00:00:39.809  -->  00:00:42.439
It's in section 5 animations and we've

38

00:00:42.439  -->  00:00:42.449

39

00:00:42.449  -->  00:00:44.240
got four files here so let's go through,

40

00:00:44.240  -->  00:00:44.250

41

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:47.240
so what is country meta data? Country

42

00:00:47.240  -->  00:00:47.250

43

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:50.090
meta data is basically your list of

44

00:00:50.090  -->  00:00:50.100

45

00:00:50.100  -->  00:00:52.490
countries of the world, so there's 215 of

46

00:00:52.490  -->  00:00:52.500

47

00:00:52.500  -->  00:00:56.660
them here and what it is showing us it's

48

00:00:56.660  -->  00:00:56.670

49

00:00:56.670  -->  00:00:59.060
got a country code so that's going to be

50

00:00:59.060  -->  00:00:59.070

51

00:00:59.070  -->  00:01:01.009
useful field for us the region where the

52

00:01:01.009  -->  00:01:01.019

53

00:01:01.019  -->  00:01:02.869
country's from. So the regions are a bit

54

00:01:02.869  -->  00:01:02.879

55

00:01:02.879  -->  00:01:04.039
different to what you saw in the video.

56

00:01:04.039  -->  00:01:04.049

57

00:01:04.049  -->  00:01:07.610
They these regions are taken from the

58

00:01:07.610  -->  00:01:07.620

59

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:09.710
World Bank classification, so we'll just

60

00:01:09.710  -->  00:01:09.720

61

00:01:09.720  -->  00:01:12.200
keep them as is here but just bear in

62

00:01:12.200  -->  00:01:12.210

63

00:01:12.210  -->  00:01:14.360
mind that the colors might be a bit

64

00:01:14.360  -->  00:01:14.370

65

00:01:14.370  -->  00:01:16.190
different to watch in the video then

66

00:01:16.190  -->  00:01:16.200

67

00:01:16.200  -->  00:01:17.570
it's got some additional data which we

68

00:01:17.570  -->  00:01:17.580

69

00:01:17.580  -->  00:01:19.730
won't be using but it's still here

70

00:01:19.730  -->  00:01:19.740

71

00:01:19.740  -->  00:01:22.550
nevertheless. So that's our country meta data.

72

00:01:22.550  -->  00:01:22.560

73

00:01:22.560  -->  00:01:26.000
Country population, so this file

74

00:01:26.000  -->  00:01:26.010

75

00:01:26.010  -->  00:01:28.610
presents us with I'll just make it a bit

76

00:01:28.610  -->  00:01:28.620

77

00:01:28.620  -->  00:01:30.890
more here. So this file presents us with

78

00:01:30.890  -->  00:01:30.900

79

00:01:30.900  -->  00:01:33.050
once again, the list of countries and

80

00:01:33.050  -->  00:01:33.060

81

00:01:33.060  -->  00:01:35.930
once again this thread 215 of them here.

82

00:01:35.930  -->  00:01:35.940

83

00:01:35.940  -->  00:01:39.200
Country code, the indicator name so this

84

00:01:39.200  -->  00:01:39.210

85

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:41.120
is the indicator the country population

86

00:01:41.120  -->  00:01:41.130

87

00:01:41.130  -->  00:01:43.580
is the indicator in this case, indicated

88

00:01:43.580  -->  00:01:43.590

89

00:01:43.590  -->  00:01:45.260
color call according to the world bank

90

00:01:45.260  -->  00:01:45.270

91

00:01:45.270  -->  00:01:48.080
and then it's got the data of the

92

00:01:48.080  -->  00:01:48.090

93

00:01:48.090  -->  00:01:49.460
population for each one of these

94

00:01:49.460  -->  00:01:49.470

95

00:01:49.470  -->  00:01:54.500
countries for the 50 for the past 50,

96

00:01:54.500  -->  00:01:54.510

97

00:01:54.510  -->  00:01:56.630
just over 50 years from 1960-

98

00:01:56.630  -->  00:01:56.640

99

00:01:56.640  -->  00:02:01.250
2013 so there

100

00:02:01.250  -->  00:02:01.260

101

00:02:01.260  -->  00:02:03.110
we go, that's our population data and the

102

00:02:03.110  -->  00:02:03.120

103

00:02:03.120  -->  00:02:05.090
remaining files look very similar to

104

00:02:05.090  -->  00:02:05.100

105

00:02:05.100  -->  00:02:06.800
that so we've got the fertility rate,

106

00:02:06.800  -->  00:02:06.810

107

00:02:06.810  -->  00:02:08.809
same thing different indicators name, so

108

00:02:08.809  -->  00:02:08.819

109

00:02:08.819  -->  00:02:10.369
keep that in mind because that will be

110

00:02:10.369  -->  00:02:10.379

111

00:02:10.379  -->  00:02:13.430
important when we are connecting these

112

00:02:13.430  -->  00:02:13.440

113

00:02:13.440  -->  00:02:15.559
datasets here's got a

114

00:02:15.559  -->  00:02:15.569

115

00:02:15.569  -->  00:02:17.420
her to fertility rates also for the same

116

00:02:17.420  -->  00:02:17.430

117

00:02:17.430  -->  00:02:20.539
years and finally we got life expectancy

118

00:02:20.539  -->  00:02:20.549

119

00:02:20.549  -->  00:02:22.610
same thing so another different

120

00:02:22.610  -->  00:02:22.620

121

00:02:22.620  -->  00:02:24.979
indicator and already we can see that

122

00:02:24.979  -->  00:02:24.989

123

00:02:24.989  -->  00:02:26.059
we're going to have to do a pivot

124

00:02:26.059  -->  00:02:26.069

125

00:02:26.069  -->  00:02:27.530
because this is not the best for me to

126

00:02:27.530  -->  00:02:27.540

127

00:02:27.540  -->  00:02:29.839
present but we are already very

128

00:02:29.839  -->  00:02:29.849

129

00:02:29.849  -->  00:02:32.149
comfortable with pivots by now it's

130

00:02:32.149  -->  00:02:32.159

131

00:02:32.159  -->  00:02:34.699
going to be very easy for us. So let's go

132

00:02:34.699  -->  00:02:34.709

133

00:02:34.709  -->  00:02:36.619
ahead and close all of these, so that we

134

00:02:36.619  -->  00:02:36.629

135

00:02:36.629  -->  00:02:37.819
can connect to them.

136

00:02:37.819  -->  00:02:37.829

137

00:02:37.829  -->  00:02:40.160
Here's my Tableau workbook, going to

138

00:02:40.160  -->  00:02:40.170

139

00:02:40.170  -->  00:02:42.349
connect to an excel file and doesn't

140

00:02:42.349  -->  00:02:42.359

141

00:02:42.359  -->  00:02:43.759
matter which one we start with connect

142

00:02:43.759  -->  00:02:43.769

143

00:02:43.769  -->  00:02:46.039
to country meta data.

144

00:02:46.039  -->  00:02:46.049

145

00:02:46.049  -->  00:02:48.140
There we go so there's a file down at

146

00:02:48.140  -->  00:02:48.150

147

00:02:48.150  -->  00:02:50.420
the bottom here, we've got the country

148

00:02:50.420  -->  00:02:50.430

149

00:02:50.430  -->  00:02:53.390
name, the country code so this file

150

00:02:53.390  -->  00:02:53.400

151

00:02:53.400  -->  00:02:54.740
we're going to be using to get the

152

00:02:54.740  -->  00:02:54.750

153

00:02:54.750  -->  00:02:56.240
region. This is what we're getting from

154

00:02:56.240  -->  00:02:56.250

155

00:02:56.250  -->  00:02:58.189
this file the rest of the information

156

00:02:58.189  -->  00:02:58.199

157

00:02:58.199  -->  00:03:00.709
doesn't really matter for us we don't

158

00:03:00.709  -->  00:03:00.719

159

00:03:00.719  -->  00:03:02.270
need to do a pivot here so it's going to

160

00:03:02.270  -->  00:03:02.280

161

00:03:02.280  -->  00:03:05.479
another data set excel and this time

162

00:03:05.479  -->  00:03:05.489

163

00:03:05.489  -->  00:03:09.199
we're going to look at population so

164

00:03:09.199  -->  00:03:09.209

165

00:03:09.209  -->  00:03:14.240
here we've got our date range right away

166

00:03:14.240  -->  00:03:14.250

167

00:03:14.250  -->  00:03:16.789
let's create this pivot select the dates

168

00:03:16.789  -->  00:03:16.799

169

00:03:16.799  -->  00:03:20.509
drop-down pivot and a red surname this

170

00:03:20.509  -->  00:03:20.519

171

00:03:20.519  -->  00:03:25.670
to year and this one is going to be

172

00:03:25.670  -->  00:03:25.680

173

00:03:25.680  -->  00:03:30.259
population perfect so as you can see

174

00:03:30.259  -->  00:03:30.269

175

00:03:30.269  -->  00:03:31.429
we've got the country name but we don't

176

00:03:31.429  -->  00:03:31.439

177

00:03:31.439  -->  00:03:33.080
have the region. We'll get the region from

178

00:03:33.080  -->  00:03:33.090

179

00:03:33.090  -->  00:03:36.080
the metadata from the metadata workbook,

180

00:03:36.080  -->  00:03:36.090

181

00:03:36.090  -->  00:03:39.710
worksheet. Ok excel so we put down

182

00:03:39.710  -->  00:03:39.720

183

00:03:39.720  -->  00:03:41.629
population fertility rates same thing

184

00:03:41.629  -->  00:03:41.639

185

00:03:41.639  -->  00:03:45.800
all the way 2013 and just clear on any

186

00:03:45.800  -->  00:03:45.810

187

00:03:45.810  -->  00:03:48.409
one of them click pivot and this one's

188

00:03:48.409  -->  00:03:48.419

189

00:03:48.419  -->  00:03:51.979
going to rename this to year again and

190

00:03:51.979  -->  00:03:51.989

191

00:03:51.989  -->  00:03:54.199
this one is going to be our fertility

192

00:03:54.199  -->  00:03:54.209

193

00:03:54.209  -->  00:03:56.659
rate. A bit of tedious work but that's

194

00:03:56.659  -->  00:03:56.669

195

00:03:56.669  -->  00:03:58.520
what data preparation is all about.

196

00:03:58.520  -->  00:03:58.530

197

00:03:58.530  -->  00:04:01.759
We're pretty lucky here that this is how

198

00:04:01.759  -->  00:04:01.769

199

00:04:01.769  -->  00:04:04.520
this is the full extent of what we're

200

00:04:04.520  -->  00:04:04.530

201

00:04:04.530  -->  00:04:06.080
going to have to do with our data so

202

00:04:06.080  -->  00:04:06.090

203

00:04:06.090  -->  00:04:10.219
one more to go and pivot there we go. So

204

00:04:10.219  -->  00:04:10.229

205

00:04:10.229  -->  00:04:13.999
rename this is going to be here and what

206

00:04:13.999  -->  00:04:14.009

207

00:04:14.009  -->  00:04:15.589
are we looking at here

208

00:04:15.589  -->  00:04:15.599

209

00:04:15.599  -->  00:04:19.399
life expectancy.

210

00:04:19.399  -->  00:04:19.409

211

00:04:19.409  -->  00:04:22.939
Alright so there are data sets and as

212

00:04:22.939  -->  00:04:22.949

213

00:04:22.949  -->  00:04:25.250
you have probably guessed we are not

214

00:04:25.250  -->  00:04:25.260

215

00:04:25.260  -->  00:04:27.480
doing joins in this case we are going

216

00:04:27.480  -->  00:04:27.490

217

00:04:27.490  -->  00:04:29.730
to be using blends in this section of

218

00:04:29.730  -->  00:04:29.740

219

00:04:29.740  -->  00:04:30.689
the course and that's because we've

220

00:04:30.689  -->  00:04:30.699

221

00:04:30.699  -->  00:04:33.120
already connected to our datasets. If you

222

00:04:33.120  -->  00:04:33.130

223

00:04:33.130  -->  00:04:35.879
would like to do this through joins then

224

00:04:35.879  -->  00:04:35.889

225

00:04:35.889  -->  00:04:38.700
by all means you can still achieve the

226

00:04:38.700  -->  00:04:38.710

227

00:04:38.710  -->  00:04:40.980
same result through join. Of course your

228

00:04:40.980  -->  00:04:40.990

229

00:04:40.990  -->  00:04:42.749
process of creating a position be

230

00:04:42.749  -->  00:04:42.759

231

00:04:42.759  -->  00:04:44.490
different be different but in our case

232

00:04:44.490  -->  00:04:44.500

233

00:04:44.500  -->  00:04:46.439
we are going to go ahead with blends and

234

00:04:46.439  -->  00:04:46.449

235

00:04:46.449  -->  00:04:47.999
that is why before we finish off this

236

00:04:47.999  -->  00:04:48.009

237

00:04:48.009  -->  00:04:50.040
tutorial, we have to correct one little

238

00:04:50.040  -->  00:04:50.050

239

00:04:50.050  -->  00:04:54.150
thing for the upcoming blends and that

240

00:04:54.150  -->  00:04:54.160

241

00:04:54.160  -->  00:04:57.420
is the relationships between data. So if

242

00:04:57.420  -->  00:04:57.430

243

00:04:57.430  -->  00:04:59.820
you go into data and relationships and

244

00:04:59.820  -->  00:04:59.830

245

00:04:59.830  -->  00:05:02.249
let's say let's select one that we're

246

00:05:02.249  -->  00:05:02.259

247

00:05:02.259  -->  00:05:04.920
going to use as our primary data source

248

00:05:04.920  -->  00:05:04.930

249

00:05:04.930  -->  00:05:07.589
and visualization and right away a hint

250

00:05:07.589  -->  00:05:07.599

251

00:05:07.599  -->  00:05:09.480
we are not going to use meta data because it

252

00:05:09.480  -->  00:05:09.490

253

00:05:09.490  -->  00:05:10.920
doesn't have year and we're going to

254

00:05:10.920  -->  00:05:10.930

255

00:05:10.930  -->  00:05:13.140
need year for the animation so you can

256

00:05:13.140  -->  00:05:13.150

257

00:05:13.150  -->  00:05:14.550
select any one of the other three

258

00:05:14.550  -->  00:05:14.560

259

00:05:14.560  -->  00:05:16.350
datasets. I'm just going to start country

260

00:05:16.350  -->  00:05:16.360

261

00:05:16.360  -->  00:05:19.290
population and what you'll find here is

262

00:05:19.290  -->  00:05:19.300

263

00:05:19.300  -->  00:05:22.200
the way it's going to be blended with

264

00:05:22.200  -->  00:05:22.210

265

00:05:22.210  -->  00:05:25.050
the rest of the data sets. Now in here,

266

00:05:25.050  -->  00:05:25.060

267

00:05:25.060  -->  00:05:26.820
you will notice that Tableau has

268

00:05:26.820  -->  00:05:26.830

269

00:05:26.830  -->  00:05:29.850
automatically picked up some of the

270

00:05:29.850  -->  00:05:29.860

271

00:05:29.860  -->  00:05:31.709
field that is going to be blending on

272

00:05:31.709  -->  00:05:31.719

273

00:05:31.719  -->  00:05:33.779
and the way it picks them up is it just

274

00:05:33.779  -->  00:05:33.789

275

00:05:33.789  -->  00:05:35.820
looks for matching names. So I feel that

276

00:05:35.820  -->  00:05:35.830

277

00:05:35.830  -->  00:05:37.980
is present in this data set the primary

278

00:05:37.980  -->  00:05:37.990

279

00:05:37.990  -->  00:05:39.600
data source and secondary data source

280

00:05:39.600  -->  00:05:39.610

281

00:05:39.610  -->  00:05:41.249
and if the name matches then it's going

282

00:05:41.249  -->  00:05:41.259

283

00:05:41.259  -->  00:05:42.450
to blend on them.

284

00:05:42.450  -->  00:05:42.460

285

00:05:42.460  -->  00:05:45.120
Well that's okay most of the time but in

286

00:05:45.120  -->  00:05:45.130

287

00:05:45.130  -->  00:05:47.879
our cas,e it's actually not. So country

288

00:05:47.879  -->  00:05:47.889

289

00:05:47.889  -->  00:05:49.649
code is a right country name is alright,

290

00:05:49.649  -->  00:05:49.659

291

00:05:49.659  -->  00:05:51.990
but indicator code is not alright, as

292

00:05:51.990  -->  00:05:52.000

293

00:05:52.000  -->  00:05:55.560
we saw indicator code is the code for

294

00:05:55.560  -->  00:05:55.570

295

00:05:55.570  -->  00:05:59.159
the file. So in this case, in country

296

00:05:59.159  -->  00:05:59.169

297

00:05:59.169  -->  00:06:00.809
population indicated code is going to be

298

00:06:00.809  -->  00:06:00.819

299

00:06:00.819  -->  00:06:02.939
relating to country population. In case

300

00:06:02.939  -->  00:06:02.949

301

00:06:02.949  -->  00:06:04.230
of fertility rate, it's going to be a

302

00:06:04.230  -->  00:06:04.240

303

00:06:04.240  -->  00:06:06.059
different code and same thing for

304

00:06:06.059  -->  00:06:06.069

305

00:06:06.069  -->  00:06:08.520
indicating name because it is relating

306

00:06:08.520  -->  00:06:08.530

307

00:06:08.530  -->  00:06:11.219
to the file. So we have to remove these

308

00:06:11.219  -->  00:06:11.229

309

00:06:11.229  -->  00:06:12.870
two, so we're going to go ahead and do

310

00:06:12.870  -->  00:06:12.880

311

00:06:12.880  -->  00:06:14.820
that we're going to remove indicate a

312

00:06:14.820  -->  00:06:14.830

313

00:06:14.830  -->  00:06:16.559
code and indicate a name so that the

314

00:06:16.559  -->  00:06:16.569

315

00:06:16.569  -->  00:06:18.899
blend goes ahead correctly and also

316

00:06:18.899  -->  00:06:18.909

317

00:06:18.909  -->  00:06:20.550
we're going to remove country name and

318

00:06:20.550  -->  00:06:20.560

319

00:06:20.560  -->  00:06:22.740
that is because we don't need that. We

320

00:06:22.740  -->  00:06:22.750

321

00:06:22.750  -->  00:06:25.290
country code is sufficient to blend the

322

00:06:25.290  -->  00:06:25.300

323

00:06:25.300  -->  00:06:27.779
data. We want to blend it on year and

324

00:06:27.779  -->  00:06:27.789

325

00:06:27.789  -->  00:06:29.370
country code, so we want to match up

326

00:06:29.370  -->  00:06:29.380

327

00:06:29.380  -->  00:06:31.800
population and fertility rate for the

328

00:06:31.800  -->  00:06:31.810

329

00:06:31.810  -->  00:06:34.649
country and for the correct year but

330

00:06:34.649  -->  00:06:34.659

331

00:06:34.659  -->  00:06:36.870
country name is excessive right? So if

332

00:06:36.870  -->  00:06:36.880

333

00:06:36.880  -->  00:06:37.950
you have country code you don't need

334

00:06:37.950  -->  00:06:37.960

335

00:06:37.960  -->  00:06:39.899
country name already and also be careful

336

00:06:39.899  -->  00:06:39.909

337

00:06:39.909  -->  00:06:40.780
these things

338

00:06:40.780  -->  00:06:40.790

339

00:06:40.790  -->  00:06:42.580
if for some reason one of the files

340

00:06:42.580  -->  00:06:42.590

341

00:06:42.590  -->  00:06:44.680
country names are spelled a bit

342

00:06:44.680  -->  00:06:44.690

343

00:06:44.690  -->  00:06:46.810
differently or there's an extra symbol

344

00:06:46.810  -->  00:06:46.820

345

00:06:46.820  -->  00:06:49.120
or there's no spaces or hyphens or

346

00:06:49.120  -->  00:06:49.130

347

00:06:49.130  -->  00:06:51.010
something that. So even if one of the

348

00:06:51.010  -->  00:06:51.020

349

00:06:51.020  -->  00:06:52.510
country's spelled differently in one of the

350

00:06:52.510  -->  00:06:52.520

351

00:06:52.520  -->  00:06:54.190
files, you might run into problems.

352

00:06:54.190  -->  00:06:54.200

353

00:06:54.200  -->  00:06:56.200
Country codes are much more reliable

354

00:06:56.200  -->  00:06:56.210

355

00:06:56.210  -->  00:06:58.870
that sense so I prefer to stick with

356

00:06:58.870  -->  00:06:58.880

357

00:06:58.880  -->  00:07:00.340
country codes and get rid of country

358

00:07:00.340  -->  00:07:00.350

359

00:07:00.350  -->  00:07:02.200
names. So we're going to do that and

360

00:07:02.200  -->  00:07:02.210

361

00:07:02.210  -->  00:07:04.570
we're also going to do the same for the

362

00:07:04.570  -->  00:07:04.580

363

00:07:04.580  -->  00:07:07.420
rest of the file. So life expectancy at

364

00:07:07.420  -->  00:07:07.430

365

00:07:07.430  -->  00:07:08.170
birth,

366

00:07:08.170  -->  00:07:08.180

367

00:07:08.180  -->  00:07:09.940
we just want to keep country code and

368

00:07:09.940  -->  00:07:09.950

369

00:07:09.950  -->  00:07:13.090
year and metadata there is no year here

370

00:07:13.090  -->  00:07:13.100

371

00:07:13.100  -->  00:07:15.400
so we just want to keep country code. So

372

00:07:15.400  -->  00:07:15.410

373

00:07:15.410  -->  00:07:17.350
just look through them once again

374

00:07:17.350  -->  00:07:17.360

375

00:07:17.360  -->  00:07:19.180
sometimes this happens when you're

376

00:07:19.180  -->  00:07:19.190

377

00:07:19.190  -->  00:07:22.390
working with a couple I think it's maybe

378

00:07:22.390  -->  00:07:22.400

379

00:07:22.400  -->  00:07:24.820
a glitch just keeps coming back so just

380

00:07:24.820  -->  00:07:24.830

381

00:07:24.830  -->  00:07:27.070
make sure that you don't have any of

382

00:07:27.070  -->  00:07:27.080

383

00:07:27.080  -->  00:07:28.270
those situations there we go

384

00:07:28.270  -->  00:07:28.280

385

00:07:28.280  -->  00:07:30.640
country code year and go here and just

386

00:07:30.640  -->  00:07:30.650

387

00:07:30.650  -->  00:07:33.310
control and click OK and maybe just

388

00:07:33.310  -->  00:07:33.320

389

00:07:33.320  -->  00:07:34.720
double-check that.

390

00:07:34.720  -->  00:07:34.730

391

00:07:34.730  -->  00:07:38.470
There we go so which one we're looking

392

00:07:38.470  -->  00:07:38.480

393

00:07:38.480  -->  00:07:41.230
at population and just looking at how

394

00:07:41.230  -->  00:07:41.240

395

00:07:41.240  -->  00:07:43.270
its connecting. If you choose to change

396

00:07:43.270  -->  00:07:43.280

397

00:07:43.280  -->  00:07:44.920
your primary data source, make sure to

398

00:07:44.920  -->  00:07:44.930

399

00:07:44.930  -->  00:07:47.530
perform that as well for the other data

400

00:07:47.530  -->  00:07:47.540

401

00:07:47.540  -->  00:07:49.330
sources because here as you can see it

402

00:07:49.330  -->  00:07:49.340

403

00:07:49.340  -->  00:07:50.980
hasn't been corrected but we're going to

404

00:07:50.980  -->  00:07:50.990

405

00:07:50.990  -->  00:07:53.440
stick with population as our primary

406

00:07:53.440  -->  00:07:53.450

407

00:07:53.450  -->  00:07:55.630
data source and we will get started on

408

00:07:55.630  -->  00:07:55.640

409

00:07:55.640  -->  00:07:57.550
the visualization and actually finish

410

00:07:57.550  -->  00:07:57.560

411

00:07:57.560  -->  00:07:59.110
the visualization to in the next

412

00:07:59.110  -->  00:07:59.120

413

00:07:59.120  -->  00:08:00.610
tutorial I look forward to seeing you

414

00:08:00.610  -->  00:08:00.620

415

00:08:00.620  -->  00:08:07.900
then and until next time, happy analyzing.
