00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,710
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:06,720

3

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:08,960
course on Tableau. Today we're connecting

4

00:00:08,960  -->  00:00:08,970

5

00:00:08,970  -->  00:00:10,820
to our third data set for this

6

00:00:10,820  -->  00:00:10,830

7

00:00:10,830  -->  00:00:13,100
section which is population statistics

8

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:13,110

9

00:00:13,110  -->  00:00:15,169
for Australia for the different

10

00:00:15,169  -->  00:00:15,179

11

00:00:15,179  -->  00:00:15,919
states.

12

00:00:15,919  -->  00:00:15,929

13

00:00:15,929  -->  00:00:18,080
Let's go ahead and do that, we go to the

14

00:00:18,080  -->  00:00:18,090

15

00:00:18,090  -->  00:00:21,410
advanced course folder then we've got to

16

00:00:21,410  -->  00:00:21,420

17

00:00:21,420  -->  00:00:23,060
this file here which is demographic

18

00:00:23,060  -->  00:00:23,070

19

00:00:23,070  -->  00:00:26,450
statistics and let's bring up Excel and

20

00:00:26,450  -->  00:00:26,460

21

00:00:26,460  -->  00:00:28,490
will open up this file.

22

00:00:28,490  -->  00:00:28,500

23

00:00:28,500  -->  00:00:29,870
Alright, so once again you can see that

24

00:00:29,870  -->  00:00:29,880

25

00:00:29,880  -->  00:00:32,030
this is an ABS file which stands for

26

00:00:32,030  -->  00:00:32,040

27

00:00:32,040  -->  00:00:35,420
Australian Bureau of Statistics and here

28

00:00:35,420  -->  00:00:35,430

29

00:00:35,430  -->  00:00:40,250
we've got the index for our data set

30

00:00:40,250  -->  00:00:40,260

31

00:00:40,260  -->  00:00:42,260
which and the data set is in the second

32

00:00:42,260  -->  00:00:42,270

33

00:00:42,270  -->  00:00:46,700
tab again which is here and in this data

34

00:00:46,700  -->  00:00:46,710

35

00:00:46,710  -->  00:00:47,180
set

36

00:00:47,180  -->  00:00:47,190

37

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:49,880
we've got a bit of a few, fewer rows

38

00:00:49,880  -->  00:00:49,890

39

00:00:49,890  -->  00:00:54,260
and previously, so we've got I mean do we

40

00:00:54,260  -->  00:00:54,270

41

00:00:54,270  -->  00:00:56,569
have we have a hundred and forty six

42

00:00:56,569  -->  00:00:56,579

43

00:00:56,579  -->  00:00:58,369
rows in total, so hundred and thirty-six

44

00:00:58,369  -->  00:00:58,379

45

00:00:58,379  -->  00:01:02,389
observations and that is because the

46

00:01:02,389  -->  00:01:02,399

47

00:01:02,399  -->  00:01:04,549
data at this time is quarterly so it's

48

00:01:04,549  -->  00:01:04,559

49

00:01:04,559  -->  00:01:07,340
not monthly

50

00:01:07,340  -->  00:01:07,350

51

00:01:07,350  -->  00:01:08,990
as previously it's actually quarterly. So

52

00:01:08,990  -->  00:01:09,000

53

00:01:09,000  -->  00:01:11,300
June, Septermber, December, March, June and so on.

54

00:01:11,400  -->  00:01:14,060
And what do we have? Here you can see

55

00:01:14,060  -->  00:01:14,070

56

00:01:14,070  -->  00:01:18,109
that we've got once again the name of

57

00:01:18,109  -->  00:01:18,119

58

00:01:18,119  -->  00:01:19,429
the indicator which is estimated

59

00:01:19,429  -->  00:01:19,439

60

00:01:19,439  -->  00:01:21,710
resident population and then the gender

61

00:01:21,710  -->  00:01:21,720

62

00:01:21,720  -->  00:01:25,070
male and then the state. So this is males

63

00:01:25,070  -->  00:01:25,080

64

00:01:25,080  -->  00:01:27,440
for all of the states then we've got

65

00:01:27,440  -->  00:01:27,450

66

00:01:27,450  -->  00:01:30,710
females over here and then we've got

67

00:01:30,710  -->  00:01:30,720

68

00:01:30,720  -->  00:01:32,749
finally we just got persons which is a

69

00:01:32,749  -->  00:01:32,759

70

00:01:32,759  -->  00:01:39,350
total male plus female. Alright and once

71

00:01:39,350  -->  00:01:39,360

72

00:01:39,360  -->  00:01:41,060
again these rows as you can see these

73

00:01:41,060  -->  00:01:41,070

74

00:01:41,070  -->  00:01:42,920
ones are here they're not changing as

75

00:01:42,920  -->  00:01:42,930

76

00:01:42,930  -->  00:01:44,539
you as I scroll through so we're going

77

00:01:44,539  -->  00:01:44,549

78

00:01:44,549  -->  00:01:46,940
to get rid of them and we're going to

79

00:01:46,940  -->  00:01:46,950

80

00:01:46,950  -->  00:01:49,219
get rid of series ID. So similar

81

00:01:49,219  -->  00:01:49,229

82

00:01:49,229  -->  00:01:51,590
procedure to what we did before if you

83

00:01:51,590  -->  00:01:51,600

84

00:01:51,600  -->  00:01:53,420
want to practice then feel free to pause

85

00:01:53,420  -->  00:01:53,430

86

00:01:53,430  -->  00:01:56,209
this video and go ahead and perform all

87

00:01:56,209  -->  00:01:56,219

88

00:01:56,219  -->  00:01:58,789
the same task we did previously,

89

00:01:58,789  -->  00:01:58,799

90

00:01:58,799  -->  00:02:00,620
to connect the data set including the

91

00:02:00,620  -->  00:02:00,630

92

00:02:00,630  -->  00:02:03,950
pivot and then we can meet up towards

93

00:02:03,950  -->  00:02:03,960

94

00:02:03,960  -->  00:02:05,749
the end of this video and see how we

95

00:02:05,749  -->  00:02:05,759

96

00:02:05,759  -->  00:02:07,340
went and see what additional things that

97

00:02:07,340  -->  00:02:07,350

98

00:02:07,350  -->  00:02:09,050
we need to do with this specific data

99

00:02:09,050  -->  00:02:09,060

100

00:02:09,060  -->  00:02:11,390
set. Otherwise, if you haven't paused the

101

00:02:11,390  -->  00:02:11,400

102

00:02:11,400  -->  00:02:13,280
video, I am going to continue now.

103

00:02:13,280  -->  00:02:13,290

104

00:02:13,290  -->  00:02:18,020
So first thing we must not forget is we

105

00:02:18,020  -->  00:02:18,030

106

00:02:18,030  -->  00:02:20,899
need to go back to our folder and create

107

00:02:20,899  -->  00:02:20,909

108

00:02:20,909  -->  00:02:25,699
a copy. So there we go and just going to

109

00:02:25,699  -->  00:02:25,709

110

00:02:25,709  -->  00:02:27,530
move this here so I'm just going to move

111

00:02:27,530  -->  00:02:27,540

112

00:02:27,540  -->  00:02:29,899
the copied file here. I'm really curious

113

00:02:29,899  -->  00:02:29,909

114

00:02:29,909  -->  00:02:31,460
if you did pause the video did you

115

00:02:31,460  -->  00:02:31,470

116

00:02:31,470  -->  00:02:33,140
remember that step.

117

00:02:33,140  -->  00:02:33,150

118

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:34,880
It's always important to have a copy of

119

00:02:34,880  -->  00:02:34,890

120

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:37,099
your original data source, or data

121

00:02:37,099  -->  00:02:37,109

122

00:02:37,109  -->  00:02:39,349
set because then you can always refer

123

00:02:39,349  -->  00:02:39,359

124

00:02:39,359  -->  00:02:41,390
to it in case there are any questions.

125

00:02:41,390  -->  00:02:41,400

126

00:02:41,400  -->  00:02:43,190
So there we go, so we've done that and

127

00:02:43,190  -->  00:02:43,200

128

00:02:43,200  -->  00:02:46,069
now we can safely remove the rows so

129

00:02:46,069  -->  00:02:46,079

130

00:02:46,079  -->  00:02:48,559
let's get rid of all of these control minus

131

00:02:48,559  -->  00:02:48,569

132

00:02:48,569  -->  00:02:51,860
and we're done. And now we're simply

133

00:02:51,860  -->  00:02:51,870

134

00:02:51,870  -->  00:02:55,759
going to go and save this file, close it

135

00:02:55,759  -->  00:02:55,769

136

00:02:55,769  -->  00:02:58,369
and we're going to go to Tableau and

137

00:02:58,369  -->  00:02:58,379

138

00:02:58,379  -->  00:03:00,470
connect to our new data source by clicking

139

00:03:00,470  -->  00:03:00,480

140

00:03:00,480  -->  00:03:01,970
this button up over here,

141

00:03:01,970  -->  00:03:01,980

142

00:03:01,980  -->  00:03:05,809
excel and here we're going to select our

143

00:03:05,809  -->  00:03:05,819

144

00:03:05,819  -->  00:03:09,199
data source which is this one. Click open

145

00:03:09,199  -->  00:03:09,209

146

00:03:09,209  -->  00:03:12,770
even a second and once again scroll to

147

00:03:12,770  -->  00:03:12,780

148

00:03:12,780  -->  00:03:14,869
the bottom find our data which is

149

00:03:14,869  -->  00:03:14,879

150

00:03:14,879  -->  00:03:18,439
here and now we want to perform the

151

00:03:18,439  -->  00:03:18,449

152

00:03:18,449  -->  00:03:20,240
pivot so we can see that everything has

153

00:03:20,240  -->  00:03:20,250

154

00:03:20,250  -->  00:03:22,129
a number so we don't need to hide any

155

00:03:22,129  -->  00:03:22,139

156

00:03:22,139  -->  00:03:24,559
columns which is good. So just select all

157

00:03:24,559  -->  00:03:24,569

158

00:03:24,569  -->  00:03:27,349
these and click the drop-down anywhere.

159

00:03:27,349  -->  00:03:27,359

160

00:03:27,359  -->  00:03:30,229
And could pivot and I'll pivot ready. We

161

00:03:30,229  -->  00:03:30,239

162

00:03:30,239  -->  00:03:32,390
just have to rename it so oh well

163

00:03:32,390  -->  00:03:32,400

164

00:03:32,400  -->  00:03:34,039
children and of course means to the

165

00:03:34,039  -->  00:03:34,049

166

00:03:34,049  -->  00:03:36,890
split so do the split here hide this

167

00:03:36,890  -->  00:03:36,900

168

00:03:36,900  -->  00:03:39,319
column we don't need it this one we're

169

00:03:39,319  -->  00:03:39,329

170

00:03:39,329  -->  00:03:44,000
going to rename to a gender and this one

171

00:03:44,000  -->  00:03:44,010

172

00:03:44,010  -->  00:03:47,180
we're going to rename to state. It's got

173

00:03:47,180  -->  00:03:47,190

174

00:03:47,190  -->  00:03:48,830
Australia, I think that's the total

175

00:03:48,830  -->  00:03:48,840

176

00:03:48,840  -->  00:03:51,409
if you go down you can see that then

177

00:03:51,409  -->  00:03:51,419

178

00:03:51,419  -->  00:03:53,569
it's got the state's there as well and

179

00:03:53,569  -->  00:03:53,579

180

00:03:53,579  -->  00:03:55,969
here we're going to rename this to

181

00:03:55,969  -->  00:03:55,979

182

00:03:55,979  -->  00:03:58,849
population.

183

00:03:58,849  -->  00:03:58,859

184

00:03:58,859  -->  00:04:01,399
Alright so that's good, can you see how

185

00:04:01,399  -->  00:04:01,409

186

00:04:01,409  -->  00:04:04,280
quickly that happens right so in Tableau

187

00:04:04,280  -->  00:04:04,290

188

00:04:04,290  -->  00:04:06,020
data preparation with these advanced

189

00:04:06,020  -->  00:04:06,030

190

00:04:06,030  -->  00:04:08,569
tools is just lightning fast you don't

191

00:04:08,569  -->  00:04:08,579

192

00:04:08,579  -->  00:04:11,149
have to do any pivots in Excel and so on

193

00:04:11,149  -->  00:04:11,159

194

00:04:11,159  -->  00:04:12,890
your data basis very quick very

195

00:04:12,890  -->  00:04:12,900

196

00:04:12,900  -->  00:04:13,670
convenient,

197

00:04:13,670  -->  00:04:13,680

198

00:04:13,680  -->  00:04:16,099
great! Now we' re going to add a data

199

00:04:16,099  -->  00:04:16,109

200

00:04:16,109  -->  00:04:18,080
source filter here and that is because

201

00:04:18,080  -->  00:04:18,090

202

00:04:18,090  -->  00:04:23,180
we have female, we have male and we have

203

00:04:23,180  -->  00:04:23,190

204

00:04:23,190  -->  00:04:26,029
persons right? so we don't want to all of

205

00:04:26,029  -->  00:04:26,039

206

00:04:26,039  -->  00:04:26,790
them, we just

207

00:04:26,790  -->  00:04:26,800

208

00:04:26,800  -->  00:04:30,930
and one specific category which is

209

00:04:30,930  -->  00:04:30,940

210

00:04:30,940  -->  00:04:33,029
persons we don't want female or male. In

211

00:04:33,029  -->  00:04:33,039

212

00:04:33,039  -->  00:04:35,010
fact you don't have to add it as a data

213

00:04:35,010  -->  00:04:35,020

214

00:04:35,020  -->  00:04:36,930
source filter because this is one of

215

00:04:36,930  -->  00:04:36,940

216

00:04:36,940  -->  00:04:39,420
those cases when further down the track

217

00:04:39,420  -->  00:04:39,430

218

00:04:39,430  -->  00:04:42,510
your executive board might say all we

219

00:04:42,510  -->  00:04:42,520

220

00:04:42,520  -->  00:04:44,909
want to just analyze the behavior of

221

00:04:44,909  -->  00:04:44,919

222

00:04:44,919  -->  00:04:47,219
females because maybe they shop more

223

00:04:47,219  -->  00:04:47,229

224

00:04:47,229  -->  00:04:50,670
with us or males or something that but

225

00:04:50,670  -->  00:04:50,680

226

00:04:50,680  -->  00:04:52,110
in our case we're going to assume that

227

00:04:52,110  -->  00:04:52,120

228

00:04:52,120  -->  00:04:55,050
females and males shop equally with us

229

00:04:55,050  -->  00:04:55,060

230

00:04:55,060  -->  00:04:58,409
and we're actually going to keep the

231

00:04:58,409  -->  00:04:58,419

232

00:04:58,419  -->  00:05:00,629
person's rather than females and males

233

00:05:00,629  -->  00:05:00,639

234

00:05:00,639  -->  00:05:03,270
at the data source level. Once again feel free not

235

00:05:03,270  -->  00:05:03,280

236

00:05:03,280  -->  00:05:05,040
to do it this way feel free to use a

237

00:05:05,040  -->  00:05:05,050

238

00:05:05,050  -->  00:05:07,290
filter in  the visualizations up but a

239

00:05:07,290  -->  00:05:07,300

240

00:05:07,300  -->  00:05:10,379
good opportunity to practice data  source of

241

00:05:10,379  -->  00:05:10,389

242

00:05:10,389  -->  00:05:12,540
filters and one more time. So we're going

243

00:05:12,540  -->  00:05:12,550

244

00:05:12,550  -->  00:05:14,909
to keep persons i'm going to click ok

245

00:05:14,909  -->  00:05:14,919

246

00:05:14,919  -->  00:05:18,180
and as you can see here we are applying

247

00:05:18,180  -->  00:05:18,190

248

00:05:18,190  -->  00:05:20,640
this filter off to the pivot's has

249

00:05:20,640  -->  00:05:20,650

250

00:05:20,650  -->  00:05:21,930
been done so that's that's kind of an

251

00:05:21,930  -->  00:05:21,940

252

00:05:21,940  -->  00:05:23,550
important thing. So here you can see that

253

00:05:23,550  -->  00:05:23,560

254

00:05:23,560  -->  00:05:26,279
these are pivoted fields or the fields

255

00:05:26,279  -->  00:05:26,289

256

00:05:26,289  -->  00:05:29,100
that we have after the pivot. If you perform,

257

00:05:29,100  -->  00:05:29,110

258

00:05:29,110  -->  00:05:30,719
if you don't do the pivot then you'll

259

00:05:30,719  -->  00:05:30,729

260

00:05:30,729  -->  00:05:32,279
have different fields that you can

261

00:05:32,279  -->  00:05:32,289

262

00:05:32,289  -->  00:05:35,459
filter on so we're going to keep persons

263

00:05:35,459  -->  00:05:35,469

264

00:05:35,469  -->  00:05:37,740
and there we go those are the records

265

00:05:37,740  -->  00:05:37,750

266

00:05:37,750  -->  00:05:40,260
that we're going to be working with.

267

00:05:40,260  -->  00:05:40,270

268

00:05:40,270  -->  00:05:42,360
Alright so that's all for today. That was a

269

00:05:42,360  -->  00:05:42,370

270

00:05:42,370  -->  00:05:44,580
good exercise for us to do and see how

271

00:05:44,580  -->  00:05:44,590

272

00:05:44,590  -->  00:05:47,100
to perform the pivots and splits and

273

00:05:47,100  -->  00:05:47,110

274

00:05:47,110  -->  00:05:49,769
data source filters one more time and in

275

00:05:49,769  -->  00:05:49,779

276

00:05:49,779  -->  00:05:50,939
the next tutorial we're going to talk

277

00:05:50,939  -->  00:05:50,949

278

00:05:50,949  -->  00:05:52,680
about some advanced blending which will

279

00:05:52,680  -->  00:05:52,690

280

00:05:52,690  -->  00:05:55,379
allow us to combine the two data sets

281

00:05:55,379  -->  00:05:55,389

282

00:05:55,389  -->  00:05:56,909
together. I look forward to seeing you

283

00:05:56,909  -->  00:05:56,919

284

00:05:56,919  -->  00:05:59,750
then and until next time happy analyzing.

285

00:05:59,750  -->  00:06:07,880
