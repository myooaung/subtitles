1

00:00:02,590  -->  00:00:07,110
In the previous tutorial, we applied the

2

00:00:07,110  -->  00:00:07,120

3

00:00:07,120  -->  00:00:09,089
data source filter and you can see that

4

00:00:09,089  -->  00:00:09,099

5

00:00:09,099  -->  00:00:10,379
it's applied here because there's a

6

00:00:10,379  -->  00:00:10,389

7

00:00:10,389  -->  00:00:13,590
number one here and that will allow us

8

00:00:13,590  -->  00:00:13,600

9

00:00:13,600  -->  00:00:16,439
to work with a smaller data set so

10

00:00:16,439  -->  00:00:16,449

11

00:00:16,449  -->  00:00:18,990
less rows and do all the pre-work and

12

00:00:18,990  -->  00:00:19,000

13

00:00:19,000  -->  00:00:20,340
then when we're ready we'll remove this

14

00:00:20,340  -->  00:00:20,350

15

00:00:20,350  -->  00:00:23,310
filter and then all the rows will go

16

00:00:23,310  -->  00:00:23,320

17

00:00:23,320  -->  00:00:25,260
through the same visualizations that we

18

00:00:25,260  -->  00:00:25,270

19

00:00:25,270  -->  00:00:27,359
have prepared. And today we're going to

20

00:00:27,359  -->  00:00:27,369

21

00:00:27,369  -->  00:00:30,090
do a pivot, we're going to create a pivot

22

00:00:30,090  -->  00:00:30,100

23

00:00:30,100  -->  00:00:33,869
for our columns. So as you can see the data

24

00:00:33,869  -->  00:00:33,879

25

00:00:33,879  -->  00:00:37,410
set is not in the best format for

26

00:00:37,410  -->  00:00:37,420

27

00:00:37,420  -->  00:00:40,290
machines and we're going to fix that, so as

28

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:40,300

29

00:00:40,300  -->  00:00:42,569
we are used to we're going to select all

30

00:00:42,569  -->  00:00:42,579

31

00:00:42,579  -->  00:00:44,490
the columns that we want to pivot and

32

00:00:44,490  -->  00:00:44,500

33

00:00:44,500  -->  00:00:46,290
there's a lot of them this time we'll

34

00:00:46,290  -->  00:00:46,300

35

00:00:46,300  -->  00:00:48,750
click this drop-down and select pivot

36

00:00:48,750  -->  00:00:48,760

37

00:00:48,760  -->  00:00:51,479
and there we go

38

00:00:51,479  -->  00:00:51,489

39

00:00:51,489  -->  00:00:54,209
everything has been done. So let's make

40

00:00:54,209  -->  00:00:54,219

41

00:00:54,219  -->  00:00:57,299
some more space here and of course we

42

00:00:57,299  -->  00:00:57,309

43

00:00:57,309  -->  00:00:59,369
want to rename these so this is pivot

44

00:00:59,369  -->  00:00:59,379

45

00:00:59,379  -->  00:01:01,139
field notes for now, we won't to name this

46

00:01:01,139  -->  00:01:01,149

47

00:01:01,149  -->  00:01:04,499
one. We'll rename this one, so we rename it

48

00:01:04,499  -->  00:01:04,509

49

00:01:04,509  -->  00:01:10,859
to turn over millions of dollars because

50

00:01:10,859  -->  00:01:10,869

51

00:01:10,869  -->  00:01:13,859
remember we remove that row telling us

52

00:01:13,859  -->  00:01:13,869

53

00:01:13,869  -->  00:01:17,099
that this is in millions of dollars.

54

00:01:17,099  -->  00:01:17,109

55

00:01:17,109  -->  00:01:19,949
Alright, so now what is this column

56

00:01:19,949  -->  00:01:19,959

57

00:01:19,959  -->  00:01:22,379
contain. Well it's got the word

58

00:01:22,379  -->  00:01:22,389

59

00:01:22,389  -->  00:01:24,809
turnover which is kind of useless to us

60

00:01:24,809  -->  00:01:24,819

61

00:01:24,819  -->  00:01:26,760
because we already know that we're

62

00:01:26,760  -->  00:01:26,770

63

00:01:26,770  -->  00:01:28,800
dealing with turnover there but also has

64

00:01:28,800  -->  00:01:28,810

65

00:01:28,810  -->  00:01:32,639
the state and it's got the clothing or

66

00:01:32,639  -->  00:01:32,649

67

00:01:32,649  -->  00:01:35,489
it's got to the industry and now we want

68

00:01:35,489  -->  00:01:35,499

69

00:01:35,499  -->  00:01:37,319
to separate that information so how do

70

00:01:37,319  -->  00:01:37,329

71

00:01:37,329  -->  00:01:38,909
we do it? Well we already know it's very

72

00:01:38,909  -->  00:01:38,919

73

00:01:38,919  -->  00:01:40,830
simple we click the drop-down and we

74

00:01:40,830  -->  00:01:40,840

75

00:01:40,840  -->  00:01:45,149
just select split and there we go now we

76

00:01:45,149  -->  00:01:45,159

77

00:01:45,159  -->  00:01:48,479
have our columns and they have been

78

00:01:48,479  -->  00:01:48,489

79

00:01:48,489  -->  00:01:53,909
split, so here you've got the state and

80

00:01:53,909  -->  00:01:53,919

81

00:01:53,919  -->  00:01:55,979
here you've got the industry and that's

82

00:01:55,979  -->  00:01:55,989

83

00:01:55,989  -->  00:01:58,319
exactly what we want. So you can see

84

00:01:58,319  -->  00:01:58,329

85

00:01:58,329  -->  00:01:59,580
Tableau's actually smart

86

00:01:59,580  -->  00:01:59,590

87

00:01:59,590  -->  00:02:02,249
it's not even included a column for the

88

00:02:02,249  -->  00:02:02,259

89

00:02:02,259  -->  00:02:04,679
word turnover separately because it

90

00:02:04,679  -->  00:02:04,689

91

00:02:04,689  -->  00:02:06,149
would have been the same for every

92

00:02:06,149  -->  00:02:06,159

93

00:02:06,159  -->  00:02:08,490
single row. So now we can hide this

94

00:02:08,490  -->  00:02:08,500

95

00:02:08,500  -->  00:02:11,090
column because we don't need it anymore

96

00:02:11,090  -->  00:02:11,100

97

00:02:11,100  -->  00:02:12,860
and we can work with these two so let's

98

00:02:12,860  -->  00:02:12,870

99

00:02:12,870  -->  00:02:14,870
rename them this was going to be state

100

00:02:14,870  -->  00:02:14,880

101

00:02:14,880  -->  00:02:18,350
as instead of Australia and this one's

102

00:02:18,350  -->  00:02:18,360

103

00:02:18,360  -->  00:02:23,900
going to be industry. And there we go,

104

00:02:23,900  -->  00:02:23,910

105

00:02:23,910  -->  00:02:28,790
that is all we needed to do. Our data set

106

00:02:28,790  -->  00:02:28,800

107

00:02:28,800  -->  00:02:32,420
is now ready for analysis and we'll jump

108

00:02:32,420  -->  00:02:32,430

109

00:02:32,430  -->  00:02:35,030
straight into it in the next tutorial. I

110

00:02:35,030  -->  00:02:35,040

111

00:02:35,040  -->  00:02:36,410
look forward to seeing you next time and

112

00:02:36,410  -->  00:02:36,420

113

00:02:36,420  -->  00:02:42,920
until then happy analyzing.
