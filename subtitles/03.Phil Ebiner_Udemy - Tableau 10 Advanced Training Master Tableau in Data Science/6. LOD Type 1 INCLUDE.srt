00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,619
Hello and welcome back to the advanced

2

00:00:06,619  -->  00:00:06,629

3

00:00:06,629  -->  00:00:08,270
course in Tableau. Now that we've talked

4

00:00:08,270  -->  00:00:08,280

5

00:00:08,280  -->  00:00:10,100
about theory of level of detailed

6

00:00:10,100  -->  00:00:10,110

7

00:00:10,110  -->  00:00:12,290
calculations. I hope that you can see

8

00:00:12,290  -->  00:00:12,300

9

00:00:12,300  -->  00:00:14,690
that they are very, very simple even

10

00:00:14,690  -->  00:00:14,700

11

00:00:14,700  -->  00:00:17,570
though this sounds like a very complex

12

00:00:17,570  -->  00:00:17,580

13

00:00:17,580  -->  00:00:20,660
topic and that it's a challenging

14

00:00:20,660  -->  00:00:20,670

15

00:00:20,670  -->  00:00:23,599
skilled monster Tableau in reality level

16

00:00:23,599  -->  00:00:23,609

17

00:00:23,609  -->  00:00:25,910
of detail calculations are not that hard

18

00:00:25,910  -->  00:00:25,920

19

00:00:25,920  -->  00:00:26,960
we've already talked about the theory

20

00:00:26,960  -->  00:00:26,970

21

00:00:26,970  -->  00:00:28,910
and now we're going to move on to the

22

00:00:28,910  -->  00:00:28,920

23

00:00:28,920  -->  00:00:30,980
practical side of things so that you

24

00:00:30,980  -->  00:00:30,990

25

00:00:30,990  -->  00:00:32,990
will also see that they're very easy to

26

00:00:32,990  -->  00:00:33,000

27

00:00:33,000  -->  00:00:36,290
create in Tableau and my goal is that by

28

00:00:36,290  -->  00:00:36,300

29

00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:37,970
the end of this section you should very

30

00:00:37,970  -->  00:00:37,980

31

00:00:37,980  -->  00:00:41,030
easily navigate across these level of

32

00:00:41,030  -->  00:00:41,040

33

00:00:41,040  -->  00:00:42,650
detail calculations and that you should

34

00:00:42,650  -->  00:00:42,660

35

00:00:42,660  -->  00:00:44,750
be able to create them even without

36

00:00:44,750  -->  00:00:44,760

37

00:00:44,760  -->  00:00:47,600
looking into any sheet, sheets or looking

38

00:00:47,600  -->  00:00:47,610

39

00:00:47,610  -->  00:00:50,270
up formula. So that you'll know on an

40

00:00:50,270  -->  00:00:50,280

41

00:00:50,280  -->  00:00:53,150
intuitive level, how each one of the

42

00:00:53,150  -->  00:00:53,160

43

00:00:53,160  -->  00:00:54,590
level of detail calculation that you

44

00:00:54,590  -->  00:00:54,600

45

00:00:54,600  -->  00:00:56,630
want to create, how it should work. So

46

00:00:56,630  -->  00:00:56,640

47

00:00:56,640  -->  00:00:58,310
let's get straight into it.

48

00:00:58,310  -->  00:00:58,320

49

00:00:58,320  -->  00:01:01,220
In this case, we've got a map at the

50

00:01:01,220  -->  00:01:01,230

51

00:01:01,230  -->  00:01:03,830
level of granularity of the state, so

52

00:01:03,830  -->  00:01:03,840

53

00:01:03,840  -->  00:01:05,929
let's save it here as a map and which is

54

00:01:05,929  -->  00:01:05,939

55

00:01:05,939  -->  00:01:08,539
going to duplicate this sheet and now

56

00:01:08,539  -->  00:01:08,549

57

00:01:08,549  -->  00:01:10,490
we're going to in this sheet we're going

58

00:01:10,490  -->  00:01:10,500

59

00:01:10,500  -->  00:01:12,500
to actually going to call it LOD,

60

00:01:12,500  -->  00:01:12,510

61

00:01:12,510  -->  00:01:16,280
level detail calculation, include. So

62

00:01:16,280  -->  00:01:16,290

63

00:01:16,290  -->  00:01:18,380
we're going to talk about the include,

64

00:01:18,380  -->  00:01:18,390

65

00:01:18,390  -->  00:01:22,429
type of LOD here and what we're going to

66

00:01:22,429  -->  00:01:22,439

67

00:01:22,439  -->  00:01:25,520
do? Well what we want to do,  is we want to

68

00:01:25,520  -->  00:01:25,530

69

00:01:25,530  -->  00:01:27,859
get, we want to keep the visualization at

70

00:01:27,859  -->  00:01:27,869

71

00:01:27,869  -->  00:01:31,100
the level of aggregation at, at state so

72

00:01:31,100  -->  00:01:31,110

73

00:01:31,110  -->  00:01:33,620
that is our bottom line that is our

74

00:01:33,620  -->  00:01:33,630

75

00:01:33,630  -->  00:01:35,840
foundation of what we're building here.

76

00:01:35,840  -->  00:01:35,850

77

00:01:35,850  -->  00:01:38,870
The visualization has to stay at this

78

00:01:38,870  -->  00:01:38,880

79

00:01:38,880  -->  00:01:41,870
level of aggregation we cannot go down

80

00:01:41,870  -->  00:01:41,880

81

00:01:41,880  -->  00:01:45,109
or up in our aggregation, but at the same

82

00:01:45,109  -->  00:01:45,119

83

00:01:45,119  -->  00:01:47,270
time we want to perform some sort of

84

00:01:47,270  -->  00:01:47,280

85

00:01:47,280  -->  00:01:50,480
calculation at the level of granularity

86

00:01:50,480  -->  00:01:50,490

87

00:01:50,490  -->  00:01:53,929
or aggregation of a city. So we want

88

00:01:53,929  -->  00:01:53,939

89

00:01:53,939  -->  00:01:55,490
to perform a calculation at this level

90

00:01:55,490  -->  00:01:55,500

91

00:01:55,500  -->  00:01:57,800
but our visualization has to stay at

92

00:01:57,800  -->  00:01:57,810

93

00:01:57,810  -->  00:01:59,569
this level and the calculation and we

94

00:01:59,569  -->  00:01:59,579

95

00:01:59,579  -->  00:02:01,819
want to perform is, so let me just go

96

00:02:01,819  -->  00:02:01,829

97

00:02:01,829  -->  00:02:04,340
back here, the calculation we want to

98

00:02:04,340  -->  00:02:04,350

99

00:02:04,350  -->  00:02:07,399
perform is we want to take all of the

100

00:02:07,399  -->  00:02:07,409

101

00:02:07,409  -->  00:02:10,699
profits for each city so for all the

102

00:02:10,699  -->  00:02:10,709

103

00:02:10,709  -->  00:02:13,090
orders and all of the items that was

104

00:02:13,090  -->  00:02:13,100

105

00:02:13,100  -->  00:02:15,280
holding any given city for example here

106

00:02:15,280  -->  00:02:15,290

107

00:02:15,290  -->  00:02:17,800
and we want to sum it up and then once

108

00:02:17,800  -->  00:02:17,810

109

00:02:17,810  -->  00:02:19,180
we've got sum so as we can see here

110

00:02:19,180  -->  00:02:19,190

111

00:02:19,190  -->  00:02:21,280
this is actually what we're after we're

112

00:02:21,280  -->  00:02:21,290

113

00:02:21,290  -->  00:02:23,230
after the sum of the profit and then we

114

00:02:23,230  -->  00:02:23,240

115

00:02:23,240  -->  00:02:26,380
want to take the average across each of

116

00:02:26,380  -->  00:02:26,390

117

00:02:26,390  -->  00:02:28,330
the states. So for instance in North

118

00:02:28,330  -->  00:02:28,340

119

00:02:28,340  -->  00:02:31,150
Dakota the final number that we want to

120

00:02:31,150  -->  00:02:31,160

121

00:02:31,160  -->  00:02:34,150
see for that state is an average of 2678,

122

00:02:34,150  -->  00:02:34,160

123

00:02:34,160  -->  00:02:37,990
4400 and minus 76. So

124

00:02:37,990  -->  00:02:38,000

125

00:02:38,000  -->  00:02:39,760
these three cities,

126

00:02:39,760  -->  00:02:39,770

127

00:02:39,770  -->  00:02:41,710
that's the sum of profit for that city.

128

00:02:41,710  -->  00:02:41,720

129

00:02:41,720  -->  00:02:43,690
That sum of profit for all of the

130

00:02:43,690  -->  00:02:43,700

131

00:02:43,700  -->  00:02:46,150
orders all the items in that city and by

132

00:02:46,150  -->  00:02:46,160

133

00:02:46,160  -->  00:02:48,190
the way don't forget that here in this

134

00:02:48,190  -->  00:02:48,200

135

00:02:48,200  -->  00:02:50,110
data set we've actually got many, many

136

00:02:50,110  -->  00:02:50,120

137

00:02:50,120  -->  00:02:53,230
years. So we've got order date and if you

138

00:02:53,230  -->  00:02:53,240

139

00:02:53,240  -->  00:02:54,940
put that in filters and look at years

140

00:02:54,940  -->  00:02:54,950

141

00:02:54,950  -->  00:02:57,040
you'll see that we've got four years

142

00:02:57,040  -->  00:02:57,050

143

00:02:57,050  -->  00:02:57,700
here.

144

00:02:57,700  -->  00:02:57,710

145

00:02:57,710  -->  00:03:01,030
So in reality what this 4,400 represents

146

00:03:01,030  -->  00:03:01,040

147

00:03:01,040  -->  00:03:03,760
is that is the sum of the profit for

148

00:03:03,760  -->  00:03:03,770

149

00:03:03,770  -->  00:03:06,400
every single item in every single order

150

00:03:06,400  -->  00:03:06,410

151

00:03:06,410  -->  00:03:09,370
for every single year for the City of

152

00:03:09,370  -->  00:03:09,380

153

00:03:09,380  -->  00:03:12,670
Mandan in North Dakota, same thing here, this

154

00:03:12,670  -->  00:03:12,680

155

00:03:12,680  -->  00:03:14,920
is the sum of all every single item in

156

00:03:14,920  -->  00:03:14,930

157

00:03:14,930  -->  00:03:16,690
every single order for every single year.

158

00:03:16,690  -->  00:03:16,700

159

00:03:16,700  -->  00:03:18,850
This is the summer for every single item

160

00:03:18,850  -->  00:03:18,860

161

00:03:18,860  -->  00:03:20,800
for every single order for every single

162

00:03:20,800  -->  00:03:20,810

163

00:03:20,810  -->  00:03:22,540
year. So that's the sum of profit and

164

00:03:22,540  -->  00:03:22,550

165

00:03:22,550  -->  00:03:24,520
What we want as a final number is the

166

00:03:24,520  -->  00:03:24,530

167

00:03:24,530  -->  00:03:27,040
average for the State. The same thing

168

00:03:27,040  -->  00:03:27,050

169

00:03:27,050  -->  00:03:29,050
here Colorado, same thing for Wyoming,

170

00:03:29,050  -->  00:03:29,060

171

00:03:29,060  -->  00:03:31,840
same thing for Utah for every single

172

00:03:31,840  -->  00:03:31,850

173

00:03:31,850  -->  00:03:35,740
State we want to average out. The sums of

174

00:03:35,740  -->  00:03:35,750

175

00:03:35,750  -->  00:03:39,910
profits that were incurred in the cities

176

00:03:39,910  -->  00:03:39,920

177

00:03:39,920  -->  00:03:42,910
of that state. So there we go now we know

178

00:03:42,910  -->  00:03:42,920

179

00:03:42,920  -->  00:03:44,170
what we want.

180

00:03:44,170  -->  00:03:44,180

181

00:03:44,180  -->  00:03:46,120
How do we create that? So we have to be

182

00:03:46,120  -->  00:03:46,130

183

00:03:46,130  -->  00:03:48,220
at the State level and the first thing

184

00:03:48,220  -->  00:03:48,230

185

00:03:48,230  -->  00:03:50,650
that pops to mind is how about we just

186

00:03:50,650  -->  00:03:50,660

187

00:03:50,660  -->  00:03:52,720
take instead of sum of profit. We take

188

00:03:52,720  -->  00:03:52,730

189

00:03:52,730  -->  00:03:54,640
average of profit. So let's change this here

190

00:03:54,640  -->  00:03:54,650

191

00:03:54,650  -->  00:03:57,040
to average, let's change this here to

192

00:03:57,040  -->  00:03:57,050

193

00:03:57,050  -->  00:03:59,620
average. Now if you've been following

194

00:03:59,620  -->  00:03:59,630

195

00:03:59,630  -->  00:04:02,530
along with the logic, so this could be

196

00:04:02,530  -->  00:04:02,540

197

00:04:02,540  -->  00:04:05,470
changed this font to 12 and bold so we

198

00:04:05,470  -->  00:04:05,480

199

00:04:05,480  -->  00:04:06,760
can see better, if you've been following

200

00:04:06,760  -->  00:04:06,770

201

00:04:06,770  -->  00:04:08,890
along with logic you will notice that

202

00:04:08,890  -->  00:04:08,900

203

00:04:08,900  -->  00:04:12,250
this is not what we want. The average of

204

00:04:12,250  -->  00:04:12,260

205

00:04:12,260  -->  00:04:15,550
profit is taking the average of

206

00:04:15,550  -->  00:04:15,560

207

00:04:15,560  -->  00:04:19,450
profit for every single order. So let's

208

00:04:19,450  -->  00:04:19,460

209

00:04:19,460  -->  00:04:21,729
say in North Dakota, it is taking the

210

00:04:21,729  -->  00:04:21,739

211

00:04:21,739  -->  00:04:24,370
average of all of the orders inside

212

00:04:24,370  -->  00:04:24,380

213

00:04:24,380  -->  00:04:26,050
North Dakota. So let me open up

214

00:04:26,050  -->  00:04:26,060

215

00:04:26,060  -->  00:04:30,250
the data set here and so let's say we

216

00:04:30,250  -->  00:04:30,260

217

00:04:30,260  -->  00:04:33,909
were sort of by City actually by state

218

00:04:33,909  -->  00:04:33,919

219

00:04:33,919  -->  00:04:35,680
where the State? Must be somewhere here

220

00:04:35,680  -->  00:04:35,690

221

00:04:35,690  -->  00:04:40,450
State, so let's find North Dakota, Ok

222

00:04:40,450  -->  00:04:40,460

223

00:04:40,460  -->  00:04:43,990
North Carolina, North Dakota so what it

224

00:04:43,990  -->  00:04:44,000

225

00:04:44,000  -->  00:04:45,610
is doing currently?

226

00:04:45,610  -->  00:04:45,620

227

00:04:45,620  -->  00:04:47,200
What it's doing currently is it's taking

228

00:04:47,200  -->  00:04:47,210

229

00:04:47,210  -->  00:04:50,170
all of these orders is quite a lot of

230

00:04:50,170  -->  00:04:50,180

231

00:04:50,180  -->  00:04:53,050
them here is taking all of these orders

232

00:04:53,050  -->  00:04:53,060

233

00:04:53,060  -->  00:04:56,020
for North Dakota that's North Carolina

234

00:04:56,020  -->  00:04:56,030

235

00:04:56,030  -->  00:04:59,560
again, let's go back there it is, so it's

236

00:04:59,560  -->  00:04:59,570

237

00:04:59,570  -->  00:05:00,969
taking all the orders for North Dakota,

238

00:05:00,969  -->  00:05:00,979

239

00:05:00,979  -->  00:05:04,480
which we can see are over here and it's

240

00:05:04,480  -->  00:05:04,490

241

00:05:04,490  -->  00:05:07,210
taking the average of all of the profits

242

00:05:07,210  -->  00:05:07,220

243

00:05:07,220  -->  00:05:09,460
so there's a profit column taking the

244

00:05:09,460  -->  00:05:09,470

245

00:05:09,470  -->  00:05:11,409
average of these profits. That's not

246

00:05:11,409  -->  00:05:11,419

247

00:05:11,419  -->  00:05:14,890
what we want, we want these rows to be

248

00:05:14,890  -->  00:05:14,900

249

00:05:14,900  -->  00:05:17,469
broken down into City. So we want the sum

250

00:05:17,469  -->  00:05:17,479

251

00:05:17,479  -->  00:05:20,170
of these rows for Dickinson, the sum of

252

00:05:20,170  -->  00:05:20,180

253

00:05:20,180  -->  00:05:22,300
these rows for Grand Forks. The sum of

254

00:05:22,300  -->  00:05:22,310

255

00:05:22,310  -->  00:05:24,580
these rows from Mandan. We want to

256

00:05:24,580  -->  00:05:24,590

257

00:05:24,590  -->  00:05:26,409
aggregate at the level the city first,

258

00:05:26,409  -->  00:05:26,419

259

00:05:26,419  -->  00:05:29,800
and then we want to take the average. So it

260

00:05:29,800  -->  00:05:29,810

261

00:05:29,810  -->  00:05:32,440
will be the average of the City profit.

262

00:05:32,440  -->  00:05:32,450

263

00:05:32,450  -->  00:05:34,180
Right now we're seeing the average of

264

00:05:34,180  -->  00:05:34,190

265

00:05:34,190  -->  00:05:36,880
the item profits,  so it's not even at the

266

00:05:36,880  -->  00:05:36,890

267

00:05:36,890  -->  00:05:39,700
order levels at the item level and that

268

00:05:39,700  -->  00:05:39,710

269

00:05:39,710  -->  00:05:41,980
is where it's going wrong so but at the

270

00:05:41,980  -->  00:05:41,990

271

00:05:41,990  -->  00:05:43,090
same time we're going to keep this

272

00:05:43,090  -->  00:05:43,100

273

00:05:43,100  -->  00:05:44,980
visualization so we can compare the

274

00:05:44,980  -->  00:05:44,990

275

00:05:44,990  -->  00:05:46,870
final result. So I'm going to crew

276

00:05:46,870  -->  00:05:46,880

277

00:05:46,880  -->  00:05:50,200
duplicate this map, I'm going to hold

278

00:05:50,200  -->  00:05:50,210

279

00:05:50,210  -->  00:05:52,719
down longitude, hold down control and drag

280

00:05:52,719  -->  00:05:52,729

281

00:05:52,729  -->  00:05:55,330
it to the right and that duplicates the

282

00:05:55,330  -->  00:05:55,340

283

00:05:55,340  -->  00:05:57,580
map, creates a dual-axis chart for these

284

00:05:57,580  -->  00:05:57,590

285

00:05:57,590  -->  00:06:00,790
maps and now what we not a dual-axis

286

00:06:00,790  -->  00:06:00,800

287

00:06:00,800  -->  00:06:02,440
chart it actually creates two charts

288

00:06:02,440  -->  00:06:02,450

289

00:06:02,450  -->  00:06:04,270
side-by-side for a dual-axis. We need to

290

00:06:04,270  -->  00:06:04,280

291

00:06:04,280  -->  00:06:06,129
click to dual-axis here, but like this is

292

00:06:06,129  -->  00:06:06,139

293

00:06:06,139  -->  00:06:08,350
just two charts side-by-side, two maps

294

00:06:08,350  -->  00:06:08,360

295

00:06:08,360  -->  00:06:09,610
side-by-side, so that's a handy little

296

00:06:09,610  -->  00:06:09,620

297

00:06:09,620  -->  00:06:12,760
trick and what we want is we're going to

298

00:06:12,760  -->  00:06:12,770

299

00:06:12,770  -->  00:06:15,310
keep the one on the right which is so

300

00:06:15,310  -->  00:06:15,320

301

00:06:15,320  -->  00:06:17,170
here you can see there's two drop down, so

302

00:06:17,170  -->  00:06:17,180

303

00:06:17,180  -->  00:06:18,430
the one on the right we're going to keep

304

00:06:18,430  -->  00:06:18,440

305

00:06:18,440  -->  00:06:22,000
it without the LOD calculations so we're

306

00:06:22,000  -->  00:06:22,010

307

00:06:22,010  -->  00:06:24,460
actually going to add a annotation here.

308

00:06:24,460  -->  00:06:24,470

309

00:06:24,470  -->  00:06:26,260
We're going to click area annotation

310

00:06:26,260  -->  00:06:26,270

311

00:06:26,270  -->  00:06:31,510
we'll say without LOD calculation, make

312

00:06:31,510  -->  00:06:31,520

313

00:06:31,520  -->  00:06:34,360
this bold, make this 22 in size, make

314

00:06:34,360  -->  00:06:34,370

315

00:06:34,370  -->  00:06:37,670
it red,

316

00:06:37,670  -->  00:06:37,680

317

00:06:37,680  -->  00:06:44,150
and let's make it like this.

318

00:06:44,150  -->  00:06:44,160

319

00:06:44,160  -->  00:06:46,730
There you go and here we'll also change

320

00:06:46,730  -->  00:06:46,740

321

00:06:46,740  -->  00:06:48,800
will format it so right click format,

322

00:06:48,800  -->  00:06:48,810

323

00:06:48,810  -->  00:06:54,230
border, give it a border, a thicker border, make

324

00:06:54,230  -->  00:06:54,240

325

00:06:54,240  -->  00:06:56,060
it rounded, there we go.

326

00:06:56,060  -->  00:06:56,070

327

00:06:56,070  -->  00:06:57,170
So that's what followed to LOD

328

00:06:57,170  -->  00:06:57,180

329

00:06:57,180  -->  00:06:59,360
calculation. This one we're going to

330

00:06:59,360  -->  00:06:59,370

331

00:06:59,370  -->  00:07:01,070
change and we're going to include an LOD

332

00:07:01,070  -->  00:07:01,080

333

00:07:01,080  -->  00:07:02,749
calculation, so let's get to it this is

334

00:07:02,749  -->  00:07:02,759

335

00:07:02,759  -->  00:07:03,800
the fun part.

336

00:07:03,800  -->  00:07:03,810

337

00:07:03,810  -->  00:07:06,290
So what do we want to create? Want to

338

00:07:06,290  -->  00:07:06,300

339

00:07:06,300  -->  00:07:09,200
create an LOD calculation for the profit

340

00:07:09,200  -->  00:07:09,210

341

00:07:09,210  -->  00:07:11,540
of the City. So we're going to click here,

342

00:07:11,540  -->  00:07:11,550

343

00:07:11,550  -->  00:07:13,310
we're going to click create, calculated

344

00:07:13,310  -->  00:07:13,320

345

00:07:13,320  -->  00:07:17,120
field, we'll call it LOD usually would

346

00:07:17,120  -->  00:07:17,130

347

00:07:17,130  -->  00:07:19,879
say something like LOD city profit but

348

00:07:19,879  -->  00:07:19,889

349

00:07:19,889  -->  00:07:21,080
in our case we're going to explore

350

00:07:21,080  -->  00:07:21,090

351

00:07:21,090  -->  00:07:23,150
different types of LOD's and we're

352

00:07:23,150  -->  00:07:23,160

353

00:07:23,160  -->  00:07:24,980
learning so I'm just going to add some

354

00:07:24,980  -->  00:07:24,990

355

00:07:24,990  -->  00:07:26,570
additional information for our own

356

00:07:26,570  -->  00:07:26,580

357

00:07:26,580  -->  00:07:29,719
benefits. I'm going to call it LOD include

358

00:07:29,719  -->  00:07:29,729

359

00:07:29,729  -->  00:07:32,540
City profit. So we know that this is an

360

00:07:32,540  -->  00:07:32,550

361

00:07:32,550  -->  00:07:35,510
LOD of the type include for the city

362

00:07:35,510  -->  00:07:35,520

363

00:07:35,520  -->  00:07:37,790
profit. Again you don't have to do that

364

00:07:37,790  -->  00:07:37,800

365

00:07:37,800  -->  00:07:40,760
in your actual work all the time but

366

00:07:40,760  -->  00:07:40,770

367

00:07:40,770  -->  00:07:42,830
this is just for learning purposes and

368

00:07:42,830  -->  00:07:42,840

369

00:07:42,840  -->  00:07:44,750
here we're going to write off formula

370

00:07:44,750  -->  00:07:44,760

371

00:07:44,760  -->  00:07:47,719
and the way these formulas work is is

372

00:07:47,719  -->  00:07:47,729

373

00:07:47,729  -->  00:07:50,000
actually very very straightcforward. You

374

00:07:50,000  -->  00:07:50,010

375

00:07:50,010  -->  00:07:52,159
first thing you need to do is you

376

00:07:52,159  -->  00:07:52,169

377

00:07:52,169  -->  00:07:54,830
need curly braces and that is your level

378

00:07:54,830  -->  00:07:54,840

379

00:07:54,840  -->  00:07:56,210
of detailed calculation, is going to go

380

00:07:56,210  -->  00:07:56,220

381

00:07:56,220  -->  00:07:58,879
inside the curly braces and here you

382

00:07:58,879  -->  00:07:58,889

383

00:07:58,889  -->  00:08:00,800
need to first specify the cure, so it's

384

00:08:00,800  -->  00:08:00,810

385

00:08:00,810  -->  00:08:03,020
either going to include, exclude or fixed.

386

00:08:03,020  -->  00:08:03,030

387

00:08:03,030  -->  00:08:05,960
So in our case we want include. Then

388

00:08:05,960  -->  00:08:05,970

389

00:08:05,970  -->  00:08:09,260
you want to specify that dimension that

390

00:08:09,260  -->  00:08:09,270

391

00:08:09,270  -->  00:08:11,330
you want to include. So in our case we

392

00:08:11,330  -->  00:08:11,340

393

00:08:11,340  -->  00:08:14,360
already have state, we want to add a two

394

00:08:14,360  -->  00:08:14,370

395

00:08:14,370  -->  00:08:16,850
from where we are now remember the

396

00:08:16,850  -->  00:08:16,860

397

00:08:16,860  -->  00:08:19,939
absolute and relative paths. So we're

398

00:08:19,939  -->  00:08:19,949

399

00:08:19,949  -->  00:08:21,710
creating a relative kind of relative

400

00:08:21,710  -->  00:08:21,720

401

00:08:21,720  -->  00:08:24,020
path if we take thinking folder terms

402

00:08:24,020  -->  00:08:24,030

403

00:08:24,030  -->  00:08:26,839
which is our little analogy to remember

404

00:08:26,839  -->  00:08:26,849

405

00:08:26,849  -->  00:08:29,270
these things in terms of parts we're

406

00:08:29,270  -->  00:08:29,280

407

00:08:29,280  -->  00:08:30,680
creating a relative path we want to go

408

00:08:30,680  -->  00:08:30,690

409

00:08:30,690  -->  00:08:33,440
down a level to Cities. So we want to

410

00:08:33,440  -->  00:08:33,450

411

00:08:33,450  -->  00:08:35,630
say here in square brackets, we want to say

412

00:08:35,630  -->  00:08:35,640

413

00:08:35,640  -->  00:08:38,930
City and then you put a cold one, so this

414

00:08:38,930  -->  00:08:38,940

415

00:08:38,940  -->  00:08:40,819
is your condition. You want to include

416

00:08:40,819  -->  00:08:40,829

417

00:08:40,829  -->  00:08:43,819
city and then you're going to say here

418

00:08:43,819  -->  00:08:43,829

419

00:08:43,829  -->  00:08:46,220
what you want to do. So you once we get

420

00:08:46,220  -->  00:08:46,230

421

00:08:46,230  -->  00:08:50,639
to the level of city, we want to sum up

422

00:08:50,639  -->  00:08:50,649

423

00:08:50,649  -->  00:08:52,920
at the level of granularity of city, we want

424

00:08:52,920  -->  00:08:52,930

425

00:08:52,930  -->  00:08:54,780
to sum up. What you want to sum up? I want

426

00:08:54,780  -->  00:08:54,790

427

00:08:54,790  -->  00:08:57,780
to sum up profit right and that's all

428

00:08:57,780  -->  00:08:57,790

429

00:08:57,790  -->  00:08:59,280
there is to it so you can see the

430

00:08:59,280  -->  00:08:59,290

431

00:08:59,290  -->  00:09:02,699
calculations valid so here we want we

432

00:09:02,699  -->  00:09:02,709

433

00:09:02,709  -->  00:09:05,999
want to sum up profit at the level of

434

00:09:05,999  -->  00:09:06,009

435

00:09:06,009  -->  00:09:08,100
granularity which is our current

436

00:09:08,100  -->  00:09:08,110

437

00:09:08,110  -->  00:09:10,739
visualization plus we want to include

438

00:09:10,739  -->  00:09:10,749

439

00:09:10,749  -->  00:09:12,900
city in our current visualization so

440

00:09:12,900  -->  00:09:12,910

441

00:09:12,910  -->  00:09:14,549
bear in mind that if you change your

442

00:09:14,549  -->  00:09:14,559

443

00:09:14,559  -->  00:09:16,949
visualization this result might also

444

00:09:16,949  -->  00:09:16,959

445

00:09:16,959  -->  00:09:20,850
change because you might go up include

446

00:09:20,850  -->  00:09:20,860

447

00:09:20,860  -->  00:09:23,220
some other view aggregations and so on

448

00:09:23,220  -->  00:09:23,230

449

00:09:23,230  -->  00:09:25,859
so this result is dynamic it changes with

450

00:09:25,859  -->  00:09:25,869

451

00:09:25,869  -->  00:09:28,590
your visualization, but in addition to

452

00:09:28,590  -->  00:09:28,600

453

00:09:28,600  -->  00:09:30,449
all of the measures that you have in

454

00:09:30,449  -->  00:09:30,459

455

00:09:30,459  -->  00:09:31,889
your visualization already

456

00:09:31,889  -->  00:09:31,899

457

00:09:31,899  -->  00:09:33,660
it will include an additional one which is

458

00:09:33,660  -->  00:09:33,670

459

00:09:33,670  -->  00:09:35,549
called the City. Alright so we click OK

460

00:09:35,549  -->  00:09:35,559

461

00:09:35,559  -->  00:09:38,009
here and there is our LOD include so

462

00:09:38,009  -->  00:09:38,019

463

00:09:38,019  -->  00:09:39,569
let's make some more room here so that

464

00:09:39,569  -->  00:09:39,579

465

00:09:39,579  -->  00:09:42,960
they fit in and now instead of so in

466

00:09:42,960  -->  00:09:42,970

467

00:09:42,970  -->  00:09:44,730
this in this map not in this map in this

468

00:09:44,730  -->  00:09:44,740

469

00:09:44,740  -->  00:09:47,129
map instead of average profit.

470

00:09:47,129  -->  00:09:47,139

471

00:09:47,139  -->  00:09:50,340
We're going to do an average, so here is

472

00:09:50,340  -->  00:09:50,350

473

00:09:50,350  -->  00:09:51,780
doing sum that's not wonder what

474

00:09:51,780  -->  00:09:51,790

475

00:09:51,790  -->  00:09:55,739
we want average of the LOD so the full

476

00:09:55,739  -->  00:09:55,749

477

00:09:55,749  -->  00:09:57,660
of profit to some profit for the City so

478

00:09:57,660  -->  00:09:57,670

479

00:09:57,670  -->  00:10:01,169
again we want here average and so now

480

00:10:01,169  -->  00:10:01,179

481

00:10:01,179  -->  00:10:07,139
I'm going to add an annotation area and

482

00:10:07,139  -->  00:10:07,149

483

00:10:07,149  -->  00:10:11,369
so here I'm going to say with LOD

484

00:10:11,369  -->  00:10:11,379

485

00:10:11,379  -->  00:10:19,619
calculation, size again 22, there you go 22 whoa see that

486

00:10:19,619  -->  00:10:19,629

487

00:10:19,629  -->  00:10:21,720
again doesn't want that way, Alright

488

00:10:21,720  -->  00:10:21,730

489

00:10:21,730  -->  00:10:25,860
22, color red.

490

00:10:25,860  -->  00:10:25,870

491

00:10:25,870  -->  00:10:32,790
Okay and make some room, like that and

492

00:10:32,790  -->  00:10:32,800

493

00:10:32,800  -->  00:10:34,319
now we're going to format it as well so

494

00:10:34,319  -->  00:10:34,329

495

00:10:34,329  -->  00:10:41,039
make it border red nearly there around

496

00:10:41,039  -->  00:10:41,049

497

00:10:41,049  -->  00:10:41,610
it.

498

00:10:41,610  -->  00:10:41,620

499

00:10:41,620  -->  00:10:43,559
There we go so that's with LOD

500

00:10:43,559  -->  00:10:43,569

501

00:10:43,569  -->  00:10:46,110
calculation, that's without LOD

502

00:10:46,110  -->  00:10:46,120

503

00:10:46,120  -->  00:10:47,669
calculation and let's have a look at the

504

00:10:47,669  -->  00:10:47,679

505

00:10:47,679  -->  00:10:51,989
result. So here you can see that this for

506

00:10:51,989  -->  00:10:51,999

507

00:10:51,999  -->  00:10:54,809
instance for North Dakota it doesn't

508

00:10:54,809  -->  00:10:54,819

509

00:10:54,819  -->  00:10:57,900
stand out at all and what are these

510

00:10:57,900  -->  00:10:57,910

511

00:10:57,910  -->  00:11:00,150
other states Louisiana and Nevada,

512

00:11:00,150  -->  00:11:00,160

513

00:11:00,160  -->  00:11:01,289
they don't they don't stand out here.

514

00:11:01,289  -->  00:11:01,299

515

00:11:01,299  -->  00:11:02,970
They they're kind of like

516

00:11:02,970  -->  00:11:02,980

517

00:11:02,980  -->  00:11:04,860
everything else but here right away they

518

00:11:04,860  -->  00:11:04,870

519

00:11:04,870  -->  00:11:07,889
stand out very clearly because the

520

00:11:07,889  -->  00:11:07,899

521

00:11:07,899  -->  00:11:11,699
average profit per City is different to

522

00:11:11,699  -->  00:11:11,709

523

00:11:11,709  -->  00:11:14,189
the average profit so that the average

524

00:11:14,189  -->  00:11:14,199

525

00:11:14,199  -->  00:11:16,920
profit across cities in each state is

526

00:11:16,920  -->  00:11:16,930

527

00:11:16,930  -->  00:11:18,360
different to the average profit across

528

00:11:18,360  -->  00:11:18,370

529

00:11:18,370  -->  00:11:21,150
all items in each State. So here's only

530

00:11:21,150  -->  00:11:21,160

531

00:11:21,160  -->  00:11:24,329
57.4 dollars but actually it is much

532

00:11:24,329  -->  00:11:24,339

533

00:11:24,339  -->  00:11:28,019
higher than the across in than in other

534

00:11:28,019  -->  00:11:28,029

535

00:11:28,029  -->  00:11:31,019
States, it's the average profit across

536

00:11:31,019  -->  00:11:31,029

537

00:11:31,029  -->  00:11:33,660
the cities of North Dakota is actually

538

00:11:33,660  -->  00:11:33,670

539

00:11:33,670  -->  00:11:37,560
2,334 and that is what we were after.

540

00:11:37,560  -->  00:11:37,570

541

00:11:37,570  -->  00:11:39,870
So as you can see the results are

542

00:11:39,870  -->  00:11:39,880

543

00:11:39,880  -->  00:11:42,870
different here and not only are they, they are

544

00:11:42,870  -->  00:11:42,880

545

00:11:42,880  -->  00:11:44,670
proportionately different. You can see

546

00:11:44,670  -->  00:11:44,680

547

00:11:44,680  -->  00:11:46,769
that this visualization gives us

548

00:11:46,769  -->  00:11:46,779

549

00:11:46,779  -->  00:11:48,600
additional insights on top of this

550

00:11:48,600  -->  00:11:48,610

551

00:11:48,610  -->  00:11:50,790
visualization or that you actually gives

552

00:11:50,790  -->  00:11:50,800

553

00:11:50,800  -->  00:11:53,100
us the insights that we were after.

554

00:11:53,100  -->  00:11:53,110

555

00:11:53,110  -->  00:11:54,990
So hopefully that makes sense and

556

00:11:54,990  -->  00:11:55,000

557

00:11:55,000  -->  00:11:57,569
hopefully that gives you some

558

00:11:57,569  -->  00:11:57,579

559

00:11:57,579  -->  00:12:01,769
understanding of how to or an idea of

560

00:12:01,769  -->  00:12:01,779

561

00:12:01,779  -->  00:12:04,050
how to use level of detail calculations,

562

00:12:04,050  -->  00:12:04,060

563

00:12:04,060  -->  00:12:05,639
the main thing we're after here is

564

00:12:05,639  -->  00:12:05,649

565

00:12:05,649  -->  00:12:07,439
the syntax so let's have a look at it

566

00:12:07,439  -->  00:12:07,449

567

00:12:07,449  -->  00:12:10,439
again so we'll edit it. So it's very simple,

568

00:12:10,439  -->  00:12:10,449

569

00:12:10,449  -->  00:12:13,710
so curly braces include then the

570

00:12:13,710  -->  00:12:13,720

571

00:12:13,720  -->  00:12:15,840
dimension or dimensions and we'll talk

572

00:12:15,840  -->  00:12:15,850

573

00:12:15,850  -->  00:12:17,879
about this further down in section that

574

00:12:17,879  -->  00:12:17,889

575

00:12:17,889  -->  00:12:19,740
you want to include in addition to your

576

00:12:19,740  -->  00:12:19,750

577

00:12:19,750  -->  00:12:22,050
current visualization the colon and then what

578

00:12:22,050  -->  00:12:22,060

579

00:12:22,060  -->  00:12:24,360
you want to do there. So this is

580

00:12:24,360  -->  00:12:24,370

581

00:12:24,370  -->  00:12:27,389
specifying the level of granularity

582

00:12:27,389  -->  00:12:27,399

583

00:12:27,399  -->  00:12:31,079
which you want to get to, as if you

584

00:12:31,079  -->  00:12:31,089

585

00:12:31,089  -->  00:12:32,400
were going to change your visualization

586

00:12:32,400  -->  00:12:32,410

587

00:12:32,410  -->  00:12:34,139
but you're actually not this is all

588

00:12:34,139  -->  00:12:34,149

589

00:12:34,149  -->  00:12:35,910
happening in the background and this is

590

00:12:35,910  -->  00:12:35,920

591

00:12:35,920  -->  00:12:38,819
what formula you want to apply at that

592

00:12:38,819  -->  00:12:38,829

593

00:12:38,829  -->  00:12:41,069
level of granularity and then this whole

594

00:12:41,069  -->  00:12:41,079

595

00:12:41,079  -->  00:12:44,460
thing will bring you back that result. So

596

00:12:44,460  -->  00:12:44,470

597

00:12:44,470  -->  00:12:47,340
it's very very simple this is.. was our

598

00:12:47,340  -->  00:12:47,350

599

00:12:47,350  -->  00:12:50,400
very first LOD calculation. We talked

600

00:12:50,400  -->  00:12:50,410

601

00:12:50,410  -->  00:12:52,980
about include and further down the section

602

00:12:52,980  -->  00:12:52,990

603

00:12:52,990  -->  00:12:54,569
we're going to discuss the other two.

604

00:12:54,569  -->  00:12:54,579

605

00:12:54,579  -->  00:12:57,030
Hope you enjoy today's tutorial and I

606

00:12:57,030  -->  00:12:57,040

607

00:12:57,040  -->  00:12:59,460
can't wait to see you on the next one

608

00:12:59,460  -->  00:12:59,470

609

00:12:59,470  -->  00:13:01,530
make sure to spend some time to play

610

00:13:01,530  -->  00:13:01,540

611

00:13:01,540  -->  00:13:02,819
around with this try some other

612

00:13:02,819  -->  00:13:02,829

613

00:13:02,829  -->  00:13:05,490
dimensions, try to include some other

614

00:13:05,490  -->  00:13:05,500

615

00:13:05,500  -->  00:13:07,800
dimensions just so you have some

616

00:13:07,800  -->  00:13:07,810

617

00:13:07,810  -->  00:13:11,340
practice because practice is what leads

618

00:13:11,340  -->  00:13:11,350

619

00:13:11,350  -->  00:13:14,490
to mastering and see you next time.

620

00:13:14,490  -->  00:13:14,500

621

00:13:14,500  -->  00:13:15,330
Until then,

622

00:13:15,330  -->  00:13:15,340

623

00:13:15,340  -->  00:13:20,910
happy analyzing!
