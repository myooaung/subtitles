00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,710
Hello and welcome back to the advanced course

2

00:00:06,710  -->  00:00:06,720

3

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:08,150
on Tableau and today we're going to

4

00:00:08,150  -->  00:00:08,160

5

00:00:08,160  -->  00:00:10,190
discuss the three types of the level of

6

00:00:10,190  -->  00:00:10,200

7

00:00:10,200  -->  00:00:12,680
detailed calculations that exists

8

00:00:12,680  -->  00:00:12,690

9

00:00:12,690  -->  00:00:15,020
in Tableau. Alright, so here we've got the

10

00:00:15,020  -->  00:00:15,030

11

00:00:15,030  -->  00:00:17,420
map that we prepared previously, let's

12

00:00:17,420  -->  00:00:17,430

13

00:00:17,430  -->  00:00:20,750
take profit and drag it onto color now

14

00:00:20,750  -->  00:00:20,760

15

00:00:20,760  -->  00:00:23,390
we've got profit which indicates which

16

00:00:23,390  -->  00:00:23,400

17

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:27,109
is signified by the color of in this

18

00:00:27,109  -->  00:00:27,119

19

00:00:27,119  -->  00:00:30,290
case points because we've got cities on

20

00:00:30,290  -->  00:00:30,300

21

00:00:30,300  -->  00:00:32,900
our map and what we can do is we can

22

00:00:32,900  -->  00:00:32,910

23

00:00:32,910  -->  00:00:36,200
change the granularity or aggregation as

24

00:00:36,200  -->  00:00:36,210

25

00:00:36,210  -->  00:00:37,880
we discussed so we can just simply click

26

00:00:37,880  -->  00:00:37,890

27

00:00:37,890  -->  00:00:40,280
this minus button or just remove a city

28

00:00:40,280  -->  00:00:40,290

29

00:00:40,290  -->  00:00:42,470
and then we'll move to the level of

30

00:00:42,470  -->  00:00:42,480

31

00:00:42,480  -->  00:00:45,229
aggregation at the state level if we

32

00:00:45,229  -->  00:00:45,239

33

00:00:45,239  -->  00:00:47,540
remove that then our visualization is now

34

00:00:47,540  -->  00:00:47,550

35

00:00:47,550  -->  00:00:51,200
aggregated at the country level and as

36

00:00:51,200  -->  00:00:51,210

37

00:00:51,210  -->  00:00:53,060
you can see this is a total for the

38

00:00:53,060  -->  00:00:53,070

39

00:00:53,070  -->  00:00:55,310
United States so here we can zoom in

40

00:00:55,310  -->  00:00:55,320

41

00:00:55,320  -->  00:00:56,330
because we know we're dealing with

42

00:00:56,330  -->  00:00:56,340

43

00:00:56,340  -->  00:00:59,450
mainland US so you can see that's the

44

00:00:59,450  -->  00:00:59,460

45

00:00:59,460  -->  00:01:01,160
aggregation for the US. But we're going to

46

00:01:01,160  -->  00:01:01,170

47

00:01:01,170  -->  00:01:04,130
stick to the state and the city and

48

00:01:04,130  -->  00:01:04,140

49

00:01:04,140  -->  00:01:07,250
basically what do level of detailed

50

00:01:07,250  -->  00:01:07,260

51

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:09,530
calculations allow us to achieve?

52

00:01:09,530  -->  00:01:09,540

53

00:01:09,540  -->  00:01:10,880
Well let's say you're working with this

54

00:01:10,880  -->  00:01:10,890

55

00:01:10,890  -->  00:01:13,310
visualization and here we've got the

56

00:01:13,310  -->  00:01:13,320

57

00:01:13,320  -->  00:01:15,679
level of detail of the visualization

58

00:01:15,679  -->  00:01:15,689

59

00:01:15,689  -->  00:01:18,859
which is the state level right so right

60

00:01:18,859  -->  00:01:18,869

61

00:01:18,869  -->  00:01:23,149
now we are at the state level and their

62

00:01:23,149  -->  00:01:23,159

63

00:01:23,159  -->  00:01:25,609
form that's how Tableau is summing

64

00:01:25,609  -->  00:01:25,619

65

00:01:25,619  -->  00:01:27,469
everything up, but what if we want to

66

00:01:27,469  -->  00:01:27,479

67

00:01:27,479  -->  00:01:29,660
actually perform some calculations at

68

00:01:29,660  -->  00:01:29,670

69

00:01:29,670  -->  00:01:31,609
the city level.

70

00:01:31,609  -->  00:01:31,619

71

00:01:31,619  -->  00:01:33,530
Yes of course, we can add the city into

72

00:01:33,530  -->  00:01:33,540

73

00:01:33,540  -->  00:01:35,390
our visualization by clicking this plus

74

00:01:35,390  -->  00:01:35,400

75

00:01:35,400  -->  00:01:38,210
sign or we can just drag city here into

76

00:01:38,210  -->  00:01:38,220

77

00:01:38,220  -->  00:01:41,030
detail same thing and what happens is

78

00:01:41,030  -->  00:01:41,040

79

00:01:41,040  -->  00:01:43,460
now we can actually see the different

80

00:01:43,460  -->  00:01:43,470

81

00:01:43,470  -->  00:01:45,230
cities here and we can perform calculations

82

00:01:45,230  -->  00:01:45,240

83

00:01:45,240  -->  00:01:47,780
here but what happens if we actually

84

00:01:47,780  -->  00:01:47,790

85

00:01:47,790  -->  00:01:51,139
want the visualization to stay at the

86

00:01:51,139  -->  00:01:51,149

87

00:01:51,149  -->  00:01:55,249
state level but we want to first perform

88

00:01:55,249  -->  00:01:55,259

89

00:01:55,259  -->  00:01:57,350
some calculations at the city level and

90

00:01:57,350  -->  00:01:57,360

91

00:01:57,360  -->  00:01:58,700
then display them at the state level.

92

00:01:58,700  -->  00:01:58,710

93

00:01:58,710  -->  00:02:01,039
We'll look at more specific examples

94

00:02:01,039  -->  00:02:01,049

95

00:02:01,049  -->  00:02:04,219
further in this section but let's just

96

00:02:04,219  -->  00:02:04,229

97

00:02:04,229  -->  00:02:05,899
imagine that scenario let's imagine we

98

00:02:05,899  -->  00:02:05,909

99

00:02:05,909  -->  00:02:07,910
want to perform some aggregation of our

100

00:02:07,910  -->  00:02:07,920

101

00:02:07,920  -->  00:02:09,499
data because we remember that our

102

00:02:09,499  -->  00:02:09,509

103

00:02:09,509  -->  00:02:13,170
data is actually at the order

104

00:02:13,170  -->  00:02:13,180

105

00:02:13,180  -->  00:02:15,569
item level so we've got many many rows

106

00:02:15,569  -->  00:02:15,579

107

00:02:15,579  -->  00:02:18,059
so even more than we have cities so what

108

00:02:18,059  -->  00:02:18,069

109

00:02:18,069  -->  00:02:19,860
if you want to aggregate these rows at

110

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:19,870

111

00:02:19,870  -->  00:02:22,349
the city level. Let's say take the sum

112

00:02:22,349  -->  00:02:22,359

113

00:02:22,359  -->  00:02:25,380
or the average or count these rows at the

114

00:02:25,380  -->  00:02:25,390

115

00:02:25,390  -->  00:02:29,039
city level and then aggregation at the

116

00:02:29,039  -->  00:02:29,049

117

00:02:29,049  -->  00:02:30,959
level of the state.

118

00:02:30,959  -->  00:02:30,969

119

00:02:30,969  -->  00:02:32,610
How can we do that? Well that's what

120

00:02:32,610  -->  00:02:32,620

121

00:02:32,620  -->  00:02:34,679
level of detailed calculations are

122

00:02:34,679  -->  00:02:34,689

123

00:02:34,689  -->  00:02:36,479
actually for and we're going to discuss

124

00:02:36,479  -->  00:02:36,489

125

00:02:36,489  -->  00:02:38,849
the three types of level of detail

126

00:02:38,849  -->  00:02:38,859

127

00:02:38,859  -->  00:02:40,530
calculations and existing Tableau. So

128

00:02:40,530  -->  00:02:40,540

129

00:02:40,540  -->  00:02:42,660
let's go ahead and do that. Here I've got

130

00:02:42,660  -->  00:02:42,670

131

00:02:42,670  -->  00:02:44,640
a little presentation prepared three

132

00:02:44,640  -->  00:02:44,650

133

00:02:44,650  -->  00:02:48,210
types of level of detail calculations so

134

00:02:48,210  -->  00:02:48,220

135

00:02:48,220  -->  00:02:50,610
the three types are number one include

136

00:02:50,610  -->  00:02:50,620

137

00:02:50,620  -->  00:02:54,929
number two exclude and number three fixed. So let's

138

00:02:54,929  -->  00:02:54,939

139

00:02:54,939  -->  00:02:57,390
have a look at each one of them separately.

140

00:02:57,390  -->  00:02:57,400

141

00:02:57,400  -->  00:02:59,610
What does include a almost do? Well let's

142

00:02:59,610  -->  00:02:59,620

143

00:02:59,620  -->  00:03:01,679
say like in our hypothetical example

144

00:03:01,679  -->  00:03:01,689

145

00:03:01,689  -->  00:03:04,379
working on a map it doesn't have to be

146

00:03:04,379  -->  00:03:04,389

147

00:03:04,389  -->  00:03:06,780
my map by the way it can be any type of

148

00:03:06,780  -->  00:03:06,790

149

00:03:06,790  -->  00:03:09,209
visualization as you're creating can be

150

00:03:09,209  -->  00:03:09,219

151

00:03:09,219  -->  00:03:12,149
completely unrelated to geographical

152

00:03:12,149  -->  00:03:12,159

153

00:03:12,159  -->  00:03:13,920
data you just have some certain

154

00:03:13,920  -->  00:03:13,930

155

00:03:13,930  -->  00:03:16,409
measures and the measures that you

156

00:03:16,409  -->  00:03:16,419

157

00:03:16,419  -->  00:03:18,960
include in your dashboard, they are they

158

00:03:18,960  -->  00:03:18,970

159

00:03:18,970  -->  00:03:20,699
determine the level of detail of your

160

00:03:20,699  -->  00:03:20,709

161

00:03:20,709  -->  00:03:22,649
visualization but you might want to

162

00:03:22,649  -->  00:03:22,659

163

00:03:22,659  -->  00:03:24,990
drill in further without changing your

164

00:03:24,990  -->  00:03:25,000

165

00:03:25,000  -->  00:03:27,839
visualization to perform aggregation and

166

00:03:27,839  -->  00:03:27,849

167

00:03:27,849  -->  00:03:29,699
then display that on your visualization.

168

00:03:29,699  -->  00:03:29,709

169

00:03:29,709  -->  00:03:32,280
So which is using a map for simplicity's

170

00:03:32,280  -->  00:03:32,290

171

00:03:32,290  -->  00:03:34,170
sake so it's very visual it's very easy

172

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:34,180

173

00:03:34,180  -->  00:03:37,020
to understand but again this can be

174

00:03:37,020  -->  00:03:37,030

175

00:03:37,030  -->  00:03:39,210
completely unrelated to geography it can

176

00:03:39,210  -->  00:03:39,220

177

00:03:39,220  -->  00:03:43,319
be any sort of measures that dimensions

178

00:03:43,319  -->  00:03:43,329

179

00:03:43,329  -->  00:03:46,259
that you're using in order to create

180

00:03:46,259  -->  00:03:46,269

181

00:03:46,269  -->  00:03:47,759
visualizations. That's just very

182

00:03:47,759  -->  00:03:47,769

183

00:03:47,769  -->  00:03:49,949
important to bear in mind that level of

184

00:03:49,949  -->  00:03:49,959

185

00:03:49,959  -->  00:03:52,860
detail calculations apply always. You can

186

00:03:52,860  -->  00:03:52,870

187

00:03:52,870  -->  00:03:55,229
always use them doesn't matter if you're

188

00:03:55,229  -->  00:03:55,239

189

00:03:55,239  -->  00:03:57,599
creating maps or not you're creating

190

00:03:57,599  -->  00:03:57,609

191

00:03:57,609  -->  00:04:01,110
something else. So in our case where

192

00:04:01,110  -->  00:04:01,120

193

00:04:01,120  -->  00:04:02,999
let's say we're working at the state

194

00:04:02,999  -->  00:04:03,009

195

00:04:03,009  -->  00:04:06,719
level and then we want to perform some

196

00:04:06,719  -->  00:04:06,729

197

00:04:06,729  -->  00:04:09,960
calculations at the city level for

198

00:04:09,960  -->  00:04:09,970

199

00:04:09,970  -->  00:04:11,369
instance aggregate our data at the

200

00:04:11,369  -->  00:04:11,379

201

00:04:11,379  -->  00:04:13,140
city level and then bring it back to

202

00:04:13,140  -->  00:04:13,150

203

00:04:13,150  -->  00:04:14,999
our visualization. So that's what include

204

00:04:14,999  -->  00:04:15,009

205

00:04:15,009  -->  00:04:16,560
allows you to do. It allows you to

206

00:04:16,560  -->  00:04:16,570

207

00:04:16,570  -->  00:04:20,339
include additional dimensions in your

208

00:04:20,339  -->  00:04:20,349

209

00:04:20,349  -->  00:04:22,800
calculation so not only on visualization bring

210

00:04:22,800  -->  00:04:22,810

211

00:04:22,810  -->  00:04:24,140
your calculation so

212

00:04:24,140  -->  00:04:24,150

213

00:04:24,150  -->  00:04:25,969
your visualization won't change even

214

00:04:25,969  -->  00:04:25,979

215

00:04:25,979  -->  00:04:27,770
though we're showing a new

216

00:04:27,770  -->  00:04:27,780

217

00:04:27,780  -->  00:04:29,210
visualization. Your visualization stays

218

00:04:29,210  -->  00:04:29,220

219

00:04:29,220  -->  00:04:31,520
like this and this is just what happens

220

00:04:31,520  -->  00:04:31,530

221

00:04:31,530  -->  00:04:33,980
in the background so include allows you

222

00:04:33,980  -->  00:04:33,990

223

00:04:33,990  -->  00:04:38,090
to go to a lower level of a higher level

224

00:04:38,090  -->  00:04:38,100

225

00:04:38,100  -->  00:04:41,150
of granularity or a low level level of

226

00:04:41,150  -->  00:04:41,160

227

00:04:41,160  -->  00:04:43,189
aggregation as you remember granularity and

228

00:04:43,189  -->  00:04:43,199

229

00:04:43,199  -->  00:04:46,490
aggregation are the opposites so include

230

00:04:46,490  -->  00:04:46,500

231

00:04:46,500  -->  00:04:49,670
allows you to go to a lower level of

232

00:04:49,670  -->  00:04:49,680

233

00:04:49,680  -->  00:04:52,400
granularity. So include allows you to go

234

00:04:52,400  -->  00:04:52,410

235

00:04:52,410  -->  00:04:55,279
to a higher level of granularity, so make

236

00:04:55,279  -->  00:04:55,289

237

00:04:55,289  -->  00:04:57,320
your calculation more granular for

238

00:04:57,320  -->  00:04:57,330

239

00:04:57,330  -->  00:04:59,540
instance go to the city level, perform

240

00:04:59,540  -->  00:04:59,550

241

00:04:59,550  -->  00:05:02,450
some calculation at the city level and

242

00:05:02,450  -->  00:05:02,460

243

00:05:02,460  -->  00:05:04,250
then bring it back to your visualization.

244

00:05:04,250  -->  00:05:04,260

245

00:05:04,260  -->  00:05:07,340
So all of this these two arrows and this

246

00:05:07,340  -->  00:05:07,350

247

00:05:07,350  -->  00:05:09,379
part you will never see them they will

248

00:05:09,379  -->  00:05:09,389

249

00:05:09,389  -->  00:05:11,330
happen in the background. They will happen in

250

00:05:11,330  -->  00:05:11,340

251

00:05:11,340  -->  00:05:13,670
your formula. Your visualization will

252

00:05:13,670  -->  00:05:13,680

253

00:05:13,680  -->  00:05:17,089
still remain at the higher level. That's

254

00:05:17,089  -->  00:05:17,099

255

00:05:17,099  -->  00:05:18,409
what includes allows you to and that's

256

00:05:18,409  -->  00:05:18,419

257

00:05:18,419  -->  00:05:20,330
why it's called include, it allows you to

258

00:05:20,330  -->  00:05:20,340

259

00:05:20,340  -->  00:05:23,210
include in this case we're including the

260

00:05:23,210  -->  00:05:23,220

261

00:05:23,220  -->  00:05:26,029
dimension which is called city. So our

262

00:05:26,029  -->  00:05:26,039

263

00:05:26,039  -->  00:05:28,370
visualization stays at the level of the

264

00:05:28,370  -->  00:05:28,380

265

00:05:28,380  -->  00:05:31,760
dimension state in our formula we are

266

00:05:31,760  -->  00:05:31,770

267

00:05:31,770  -->  00:05:33,620
including and as you'll see from the

268

00:05:33,620  -->  00:05:33,630

269

00:05:33,630  -->  00:05:35,360
practical side of things we're including

270

00:05:35,360  -->  00:05:35,370

271

00:05:35,370  -->  00:05:38,420
the dimension which is called city. Alright

272

00:05:38,420  -->  00:05:38,430

273

00:05:38,430  -->  00:05:41,000
so then we've got exclude, well exclude

274

00:05:41,000  -->  00:05:41,010

275

00:05:41,010  -->  00:05:43,339
does opposite. If you're working at a

276

00:05:43,339  -->  00:05:43,349

277

00:05:43,349  -->  00:05:46,460
level of aggregation such as city for

278

00:05:46,460  -->  00:05:46,470

279

00:05:46,470  -->  00:05:48,710
instance in this case and then you need

280

00:05:48,710  -->  00:05:48,720

281

00:05:48,720  -->  00:05:51,620
to for some reason go to a higher level

282

00:05:51,620  -->  00:05:51,630

283

00:05:51,630  -->  00:05:55,399
of aggregation also you want to lower

284

00:05:55,399  -->  00:05:55,409

285

00:05:55,409  -->  00:05:58,100
the granularity and you want to go to

286

00:05:58,100  -->  00:05:58,110

287

00:05:58,110  -->  00:06:00,560
the state level but you don't want to

288

00:06:00,560  -->  00:06:00,570

289

00:06:00,570  -->  00:06:01,939
change your visualization, you just want to get

290

00:06:01,939  -->  00:06:01,949

291

00:06:01,949  -->  00:06:05,000
some data from some from so calculations

292

00:06:05,000  -->  00:06:05,010

293

00:06:05,010  -->  00:06:06,469
at the state level and bring them back

294

00:06:06,469  -->  00:06:06,479

295

00:06:06,479  -->  00:06:09,620
right? So then that's what exclude allows

296

00:06:09,620  -->  00:06:09,630

297

00:06:09,630  -->  00:06:11,149
you to. Exclude in this case, we're going

298

00:06:11,149  -->  00:06:11,159

299

00:06:11,159  -->  00:06:14,240
to exclude the dimension which is city

300

00:06:14,240  -->  00:06:14,250

301

00:06:14,250  -->  00:06:18,020
which will give us just the same

302

00:06:18,020  -->  00:06:18,030

303

00:06:18,030  -->  00:06:20,450
visualization or this will give us the

304

00:06:20,450  -->  00:06:20,460

305

00:06:20,460  -->  00:06:24,200
same data set and the same analysis

306

00:06:24,200  -->  00:06:24,210

307

00:06:24,210  -->  00:06:26,629
that were performing but at the level of

308

00:06:26,629  -->  00:06:26,639

309

00:06:26,639  -->  00:06:28,670
the state and then we'll perform some

310

00:06:28,670  -->  00:06:28,680

311

00:06:28,680  -->  00:06:30,260
calculations in our formula and then

312

00:06:30,260  -->  00:06:30,270

313

00:06:30,270  -->  00:06:32,269
we'll bring it back. So in this case, all

314

00:06:32,269  -->  00:06:32,279

315

00:06:32,279  -->  00:06:35,480
of this on the left will be in the

316

00:06:35,480  -->  00:06:35,490

317

00:06:35,490  -->  00:06:37,430
background so your visualization will stay at

318

00:06:37,430  -->  00:06:37,440

319

00:06:37,440  -->  00:06:37,740
this

320

00:06:37,740  -->  00:06:37,750

321

00:06:37,750  -->  00:06:39,780
level of granularity whichever level of

322

00:06:39,780  -->  00:06:39,790

323

00:06:39,790  -->  00:06:42,270
granularity it was at and then you'll

324

00:06:42,270  -->  00:06:42,280

325

00:06:42,280  -->  00:06:44,880
just excluded the dimension temporarily in

326

00:06:44,880  -->  00:06:44,890

327

00:06:44,890  -->  00:06:46,980
your calculation perform that

328

00:06:46,980  -->  00:06:46,990

329

00:06:46,990  -->  00:06:49,350
calculation for instance you might want

330

00:06:49,350  -->  00:06:49,360

331

00:06:49,360  -->  00:06:51,900
to find out the sum of all of your

332

00:06:51,900  -->  00:06:51,910

333

00:06:51,910  -->  00:06:54,330
profits for each state and then bring it

334

00:06:54,330  -->  00:06:54,340

335

00:06:54,340  -->  00:06:56,340
back into a calculation right and an

336

00:06:56,340  -->  00:06:56,350

337

00:06:56,350  -->  00:06:58,200
obvious example here is that lets say

338

00:06:58,200  -->  00:06:58,210

339

00:06:58,210  -->  00:07:00,600
you have them profit for each city so

340

00:07:00,600  -->  00:07:00,610

341

00:07:00,610  -->  00:07:02,670
you can sum it up, you just just forget

342

00:07:02,670  -->  00:07:02,680

343

00:07:02,680  -->  00:07:04,500
about this left part. You can just, based on

344

00:07:04,500  -->  00:07:04,510

345

00:07:04,510  -->  00:07:06,030
this visualization you can sum up the

346

00:07:06,030  -->  00:07:06,040

347

00:07:06,040  -->  00:07:07,590
profit for every city and you'll get the

348

00:07:07,590  -->  00:07:07,600

349

00:07:07,600  -->  00:07:10,290
sum of profit for city but then you want

350

00:07:10,290  -->  00:07:10,300

351

00:07:10,300  -->  00:07:12,900
to divide it by the total profit for

352

00:07:12,900  -->  00:07:12,910

353

00:07:12,910  -->  00:07:15,750
that state in which that city is right?

354

00:07:15,750  -->  00:07:15,760

355

00:07:15,760  -->  00:07:17,250
So how'd you get that? Well you use a

356

00:07:17,250  -->  00:07:17,260

357

00:07:17,260  -->  00:07:18,990
level of detail calculation. You use

358

00:07:18,990  -->  00:07:19,000

359

00:07:19,000  -->  00:07:21,900
exclude, you exclude city in that

360

00:07:21,900  -->  00:07:21,910

361

00:07:21,910  -->  00:07:23,940
specific calculation so that will give

362

00:07:23,940  -->  00:07:23,950

363

00:07:23,950  -->  00:07:27,659
you this arrow. You will then this use a

364

00:07:27,659  -->  00:07:27,669

365

00:07:27,669  -->  00:07:32,490
sum function on the within each state in

366

00:07:32,490  -->  00:07:32,500

367

00:07:32,500  -->  00:07:35,040
that formula. We will see that as well in

368

00:07:35,040  -->  00:07:35,050

369

00:07:35,050  -->  00:07:38,100
action and then you will go back to your

370

00:07:38,100  -->  00:07:38,110

371

00:07:38,110  -->  00:07:40,500
original visualization. You will bring that

372

00:07:40,500  -->  00:07:40,510

373

00:07:40,510  -->  00:07:42,030
information back and you'll be able to

374

00:07:42,030  -->  00:07:42,040

375

00:07:42,040  -->  00:07:44,340
use it in your visualization so without

376

00:07:44,340  -->  00:07:44,350

377

00:07:44,350  -->  00:07:46,590
impacting the visualization itself very very

378

00:07:46,590  -->  00:07:46,600

379

00:07:46,600  -->  00:07:49,200
powerful and finally we've got fixed, so

380

00:07:49,200  -->  00:07:49,210

381

00:07:49,210  -->  00:07:50,700
what is fixed? Well here I've got just

382

00:07:50,700  -->  00:07:50,710

383

00:07:50,710  -->  00:07:54,150
the map based on the state level again

384

00:07:54,150  -->  00:07:54,160

385

00:07:54,160  -->  00:07:55,680
it's just this is just an example can be

386

00:07:55,680  -->  00:07:55,690

387

00:07:55,690  -->  00:07:58,140
at any level can be at city state

388

00:07:58,140  -->  00:07:58,150

389

00:07:58,150  -->  00:08:00,300
country war again your visualization

390

00:08:00,300  -->  00:08:00,310

391

00:08:00,310  -->  00:08:02,159
might not even include geographies it

392

00:08:02,159  -->  00:08:02,169

393

00:08:02,169  -->  00:08:05,130
might be a years it might be months it

394

00:08:05,130  -->  00:08:05,140

395

00:08:05,140  -->  00:08:07,500
might be gender it might be different

396

00:08:07,500  -->  00:08:07,510

397

00:08:07,510  -->  00:08:10,380
categories of products any kind of

398

00:08:10,380  -->  00:08:10,390

399

00:08:10,390  -->  00:08:11,730
dimension. This is very important to

400

00:08:11,730  -->  00:08:11,740

401

00:08:11,740  -->  00:08:14,550
understand and in this case what i have

402

00:08:14,550  -->  00:08:14,560

403

00:08:14,560  -->  00:08:18,659
is the data set, add to the level of the

404

00:08:18,659  -->  00:08:18,669

405

00:08:18,669  -->  00:08:21,360
state and what fixed means is it means

406

00:08:21,360  -->  00:08:21,370

407

00:08:21,370  -->  00:08:24,300
it doesn't this calculation which we'll

408

00:08:24,300  -->  00:08:24,310

409

00:08:24,310  -->  00:08:27,180
be using the fixed level of detail

410

00:08:27,180  -->  00:08:27,190

411

00:08:27,190  -->  00:08:31,950
calculation it won't care it won't rely

412

00:08:31,950  -->  00:08:31,960

413

00:08:31,960  -->  00:08:35,670
on the original level of granularity of

414

00:08:35,670  -->  00:08:35,680

415

00:08:35,680  -->  00:08:37,709
your visualization. So this is where the

416

00:08:37,709  -->  00:08:37,719

417

00:08:37,719  -->  00:08:40,230
calculation will happen, that's full stop so

418

00:08:40,230  -->  00:08:40,240

419

00:08:40,240  -->  00:08:41,370
you're not including or excluding

420

00:08:41,370  -->  00:08:41,380

421

00:08:41,380  -->  00:08:44,490
anything you just explicitly specifying

422

00:08:44,490  -->  00:08:44,500

423

00:08:44,500  -->  00:08:47,010
where at which level of granularity you

424

00:08:47,010  -->  00:08:47,020

425

00:08:47,020  -->  00:08:49,199
want your calculations be performed and

426

00:08:49,199  -->  00:08:49,209

427

00:08:49,209  -->  00:08:50,970
your visualization can be at

428

00:08:50,970  -->  00:08:50,980

429

00:08:50,980  -->  00:08:52,949
the country level. It can be at the city

430

00:08:52,949  -->  00:08:52,959

431

00:08:52,959  -->  00:08:54,449
level or you can even be at the same

432

00:08:54,449  -->  00:08:54,459

433

00:08:54,459  -->  00:08:57,689
state level. Doesn't matter, so it doesn't

434

00:08:57,689  -->  00:08:57,699

435

00:08:57,699  -->  00:09:00,660
matter from which actual visualization

436

00:09:00,660  -->  00:09:00,670

437

00:09:00,670  -->  00:09:03,660
you are calling this formula. It will

438

00:09:03,660  -->  00:09:03,670

439

00:09:03,670  -->  00:09:06,269
always be you'll be able always to be

440

00:09:06,269  -->  00:09:06,279

441

00:09:06,279  -->  00:09:07,740
able to call it with the same result

442

00:09:07,740  -->  00:09:07,750

443

00:09:07,750  -->  00:09:09,900
because you're explicitly specifying

444

00:09:09,900  -->  00:09:09,910

445

00:09:09,910  -->  00:09:13,500
where this calculation has to happen at

446

00:09:13,500  -->  00:09:13,510

447

00:09:13,510  -->  00:09:15,210
which level of granularity. The way to think

448

00:09:15,210  -->  00:09:15,220

449

00:09:15,220  -->  00:09:18,509
about fixed is kind of like a path on

450

00:09:18,509  -->  00:09:18,519

451

00:09:18,519  -->  00:09:21,660
your hard drive you know? So if you're if

452

00:09:21,660  -->  00:09:21,670

453

00:09:21,670  -->  00:09:23,340
you're familiar with program programming

454

00:09:23,340  -->  00:09:23,350

455

00:09:23,350  -->  00:09:26,970
then you can or basically any type of

456

00:09:26,970  -->  00:09:26,980

457

00:09:26,980  -->  00:09:30,900
computer work you can always specify a

458

00:09:30,900  -->  00:09:30,910

459

00:09:30,910  -->  00:09:33,660
relative or absolute path right? So

460

00:09:33,660  -->  00:09:33,670

461

00:09:33,670  -->  00:09:36,000
include, exclude are relative paths so

462

00:09:36,000  -->  00:09:36,010

463

00:09:36,010  -->  00:09:40,230
say your on folder x include means go into

464

00:09:40,230  -->  00:09:40,240

465

00:09:40,240  -->  00:09:44,280
a subfolder and find something in the

466

00:09:44,280  -->  00:09:44,290

467

00:09:44,290  -->  00:09:46,259
sub folder so going to make the

468

00:09:46,259  -->  00:09:46,269

469

00:09:46,269  -->  00:09:48,569
increase the granularity. Exclude means

470

00:09:48,569  -->  00:09:48,579

471

00:09:48,579  -->  00:09:50,490
going to the parent folder of the

472

00:09:50,490  -->  00:09:50,500

473

00:09:50,500  -->  00:09:52,350
current from your current location where

474

00:09:52,350  -->  00:09:52,360

475

00:09:52,360  -->  00:09:54,810
is fixed is the absolute path. You don't

476

00:09:54,810  -->  00:09:54,820

477

00:09:54,820  -->  00:09:58,079
fix doesn't mind where you are now your

478

00:09:58,079  -->  00:09:58,089

479

00:09:58,089  -->  00:10:01,590
folder X or folder Y, you're in the

480

00:10:01,590  -->  00:10:01,600

481

00:10:01,600  -->  00:10:03,689
parent folder or the child folder.

482

00:10:03,689  -->  00:10:03,699

483

00:10:03,699  -->  00:10:05,340
Doesn't matter, if it fixes like

484

00:10:05,340  -->  00:10:05,350

485

00:10:05,350  -->  00:10:08,579
specifying absolute path to your folder

486

00:10:08,579  -->  00:10:08,589

487

00:10:08,589  -->  00:10:10,319
where you want to find something. That's

488

00:10:10,319  -->  00:10:10,329

489

00:10:10,329  -->  00:10:12,720
kind of a very simplistic type of

490

00:10:12,720  -->  00:10:12,730

491

00:10:12,730  -->  00:10:15,180
analogy but it does drive the point home.

492

00:10:15,180  -->  00:10:15,190

493

00:10:15,190  -->  00:10:17,639
Alright so those are the three types of

494

00:10:17,639  -->  00:10:17,649

495

00:10:17,649  -->  00:10:20,400
level of detailed calculations and now

496

00:10:20,400  -->  00:10:20,410

497

00:10:20,410  -->  00:10:22,680
that we've done three, we can't wait to get

498

00:10:22,680  -->  00:10:22,690

499

00:10:22,690  -->  00:10:26,100
into the practical side and I look

500

00:10:26,100  -->  00:10:26,110

501

00:10:26,110  -->  00:10:27,509
forward to see you next time.

502

00:10:27,509  -->  00:10:27,519

503

00:10:27,519  -->  00:10:34,110
Until then, happy analyzing.
