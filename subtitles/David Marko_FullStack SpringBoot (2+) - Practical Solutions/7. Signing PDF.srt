00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,770
In this lecture, we are going to add support for embedding barcodes into PDF.

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:25,920
It's a very the same way as embedding images in PDF as barcode is image as such, but instead of using

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,230
a static image already created, we have to create that barcode image on the fly.

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,350
So we use a few libraries from the Google for that purposes.

5
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:46,800
We have the support for different barcode flavors and we use those libraries for creating

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,980
barcodes.

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,630
Resources.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,000
So let's create a barcode service.

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,640
And to create some implementation.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:09,750
We first one is creating a method for getting a barcode or creating a barcode from the text string.

11
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,440
And we use also kind of a helper method for converting a barcode to basis 64.

12
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:29,040
For the conversion, we use Google based dependency library for converting to a specific barcode we

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,530
use for our PDF file,

14
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,970
creating a barcode to contain the different options here, even for different barcode types.

15
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,840
So it's not the core of this course.

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,590
So we can just skip it with a basic implementation.

17
00:01:49,590 --> 00:02:04,290
Using Code 128 type, we specify a text, we specify a type of the barcode and some other stuff that

18
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,350
is required and can be found and in library documentation.

19
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:21,690
Then we create a binary output stream very similar way as we use with static files and we do a conversion

20
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,160
of the barcode into a JPG image.

21
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:37,800
So at the end of of this method, we can get a barcode and type of byte array, PNG data format, then

22
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:46,410
we have to convert that to data into base 64 in the very same way as we have done for a static image.

23
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,290
So we can create even a helper function here that can do it for us.

24
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,610
Let's see.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,810
And then we have to of course add that barcode into context variables.

26
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:11,400
So we have that context object, we create a new line, we can name it barcode one, barcode one, and

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,340
we can call a barcode service and get barcode as base 64 with the invoice number information.

28
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:30,150
So the text we would like to convert into base into barcode is mentioned as a method parameter.

29
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,850
So we just call that.

30
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,320
And we are getting back PNG image converted into base 64

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,430
the same way as we have down for static image.

32
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:59,400
We have to create a HTML tac to make that barcode visible in HTML and then that HTML will be converted

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,710
into a PDF the same way as we have done for image.

34
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,320
So let's copy paste the image tag.

35
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:19,170
But to just use a barcode, one variable name, this is the name we've done or we used in this context

36
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,040
variable.

37
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,600
So we have that context variable and.

38
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,300
Now everything is in place, and we should just try it.

39
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,360
Just reload our endpoint, save and open the file.

40
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
And something is wrong here.

41
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,020
So let's just recompile.

42
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:48,980
HTML.

43
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,230
This is something we have to think about that.

44
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:58,280
And if something is not visible, usually it means we didn't refresh something in our application.

45
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:07,550
So we refresh the template and we can see the barcode is inside the PDF under the image we re provided

46
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,330
previously.

47
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,540
So it's very easy way how to embed a barcode.

48
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,480
You can use different types of barcodes.

49
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:29,120
We can position that on the in the pdf the same way as we position something in HTML.

50
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:39,880
So it's very easy and we basically don't need to learn some PDF related language for formatting output.

51
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,960
We just need to know come on HTML and we are good to go.
