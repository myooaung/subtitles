00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:15,720
The last thing we are going to look at is the way how to support using a different fonts in PDF output.

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,720
To use a different fonts, we can download the fonts in two type of format.

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:35,980
We have this free library sans font available and downloaded and stored inside resources folder and

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,180
to.

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,820
We can reference that to type fonts in the create pdf it's method.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:01:00,270
So we use we set u r l resource pointing to those two fonts and then we use those two URLs for the render

7
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,590
specification.

8
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,120
So let's just enhance our configuration.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:20,790
We use this render get font resource resolver and we at each font into the renderer the same way.

10
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,920
So we have those two URLs, first one and second one, we add those fonts.

11
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,920
So Render is able to recognise fonts being used by name.

12
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:43,770
And then of course we have to bind this together with each HTML we use for creating a PDF.

13
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:58,440
So we have to go to our HTML template and we have to specify font family the way we basically use for

14
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,820
HTML pages.

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:10,110
So we create a body style information and we can specify font family that fits the name of tru type

16
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,850
font we we are using.

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,980
Then when we create a PDF, the font being used as the one we reference in HTML in this very easy way.
