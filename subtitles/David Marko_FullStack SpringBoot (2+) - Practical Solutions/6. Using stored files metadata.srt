00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:15,290
In the first lecture on this great topic, we mentioned a few advantages when using grade FS for storing

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,460
files.

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,390
One of those is using a kind of metadata.

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,090
We mentioned that metadata is a map like objects.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:34,820
We specify each metadata with the key and the content actually can be almost anything.

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,900
It can be a string number or array or information.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,880
And this way we can store metadata together with the file itself.

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,230
So it's very easy to to add some application specific.

9
00:00:53,110 --> 00:01:04,510
Logic and to when we go to a MongoDB UI, we can see one greater as object and we can see a metadata

10
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:15,100
section and object data and we can see as well the name, size, image type information, the metadata.

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,610
We actually provide it in our implementation.

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,520
So it's stored in a in one record with the file.

13
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:32,920
And when we are retrieving the single file or a list of files, we have that information available for

14
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,420
us to to present to the browser to make it available to the user.

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:51,940
And we can use that information to filter items from the database so we can use it for a kind of access

16
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,250
control definition, for example.

17
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:02,320
So grid of assets, there is a there is many advantages we can use.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,300
There is a very nice documentation on the MongoDB website and spring data implementation covers all

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:17,320
the features and this is first class implementation for the MongoDB usage.

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,070
Great advice and great advice include it.

21
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,440
So I really encourage you to use it.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,820
It's very easy to handle if I uploads in your application and manage that for a long time.
