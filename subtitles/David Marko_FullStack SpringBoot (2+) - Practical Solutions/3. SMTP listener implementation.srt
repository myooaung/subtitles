1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,230
Okay.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,120
So let's start with simple message listener implementation.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,830
So it's a core part of our implementation.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:26,350
This is a service or class that will implement, accepting and email delivery.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:33,790
So let's create some infrastructure in our application source code.

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,490
We create some default packages.

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:45,250
We have a mailer and service package, and now we create a simple mail listener implementation.

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,380
So let's name it.

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,800
Simple message listener.

10
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,430
Simple.

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,780
We we need to.

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,650
Implement the interface.

13
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,570
The interface is coming from the one of our dependencies.

14
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,320
So we have this simple message listener.

15
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,190
Interface we are going to implement here.

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,460
So just to avoid any confusion.

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,930
Now the idea show us shows that we need to implement.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,630
Actually two methods.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,090
So we have a two method methods here.

20
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,600
We have a accept and deliver.

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,480
The first one.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:44,410
The exit method is just for making decision whether we accept the incoming message or we are rejecting

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,220
that.

24
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,520
So we return a true or false.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,390
So when we return, a true message is accepted.

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,250
This accept method has a two parameters.

27
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:05,590
We have a from and recipient information so we can reuse those for making a decision whether we accept

28
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,640
it or not.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,470
The same parameters are going to the second method named deliver.

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:20,560
Deliver method has also the from end recipient information coming into and we have input stream data

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,770
structure containing the entire email structure.

32
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,930
I just tried to say body, but it's not the body itself, it's our email.

33
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:41,350
As such, we switch the accept return value to choose, so we don't have any specific logic for accepting

34
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,210
email right now.

35
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,790
And it's okay for testing purposes.

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:56,290
And if we need anything else and we have that to deliver method here, we can also reuse this from recipient

37
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:09,520
information directly and then we have to decode that input stream data and just to pass those data as

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
an email data structure.

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,120
So we know that from a recipient directly and then we have to decode that.

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:27,670
So basically that's all we need to accept email specifically, we need to or we can specify some kind

41
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,760
of logic here based on those from and recipient information.

42
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,320
We don't have anything else here because we are just rejecting email as such if needed.

43
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:49,660
And then we have the deliver method that is doing actually the email processing so we can add some lodging

44
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,230
here.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:00,820
So we use a Lombok logging infrastructure, we're using that annotation and then we do use some a log

46
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,010
information writing to console.

47
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:13,840
So when we start an application and send email into, we can see a LOC message coming to the console

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:25,390
so we can just reuse the from and recipient informations here and display those on the console so we

49
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:32,440
can just check that everything is working without any detailed code right now.

50
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,700
So that's all.

51
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,300
That's all.

52
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,110
It's quite simple here and we will continue in the next lecture.
