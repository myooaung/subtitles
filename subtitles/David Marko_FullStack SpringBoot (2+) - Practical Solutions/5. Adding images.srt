00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,080
In this lecture, we start creating a way how to embed images into PDF.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:23,010
The way of the support of embedding images in PDF is to put image into HTML in base 6 to 4 format.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:32,320
So we don't reference image directly, but we embed the image as encoded text in base 6 to 4 format.

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:40,620
That way we can use render to render image directly as the image in PDF.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,830
To do so, we create a kind of utility class for that purpose.

6
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:57,480
So and to using that class, we can we will be able to convert it to images stored in the disk into

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
base 64.

8
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:09,540
We have a full implementation here right now because it's not directly the core of this course.

9
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,680
So we we are using a libraries to do so.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,590
We convert it to we can convert the image to base 64 using those two methods directly into PNG or to

11
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:36,240
format we we specify we take a reference to image storage and data source inside of our project so we

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,910
can put image into our project.

13
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:52,080
We can reference the the image specify image format and we can embed or create data format attack.

14
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,340
That will reference the image in image TAC in HTML.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,190
We have a few way how to do it.

16
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,420
We can use Default Java Base 64 and coder for that purpose.

17
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:22,070
It's probably most straightforward way to do so and to we can just reference an image and do proper

18
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,850
conversion.

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,870
We can take the image we just created.

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:38,960
We create a helpful directory for us in that templates, PDF Subfolder so we can create something where

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,730
we can embed the image.

22
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:49,940
So let's create a images folder here and we can just paste predefined image here.

23
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,490
Just take a look how the image looks like.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:01,820
Yeah, this is my custom image and we reference that image and in during the conversion.

25
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,040
So yeah, we have a templates, pdfs, images, image one dot PNG.

26
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,960
This is a full path where we reference to image.

27
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,550
And that's that's the first step we need to do.

28
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,220
We need to we need to make a conversion.

29
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:32,390
So in the HTML we can create an image tag and we can reference the image using a time leave syntax like

30
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:32,840
a

31
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,860
source and we reference something called image one.

32
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,340
And this image one should be a part of the context we provide for time leave.

33
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,930
So this will be part of the for the implementation.
