00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:16,200
In this last lecture describing ways of using or creating Excel files on fly in our applications, we

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,350
we try to implement the way how to embed to images into Excel sheets.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:32,340
We have to create some infrastructure code, something that we can use to embed the image we have already

4
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,670
uploaded in our projects directly in the sheet.

5
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,230
So we create sheets.

6
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:44,520
We use this Excel, generate, generate the service we created already and we created embed image method.

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,060
We have the way or method signature defines a way how to specify image path.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:59,310
We provide a workbook and sheets information so we can just put the image directly in the place.

9
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,400
And now we have to handle the image itself.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,770
We put images into resources folder of our projects.

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,270
We have to convert image to array of bytes.

12
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,800
We have to add image to the workbook.

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,410
We get a picture index, something that describes our image.

14
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,220
We do some other handling for the working of images in the workbook.

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,170
So we basically we add image to the workbook as such.

16
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:42,490
And then we have to place such image inside the sheet so we can have a.

17
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,920
A lot of images in the world book and we have placed the image at the correct position on the particular

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,540
sheet.

19
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,570
So for that purpose we have this great picture method.

20
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,150
We specify a position and we specify a picture index.

21
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,570
This is just a kind of variable describing our picture in the book.

22
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:20,080
So just putting all those things together help us to place the image we we have into the sheet.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,080
We can use that method for placing any kind of images on the sheet.

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,910
For our purposes, we we are going to use a PNG file, but we can use a JPEG for example as well.

25
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:44,690
And to having that embed image method, we have to just call it in a in a method when we create Excel

26
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:53,590
file so we specify the path or image name, we can even specify a full path if needed.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,300
So we specify a PNG image name.

28
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,760
We provide a workbook and sheets variables to our method.

29
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,580
And now we also have to upload the image we would like to display.

30
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:19,580
We don't have any image yet, so let's just pays the image into the new images folder.

31
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,850
So we have just image one BMG right here.

32
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:34,970
And this is the one we are referencing and this is the image we are going to see an Excel file.

33
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:42,170
So let's restart our application and see that everything is working as expected.

34
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,890
And till we can again access the end point we created for that purpose and open the file that's been

35
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,430
updated.

36
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,230
We can see the text format.

37
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,650
It still remains the same and we can see actually the image we embedded into Excel file.

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:07,110
We have we have that anchor that's just position image on the sheet.

39
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,540
And the same way we can embed many images on the same sheet or we can use a different sheets for place

40
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,740
of images as we are requested.

41
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,820
We can now take a quick look to picture types being supported.

42
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:32,910
We use a PNG file, but we can use the JPEG or some other formats as supported by the library.

43
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:40,560
So it's very easy to switch to something more friendly to your project easily, and that's actually

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,760
all we need to provide or embed the images into Excel file.

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,960
Just implementation.

46
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,720
I think it's quite straightforward and easy to understand and this is important for us.
