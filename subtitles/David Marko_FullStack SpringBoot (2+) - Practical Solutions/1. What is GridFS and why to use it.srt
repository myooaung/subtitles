Guiterrez is important part of Mongo database great of as is specification for storing and retrieving

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,720
files that exceed a size limit of 60 megabytes.

3
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:31,730
We usually we usually store attachments or a file uploads directly into file system or some abstraction

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,900
over the file system.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,250
Great.

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:45,650
As is the way how to store such files in mongo database directly and to storing files into database

7
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:53,540
in general is not recommended, but a great Avaz is a very special feature of Mongo database that is

8
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,510
specifically focused for that purpose.

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:08,210
There is a few use cases or not few, maybe even many use cases when great FS is much better solution

10
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,200
for storing files compared to file systems and so on.

11
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:27,960
We can store a bunch of small files, we can save really huge files into Great Avaz and we can use a

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,100
different MongoDB features, features like sharding to work with the data.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:44,760
What's even important, we can store a metadata together with files saved in grid avast.

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:54,030
So not just the files and basic data like a file name or size are going to be saved.

15
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:07,620
But we can save metadata of any kind and it usually very good and reflects specifics of our applications.

16
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:14,970
This is also the reason why we are going to include grid of apps in that course.

17
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:27,630
Spring Boot has very good support for MongoDB and Grid Avast included, so it's very easy to enhance

18
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,480
existing or new application and include the support we need.

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,590
We can look at our basic application.

20
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,950
We have a Maven configuration here.

21
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:52,860
We can see we use version 2.7, but greater fast support is included even in a 1.5 version of spring

22
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,430
boot.

23
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,340
So we can use a legacy application.

24
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,510
The only dependency we need is to start it's spring boot start data MongoDB dependency.

25
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:17,250
So if we use that, we have a grid of full support and in our application we are adding a few more packages.

26
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:26,430
But this is very minimal application so there is not too much dependency and you can see how easily

27
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:37,800
storing files in grid of apps in MongoDB can be done in spring boot application like we have.
