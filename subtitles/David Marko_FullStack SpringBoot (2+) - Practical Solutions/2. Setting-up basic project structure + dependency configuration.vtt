00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:10.640
Now we are going to set up a minimal speed project for our inbound SMTP server.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:20.500
Example we we used to start a web interface for creating this very minimal project.

3
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.900
We, we use dependency on springboard itself.

4
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.450
We have a timely dependency included.

5
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.330
We have spring data, MongoDB included.

6
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.780
We are going to use that for storing email into the emails database.

7
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.280
And what's more important here or most important here is dependency on that SMTP server itself.

8
00:00:48.290 --> 00:01:01.250
We are using a package or dependency called subset SMTP, which provides embeddable SMTP server that

9
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.740
is fully configurable as we are going to see after a minute.

10
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:16.640
And that way, or using just this one dependency, we can run embedded SMTP server and virtually any

11
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.160
in literally any springboard applications.

12
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:33.020
We are using a springboard version to here, but we are successfully using that SMTP package and a springboard

13
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.950
to 1 to 5 applications running for years with no issues in production.

14
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.400
So this can be reused even for older legacy applications successfully with actually no issue here.

15
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.500
So this is the very minimum system we have for we can run the application with that dependency and we

16
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.220
can build our system based on that just after a minute.
