00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,320
In this lecture we are going to finish implementation of embedding image in PDF.

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,070
We prepared image utility class.

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,450
We created a TAC into HTML template.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:31,500
And then now we need to specify the image one context variable and specify the way how the variable

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,640
is being represented.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:42,720
So we here in render HTML for PDF, we add a new context variable named image one as we reference and

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:54,780
we call our image utils convert image to base 64 and we have to mention or reference image itself.

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,180
We we passed image into PDF images under the image one dot PNG name.

9
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,590
So we just reference this name as a part of converting image to Base64 method.

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,980
And this is actually all this is the part we we need to use.

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:26,580
We have this create PDF already available so we can run the project and see if everything fits together

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,670
and the entire implementation and implementation is correct.

13
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,380
So let's see if application is running.

14
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:46,200
We can again call controller method and we can just store it and open the PDF.

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,970
We just create it.

16
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,100
So let's see how the.

17
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:04,820
How the test file looks like and we can see our HTML converted to PDF and we can see the image being

18
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,330
embedded into the PDF the same way as we could see in the resources part.

19
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:19,220
So this is quite straightforward way how to embed the image into PDF.

20
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:28,730
We just need to take the image static one of or generate generated one and we have to just convert the

21
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,560
image into base 64.

22
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:39,380
This is a very easy way how to do so for many different image sources and just show up image in PDF

23
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,070
easily.
