00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.800
In this lecture, we are going to create a dynamic file output into Excel spreadsheet format.

2
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:24.390
For that purpose, we are supposed to use Apache Po AI Library, which is quite powerful library for

3
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:36.240
exporting data in Microsoft Office related formats like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, or even a publisher,

4
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.750
especially, especially the actual implementation.

5
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:50.100
And it contains a huge number of features, including formatting cells, working with sheets, embedding

6
00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:00.780
images and just to use that library, we can include one dependency into our Maven configuration file.

7
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:09.720
You can see we still have that springboard version at seven, but it's compatible with we have a low,

8
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.130
low, much lower.

9
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.600
The springboard versions.

10
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.320
And for our purposes we we add a dependency to Apache po po.

11
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.570
I library specifically the one for working with Excel files.

12
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:36.800
So this is all we need actually all the sub sub dependencies are included in this dependency definition.

13
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.310
So we just point that into maven.
