00:00:07,919  -->  00:00:10,910
In this lesson, we are going to focus on 
interaction design.

2

00:00:10,910  -->  00:00:14,519
An important part in the broad field 
of user experience.

3

00:00:14,519  -->  00:00:16,590
But what exactly is it?

4

00:00:16,590  -->  00:00:19,380
Let's start with this famous quote 
from Steve Jobs.

5

00:00:19,380  -->  00:00:24,110
He said: “Design is not just how it looks
and feels.

6

00:00:24,110  -->  00:00:26,110
Design is how it works.”

7

00:00:26,110  -->  00:00:29,434
And this is exactly what interaction design
is about.

8

00:00:29,434  -->  00:00:35,480
Interaction designers focus on the user and
their interaction with a product.

9

00:00:35,480  -->  00:00:37,615
Think of it as a conversation.

10

00:00:37,615  -->  00:00:42,556
Interaction design is the creation of a dialogue
between a system and a person using it.

11

00:00:43,307  -->  00:00:49,545
Interaction design has its origins in web
design, but has grown into its own domain.

12

00:00:49,545  -->  00:00:53,909
Interaction designers are responsible for
creating every element on the screen that

13

00:00:53,909  -->  00:00:58,269
a user can swipe, click, tap, or type.

14

00:00:58,269  -->  00:01:01,459
In short, the interactions of an experience.

15

00:01:01,459  -->  00:01:06,460
Everything from a button to a link to a form
field is part of interaction design.

16

00:01:07,184  -->  00:01:11,063
The 5 dimensions of interaction design is
a useful model to understand

17

00:01:11,063  -->  00:01:13,430
what interaction design is about.

18

00:01:13,430  -->  00:01:19,520
Gillian Crampton Smith, an interaction design
academic, first introduced this concept.

19

00:01:19,520  -->  00:01:27,149
According to this model interaction design
pays attention to five dimensions.

20

00:01:27,149  -->  00:01:34,810
Words, visual representations, physical objects or
space, time, and behavior.

21

00:01:37,277  -->  00:01:40,034
Let’s take a look at this application form.

22

00:01:40,034  -->  00:01:42,240
The first dimension is words.

23

00:01:42,240  -->  00:01:47,289
You may think that writing puts one word before
another, but there's a lot that goes into

24

00:01:47,289  -->  00:01:49,780
choosing your words.

25

00:01:49,780  -->  00:01:51,710
Words should be easy to understand.

26

00:01:51,710  -->  00:01:55,950
Written in such a way that they easily transfer
information to the end-user.

27

00:01:56,299  -->  00:02:02,319
Words, especially those used in interactions,
such as button labels, should be meaningful

28

00:02:02,319  -->  00:02:04,100
and easy to understand.

29

00:02:04,100  -->  00:02:10,154
They need to pass information to users without
overwhelming them with too much detail.

30

00:02:10,154  -->  00:02:15,130
Visual representations are graphical elements
that users interact with.

31

00:02:15,130  -->  00:02:17,319
Such as images and icons.

32

00:02:17,319  -->  00:02:19,991
Basically, anything that isn't text.

33

00:02:19,991  -->  00:02:24,819
They usually complement the words used to
convey information to users.

34

00:02:24,819  -->  00:02:30,554
Users need to be able to interact with them
seamlessly and use only their intuition.

35

00:02:30,554  -->  00:02:35,040
Physical objects refer to the hardware that
a user interacts with.

36

00:02:35,040  -->  00:02:38,409
For example, a laptop, with a mouse or touchpad.

37

00:02:38,409  -->  00:02:41,450
Or a smartphone, with the user's fingers.

38

00:02:41,450  -->  00:02:44,989
Second, within which physical space the user
does that.

39

00:02:44,989  -->  00:02:50,150
For example, is the user standing on a crowded
train while using his smartphone?

40

00:02:50,150  -->  00:02:53,209
Or is he surfing the website at a desk in
the office?

41

00:02:53,209  -->  00:02:59,260
These all affect the interaction between the
user and the product.

42

00:02:59,260  -->  00:03:04,360
Time is the time the user spends interacting
with the first three dimensions.

43

00:03:04,360  -->  00:03:07,349
For example, can users track their progress?

44

00:03:07,349  -->  00:03:10,890
Or resume their interaction sometime later?

45

00:03:10,890  -->  00:03:17,000
Motion and sound play a vital role in providing
visual and audio feedback about user interactions.

46

00:03:17,000  -->  00:03:20,989
It helps users understand changes in an interface.

47

00:03:20,989  -->  00:03:26,750
The fifth dimension 'behavior' was added by
senior interaction designer Kevin Silver.

48

00:03:26,750  -->  00:03:33,170
How do the previous four elements work together
to influence a user's interaction with a product?

49

00:03:33,170  -->  00:03:36,719
Behavior includes both action and reaction.

50

00:03:36,719  -->  00:03:41,269
They are the emotions and reactions that the
user has when interacting with the system.

51

00:03:41,269  -->  00:03:46,650
The behavioral dimension looks at emotional
feedback from users and forms new recommendations

52

00:03:46,650  -->  00:03:49,227
based on feedback to improve the user experience.

53

00:03:50,622  -->  00:03:55,549
Before we delve deeper into the main principles
of interaction design, it is good to explain

54

00:03:55,549  -->  00:03:58,010
the concept of mental models.

55

00:03:58,010  -->  00:03:59,634
Let's start with a definition.

56

00:04:01,155  -->  00:04:06,620
A mental model is an explanation of one's
thought process about how something works

57

00:04:06,620  -->  00:04:08,499
in the real world.

58

00:04:08,499  -->  00:04:13,240
It is a representation of the surrounding
world, the relationships between its different

59

00:04:13,240  -->  00:04:19,470
parts, and a person's intuitive perception
of his own actions and their consequences.

60

00:04:19,470  -->  00:04:25,010
It's an umbrella term for any kind of concept,
framework, or worldview that you carry around

61

00:04:25,010  -->  00:04:26,280
in your head.

62

00:04:26,280  -->  00:04:29,170
Mental models play an important role in interaction
design.

63

00:04:29,170  -->  00:04:32,913
As users take actions based on their mental
models.

64

00:04:33,825  -->  00:04:39,850
Users often form their mental models based
on interactions with existing apps and websites.

65

00:04:39,850  -->  00:04:45,080
Basically, they expect functionality to be
consistent with past experiences.

66

00:04:45,080  -->  00:04:50,120
If you can understand your users' mental models,
you can simulate these models in your designs

67

00:04:50,120  -->  00:04:52,740
to make them more usable and intuitive.

68

00:04:53,545  -->  00:04:58,910
But you can only do this successfully if you
really understand the users' mental models.

69

00:04:58,910  -->  00:05:02,950
Too often designers base their ideas on their
own mental models.

70

00:05:02,950  -->  00:05:06,660
This in turn leads to a user interface failure.

71

00:05:06,660  -->  00:05:11,360
Where the user does not find their mental
model and remains confused and frustrated.

72

00:05:11,360  -->  00:05:15,778
They are likely to go somewhere else where
the environment is aligned with their mental model.

73

00:05:16,820  -->  00:05:21,757
To better understand interaction design, it
is good to look at some important principles.

74

00:05:21,757  -->  00:05:26,720
Bruce Toganazzini, a recognized expert in
human-computer interactions, has created a

75

00:05:26,720  -->  00:05:28,890
widely used set of principles.

76

00:05:28,890  -->  00:05:32,540
There are too many to cover in one lesson.

77

00:05:32,540  -->  00:05:38,240
Some also overlap with topics we've discussed
earlier, such as usability, cognitive

78

00:05:38,240  -->  00:05:40,210
psychology, or visual design.

79

00:05:40,210  -->  00:05:42,210
So I'll highlight the most important ones.

80

00:05:42,210  -->  00:05:44,733
At the bottom of this video, you will find
a link to the full list.

81

00:05:46,020  -->  00:05:49,280
The first element is that of anticipation.

82

00:05:49,280  -->  00:05:53,780
One of Bruce's principles here is "Bring the
user all the information and tools needed

83

00:05:53,780  -->  00:05:56,400
for each step of the process".

84

00:05:56,400  -->  00:06:01,257
This means that systems must try to respond
to the wishes and needs of the user.

85

00:06:02,357  -->  00:06:05,060
Information must be visible.

86

00:06:05,060  -->  00:06:09,030
Don't expect users to leave the current screen
to search for the necessary information on

87

00:06:09,030  -->  00:06:10,680
their own.

88

00:06:10,680  -->  00:06:16,580
If it's on the screen, but users can't find
it, it might as well not be there.

89

00:06:16,580  -->  00:06:21,281
Anticipation requires designers to have a
deep understanding of the user's mental model

90

00:06:21,281  -->  00:06:23,830
to predict what will be needed.

91

00:06:23,830  -->  00:06:28,125
It also requires usability testing to ensure
it achieves its purpose.

92

00:06:29,010  -->  00:06:32,520
Autonomy means that users remain in control.

93

00:06:32,520  -->  00:06:36,690
Users learn and quickly gain a sense of mastery
when "in charge".

94

00:06:36,690  -->  00:06:41,560
Enable users to make their own decisions,
even those that are less efficient.

95

00:06:41,560  -->  00:06:45,830
Taking that kind of control away can leave
users frustrated and angry.

96

00:06:46,956  -->  00:06:52,000
This means, for example, that users can decide
for themselves what kind of device they want

97

00:06:52,000  -->  00:06:53,240
to use.

98

00:06:53,240  -->  00:06:55,020
How they want their desktop to look.

99

00:06:55,020  -->  00:06:56,160
Even if it’s messy.

100

00:06:56,160  -->  00:06:58,860
Or what apps they want to use.

101

00:06:58,860  -->  00:07:02,860
To give users autonomy, they need enough information.

102

00:07:02,860  -->  00:07:07,123
Up-to-date and accurate system status information
is therefore essential.

103

00:07:07,123  -->  00:07:11,710
This is information that users need to respond
to changing circumstances.

104

00:07:11,710  -->  00:07:13,800
Users don't have to search for status information.

105

00:07:13,800  -->  00:07:19,310
One look at the interface should be enough
to understand the state of the system.

106

00:07:19,310  -->  00:07:21,860
Accuracy and honesty are important here.

107

00:07:21,860  -->  00:07:25,710
For example, if software indicates that an
update is required.

108

00:07:25,710  -->  00:07:30,280
If a progress indicator shows that it takes
about five minutes to complete the task, but

109

00:07:30,280  -->  00:07:34,020
is actually an hour, 
a user is feeling lied to.

110

00:07:34,020  -->  00:07:39,350
After all, the user could not predict when
he would be able to use the software again.

111

00:07:39,350  -->  00:07:42,000
Such a user does not feel autonomous.

112

00:07:46,975  -->  00:07:48,560
Next is consistency.

113

00:07:48,560  -->  00:07:53,520
The following four principles avoid disrupting
the areas of consistency that matter most

114

00:07:53,520  -->  00:07:55,590
to the user.

115

00:07:55,590  -->  00:07:59,801
Changing the interpretation of a user's usual
action is one of the worst things you can

116

00:07:59,801  -->  00:08:01,870
do to a user.

117

00:08:01,870  -->  00:08:05,492
Consistency is therefore an important principle
in interaction design.

118

00:08:06,860  -->  00:08:11,860
According to the first principle, the importance
of maintaining strict consistency varies from

119

00:08:11,860  -->  00:08:13,240
level to level.

120

00:08:13,240  -->  00:08:17,360
Like consistency at the highest level, where
you're talking about maintaining the look

121

00:08:17,360  -->  00:08:20,310
and feel of a product or service.

122

00:08:20,310  -->  00:08:24,210
To consistency in small visible and invisible
structures.

123

00:08:24,210  -->  00:08:30,240
For example, think of icons, symbols, buttons,
scroll bars, and so on.

124

00:08:30,240  -->  00:08:34,844
The latter is much more important than consistency
in look and feel.

125

00:08:34,844  -->  00:08:40,000
Users should not have to spend time figuring
out how to scroll or print.

126

00:08:40,000  -->  00:08:45,769
Changes that need a user to unlearn an unconscious
action and learn a new one are extremely frustrating

127

00:08:45,769  -->  00:08:48,010
for users.

128

00:08:48,010  -->  00:08:51,209
So it's important to be consistent when things
work the same.

129

00:08:51,209  -->  00:08:56,370
But it's also important to be inconsistent
when things work differently.

130

00:08:56,370  -->  00:09:00,670
Make objects or pages that have been modified
look different.

131

00:09:00,670  -->  00:09:05,899
If someone comes across an unfamiliar page
on an updated website or in a revised app,

132

00:09:05,899  -->  00:09:07,860
they try to figure out what's different.

133

00:09:08,477  -->  00:09:13,279
If there is no such signal, they will use
the page exactly as they always have.

134

00:09:13,279  -->  00:09:15,860
Which will not work.

135

00:09:15,860  -->  00:09:19,430
Over time, strive for continuity, not consistency.

136

00:09:19,430  -->  00:09:20,670
Products evolve.

137

00:09:20,670  -->  00:09:26,350
For example, a new version of an app will
not be identical to the previous one.

138

00:09:26,350  -->  00:09:29,709
Consistency then makes way for continuity.

139

00:09:29,709  -->  00:09:35,204
Whereby there is a thread that weaves through
different products and releases guiding the users.

140

00:09:35,668  -->  00:09:41,050
But the most important consistency is
consistency with user expectations.

141

00:09:41,050  -->  00:09:45,370
If users expect it to work any other way,
it is doomed to fail.

142

00:09:45,370  -->  00:09:51,345
If your way doesn't offer a clear advantage,
always follow with what your users expect.

143

00:09:52,176  -->  00:09:57,713
So consider carefully which features you make
visible and which you hide depending on the use.

144

00:09:58,360  -->  00:10:03,709
For example, use active discovery to lead
people into more advanced functions.

145

00:10:03,709  -->  00:10:09,641
In its ideal form, your system realizes
that they need it now and offers it to them.

146

00:10:09,641  -->  00:10:14,610
Controls and other objects necessary for the
successful use of the software must be visibly

147

00:10:14,610  -->  00:10:17,370
accessible at all times.

148

00:10:17,370  -->  00:10:22,339
Exceptions can be made on small screens where
it is impractical to display items that are

149

00:10:22,339  -->  00:10:24,468
not currently needed.

150

00:10:25,353  -->  00:10:28,959
Simplicity is certainly important for easy
interactions.

151

00:10:28,959  -->  00:10:33,129
But, hiding functionality to create the illusion
of simplicity is not.

152

00:10:33,129  -->  00:10:36,079
This undermines the user's efficiency.

153

00:10:36,079  -->  00:10:42,639
To figure out what information to communicate,
it's important to run repeated usability tests.

154

00:10:42,639  -->  00:10:47,499
See if they can locate, identify, learn, and
use the tools they need to perform the tasks

155

00:10:47,499  -->  00:10:49,250
you expect your users to do.

156

00:10:50,135  -->  00:10:53,584
If they can't, iterate on the design until
they can.

157

00:10:55,300  -->  00:10:57,749
Provide explorable interfaces.

158

00:10:57,749  -->  00:11:03,430
A single-use application for performing an
unknown task requires a much more direct interface

159

00:11:03,430  -->  00:11:07,420
than a regular-use interface for experts.

160

00:11:07,420  -->  00:11:13,000
The earlier your users are in the experience
curve, the more you need to guide them.

161

00:11:13,000  -->  00:11:19,730
Stable visuals not only allow people to navigate
quickly, they also act as reliable landmarks.

162

00:11:19,730  -->  00:11:24,540
Something as simple as a company logo on every
page allows the user to escape back to the

163

00:11:24,540  -->  00:11:27,959
homepage and feel safe.

164

00:11:27,959  -->  00:11:30,180
Always offer a way out.

165

00:11:30,180  -->  00:11:31,990
Users should never feel trapped in a maze.

166

00:11:31,990  -->  00:11:34,889
They must have a clear path.

167

00:11:34,889  -->  00:11:39,869
Recognizable interfaces also mean that unwanted
actions are reversible.

168

00:11:44,294  -->  00:11:46,779
Next up is Fitts' law.

169

00:11:46,779  -->  00:11:51,240
Fitts' law states that the amount of time
it takes a person to move a pointer, such

170

00:11:51,240  -->  00:11:56,810
as a mouse cursor, to a target area is a function
of the distance to the target divided by the

171

00:11:56,810  -->  00:11:58,311
size of the target.

172

00:11:59,169  -->  00:12:04,839
So the longer the distance and the smaller
the target, the longer it takes.

173

00:12:04,839  -->  00:12:10,200
According to his law, fast movements and small
targets result in greater error rates.

174

00:12:10,200  -->  00:12:14,190
Because of the trade-off between speed and
accuracy.

175

00:12:14,190  -->  00:12:18,930
We use it to assess the appropriate size of
interactive elements.

176

00:12:18,930  -->  00:12:23,839
Based on the context of use and to highlight
potential design usability issues.

177

00:12:23,839  -->  00:12:27,070
Use large objects for important functions.

178

00:12:27,070  -->  00:12:30,610
Use small objects for secondary functions.

179

00:12:30,610  -->  00:12:35,370
While this law may seem obvious at first glance,
it is one of the most neglected principles

180

00:12:35,370  -->  00:12:37,751
in design.

181

00:12:37,751  -->  00:12:43,420
For example, this law affected the convention
to make interactive buttons large.

182

00:12:43,420  -->  00:12:48,819
Especially on touch devices, smaller buttons
are more difficult and time-consuming to click.

183

00:12:48,819  -->  00:12:53,600
According to Fitts' law, standard interface
elements such as the right-click pop-up menu

184

00:12:53,600  -->  00:12:58,040
or short drop-down menus have had resounding
success.

185

00:12:58,040  -->  00:13:03,040
They minimized the user's travel distance
with a mouse when selecting an option.

186

00:13:03,040  -->  00:13:07,160
Reducing time and increasing productivity
as a result.

187

00:13:07,160  -->  00:13:12,110
Human interface objects play an important
role in interaction design.

188

00:13:12,110  -->  00:13:16,059
They are quite well known in graphical user
interfaces.

189

00:13:16,059  -->  00:13:22,368
Examples include folders, documents, email,
buttons, menus, and the recycle bin.

190

00:13:22,368  -->  00:13:28,158
They appear in the user interface and can
refer to the object of an object-oriented program.

191

00:13:29,057  -->  00:13:35,311
Objects on the human interface can be seen,
heard, felt, or otherwise perceived.

192

00:13:35,311  -->  00:13:37,899
They are manipulated in a standard way.

193

00:13:37,899  -->  00:13:43,149
For example, buttons are pressed, sliders
are dragged, and so on.

194

00:13:43,900  -->  00:13:48,360
Human interface objects have default resulting
behavior.

195

00:13:48,360  -->  00:13:54,319
If you drop a document in a trash can, it
will not be deleted, but stored in the trash.

196

00:13:54,319  -->  00:13:59,279
Selecting "Empty Trash" is necessary to actually
delete it.

197

00:13:59,279  -->  00:14:04,965
If placing a document on your delete document
icon immediately and permanently destroys it

198

00:14:04,965  -->  00:14:07,390
don't make it look like a trash can.

199

00:14:07,390  -->  00:14:12,149
This does not correspond to the expectations
about previously found objects.

200

00:14:12,149  -->  00:14:17,029
It is therefore important not to confuse or
weaken such expectations.

201

00:14:17,029  -->  00:14:21,639
Not only is it confusing for your users, but
it is also harmful to any other developer

202

00:14:21,639  -->  00:14:24,578
who uses the trash can icon correctly.

203

00:14:25,839  -->  00:14:32,499
Latency is the delay between a user's action
and a web application's response to that action.

204

00:14:32,499  -->  00:14:37,203
Latency can often be hidden from users through
multitasking techniques.

205

00:14:37,203  -->  00:14:43,189
Allow them to continue with their work
while transmission takes place in the background.

206

00:14:43,189  -->  00:14:47,779
For example, modern web browsers can prefetch
data.

207

00:14:47,779  -->  00:14:51,740
Reducing dead time when the user reaches the
end of a task and has to wait for the next

208

00:14:51,740  -->  00:14:53,196
page to appear.

209

00:14:53,196  -->  00:14:57,290
You can see this, for example, with Netflix
or Youtube videos.

210

00:14:57,290  -->  00:15:02,089
If you can't prevent this, you should notify
users when they experience delays.

211

00:15:02,089  -->  00:15:03,689
And make it faster to start with.

212

00:15:03,689  -->  00:15:06,800
Cut every element of the application that
does not help.

213

00:15:06,800  -->  00:15:08,499
Be ruthless.

214

00:15:09,223  -->  00:15:12,930
Good usability is a fundamental need for interaction
design.

215

00:15:12,930  -->  00:15:19,860
Things like efficiency, error rate, or learnability
have a direct impact on usability.

216

00:15:19,860  -->  00:15:22,699
Ideally, products would have no learning curve.

217

00:15:22,699  -->  00:15:29,600
But in practice, all applications and services,
no matter how simple, will have a learning curve.

218

00:15:30,440  -->  00:15:34,590
Learnability and usability are not mutually
exclusive.

219

00:15:34,590  -->  00:15:36,980
First, determine what is important.

220

00:15:36,980  -->  00:15:41,929
Are you working on a product or service that
will be used only once or rarely?

221

00:15:41,929  -->  00:15:45,679
Or is it a product or service that will be
used a lot?

222

00:15:45,679  -->  00:15:49,029
If it is a one-off, the answer is obvious:
learnability.

223

00:15:49,029  -->  00:15:52,879
If someone is going to use this every day
for the rest of their life, the answer is

224

00:15:52,879  -->  00:15:55,518
equally clear: usability.

225

00:15:56,430  -->  00:15:59,939
What helps in learning is the use of metaphors.

226

00:15:59,939  -->  00:16:04,939
Good metaphors generate in the minds of the
users a strong set of connections to real-world

227

00:16:04,939  -->  00:16:06,709
experiences.

228

00:16:06,709  -->  00:16:11,339
This gives users a quick idea of ​​the
possibilities of the system.

229

00:16:11,339  -->  00:16:15,459
Most metaphors evoke the familiar, but can
also give it a new twist.

230

00:16:15,459  -->  00:16:19,439
For example, an electronic newspaper resembles
a traditional newspaper.

231

00:16:19,439  -->  00:16:23,089
But hyperlinks allow users to quickly dive
into articles.

232

00:16:23,089  -->  00:16:26,276
Which is impossible with the paper counterpart.

233

00:16:26,276  -->  00:16:30,459
There is no need to literally copy an object
from the real world.

234

00:16:30,459  -->  00:16:32,589
Also called skeuomorphism.

235

00:16:32,589  -->  00:16:37,339
In the first versions of the iPhone, the entire
interface was based on this.

236

00:16:37,339  -->  00:16:41,769
Unnecessarily limiting the functionality of
a software counterpart, to perfect the imitation

237

00:16:41,769  -->  00:16:44,560
can also reduce usability.

238

00:16:44,560  -->  00:16:50,943
The inverse of skeuomorphism is an abstraction,
a prominent feature of so-called flat design.

239

00:16:50,943  -->  00:16:56,329
A fashion that took hold in 2013 and turned
once well-understood icons and other elements

240

00:16:56,329  -->  00:17:00,000
into sometimes meaningless abstractions.

241

00:17:00,000  -->  00:17:04,500
It is therefore important to find the right
balance when using a metaphor.

242

00:17:04,500  -->  00:17:07,050
A metaphor is meant to empower your user.

243

00:17:07,050  -->  00:17:10,525
But, there are times when it can hold back
your design.

244

00:17:11,705  -->  00:17:15,700
Many of our browser-based products live in
a stateless environment.

245

00:17:15,700  -->  00:17:19,080
So it's good to maintain the status if possible.

246

00:17:19,080  -->  00:17:21,089
Our systems need to 'know'.

247

00:17:21,089  -->  00:17:25,710
For instance, whether this is the user's first
time entering the system.

248

00:17:25,710  -->  00:17:28,320
Where the user was when they left off in the
last session.

249

00:17:28,320  -->  00:17:31,813
Or the progress they've made since then.

250

00:17:31,813  -->  00:17:34,260
Amazon.com is a good example.

251

00:17:34,260  -->  00:17:39,190
Their suggestions on what we would like to
discover and buy are the result of their understanding

252

00:17:39,190  -->  00:17:42,220
of our full history on their site.

253

00:17:42,220  -->  00:17:46,460
They know what expensive items we've come
back to repeatedly in the past.

254

00:17:46,460  -->  00:17:48,280
Which pages we have visited.

255

00:17:48,280  -->  00:17:54,217
And what would pair well with what we've recently
purchased based on like-minded individuals.

256

00:17:54,217  -->  00:17:58,845
Status information should be saved to the
server when users log out.

257

00:17:58,845  -->  00:18:03,870
Users should be able to log out of work, go
home, and pick up exactly where they left off.

258

00:18:04,209  -->  00:18:06,389
Just like with this online course.

259

00:18:07,462  -->  00:18:11,360
As you have noticed, interaction design is
a very versatile field.

260

00:18:11,360  -->  00:18:16,240
It contains way more than we can cover in one
lesson, and it continues to evolve along with

261

00:18:16,240  -->  00:18:17,490
technology.

262

00:18:17,490  -->  00:18:19,898
Let's recap what we covered in this lesson.

263

00:18:20,998  -->  00:18:26,761
Interaction designers focus on the interaction
between a system and a person using it.

264

00:18:26,761  -->  00:18:30,770
Interaction designers are responsible for
creating every element on the screen that

265

00:18:30,770  -->  00:18:34,940
a user can swipe, click, tap, or type.

266

00:18:34,940  -->  00:18:38,356
In short, the interactions of an experience.

267

00:18:38,839  -->  00:18:45,260
Everything from a button to a link to a form
field is part of interaction design.

268

00:18:45,260  -->  00:18:51,430
Interaction design pays attention to five
dimensions: words, visual representations,

269

00:18:51,430  -->  00:18:56,990
physical objects or space, time, and behavior.

270

00:18:56,990  -->  00:18:58,420
We discussed mental models.

271

00:18:58,420  -->  00:19:03,120
A mental model is an explanation of one's
thought process about how something works

272

00:19:03,120  -->  00:19:05,290
in the real world.

273

00:19:05,290  -->  00:19:08,190
Mental models play an important role in interaction
design.

274

00:19:08,190  -->  00:19:12,760
As users take actions based on their mental
models.

275

00:19:12,760  -->  00:19:16,520
We have covered some important principles
for interaction design.

276

00:19:16,520  -->  00:19:17,630
Anticipation.

277

00:19:17,630  -->  00:19:22,710
This means that systems must try to respond
to the wishes and needs of the user.

278

00:19:22,710  -->  00:19:25,900
Autonomy means that users are in control.

279

00:19:25,900  -->  00:19:31,300
Users quickly learn and gain a sense of mastery
when "the boss".

280

00:19:31,300  -->  00:19:32,470
Consistency.

281

00:19:32,470  -->  00:19:36,181
Changing the interpretation of a user's usual
action is one of the worst things you can

282

00:19:36,181  -->  00:19:38,080
do to a user.

283

00:19:38,080  -->  00:19:42,020
Consistency is therefore an important principle
in interaction design.

284

00:19:42,020  -->  00:19:43,610
Discoverability.

285

00:19:43,610  -->  00:19:49,485
Consider which features you make visible and
which you hide depending on the use.

286

00:19:49,485  -->  00:19:51,490
Provide explorable interfaces.

287

00:19:51,490  -->  00:19:56,940
A single-use application for performing an
unknown task requires a much more direct interface

288

00:19:56,940  -->  00:20:00,760
than a regular-use interface for experts.

289

00:20:00,760  -->  00:20:03,160
Fitt's law.

290

00:20:03,160  -->  00:20:08,240
So the longer the distance and the smaller
the target, the longer it takes.

291

00:20:08,240  -->  00:20:14,010
According to his law, fast moves and small
targets lead to larger error rates.

292

00:20:14,010  -->  00:20:15,385
Latency reduction.

293

00:20:15,385  -->  00:20:21,360
Latency is the delay between a user's action
and a web application's response to that action.

294

00:20:21,360  -->  00:20:26,040
Latency can often be hidden from users through
multitasking techniques.

295

00:20:26,040  -->  00:20:27,500
Learnability.

296

00:20:27,500  -->  00:20:30,540
Ideally, products should have no learning
curve.

297

00:20:30,540  -->  00:20:36,620
But in practice, all applications and services,
no matter how simple, will have a learning curve.

298

00:20:37,860  -->  00:20:40,180
What helps in learning is the use of metaphors.

299

00:20:40,180  -->  00:20:45,440
Good metaphors generate in the minds of the
users a strong set of connections to real-world

300

00:20:45,440  -->  00:20:47,330
experiences.

301

00:20:47,330  -->  00:20:49,880
And last track the user's state.

302

00:20:49,880  -->  00:20:52,810
Many of our browser-based products live in
a stateless environment.

303

00:20:52,810  -->  00:20:55,621
So it's good to keep the status if possible.

304

00:20:57,043  -->  00:21:02,095
