1

00:00:07,609  -->  00:00:11,660
Users' first impressions usually form within
seconds.

2

00:00:11,660  -->  00:00:14,320
If users don't like what they see, they will
leave.

3

00:00:14,320  -->  00:00:19,119
If they have to stop and think about a design,
they won't trust or use it.

4

00:00:19,119  -->  00:00:22,668
Visual design is therefore an essential part
of the user experience.

5

00:00:23,476  -->  00:00:26,660
Visual design stems from the field 
of graphic design.

6

00:00:26,660  -->  00:00:29,310
It focuses on aesthetics and usability.

7

00:00:29,310  -->  00:00:35,230
With graphics, typography, space, layout,
color, and more.

8

00:00:35,230  -->  00:00:37,309
But it's about more than aesthetics.

9

00:00:37,309  -->  00:00:41,830
Visual design is all about making an interactive
user experience engaging.

10

00:00:41,830  -->  00:00:45,369
And involves much more than just adding colors
to a wireframe.

11

00:00:46,190  -->  00:00:49,910
The purpose of this lesson is not to make
you a visual designer.

12

00:00:49,910  -->  00:00:55,080
It covers the basics of the visual design
process within a UX project.

13

00:00:55,080  -->  00:00:59,510
Learning these foundations will also help
you collaborate better with the visual designers

14

00:00:59,510  -->  00:01:00,893
on your team.

15

00:01:00,893  -->  00:01:04,059
So let's dive into the world of visual design.

16

00:01:05,346  -->  00:01:09,330
We are going to discuss elements and principles.

17

00:01:09,330  -->  00:01:11,509
Elements are things you use to design an interface.

18

00:01:11,509  -->  00:01:13,767
The building blocks.

19

00:01:13,767  -->  00:01:17,680
Principles are the rules you must follow to
design a good interface.

20

00:01:17,680  -->  00:01:19,391
The building methods.

21

00:01:20,459  -->  00:01:26,356
Lines connect two points and are useful for
defining shapes and dividing space.

22

00:01:26,356  -->  00:01:29,870
They can range from straight to curved.

23

00:01:29,870  -->  00:01:37,777
They can be dotted, broken, horizontal, vertical,
or diagonal.

24

00:01:38,352  -->  00:01:41,570
Thick, or thin.

25

00:01:41,570  -->  00:01:48,670
Typography refers to which fonts are chosen,
their size, alignment, color, and spacing.

26

00:01:48,670  -->  00:01:52,979
It improves readability and should reflect
the content

27

00:01:52,979  -->  00:01:59,770
Shapes are defined by boundaries such as lines
or colors to create self-contained areas.

28

00:01:59,770  -->  00:02:07,520
These can be organic or geometric, such as
squares, triangles, or circles.

29

00:02:07,520  -->  00:02:12,200
Form is when an element is three-dimensional
and encloses volume.

30

00:02:12,200  -->  00:02:16,250
It includes height, width, and depth.

31

00:02:16,250  -->  00:02:19,040
You create form by combining two or more shapes.

32

00:02:19,040  -->  00:02:24,910
It can be further enhanced by using different
tones, textures, and colors.

33

00:02:24,910  -->  00:02:28,090
Size refers to the actual dimensions of an
element.

34

00:02:28,090  -->  00:02:31,870
You can use scale to emphasize an element
or area.

35

00:02:31,870  -->  00:02:34,843
Value is how light or dark an element looks.

36

00:02:34,843  -->  00:02:41,260
You use value to create a pattern, draw attention,
emphasize an element or create the illusion

37

00:02:41,260  -->  00:02:42,840
of depth.

38

00:02:42,840  -->  00:02:45,989
For example with shadows and highlights.

39

00:02:45,989  -->  00:02:50,122
Texture refers to how a surface feels or how
an element looks.

40

00:02:50,122  -->  00:02:53,510
They are used to create a more three-dimensional
look.

41

00:02:53,510  -->  00:02:57,480
For example, you can create texture by adding
a pattern.

42

00:02:57,480  -->  00:03:01,740
Depending on how a texture is applied, it
can be used strategically to attract or deter

43

00:03:01,740  -->  00:03:04,120
attention.

44

00:03:04,120  -->  00:03:08,470
Space is the area around or between elements
in the design.

45

00:03:08,470  -->  00:03:12,050
Related elements are placed together to show
unity.

46

00:03:12,050  -->  00:03:15,950
Including space in a design helps reduce noise
and improve readability.

47

00:03:15,950  -->  00:03:20,709
And is an important part of a layout strategy.

48

00:03:20,709  -->  00:03:27,947
Color is used to evoke emotions, distinguish
items, create depth, emphasize and organize information.

49

00:03:29,140  -->  00:03:31,465
But color is not just color.

50

00:03:31,465  -->  00:03:35,530
It’s a very powerful and influential tool
in user interface design.

51

00:03:35,530  -->  00:03:38,890
Let's look at the different aspects of color
in more detail.

52

00:03:39,520  -->  00:03:43,300
First, a short introduction to how colors
work.

53

00:03:43,300  -->  00:03:45,830
Light contains all colors of the color spectrum.

54

00:03:45,830  -->  00:03:49,620
Each color represents a different wavelength
of light.

55

00:03:49,620  -->  00:03:52,750
And each object absorbs different wavelengths
of color.

56

00:03:53,653  -->  00:03:58,030
In this example, the tomato absorbs all wavelengths
of light from the sun.

57

00:03:58,030  -->  00:04:00,960
Except for the wavelength which is the color
of the object.

58

00:04:00,960  -->  00:04:03,100
In this case red.

59

00:04:03,100  -->  00:04:07,980
If an object does not absorb any of the light
wavelengths but instead reflects it.

60

00:04:07,980  -->  00:04:10,503
The object will appear white.

61

00:04:10,503  -->  00:04:15,160
If an object absorbs all light wavelengths,
all colors will disappear.

62

00:04:15,160  -->  00:04:17,437
The object will appear black.

63

00:04:18,970  -->  00:04:25,129
The foundation of color theory is based on
the color wheel, a circular diagram of 12 colors.

64

00:04:25,589  -->  00:04:31,410
The wheel was developed in 1966 by the well-known
English scientist Sir Isaac Newton.

65

00:04:31,410  -->  00:04:35,802
It consists of primary and secondary colors.

66

00:04:35,802  -->  00:04:38,190
The primary colors are red, yellow, and blue.

67

00:04:38,190  -->  00:04:43,699
The secondary colors are a mix of two primary
colors.

68

00:04:43,699  -->  00:04:48,389
Together they create green, orange, and purple,
as shown in the following image.

69

00:04:48,389  -->  00:04:54,889
Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary
and secondary colors.

70

00:04:54,889  -->  00:05:00,870
The color wheel can be divided into two main
sections: warm colors and cool colors.

71

00:05:00,870  -->  00:05:07,900
Warm colors are energetic and consist of red,
yellow, orange, or a mixture of these colors.

72

00:05:07,900  -->  00:05:14,311
While cool colors are calm and consist of
blue, green, and purple, or a mixture of these color.

73

00:05:15,379  -->  00:05:20,279
When designing the user interface of a website,
it is important to use a good balance between

74

00:05:20,279  -->  00:05:22,620
warm and cool colors in your design.

75

00:05:22,921  -->  00:05:28,760
White, black and gray are considered neutral
colors and do not fall into the warm or cool category.

76

00:05:30,260  -->  00:05:33,909
It is good to know that color does not have 
the same effect on everyone.

77

00:05:33,909  -->  00:05:40,207
Age, gender, and culture are all factors that
affect how people perceive color.

78

00:05:40,207  -->  00:05:46,377
Colors can even have conflicting meanings
in different contexts, countries, or cultures.

79

00:05:46,377  -->  00:05:51,192
So if you’re working with a specific target
market it is important to do user research.

80

00:05:52,479  -->  00:05:56,455
It is normal to look at a color and subconsciously
judge it.

81

00:05:56,455  -->  00:06:01,430
If a person sees a red light and perceives
it as a danger, the person will take action

82

00:06:01,430  -->  00:06:03,809
to avoid the situation.

83

00:06:03,809  -->  00:06:07,259
A person's decisions are automatically influenced
by color.

84

00:06:07,259  -->  00:06:11,301
Color can even lead a person to buy one product
over another.

85

00:06:12,000  -->  00:06:15,349
Color also plays an important role in accessibility.

86

00:06:15,349  -->  00:06:18,550
Which we discussed in the lesson before.

87

00:06:18,550  -->  00:06:21,500
Certain color combinations are also hard on
the eyes.

88

00:06:21,500  -->  00:06:26,699
When lines or text of different colors are
projected or printed, the depth of the lines

89

00:06:26,699  -->  00:06:28,229
may differ.

90

00:06:28,229  -->  00:06:32,243
One color may pop out, while another may appear
sunken.

91

00:06:32,900  -->  00:06:37,710
As you can see in this visual illusion whereby
the impression of depth is conveyed.

92

00:06:37,710  -->  00:06:41,479
The effect is strongest with red and blue,
and red and green.

93

00:06:41,479  -->  00:06:46,218
These color combinations can be difficult
and exhausting to look at or read.

94

00:06:47,176  -->  00:06:49,119
These were the design elements.

95

00:06:49,119  -->  00:06:52,503
The other important aspect to consider are
the visual design principles.

96

00:06:52,503  -->  00:06:59,139
They tell us how the design elements we discussed
go together, to create user-friendly interfaces.

97

00:06:59,139  -->  00:07:03,659
A successful visual design applies the following
principles:

98

00:07:03,659  -->  00:07:06,469
Balance
Unity

99

00:07:06,469  -->  00:07:09,770
Contrast
Scale

100

00:07:09,770  -->  00:07:13,038
Hierarchy
And Gestalt principles

101

00:07:14,270  -->  00:07:20,719
The principle of balance refers to the even
distribution of elements within a design composition.

102

00:07:20,719  -->  00:07:25,319
As with weight balancing, the design would
feel a bit unbalanced if you had one small

103

00:07:25,319  -->  00:07:30,590
design element and one large design element
facing each other.

104

00:07:30,590  -->  00:07:35,699
The area occupied by the design element matters
in creating balance.

105

00:07:35,699  -->  00:07:37,490
Not the number of elements.

106

00:07:37,490  -->  00:07:41,488
This does not necessarily mean that there
is always symmetry.

107

00:07:41,488  -->  00:07:43,693
Balance can be symmetrical.

108

00:07:43,693  -->  00:07:49,499
The elements are symmetrically
distributed along the central imaginary axis.

109

00:07:49,499  -->  00:07:52,070
This is silent and static.

110

00:07:52,070  -->  00:07:58,699
Asymmetrical means that the elements are distributed
asymmetrically along the central axis.

111

00:07:58,699  -->  00:08:00,729
This is dynamic and captivating.

112

00:08:00,729  -->  00:08:04,207
It creates a sense of energy and movement.

113

00:08:05,302  -->  00:08:10,975
Unity brings harmony between page elements
so that they seem to belong together.

114

00:08:11,085  -->  00:08:15,080
Elements look united when you stress their
similarities.

115

00:08:15,080  -->  00:08:17,838
Even if they are not exactly the same.

116

00:08:17,838  -->  00:08:24,654
Visual design must strike a balance between
unity and variety to avoid a boring or overwhelming design.

117

00:08:25,657  -->  00:08:29,789
Contrast is a common principle that makes
certain parts of a design stand out.

118

00:08:29,789  -->  00:08:37,789
You can do this by emphasizing differences
in size, color, direction, or other features.

119

00:08:37,789  -->  00:08:41,899
Contrast is especially important if you want
to show that elements have different functions

120

00:08:41,899  -->  00:08:44,259
or belong in different categories.

121

00:08:45,381  -->  00:08:49,680
The principle of contrast is often applied
through color.

122

00:08:49,680  -->  00:08:54,719
For example, red is often used in UI designs
to signify deletion.

123

00:08:54,719  -->  00:09:00,166
The contrasting color indicates that one red
element is different from the rest.

124

00:09:00,166  -->  00:09:04,550
It's good to know that not all users perceive
contrast in the same way.

125

00:09:04,550  -->  00:09:07,149
It's a perception.

126

00:09:07,149  -->  00:09:11,970
Contrast sensitivity in humans refers to the
ability to detect subtle differences in shade

127

00:09:11,970  -->  00:09:14,290
and patterns.

128

00:09:14,290  -->  00:09:17,268
This changes throughout our lives as we get
older.

129

00:09:17,460  -->  00:09:21,480
It can also be affected by various health
conditions or medications.

130

00:09:21,480  -->  00:09:26,880
So be careful when using contrast to make
sure it still meets accessibility standards.

131

00:09:28,057  -->  00:09:30,000
A few examples:

132

00:09:30,000  -->  00:09:33,657
This image is from a test for color vision
deficiency.

133

00:09:33,657  -->  00:09:35,269
Do you see a number?

134

00:09:35,269  -->  00:09:38,259
And what number do you see?

135

00:09:38,259  -->  00:09:44,932
If you can see the number 74, you have normal
color vision, but this is only one part of the test.

136

00:09:45,056  -->  00:09:49,640
If you can see 21, you may have a red-green
color vision deficiency.

137

00:09:50,488  -->  00:09:55,069
Research has shown that even people with normal
color vision experience a decline in their

138

00:09:55,069  -->  00:09:59,663
contrast perception and color sensitivity
as they age.

139

00:09:59,663  -->  00:10:04,599
This means that not all users perceive contrast
in the same way.

140

00:10:05,256  -->  00:10:10,990
Contrast can also be affected by contextual
factors, such as the context of nearby colors

141

00:10:10,990  -->  00:10:14,629
and other features of a design or image.

142

00:10:14,629  -->  00:10:17,649
For example, take a look at this image.

143

00:10:17,649  -->  00:10:19,860
Which of the two boxes is darker?

144

00:10:19,860  -->  00:10:22,279
A or B?

145

00:10:23,511  -->  00:10:28,759
The truth is that tile A and tile B are identical.

146

00:10:28,759  -->  00:10:31,240
Yet one is often experienced as lighter than
the other.

147

00:10:31,240  -->  00:10:35,879
This illusion works because of the way our
brains process information about contrast

148

00:10:35,879  -->  00:10:37,259
and shadows.

149

00:10:37,259  -->  00:10:41,810
To determine the color of objects, we use
relative color and shading.

150

00:10:43,370  -->  00:10:45,510
You can also see it in this optical illusion.

151

00:10:45,510  -->  00:10:51,480
In this example, the same colored object is
seen as a lighter or darker gray, depending

152

00:10:51,480  -->  00:10:57,103
on the background color, while both circles
are actually the exact same shade of gray.

153

00:10:58,415  -->  00:11:01,375
Scale identifies a range of sizes.

154

00:11:01,375  -->  00:11:06,339
It shows how each item compares to the other
based on size.

155

00:11:06,339  -->  00:11:10,279
Applying this principle, the most important
elements in a design are greater than the

156

00:11:10,279  -->  00:11:13,360
less important ones.

157

00:11:13,360  -->  00:11:18,959
The reason behind this principle is simple:
if something is big, it's more likely to be noticed.

158

00:11:19,670  -->  00:11:25,649
Make sure to emphasize the most important
aspect of your design by making them the largest.

159

00:11:25,649  -->  00:11:30,269
When the scaling principle is used correctly
and the right elements are emphasized, users

160

00:11:30,269  -->  00:11:33,666
will easily parse the interface and know how
to use it.

161

00:11:35,172  -->  00:11:37,610
The next principle is visual hierarchy.

162

00:11:37,610  -->  00:11:39,935
To understand this take a look at this image.

163

00:11:47,611  -->  00:11:49,088
Funny, right?

164

00:11:49,088  -->  00:11:52,470
Chances are you have read 
the text in this order.

165

00:11:52,470  -->  00:11:54,410
This is due to the visual hierarchy.

166

00:11:54,410  -->  00:11:58,950
The principle of visual hierarchy refers to
guiding the eye on the page.

167

00:11:58,950  -->  00:12:04,379
So that it pays attention to different design
elements in the order of their importance.

168

00:12:04,379  -->  00:12:06,620
By adjusting various properties of these elements.

169

00:12:06,620  -->  00:12:10,629
Such as their relative size, color, or grouping.

170

00:12:10,629  -->  00:12:15,364
The way you organize information has a major
impact on how users experience the product.

171

00:12:15,802  -->  00:12:20,899
A layout with a good visual hierarchy will
be easily understood by your users.

172

00:12:20,899  -->  00:12:25,620
If you're having a hard time determining where
to look on a page, it's more than likely that

173

00:12:25,620  -->  00:12:29,480
the layout doesn't have a clear visual hierarchy.

174

00:12:29,480  -->  00:12:32,590
That's why it's so important that your designs
have a clear visual hierarchy.

175

00:12:32,590  -->  00:12:37,470
This allows you to control how your experience
is delivered to the user.

176

00:12:38,237  -->  00:12:40,940
Finally, there are the Gestalt principles.

177

00:12:40,940  -->  00:12:44,730
Established by German psychologists in the
early twentieth century.

178

00:12:44,730  -->  00:12:47,880
And are an essential part of visual design.

179

00:12:47,880  -->  00:12:51,818
These principles describe how your brain handles
visual information.

180

00:12:52,721  -->  00:12:57,149
Our brains are built to see structure and
patterns so that we can better understand

181

00:12:57,149  -->  00:12:59,284
the environment we live in.

182

00:12:59,284  -->  00:13:05,420
Gestalt theory is based on the idea that the
human brain will try to simplify complex designs

183

00:13:05,420  -->  00:13:07,980
made up of many elements.

184

00:13:07,980  -->  00:13:12,660
You can use these principles to determine
how users interpret your design.

185

00:13:12,660  -->  00:13:17,833
There are six individual principles commonly
associated with gestalt theory:

186

00:13:17,833  -->  00:13:22,430
Similarity
Continuation

187

00:13:22,430  -->  00:13:26,042
Closure
Proximity

188

00:13:26,782  -->  00:13:31,349
Figure/ground and
symmetry &amp; order

189

00:13:32,499  -->  00:13:35,300
The first Gestalt principle is similarity.

190

00:13:35,300  -->  00:13:39,399
It's in human nature to group similar things
together.

191

00:13:39,399  -->  00:13:42,770
The squares here are all equally spaced and
the same size.

192

00:13:42,770  -->  00:13:49,430
But our brains automatically group them by
color even when there's no reason to.

193

00:13:49,430  -->  00:13:53,040
Similar elements are grouped regardless of
their proximity to each other.

194

00:13:53,888  -->  00:13:58,620
Similarity is used to connect elements that
should not be next to each other in a design.

195

00:13:59,113  -->  00:14:04,860
In UX design, using similarity makes it clear
to your users which items are similar.

196

00:14:04,860  -->  00:14:08,496
With the aim of helping them to learn the
interface faster.

197

00:14:09,920  -->  00:14:14,130
For example, a list of features that use repeating
design elements.

198

00:14:14,130  -->  00:14:18,470
Like an icon with a few lines of text as you
can see in this example from Airbnb.

199

00:14:19,647  -->  00:14:23,170
The equality principle makes it easier to
browse.

200

00:14:23,170  -->  00:14:26,990
Of course, you can also make things different
if you want to make them stand out.

201

00:14:26,990  -->  00:14:31,120
That's why call-to-action buttons are often
designed in a different color.

202

00:14:31,120  -->  00:14:34,410
So that they draw the visitor's attention
to the desired action.

203

00:14:35,779  -->  00:14:42,000
The law of continuity states that the human
eye will follow the smoothest path when viewing lines.

204

00:14:42,284  -->  00:14:45,642
Regardless of how the lines are actually drawn.

205

00:14:45,642  -->  00:14:50,600
This continuation can be a valuable resource
when the goal is to direct a visitor's gaze

206

00:14:50,600  -->  00:14:52,149
in a particular direction.

207

00:14:53,600  -->  00:14:58,449
In this example, the eye tends to follow the
straight line from one end of this figure

208

00:14:58,449  -->  00:14:59,949
to the other.

209

00:14:59,949  -->  00:15:02,920
And the curved line from top to bottom.

210

00:15:02,920  -->  00:15:05,631
Even if the lines change color halfway through.

211

00:15:05,631  -->  00:15:10,629
Since the eye naturally follows a line, placing
items in a sequence in a line will draw the

212

00:15:10,629  -->  00:15:13,263
eye from one item to another.

213

00:15:14,932  -->  00:15:19,319
Closure is the idea that your brain fills
in the missing parts of a design or image

214

00:15:19,319  -->  00:15:21,410
to create a whole.

215

00:15:21,410  -->  00:15:22,629
Look at these examples.

216

00:15:22,629  -->  00:15:27,160
Your brain sees a triangle, a square, and
a star.

217

00:15:27,160  -->  00:15:30,010
While there aren't any.

218

00:15:30,010  -->  00:15:36,009
Closure is used quite often in logo design,
such as the one for the World Wildlife Fund.

219

00:15:36,009  -->  00:15:39,060
Large parts of the outline for the panda are
missing.

220

00:15:39,060  -->  00:15:43,809
But your brain has no problem filling in the
missing parts to see the whole animal.

221

00:15:43,809  -->  00:15:50,069
Another example is when you show a partial
image that fades from the user's screen.

222

00:15:50,069  -->  00:15:54,720
To let them know that there is more to find
if they swipe left or right.

223

00:15:54,720  -->  00:15:59,437
Without a partial image, the brain doesn't
immediately get that there may be more to see.

224

00:16:00,160  -->  00:16:04,468
Now the user knows they can scroll or swipe
to see more.

225

00:16:05,819  -->  00:16:10,410
The distance between two objects creates the
feeling that those objects may or may not

226

00:16:10,410  -->  00:16:12,146
be related.

227

00:16:12,146  -->  00:16:15,009
That distance is called proximity.

228

00:16:15,009  -->  00:16:17,279
We group elements that are closer together.

229

00:16:17,279  -->  00:16:21,319
And separate them from the elements that are
further apart.

230

00:16:21,319  -->  00:16:26,439
So when you cluster individual elements into
one area or group in your design.

231

00:16:26,439  -->  00:16:31,319
Users will recognize it as one entity that
stands out from everything else on the screen.

232

00:16:32,880  -->  00:16:35,519
The opposite is of course also true.

233

00:16:35,519  -->  00:16:40,040
Placing space between elements allows you
to add separation.

234

00:16:40,040  -->  00:16:43,115
Even if their other characteristics are the
same.

235

00:16:43,115  -->  00:16:45,699
Take, for example, this group of circles.

236

00:16:45,699  -->  00:16:50,360
The only thing that distinguishes the group
on the left from the one on the right is the

237

00:16:50,360  -->  00:16:51,610
distance.

238

00:16:51,610  -->  00:16:56,561
And yet your brain interprets the picture
on the right as three different groups.

239

00:16:57,218  -->  00:17:02,870
In UX design, proximity is usually used to
let users group certain things without using

240

00:17:02,870  -->  00:17:05,569
things as hard boundaries.

241

00:17:05,569  -->  00:17:10,040
By placing similar things closer together,
with space between each group, the viewer

242

00:17:10,040  -->  00:17:14,490
will immediately pick up on the organization
and structure you want them to see.

243

00:17:15,229  -->  00:17:20,990
The figure-ground principle states that people
instinctively perceive objects as in the foreground

244

00:17:20,990  -->  00:17:23,250
or in the background.

245

00:17:23,250  -->  00:17:28,209
When people use a website or mobile app, one
of the first things they do on a screen is

246

00:17:28,209  -->  00:17:31,559
determine which is the figure and which is
the ground.

247

00:17:32,380  -->  00:17:36,070
Your brain will distinguish between the objects
it considers to be in the foreground of an

248

00:17:36,070  -->  00:17:38,100
image, the figure.

249

00:17:38,100  -->  00:17:41,318
And the background, the area on which the
figures rest.

250

00:17:41,318  -->  00:17:45,040
In general, your brain will interpret the
larger area of ​​an image as the ground

251

00:17:45,040  -->  00:17:48,220
and the smaller area as the figure.

252

00:17:48,220  -->  00:17:53,620
Where it gets interesting is when the foreground
and background actually contain two different

253

00:17:53,620  -->  00:17:54,620
images.

254

00:17:54,620  -->  00:17:59,676
Like the figure you’re looking at right
now, also known as Rubin's Vase.

255

00:17:59,676  -->  00:18:01,169
What do you see?

256

00:18:01,169  -->  00:18:03,920
Two faces or a vase?

257

00:18:03,920  -->  00:18:08,610
In this famous illusion, developed by the
Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin, the viewer

258

00:18:08,610  -->  00:18:14,649
is presented with two interpretations of the
form: two faces or a vase.

259

00:18:14,649  -->  00:18:17,590
An excellent example of the figure/ground
principle.

260

00:18:18,274  -->  00:18:21,429
Another example is this logo for the 
Pittsburgh Zoo.

261

00:18:21,429  -->  00:18:23,340
What do you see?

262

00:18:23,340  -->  00:18:27,240
Some people will immediately notice the tree
and birds.

263

00:18:27,240  -->  00:18:31,810
While others will see the gorilla and lion
staring at each other.

264

00:18:31,810  -->  00:18:37,240
In UX design, the figure/ground principle
can be very useful when you want to emphasize

265

00:18:37,240  -->  00:18:38,980
a focal point.

266

00:18:38,980  -->  00:18:41,510
Especially when it's active or in use.

267

00:18:41,510  -->  00:18:47,350
For example when a modal window pops up and
the rest of the site fades into the background.

268

00:18:47,350  -->  00:18:51,559
When you use figure/ground correctly, you
help users with their tasks and reduce their

269

00:18:51,559  -->  00:18:53,980
cognitive load.

270

00:18:53,980  -->  00:19:00,460
The law of symmetry and order is also known
as prägnanz, the German word for 'good figure'.

271

00:19:00,460  -->  00:19:05,080
What this principle says is that your brain
will perceive ambiguous shapes in the simplest

272

00:19:05,080  -->  00:19:07,160
possible way.

273

00:19:07,160  -->  00:19:13,823
For example, a monochrome version of the Olympic
logo is seen as a series of overlapping circles.

274

00:19:13,823  -->  00:19:16,441
Rather than a collection of curved lines.

275

00:19:17,809  -->  00:19:22,100
Here's another great example of this gestalt
design principle.

276

00:19:22,100  -->  00:19:27,960
Your brain will interpret the image on the
left as a rectangle, circle, and triangle.

277

00:19:27,960  -->  00:19:32,860
Even if the outlines of each are incomplete,
as these are simpler shapes than the general image.

278

00:19:34,570  -->  00:19:37,230
So much for the introduction to visual design.

279

00:19:37,230  -->  00:19:40,740
Let's summarize what we discussed in this
lesson.

280

00:19:40,740  -->  00:19:45,140
We started by distinguishing elements and
principles.

281

00:19:45,140  -->  00:19:47,600
Elements are things you use to design an interface.

282

00:19:47,600  -->  00:19:48,940
The building blocks.

283

00:19:48,940  -->  00:19:59,460
For example, lines, shapes, space, value,
size, texture, typography, and color.

284

00:19:59,460  -->  00:20:02,750
We looked at the different aspects of color
and found that color doesn't have the same

285

00:20:02,750  -->  00:20:04,140
effect on everyone.

286

00:20:04,140  -->  00:20:09,940
Age, gender, and culture are all factors that
affect how people perceive color.

287

00:20:09,940  -->  00:20:11,890
Next, we covered principles.

288

00:20:11,890  -->  00:20:14,360
The rules to follow to design a good interface.

289

00:20:14,360  -->  00:20:16,201
The building methods.

290

00:20:16,694  -->  00:20:18,253
First, there is balance.

291

00:20:18,308  -->  00:20:22,780
The kind of balance you use in your visualization
depends on what you want to convey.

292

00:20:22,780  -->  00:20:26,309
Symmetry, for example, is silent and static.

293

00:20:26,309  -->  00:20:30,741
While asymmetry gives a sense of energy and
movement.

294

00:20:30,741  -->  00:20:36,610
Unity brings harmony between page elements
so that they seem to belong together.

295

00:20:36,610  -->  00:20:41,435
Contrast is a common principle that makes
certain parts of a design stand out.

296

00:20:41,572  -->  00:20:49,002
You do this by emphasizing differences in
size, color, direction, or other characteristics.

297

00:20:49,002  -->  00:20:51,580
Scale identifies a range of sizes.

298

00:20:51,580  -->  00:20:56,850
It shows how each item compares to the other
based on size

299

00:20:56,850  -->  00:21:01,480
The principle of visual hierarchy refers to
guiding the eye on the page.

300

00:21:01,480  -->  00:21:04,610
By adjusting different properties of these
elements.

301

00:21:04,610  -->  00:21:08,010
Such as their relative size, color, or grouping.

302

00:21:08,640  -->  00:21:11,539
Finally, we discussed the Gestalt theory.

303

00:21:11,539  -->  00:21:16,470
Based on the idea that the human brain will
try to simplify complex designs made up of

304

00:21:16,470  -->  00:21:18,110
many elements.

305

00:21:18,110  -->  00:21:22,316
You can use these principles to determine
how users interpret your design.

306

00:21:23,110  -->  00:21:26,570
And with this we come to the end of this course.

307
