1

00:00:06,720  -->  00:00:12,547
One of the best ways to understand if an idea&nbsp;
will work is to do some form of prototyping.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:12,720  -->  00:00:18,560
Prototyping offers the opportunity to bring ideas&nbsp;
to life through a low-cost and scaled-down version&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:18,560  -->  00:00:23,262
of a product. To then test the feasibility&nbsp;
and investigate how users think about it.&nbsp;

4

00:00:24,320  -->  00:00:27,600
Simply put, a prototype is a&nbsp;
scaled-down version of your product;&nbsp;&nbsp;

5

00:00:28,240  -->  00:00:32,240
a simulation or sample version that&nbsp;
allows you to test your ideas and&nbsp;&nbsp;

6

00:00:32,240  -->  00:00:37,225
designs before investing time and money&nbsp;
in the actual development of the product.

7

00:00:37,600  -->  00:00:42,800
Prototypes come in all shapes and sizes,&nbsp;
ranging from simple paper models to&nbsp;&nbsp;

8

00:00:42,800  -->  00:00:45,680
fully functional, interactive digital prototypes.

9

00:00:46,800  -->  00:00:51,120
For example, when developing software,&nbsp;
a design team can create a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

10

00:00:51,120  -->  00:00:55,840
paper prototypes. When you design an&nbsp;
app, you can create a digital prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:00:55,840  -->  00:00:59,840
Or when developing tangible&nbsp;
devices, such as the computer mouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

12

00:00:59,840  -->  00:01:04,000
designers can use 3D printing technology&nbsp;
to create a low-cost prototype.&nbsp;

13

00:01:05,600  -->  00:01:11,840
Tim Brown, CEO of international design&nbsp;
and innovation company IDEO, said it best:&nbsp;

14

00:01:11,840  -->  00:01:17,520
“They slow us down to speed us up. By taking&nbsp;
the time to prototype our ideas, we avoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

15

00:01:17,520  -->  00:01:23,948
costly mistakes such as becoming too complex too&nbsp;
early and sticking with a weak idea for too long.”&nbsp;

16

00:01:25,600  -->  00:01:29,360
Prototyping is an extremely valuable&nbsp;
step in the design thinking process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:01:30,400  -->  00:01:32,400
Prototypes can help you to:

18

00:01:32,400  -->  00:01:36,880
Test whether there is a market for your&nbsp;
idea. If an idea or design is doomed to fail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:36,880  -->  00:01:41,793
you'd rather find out early on before&nbsp;
spending time and money developing it.

20

00:01:42,160  -->  00:01:46,880
Identify any usability issues or design&nbsp;
flaws, before they go out into the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

21

00:01:46,880  -->  00:01:52,400
and into the hands of your users. Does the&nbsp;
design work as you intended? Does it solve&nbsp;&nbsp;

22

00:01:52,400  -->  00:01:58,580
the user's problem exactly as planned?&nbsp;
Is it user-friendly and intuitive?

23

00:01:58,960  -->  00:02:02,985
Prototyping also helps you&nbsp;
make informed design decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:02:03,120  -->  00:02:08,640
Can't decide where to put a certain button on your&nbsp;
app's home screen? Are you hesitating between two&nbsp;&nbsp;

25

00:02:08,640  -->  00:02:15,535
different layouts for your website? Test out a few&nbsp;
prototype versions and see which one works best.

26

00:02:16,320  -->  00:02:22,480
Testing a tangible product. No matter how thorough&nbsp;
your UX research is, many people find it difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

27

00:02:22,480  -->  00:02:28,720
to really conceptualize a product until they&nbsp;
have it in front of them. Prototypes allow you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:02:28,720  -->  00:02:33,600
iterate, refine, rework, and make improvements&nbsp;
until you have a market-ready product.

29

00:02:34,480  -->  00:02:39,675
There are different types of prototypes. They&nbsp;
can vary in shape, interactivity and fidelity.

30

00:02:40,640  -->  00:02:43,760
Shape means: is it a hand drawn prototype,&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:02:43,760  -->  00:02:48,020
a digital prototype or maybe&nbsp;
a physical 3d printed version?

32

00:02:48,720  -->  00:02:52,880
Interactivity means how functional&nbsp;
is the prototype? Can the user click&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:02:52,880  -->  00:02:55,716
or interact with it, or is it read-only?

34

00:02:56,640  -->  00:03:02,320
How detailed and polished is the prototype?&nbsp;
Fidelity describes how similar the prototype is&nbsp;&nbsp;

35

00:03:02,320  -->  00:03:07,200
to the final product. Whether it is an accurate&nbsp;
representation of the final product, or more of&nbsp;&nbsp;

36

00:03:07,200  -->  00:03:12,880
a basic model at an early stage. Prototyping&nbsp;
methods can be divided into two categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;

37

00:03:13,440  -->  00:03:16,000
low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping.

38

00:03:16,800  -->  00:03:22,160
Here's an example of what a single app prototype&nbsp;
would look like from low- to high-fidelity.

39

00:03:23,440  -->  00:03:28,960
While hi-fi prototypes can help the design team&nbsp;
gain valuable insights into how the product will&nbsp;&nbsp;

40

00:03:28,960  -->  00:03:34,400
be received when distributed, the production&nbsp;
of hi-fi prototypes can be time-consuming and&nbsp;&nbsp;

41

00:03:34,400  -->  00:03:39,620
have the potential to significantly slow&nbsp;
down a project if changes need to be made.&nbsp;

42

00:03:39,920  -->  00:03:44,531
So how do you know if you should use&nbsp;
a low- or high-fidelity prototype?&nbsp;&nbsp;

43

00:03:44,720  -->  00:03:47,398
It all depends on what you&nbsp;
want to achieve with it.&nbsp;

44

00:03:48,560  -->  00:03:54,160
Low-fidelity prototyping involves the use of basic&nbsp;
models or samples of the product being tested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45

00:03:55,200  -->  00:04:01,280
Low-fidelity prototypes can be either models that&nbsp;
are cheap and easy to make, or simply stories or&nbsp;&nbsp;

46

00:04:01,280  -->  00:04:07,040
visualizations of them. Low-fidelity prototypes&nbsp;
are ideal if you want to quickly test broad&nbsp;&nbsp;

47

00:04:07,040  -->  00:04:13,280
concepts. They are fast, inexpensive and&nbsp;
highly collaborative. They do not require&nbsp;&nbsp;

48

00:04:13,280  -->  00:04:19,440
advanced design skills, so people of different&nbsp;
expertise can easily be involved. As a rule,&nbsp;&nbsp;

49

00:04:19,440  -->  00:04:24,160
low-fidelity prototypes keep content and&nbsp;
image to a minimum, presenting only the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

50

00:04:24,160  -->  00:04:29,920
important elements as basic shapes to convey&nbsp;
visual hierarchy. Low-fi prototypes are also&nbsp;&nbsp;

51

00:04:29,920  -->  00:04:35,840
limited in terms of interactivity, so it's not&nbsp;
possible to transfer animations or transitions.&nbsp;

52

00:04:37,360  -->  00:04:40,400
The most common low-fidelity&nbsp;
prototyping techniques are&nbsp;&nbsp;

53

00:04:40,400  -->  00:04:42,880
paper prototyping and clickable wireframes.

54

00:04:43,840  -->  00:04:48,400
You can make prototypes with nothing more than&nbsp;
pen and paper. They are best used in the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

55

00:04:48,400  -->  00:04:53,200
early stages of the design process. When you need&nbsp;
to quickly explore a variety of broader ideas or&nbsp;&nbsp;

56

00:04:53,200  -->  00:04:58,640
concepts. You simply draw different screens of&nbsp;
a digital product interface on sheets of paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57

00:04:59,280  -->  00:05:03,120
You can even simulate interactivity&nbsp;
during testing by moving the screens&nbsp;&nbsp;

58

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:08,449
or sheets of paper, based on how the user&nbsp;
navigates through the paper prototype.&nbsp;

59

00:05:09,680  -->  00:05:13,520
Clickable wireframes can also be&nbsp;
used as low-fidelity prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60

00:05:14,480  -->  00:05:19,760
Clickable wireframes, like paper prototypes, are&nbsp;
a bare-bones representation of the final product.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61

00:05:20,560  -->  00:05:25,280
They can be created with dedicated wireframing&nbsp;
software, or even with a presentation tool like&nbsp;&nbsp;

62

00:05:25,280  -->  00:05:32,400
PowerPoint or Keynote. Unlike a paper prototype,&nbsp;
it also offers a degree of interactivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63

00:05:32,400  -->  00:05:37,360
You can simulate the journey a user goes through&nbsp;
by including hyperlinks that lead to another wireframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

64

00:05:37,360  -->  00:05:44,240
Another advantage is that they can&nbsp;
be adjusted quickly and easily. Unlike a paper&nbsp;&nbsp;

65

00:05:44,240  -->  00:05:49,600
prototype where you have to redraw the entire&nbsp;
screen if you want to make changes. Still,&nbsp;&nbsp;

66

00:05:49,600  -->  00:05:55,000
low-fidelity wireframes are also best suited for&nbsp;
prototyping in the early stages of the project.&nbsp;

67

00:05:56,080  -->  00:05:59,200
The advantages of low-fidelity prototyping are:

68

00:05:59,200  -->  00:06:03,641
Perfect to validate ideas and concepts
Fast and cheap.&nbsp;

69

00:06:03,840  -->  00:06:07,687
Possible to make changes on the&nbsp;
fly and test new iterations.&nbsp;

70

00:06:07,840  -->  00:06:10,960
Get a general picture of the product&nbsp;
with minimal time and effort.&nbsp;

71

00:06:12,160  -->  00:06:14,960
Available to everyone. You&nbsp;
don't need visual design&nbsp;skills.

72

00:06:14,960  -->  00:06:23,120
It stimulates and fosters design thinking.
The disadvantages of low-fidelity prototyping are:

73

00:06:23,120  -->  00:06:27,200
They are limited. You cannot&nbsp;
convey visually complex interfaces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

74

00:06:27,840  -->  00:06:30,340
nor a high degree of interactivity.

75

00:06:31,280  -->  00:06:35,760
An inherent lack of realism. The&nbsp;
applicability of results generated&nbsp;&nbsp;

76

00:06:35,760  -->  00:06:40,000
by testing simple early versions&nbsp;
of a product may not be valid.

77

00:06:40,640  -->  00:06:42,072
Depending on your product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

78

00:06:42,240  -->  00:06:46,320
the production of low-fi prototypes may&nbsp;
not be suitable for your intended users.

79

00:06:46,880  -->  00:06:51,360
Such prototypes often deprive the user of&nbsp;
control, as they generally have to communicate&nbsp;&nbsp;

80

00:06:51,360  -->  00:06:56,230
in basic ways and therefore do not provide a&nbsp;
complete picture of the final user experience.&nbsp;

81

00:06:56,960  -->  00:07:02,320
You move on to hi-fi prototypes once you have&nbsp;
a good idea of what you're going to build.&nbsp;&nbsp;

82

00:07:02,320  -->  00:07:07,120
High-fidelity prototypes even look like a real&nbsp;
app or website and work like the final product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

83

00:07:07,120  -->  00:07:12,400
which is useful when it comes to user testing.
The user feels like they are interacting with&nbsp;&nbsp;

84

00:07:12,400  -->  00:07:17,520
a live product, so you can expect them to&nbsp;
behave naturally and thus provide meaningful&nbsp;&nbsp;

85

00:07:17,520  -->  00:07:23,280
feedback. You can also use hi-fi prototypes&nbsp;
to show colleagues and stakeholders exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

86

00:07:23,280  -->  00:07:28,480
what the end product should look like. Of course,&nbsp;
high-fidelity prototypes are more expensive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

87

00:07:28,480  -->  00:07:32,800
time-consuming to produce than their&nbsp;
low-fidelity equivalents, but still many&nbsp;&nbsp;

88

00:07:32,800  -->  00:07:39,200
times cheaper than actually making the product.
The advantages of high-fidelity prototyping are:

89

00:07:39,200  -->  00:07:42,320
Stakeholders see their vision&nbsp;
realized immediately and&nbsp;&nbsp;

90

00:07:42,320  -->  00:07:46,080
can judge how well it meets their&nbsp;
expectations, wishes and needs.

91

00:07:47,280  -->  00:07:51,360
User testing with high-fi prototypes&nbsp;
will enable the evaluators to&nbsp;&nbsp;

92

00:07:51,360  -->  00:07:54,080
collect information with&nbsp;
a high degree of validity.

93

00:07:55,440  -->  00:07:59,600
The closer the prototype is to the finished&nbsp;
product, the more confident the design team&nbsp;&nbsp;

94

00:07:59,600  -->  00:08:03,920
will have in how people will react to,&nbsp;
interact with, and perceive the design.&nbsp;

95

00:08:05,840  -->  00:08:08,480
The disadvantages of&nbsp;
high-fidelity prototyping are:

96

00:08:09,040  -->  00:08:11,840
They take longer to produce&nbsp;
than low-fi prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

97

00:08:12,480  -->  00:08:17,083
Making changes to prototypes can take a&nbsp;
long time, delaying the entire project.

98

00:08:17,600  -->  00:08:19,507
More expensive to make

99

00:08:19,920  -->  00:08:26,872
Test users are more likely to focus on and comment on&nbsp;
superficial features, as opposed to the content

100

00:08:27,440  -->  00:08:31,600
They can only be made by designers with&nbsp;
knowledge of prototype software and&nbsp;&nbsp;

101

00:08:31,600  -->  00:08:35,264
who are specialized in UI or visual design

102

00:08:36,080  -->  00:08:39,200
So you need special knowledge&nbsp;
to be able to make prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103

00:08:39,200  -->  00:08:42,560
It is not something that we will go&nbsp;
into in detail in this training. But,&nbsp;&nbsp;

104

00:08:42,560  -->  00:08:45,840
if you want to delve into this further,&nbsp;
you will find some good tutorials below&nbsp;&nbsp;

105

00:08:45,840  -->  00:08:52,490
this video that will help you in the most&nbsp;
used software: Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD.&nbsp;

106

00:08:53,040  -->  00:08:56,960
Due to the pros and cons of low-fi and&nbsp;
high-fi prototyping, Low-fi prototyping is&nbsp;&nbsp;

107

00:08:56,960  -->  00:09:00,080
the usual option during the early&nbsp;
stages of a Design Thinking project.

108

00:09:00,080  -->  00:09:03,760
While high-fi prototyping is&nbsp;
used during the later stages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

109

00:09:03,760  -->  00:09:06,660
when the test questions are more sophisticated.&nbsp;

110

00:09:07,360  -->  00:09:11,440
Now that we know exactly what prototyping&nbsp;
is, why it is so valuable and what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

111

00:09:11,440  -->  00:09:15,920
of prototypes we can use during the design&nbsp;
process, here are some tips to get you started:

112

00:09:17,280  -->  00:09:22,640
Set concrete goals. Have a clear idea of ​​what&nbsp;
you want to achieve with your prototype. Remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

113

00:09:22,640  -->  00:09:27,040
what you're testing for. In other words, what do&nbsp;
you want to learn when you test your prototype?&nbsp;&nbsp;

114

00:09:28,160  -->  00:09:32,400
All prototypes must have a central test&nbsp;
problem. Don't lose sight of that issue, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

115

00:09:32,400  -->  00:09:36,480
at the same time don't become so tied down&nbsp;
to it that you lose sight of other lessons.

116

00:09:38,480  -->  00:09:43,280
Build with the user in mind: Test the prototype&nbsp;
against your expected user behavior and user&nbsp;&nbsp;

117

00:09:43,280  -->  00:09:47,920
needs. Then learn from the gaps in expectations&nbsp;
and realities and improve your ideas.

118

00:09:49,200  -->  00:09:54,320
Choose the right kind of prototype. Before&nbsp;
prototyping, consider what stage you are at&nbsp;&nbsp;

119

00:09:54,320  -->  00:09:57,680
in the design process, as well as&nbsp;
the time and resources available.&nbsp;&nbsp;

120

00:09:58,720  -->  00:10:02,160
Low-fidelity prototypes make&nbsp;
sense in the early stages, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

121

00:10:02,160  -->  00:10:06,240
you'll want to move to high-fidelity prototypes&nbsp;
as you get closer to shipping your product.

122

00:10:07,920  -->  00:10:12,640
Don't spend too much time. Prototyping&nbsp;
is all about speed; the longer you spend&nbsp;&nbsp;

123

00:10:12,640  -->  00:10:17,680
building your prototype, the more you can&nbsp;
become emotionally attached to your idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

124

00:10:17,680  -->  00:10:20,960
hindering your ability to&nbsp;
objectively assess its merits.

125

00:10:22,080  -->  00:10:25,840
Use the right tools. When it comes&nbsp;
to high-fidelity prototypes, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

126

00:10:25,840  -->  00:10:30,880
are most likely creating digital prototypes&nbsp;
using specialized software. Some of the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

127

00:10:30,880  -->  00:10:38,400
popular prototyping tools on the market include&nbsp;
Sketch, Figma and Adobe XD. Below this video is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

128

00:10:38,400  -->  00:10:43,360
comprehensive list of prototyping tools, including&nbsp;
links to external tutorials on how to use them.&nbsp;

129

00:10:44,480  -->  00:10:48,160
After this lesson, I hope you will agree&nbsp;
that prototyping is an extremely valuable&nbsp;&nbsp;

130

00:10:48,160  -->  00:10:52,560
step in the design thinking process. Let's&nbsp;
summarize what we've covered in this lesson.&nbsp;

131

00:10:53,760  -->  00:10:58,960
Prototyping offers the opportunity to bring ideas&nbsp;
to life through a low-cost and scaled-down version&nbsp;&nbsp;

132

00:10:58,960  -->  00:11:04,544
of a product. To then test the feasibility&nbsp;
and investigate how users think about it.

133

00:11:04,960  -->  00:11:07,040
Prototypes come in all shapes and sizes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

134

00:11:07,040  -->  00:11:13,840
ranging from simple paper models to fully&nbsp;
functional, interactive digital prototypes.

135

00:11:13,840  -->  00:11:15,520
Prototypes can help you to:

136

00:11:15,520  -->  00:11:20,800
Test whether there is a market for your idea.
Identify any usability issues or design flaws,&nbsp;&nbsp;

137

00:11:20,800  -->  00:11:23,600
before they go out into the world&nbsp;
and into the hands of your users.&nbsp;

138

00:11:24,560  -->  00:11:29,522
It also helps you make informed design decisions.
Testing a tangible product.

139

00:11:30,240  -->  00:11:35,120
There are different types of prototypes. They&nbsp;
can vary in shape, interactivity and fidelity.

140

00:11:36,160  -->  00:11:40,800
So how do you know if you should use&nbsp;
a low- or high-fidelity prototype? It&nbsp;&nbsp;

141

00:11:40,800  -->  00:11:43,360
all depends on what you want to achieve with it.

142

00:11:44,000  -->  00:11:48,000
Due to the pros and cons of&nbsp;
low-fi and high-fi prototyping,&nbsp;&nbsp;

143

00:11:48,000  -->  00:11:53,120
Low-fi prototyping is the usual option during&nbsp;
the early stages of a Design Thinking project.

144

00:11:53,920  -->  00:11:56,960
While high-fi prototyping is&nbsp;
used during the later stages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

145

00:11:56,960  -->  00:11:59,440
when the test questions are more sophisticated.

146

00:12:00,480  -->  00:12:04,400
I've shown you the pros and cons of each&nbsp;
method to help you decide and ​​some tips&nbsp;&nbsp;

147

00:12:04,400  -->  00:12:09,760
and best practices to get you started.
Prototyping and testing go hand in hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

148

00:12:09,760  -->  00:12:16,400
so once you've created a prototype, you need to&nbsp;
present it to real users. Continuous prototyping&nbsp;&nbsp;

149

00:12:16,400  -->  00:12:21,520
helps you make informed design decisions. Building&nbsp;
your way to an intuitive, easy-to-use product&nbsp;&nbsp;

150

00:12:21,520  -->  00:12:28,000
that your users will love. This brings us to the&nbsp;
next stage: testing. See you in the next lesson.
