1

00:00:08,380  -->  00:00:13,302
In this lesson, we are going to cover the
factors that influence user experience.

2

00:00:13,302  -->  00:00:19,050
When we talk about UX, the term user interface
design or UI for short will come up.

3

00:00:19,050  -->  00:00:24,880
But, it is good to realize that despite being
often used mixed together, UI and UX are two

4

00:00:24,880  -->  00:00:26,730
different things.

5

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:31,410
Although the user interface of a product is
of course an important part of the user experience.

6

00:00:31,410  -->  00:00:32,410
It's not the same.

7

00:00:32,410  -->  00:00:33,980
It is a subset of UX.

8

00:00:33,980  -->  00:00:38,962
Like UX is a broader part of the total customer
experience and service design.

9

00:00:38,962  -->  00:00:41,760
They are all sides of the same coin.

10

00:00:41,760  -->  00:00:46,540
UI focuses on how a product's surfaces 
look and function.

11

00:00:46,540  -->  00:00:49,867
UX focuses on what the end-user encounters.

12

00:00:49,867  -->  00:00:55,570
Customer experience or CX for short encompasses
all interactions a person has with the brand.

13

00:00:55,570  -->  00:01:01,060
While service design at the end of the spectrum
focuses on how the internal parts of the organization

14

00:01:01,060  -->  00:01:04,014
are aligned to deliver that experience.

15

00:01:05,670  -->  00:01:09,340
To explain the difference between UX and UI
more clearly.

16

00:01:09,340  -->  00:01:13,179
UI refers to the actual interface of a product.

17

00:01:13,179  -->  00:01:18,649
The visual design of the screens through which
a user navigates on, for example, an app or website.

18

00:01:19,649  -->  00:01:24,689
UI designers handle all the visual and interactive
elements of a product interface.

19

00:01:24,689  -->  00:01:29,990
Which includes everything from typography
and color palettes to animations, transitions,

20

00:01:29,990  -->  00:01:33,840
fonts, colors, all these sorts of things.

21

00:01:33,840  -->  00:01:37,990
They don't necessarily have to create the
blueprint for the product or understand exactly

22

00:01:37,990  -->  00:01:40,850
what the user needs 
or the business goals are.

23

00:01:40,850  -->  00:01:44,899
That is the role of the UX designer: research
these goals and bring them together to what

24

00:01:44,899  -->  00:01:47,000
the product could be.

25

00:01:47,514  -->  00:01:52,310
Take, for example, a travel website where
you can book an overnight stay.

26

00:01:52,310  -->  00:01:57,759
Even if the UI for finding accommodation is
perfect, the UX will be bad for a user looking

27

00:01:57,759  -->  00:02:02,560
for a private hotel room in Amsterdam, 
if the underlying database only contains

28

00:02:02,560  -->  00:02:04,819
bunk beds in hostels in the UK.

29

00:02:04,819  -->  00:02:10,307
Both UX and UI designers focus on usability
and improving the user experience.

30

00:02:10,402  -->  00:02:14,922
UX and UI go hand in hand and product interface
design has a huge impact 

31

00:02:14,922  -->  00:02:17,403
on the overall user experience.

32

00:02:18,317  -->  00:02:22,790
But UX professionals don't just focus 
on creating useful products.

33

00:02:22,790  -->  00:02:29,060
All too often UX is confused with usability,
which describes how easy a product is to use.

34

00:02:29,060  -->  00:02:33,768
While it's true that UX started out as a usability
discipline, UX has evolved into 

35

00:02:33,768  -->  00:02:35,730
much more than usability.

36

00:02:35,730  -->  00:02:38,990
It also focuses on other aspects 
of the user experience.

37

00:02:38,990  -->  00:02:42,730
We must also distinguish between UX and usability.

38

00:02:43,625  -->  00:02:49,390
Usability is a quality attribute that assesses
how easy user interfaces are to use.

39

00:02:49,390  -->  00:02:54,104
The word "usability" also refers to methods
for improving ease of use

40

00:02:54,104  -->  00:02:56,284
during the design process.

41

00:02:56,284  -->  00:03:01,140
By this definition, usability is a quality
feature of the user interface.

42

00:03:01,140  -->  00:03:06,920
A very important aspect of UX, but the total
user experience is an even broader concept.

43

00:03:07,853  -->  00:03:14,300
A UX designer is concerned with the entire
process of acquiring and integrating a product.

44

00:03:14,300  -->  00:03:18,390
It is a story that begins before the product
is even in the hands of the user.

45

00:03:19,151  -->  00:03:24,310
Products that provide a great user experience,
such as the iPhone, are designed not only

46

00:03:24,310  -->  00:03:26,650
with the use of the product in mind.

47

00:03:26,650  -->  00:03:32,310
But also with the entire process of acquiring,
owning, and even troubleshooting it.

48

00:03:32,310  -->  00:03:37,840
So usability and user interface are important
aspects, but UX design covers many other areas

49

00:03:37,840  -->  00:03:38,916
as well.

50

00:03:39,620  -->  00:03:43,620
In the first lesson, I showed you the three
fundamental aspects of a good user experience

51

00:03:43,620  -->  00:03:45,720
that are well known in the industry.

52

00:03:46,177  -->  00:03:50,590
A good user experience must deliver 
on three promises

53

00:03:50,590  -->  00:03:51,590
Is it useful?

54

00:03:51,590  -->  00:03:55,050
Does the site or app provide 
value to the user?

55

00:03:55,050  -->  00:03:56,050
Is it usable?

56

00:03:56,050  -->  00:03:58,958
Does the user find it easy to use and navigate?

57

00:03:58,958  -->  00:04:00,250
And is it desirable?

58

00:04:00,250  -->  00:04:02,860
Does the user enjoy using the site or app?

59

00:04:03,393  -->  00:04:08,079
Peter Morville, a UX pioneer who has written
several bestsellers and advises many

60

00:04:08,079  -->  00:04:13,620
Fortune 500 companies on UX, 
has expanded this model even further.

61

00:04:13,620  -->  00:04:17,500
According to him, seven factors influence
the user experience.

62

00:04:18,014  -->  00:04:23,150
Morville ranked the seven factors in the "User
Experience Honeycomb", which became a famous

63

00:04:23,150  -->  00:04:26,110
tool for understanding UX design.

64

00:04:26,110  -->  00:04:30,200
As you can see, this model includes the 
3 basic requirements of UX that we discussed

65

00:04:30,200  -->  00:04:35,410
earlier but has been expanded to include 
four other key components.

66

00:04:35,410  -->  00:04:40,650
Let's take a closer look at each factor and
what it means for the overall user experience.

67

00:04:40,650  -->  00:04:43,067
We'll start with the one we mentioned earlier.

68

00:04:44,513  -->  00:04:48,350
Usability has to do with how easy a product
is to use.

69

00:04:48,350  -->  00:04:51,270
With functionality that is intuitive.

70

00:04:51,270  -->  00:04:54,310
For example, a car without a steering wheel
is not very useful.

71

00:04:54,672  -->  00:04:58,851
At least for now, until everyone 
has a self-driving car.

72

00:04:58,851  -->  00:05:04,690
Poor usability is often associated with the
very first generation of a product.

73

00:05:04,690  -->  00:05:08,940
With the introduction of the personal computer,
with mouse and graphical interface, it became

74

00:05:08,940  -->  00:05:11,810
usable for ordinary people.

75

00:05:11,810  -->  00:05:16,060
The Macintosh wasn't the first computer, but
it was the first, at least in a UX sense,

76

00:05:16,060  -->  00:05:19,020
to be useful to everyday people.

77

00:05:19,020  -->  00:05:23,790
Or what about the first generation of MP3
players, which have lost their market share

78

00:05:23,790  -->  00:05:26,340
to the more convenient iPod.

79

00:05:26,340  -->  00:05:29,840
We'll talk more about usability in 
Chapter 3.

80

00:05:30,982  -->  00:05:35,440
If a product is of no use to anyone, why would
you want to market it?

81

00:05:35,440  -->  00:05:37,030
Sounds logical, right?

82

00:05:37,030  -->  00:05:41,369
If it has no purpose, it is unlikely to compete
for attention alongside a market

83

00:05:41,369  -->  00:05:43,340
full of useful products.

84

00:05:43,340  -->  00:05:48,560
The experience should be useful in every way
and should provide content, features, or functions

85

00:05:48,560  -->  00:05:51,280
that meet the general user needs.

86

00:05:51,280  -->  00:05:56,770
For example, an e-commerce website might include
the ability to see if a specific product is

87

00:05:56,770  -->  00:05:59,950
in stock or not, a very useful feature.

88

00:05:59,950  -->  00:06:04,889
It is worth noting that "useful" is in the
eyes of the beholder.

89

00:06:04,889  -->  00:06:09,580
Things can be considered "useful" if they
provide non-practical benefits.

90

00:06:09,580  -->  00:06:14,389
For example, playing a video game might be
useless to you, but it can be super helpful

91

00:06:14,389  -->  00:06:18,500
for a teen to let off steam after 
a busy day at college.

92

00:06:19,433  -->  00:06:25,285
Good UX designs enable experiences that are
desirable or even delightful.

93

00:06:25,285  -->  00:06:29,060
Thus, the solution not only offers useful
features that are easy to use.

94

00:06:29,060  -->  00:06:35,221
But also in a way that appeals to the user,
for example with great visual design, content and copy.

95

00:06:35,853  -->  00:06:41,850
Desirability is reflected in the design through
branding, image, identity, aesthetics, and

96

00:06:41,850  -->  00:06:43,482
emotional design.

97

00:06:43,482  -->  00:06:47,250
The more attractive a product is, the more
likely the user who owns it will tell about

98

00:06:47,250  -->  00:06:50,466
it and arouse desire in other users.

99

00:06:50,466  -->  00:06:55,020
When a user buys a product online, it should
be so engaging and enjoyable that users are

100

00:06:55,020  -->  00:06:56,420
likely to come back again.

101

00:06:56,420  -->  00:07:01,110
Or share the positive experience with others
with their family and friends.

102

00:07:02,252  -->  00:07:06,430
Findable refers to the idea that the product
should be easy to find.

103

00:07:06,430  -->  00:07:09,180
If you can't find it, you won't buy it.

104

00:07:09,180  -->  00:07:10,889
Time is precious to most people.

105

00:07:10,889  -->  00:07:15,580
Findability is therefore essential for the
user experience of many products.

106

00:07:15,580  -->  00:07:19,930
Imagine you are reading a newspaper and all
the stories were placed in random order.

107

00:07:19,930  -->  00:07:24,510
Instead of being organized into sections like
sports, entertainment, or business.

108

00:07:24,510  -->  00:07:28,040
You would find reading the newspaper a very
frustrating experience.

109

00:07:28,040  -->  00:07:32,368
Findability is essential for the user experience
of many products.

110

00:07:33,833  -->  00:07:39,370
Credibility refers to the user's ability to
trust the product provided by you.

111

00:07:39,370  -->  00:07:41,889
Today's users don't give you a second chance
to fool them.

112

00:07:41,889  -->  00:07:47,072
They can and will leave your website or app
in seconds unless you give them a reason to stay.

113

00:07:47,600  -->  00:07:49,640
Especially if there are enough alternatives.

114

00:07:50,439  -->  00:07:54,250
It is impossible to provide a user experience
if the user thinks that the creator of the

115

00:07:54,250  -->  00:07:56,940
product is a lying clown with bad intentions.

116

00:07:57,321  -->  00:08:00,780
Worse, they will also share this negative
experience with others.

117

00:08:00,780  -->  00:08:05,000
For example, by leaving a negative review
to warn potential customers.

118

00:08:06,587  -->  00:08:13,636
Unfortunately, accessibility is often forgotten
or an afterthought when creating user experiences.

119

00:08:13,636  -->  00:08:18,430
Accessibility is about providing an experience
that is accessible to all users.

120

00:08:18,430  -->  00:08:23,870
So also for people who are hard of hearing,
who have learning problems, movement disorders,

121

00:08:23,870  -->  00:08:26,990
or who are visually impaired.

122

00:08:26,990  -->  00:08:31,310
Designing for accessibility is often seen
by companies as a waste of money.

123

00:08:31,310  -->  00:08:35,199
The reason for this is the persistent misconception
that people with disabilities are a small

124

00:08:35,199  -->  00:08:37,639
part of the population.

125

00:08:37,639  -->  00:08:42,650
According to research from the United States,
at least 19% of people had a disability.

126

00:08:42,650  -->  00:08:45,950
This number is likely to be higher in less
developed countries.

127

00:08:45,950  -->  00:08:51,260
That's one in five people who may not be able
to use your product if it's inaccessible.

128

00:08:52,212  -->  00:08:56,779
It's also worth remembering that when you
design for accessibility, you often create

129

00:08:56,779  -->  00:08:59,870
products that are easier for everyone to use.

130

00:08:59,870  -->  00:09:01,930
Not just people with disabilities.

131

00:09:02,691  -->  00:09:06,640
Finally, accessible design is now a legal
requirement in many jurisdictions, such as

132

00:09:06,640  -->  00:09:08,010
the EU.

133

00:09:08,562  -->  00:09:11,930
Failure to provide accessibility in designs
can lead to fines.

134

00:09:11,930  -->  00:09:15,700
So don't neglect accessibility in the 
user experience.

135

00:09:15,700  -->  00:09:19,779
Later in this course, we will therefore devote
an entire chapter to accessibility.

136

00:09:21,339  -->  00:09:23,630
Finally, the product must deliver value.

137

00:09:23,630  -->  00:09:29,384
It must deliver value to the company that
creates it and to the user who buys or uses it.

138

00:09:30,050  -->  00:09:34,450
Without value, a product's initial success
is likely to be undermined eventually.

139

00:09:35,000  -->  00:09:39,325
Designers should keep in mind that value is
one of the most important influences on

140

00:09:39,325  -->  00:09:40,420
purchasing decisions.

141

00:09:40,896  -->  00:09:42,520
This brings us to the end of this lesson.

142

00:09:42,520  -->  00:09:45,034
Let's recap what we learned in this lesson.

143

00:09:45,034  -->  00:09:49,230
I showed you that UX and UI 
are two different things.

144

00:09:49,230  -->  00:09:50,360
It is a subset of UX.

145

00:09:50,360  -->  00:09:54,200
Like UX is a broader part of the total customer
experience and service design.

146

00:09:54,200  -->  00:09:58,110
They are all sides of the same coin.

147

00:09:58,110  -->  00:10:02,490
We also discussed that UX is too often 
confused with usability.

148

00:10:02,490  -->  00:10:07,793
While it's true that UX started out as a usability
discipline, UX has evolved into much more

149

00:10:07,793  -->  00:10:08,926
than usability.

150

00:10:08,926  -->  00:10:13,820
It also focuses on other aspects 
of the user experience.

151

00:10:13,820  -->  00:10:17,490
So the success of a product depends on more
than usability.

152

00:10:17,490  -->  00:10:25,290
Products that are also useful, findable, accessible,
credible, valuable, and desirable are much

153

00:10:25,290  -->  00:10:27,330
more likely to succeed.

154

00:10:27,330  -->  00:10:31,270
These are the 7 factors that influence the
user experience.

155

00:10:31,270  -->  00:10:35,319
Join me in the next lesson where I cover what
input is needed for a good user experience.
