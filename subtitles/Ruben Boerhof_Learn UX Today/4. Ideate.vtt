00:00:06.400  -->  00:00:10.160
The ideation phase is often the most&nbsp;
exciting part of the Design Thinking&nbsp;process

2

00:00:10.160  -->  00:00:14.960
and kicks the creative process into high&nbsp;
gear. This phase represents an important&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:14.960  -->  00:00:19.200
transition step from getting to know your users&nbsp;
and the problem to coming up with solutions.&nbsp;

4

00:00:20.320  -->  00:00:25.760
The main goal of the ideation phase is to use&nbsp;
creativity and innovation to develop solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

5

00:00:26.640  -->  00:00:32.080
In the ideation phase you explore and come up&nbsp;
with as many ideas as possible. At this stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

6

00:00:32.080  -->  00:00:38.000
the focus is on quantity of ideas rather than&nbsp;
quality. The goal is not to evaluate or assess&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:38.000  -->  00:00:43.760
the viability of these ideas, but to keep the&nbsp;
creative and problem-solving juices flowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8

00:00:43.760  -->  00:00:48.880
The main goal is to discover and explore new&nbsp;
angles and avenues. To think outside the box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

9

00:00:48.880  -->  00:00:52.000
question the obvious, challenge the&nbsp;
norm and come up with new ideas.&nbsp;

10

00:00:52.800  -->  00:00:58.640
Ideation sessions help you question assumptions,&nbsp;
think outside the box, and explore uncharted&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:00:58.640  -->  00:01:03.840
territory. When done right, an ideation&nbsp;
session is where innovation thrives.

12

00:01:04.720  -->  00:01:08.960
But it's not always easy to facilitate an&nbsp;
ideation session. They need a lot of preparation&nbsp;&nbsp;

13

00:01:08.960  -->  00:01:14.960
and concentration from team members in order  to be&nbsp;
fruitful. So before we dive deeper into specific&nbsp;&nbsp;

14

00:01:14.960  -->  00:01:20.000
ideation techniques, let's take a look at how we&nbsp;
can prepare for a successful ideation session.

15

00:01:23.760  -->  00:01:28.400
Change of environment. In ideation sessions it&nbsp;
is important to create the right environment&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:28.400  -->  00:01:32.800
to stimulate out-of-the-box thinking.&nbsp;
Therefore, get away from the office and&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:01:32.800  -->  00:01:37.200
hold your session in a brand new place.&nbsp;
This creates new incentives, which in&nbsp;&nbsp;

18

00:01:37.200  -->  00:01:44.080
turn can help initiate new ways of thinking.
Create a relaxed environment. Another reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:44.080  -->  00:01:49.760
not to sit in the office. The best idea sessions&nbsp;
are those where the participants feel comfortable&nbsp;&nbsp;

20

00:01:49.760  -->  00:01:55.168
and safe. Provide icebreakers to bring the group&nbsp;
together and warm up to the creative process.&nbsp;

21

00:01:56.320  -->  00:02:04.160
No judgments. Ideation sessions are not the place&nbsp;
to argue or question other members' ideas. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

22

00:02:04.160  -->  00:02:09.280
a no-judgment zone and that rule should be clear&nbsp;
to everyone before a brainstorming session begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:02:10.080  -->  00:02:14.720
It is now about generating ideas, not&nbsp;
judging. So instead of blocking an idea,&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:02:14.720  -->  00:02:20.080
you and your other team members are encouraged to&nbsp;
come up with your own ideas that stem from those&nbsp;&nbsp;

25

00:02:20.080  -->  00:02:24.160
of the other members of your team.&nbsp;
So you can discover the best idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

26

00:02:24.160  -->  00:02:32.320
without regard for hierarchy, seniority or ego.
There are no bad ideas. Every idea presented&nbsp;&nbsp;

27

00:02:32.320  -->  00:02:38.240
should relate to and be relevant to the&nbsp;
problem, but otherwise no idea is a bad idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:02:38.240  -->  00:02:44.240
Encourage weird, crazy and wild ideas.&nbsp;
This process involves first drafting as&nbsp;&nbsp;

29

00:02:44.240  -->  00:02:49.840
many ideas as possible which are later scaled&nbsp;
down until the best possible option remains.&nbsp;

30

00:02:50.480  -->  00:02:56.880
Aim for quantity. Brainstorming is basically a&nbsp;
creative exercise, encouraging design thinkers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:02:56.880  -->  00:03:02.160
let their imaginations run wild. At this stage,&nbsp;
the emphasis is more on quantity than quality.&nbsp;

32

00:03:02.880  -->  00:03:07.760
Build on each other's ideas. One&nbsp;
idea usually flows from another.&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:03:07.760  -->  00:03:12.560
Here new insights and perspectives can be&nbsp;
gained, which then lead to one's own ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34

00:03:12.560  -->  00:03:15.840
So the team will continue to build&nbsp;
ideas that will hopefully gradually&nbsp;&nbsp;

35

00:03:15.840  -->  00:03:19.200
become more sophisticated and&nbsp;
focused on the central problem.&nbsp;

36

00:03:20.880  -->  00:03:25.680
Apply structure. Although it is a creative&nbsp;
process, it helps the process if some&nbsp;&nbsp;

37

00:03:25.680  -->  00:03:30.800
ground rules are put in place. Stick to one&nbsp;
conversation at a time and stay on topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38

00:03:31.440  -->  00:03:36.800
Focus is essential, otherwise the process can&nbsp;
become confusing or you lose sight of the goal.

39

00:03:37.520  -->  00:03:41.440
There are hundreds of ideation techniques&nbsp;
you can use to spark innovative ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

40

00:03:42.480  -->  00:03:47.920
At the beginning of the ideation phase, it is good&nbsp;
to opt for techniques that stimulate as many ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

41

00:03:47.920  -->  00:03:53.280
as possible. At the end, you'll use techniques&nbsp;
that help you explore and test your ideas.

42

00:03:54.160  -->  00:03:58.240
Also try out different techniques.&nbsp;
Different strategies can lead to new ideas.

43

00:03:58.960  -->  00:04:04.560
Let's look at the most common ideation techniques.
Techniques you can use to generate as many ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

44

00:04:04.560  -->  00:04:12.000
as possible are brainstorm, analogies,&nbsp;
bodystorming, challenge assumptions,&nbsp;&nbsp;

45

00:04:12.000  -->  00:04:20.240
mindmap, provocation, SCAMPER, sketching,&nbsp;
storyboarding and worst possible idea.

46

00:04:21.760  -->  00:04:28.320
Techniques that help you select and test your&nbsp;
ideas are: dot voting, the four categories method,&nbsp;&nbsp;

47

00:04:28.320  -->  00:04:31.120
now wow how matrix and
affinity maps.&nbsp;

48

00:04:37.040  -->  00:04:41.840
The first ideas shared during the ideation&nbsp;
phase are often the most obvious ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49

00:04:42.880  -->  00:04:48.000
Brainstorming is one of the best known methods&nbsp;
when it comes to generating new ideas as a group.&nbsp;&nbsp;

50

00:04:48.160  -->  00:04:53.699
It helps to go beyond simple answers, question&nbsp;
assumptions, and think outside the box.

51

00:04:54.160  -->  00:04:58.240
In a brainstorming session, you verbally&nbsp;
bounce ideas off each other in the hope of&nbsp;&nbsp;

52

00:04:58.240  -->  00:05:04.000
finding a blended solution. It is a perfect&nbsp;
way to generate lots of ideas by using the&nbsp;&nbsp;

53

00:05:04.000  -->  00:05:10.240
collective thinking of the group, talking to each&nbsp;
other, listening and building on other ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

54

00:05:10.240  -->  00:05:14.080
These can then be refined and&nbsp;
narrowed down to the best solution.

55

00:05:14.080  -->  00:05:18.880
Participants should be able to discuss their&nbsp;
ideas freely without fear of criticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;

56

00:05:18.880  -->  00:05:20.560
To set up a brainstorming session,&nbsp;&nbsp;

57

00:05:20.560  -->  00:05:25.801
you need a facilitator who can ensure that all&nbsp;
voices are heard and can lead the conversation.&nbsp;

58

00:05:26.400  -->  00:05:29.920
There are also a few fun variations&nbsp;
on the traditional brainstorm:

59

00:05:31.120  -->  00:05:36.560
Braindump is very similar to brainstorming,&nbsp;
but is done individually. The participants&nbsp;&nbsp;

60

00:05:36.560  -->  00:05:41.840
write their ideas on post-it notes and share their&nbsp;
ideas with the group at a later stage. It is also&nbsp;&nbsp;

61

00:05:41.840  -->  00:05:48.820
called silent brainstorming and is often done as a&nbsp;
preparatory step before the actual brainstorming.

62

00:05:49.600  -->  00:05:54.720
Brainwriting is a version of brainstorming that&nbsp;
works well for more introverted participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;

63

00:05:55.680  -->  00:06:01.120
Instead of sharing ideas verbally, participants&nbsp;
write down their ideas before passing them on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

64

00:06:01.120  -->  00:06:08.160
someone else. The next person reads these ideas&nbsp;
and adds their own. You repeat this process until&nbsp;&nbsp;

65

00:06:08.160  -->  00:06:14.160
everyone has contributed. The advantage of this&nbsp;
technique is that everyone can contribute equally&nbsp;&nbsp;

66

00:06:14.160  -->  00:06:19.840
and not the people who normally dominate&nbsp;
the conversation or are verbally stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67

00:06:19.840  -->  00:06:24.924
When you're ready, you can put all the ideas&nbsp;
on the whiteboard and discuss them together.

68

00:06:25.440  -->  00:06:29.440
Gamestorming is the gamification of&nbsp;
brainstorming and a popular ideation&nbsp;&nbsp;

69

00:06:29.440  -->  00:06:35.378
technique. To increase involvement, energy&nbsp;
and collaboration during group sessions.

70

00:06:35.920  -->  00:06:40.960
An example of a gamified ideation session&nbsp;
is: Fishbowl. An ideation session in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

71

00:06:40.960  -->  00:06:46.688
participants sit in two circles, a smaller&nbsp;
one and a larger one around the smaller one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

72

00:06:46.960  -->  00:06:51.600
Participants in the inner circle discuss their&nbsp;
ideas and brainstorm while participants in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

73

00:06:51.600  -->  00:06:57.200
outer circle listen, observe and document the&nbsp;
ideas and talking points without saying a word.&nbsp;&nbsp;

74

00:06:58.000  -->  00:07:01.840
This forces some to listen&nbsp;
and others to brainstorm.&nbsp;

75

00:07:07.680  -->  00:07:13.840
The bodystorming technique lets you physically&nbsp;
experience a situation in order to gain new ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76

00:07:13.840  -->  00:07:18.080
Bodystorming allows participants to&nbsp;
approach potentially abstract problems&nbsp;&nbsp;

77

00:07:18.080  -->  00:07:21.440
hands-on. It combines aspects of empathy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

78

00:07:21.440  -->  00:07:27.890
brainstorming and prototyping in one exercise that&nbsp;
helps to stimulate more meaningful experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79

00:07:28.400  -->  00:07:32.320
And that is why this technique is sometimes&nbsp;
already applied in the empathy phase.

80

00:07:32.320  -->  00:07:37.504
How does it work? You set up a physical&nbsp;
experience that resembles the problem you&nbsp;&nbsp;

81

00:07:37.504  -->  00:07:41.680
are trying to solve, using people,&nbsp;
props, or a digital prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;

82

00:07:42.320  -->  00:07:46.960
Or you let the participants act out one of&nbsp;
the processes you are trying to improve. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

83

00:07:46.960  -->  00:07:52.000
simulate the real environment to test different&nbsp;
scenarios. Based on your own interactions with&nbsp;&nbsp;

84

00:07:52.000  -->  00:07:56.966
and reactions to this environment, it&nbsp;
may be easier to come up with ideas.

85

00:08:02.720  -->  00:08:08.080
Challenging assumptions is crucial to breaking&nbsp;
through conventional thinking patterns and coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

86

00:08:08.080  -->  00:08:14.000
up with new ideas. A popular ideation technique is&nbsp;
to come up with some of these assumptions inherent&nbsp;&nbsp;

87

00:08:14.000  -->  00:08:19.360
in your design challenge. As a group, you then&nbsp;
go through these assumptions and discuss whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

88

00:08:19.360  -->  00:08:25.324
they are really true, or whether they are just&nbsp;
there because they have never been questioned.

89

00:08:25.520  -->  00:08:30.560
By putting these assumptions to the test, the&nbsp;
team can realize that some assumed features&nbsp;&nbsp;

90

00:08:30.560  -->  00:08:36.288
or strategies are not necessary and what&nbsp;
innovative solutions can be used instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;

91

00:08:36.800  -->  00:08:42.127
It's especially effective to question&nbsp;
assumptions if you're stuck or run out of ideas.

92

00:08:43.200  -->  00:08:47.520
Mind mapping is a visual ideation technique&nbsp;
that makes connections between the problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

93

00:08:47.520  -->  00:08:53.360
your team is trying to solve and possible&nbsp;
solutions. It's perfect for the ideation stage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

94

00:08:53.360  -->  00:08:57.408
as it follows a similar non-linear&nbsp;
approach to brainstorming.&nbsp;

95

00:08:58.400  -->  00:09:03.440
You start by writing a keyword related to your&nbsp;
problem statement. On the same piece of paper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

96

00:09:03.440  -->  00:09:08.960
surround this word with whatever ideas come to&nbsp;
mind. Finally, you will think about how these&nbsp;&nbsp;

97

00:09:08.960  -->  00:09:14.768
ideas are connected, representing the connections&nbsp;
with lines and curves, resulting in a visual map.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98

00:09:15.360  -->  00:09:21.360
This iterative approach can help teams hone ideas&nbsp;
and uncover gaps in the user experience. Using&nbsp;&nbsp;

99

00:09:21.360  -->  00:09:27.302
a mind map allows you to break down big ideas or&nbsp;
problems into smaller, more manageable solutions.&nbsp;

100

00:09:32.400  -->  00:09:37.360
Provocation is a technique of lateral thinking&nbsp;
that challenges the status quo and allows you&nbsp;&nbsp;

101

00:09:37.360  -->  00:09:43.120
to explore new realities to the extreme. In&nbsp;
the simplest terms, a provocation can be seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

102

00:09:43.120  -->  00:09:49.600
as an idea that is considered too radical and&nbsp;
unrealistic even for a brainstorming session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

103

00:09:49.600  -->  00:09:54.880
The purpose of the provocation is to force&nbsp;
your mind out of the worn-out mental pathways,&nbsp;&nbsp;

104

00:09:54.880  -->  00:09:58.795
potentially allowing you to come up&nbsp;
with radical solutions to the problem.

105

00:10:00.160  -->  00:10:03.920
Provocations are best understood&nbsp;
by means of an example.

106

00:10:03.920  -->  00:10:06.960
Suppose the problem you want&nbsp;
to solve is the following:&nbsp;

107

00:10:06.960  -->  00:10:10.810
“Cars run out of petrol after&nbsp;
a few hundred kilometers”

108

00:10:10.995  -->  00:10:13.035
A provocation can be:

109

00:10:13.040  -->  00:10:19.725
Invent a car that pulls a gas station behind it
Invent a car that runs on air

110

00:10:20.320  -->  00:10:24.206
The provocations solve the&nbsp;
problem, but are not realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

111

00:10:24.320  -->  00:10:30.640
Make the provocation a good idea through movement.
From the provocation we extract a core idea that&nbsp;&nbsp;

112

00:10:30.640  -->  00:10:36.480
is important in solving the problem. Based on that&nbsp;
principle, we arrive at a more realistic solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;

113

00:10:37.040  -->  00:10:41.008
Let's see how we can deviate&nbsp;
from the sample provocations:&nbsp;

114

00:10:41.200  -->  00:10:45.600
The principle behind the first provocation:&nbsp;
"Invent a car that pulls a gas station",&nbsp;&nbsp;

115

00:10:45.600  -->  00:10:50.872
is that with this solution there is always a&nbsp;
large amount of petrol available for the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;

116

00:10:51.040  -->  00:10:56.640
Possible solutions are to increase the fuel&nbsp;
capacity of cars. Or perhaps a gas station&nbsp;&nbsp;

117

00:10:56.640  -->  00:11:01.941
system where cars can be refueled from mobile&nbsp;
filling stations, such as with airplanes.

118

00:11:03.040  -->  00:11:06.880
The principle behind the second provocation&nbsp;
is that by running the car on air,&nbsp;&nbsp;

119

00:11:06.880  -->  00:11:11.600
you make the fuel the car runs on&nbsp;
immediately available in its environment.&nbsp;

120

00:11:11.600  -->  00:11:16.080
Solutions that make use of this principle are,&nbsp;
for example, adding solar panels to the car for&nbsp;&nbsp;

121

00:11:16.080  -->  00:11:22.800
extra power supply. Or to supplement battery&nbsp;
charging with wind resistance when braking.&nbsp;

122

00:11:22.800  -->  00:11:26.800
Provocations do not lead directly&nbsp;
to a definitive solution, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

123

00:11:26.800  -->  00:11:32.240
they do provide the material from which the new&nbsp;
idea can be formed. The movement technique will&nbsp;&nbsp;

124

00:11:32.240  -->  00:11:38.152
help you question the status quo. Which you can&nbsp;
use to build more viable and realistic ideas.&nbsp;

125

00:11:40.400  -->  00:11:43.920
SCAMPER stands for seven ways&nbsp;
of approaching a problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

126

00:11:43.920  -->  00:11:48.206
through which you can come up with&nbsp;
ideas from different perspectives.

127

00:11:48.560  -->  00:11:54.320
This technique works well for an existing product&nbsp;
or service to determine how to improve it or use&nbsp;&nbsp;

128

00:11:54.320  -->  00:11:59.440
it as a starting point to develop a new&nbsp;
offering. Ask yourself questions based&nbsp;&nbsp;

129

00:11:59.440  -->  00:12:05.380
on the SCAMPER elements and determine whether&nbsp;
your answers represent viable solutions.

130

00:12:06.240  -->  00:12:09.360
Substitute: What features&nbsp;
of this product or service&nbsp;&nbsp;

131

00:12:09.360  -->  00:12:13.005
can be substituted or swapped for something else?

132

00:12:13.280  -->  00:12:16.560
Combine: How can we combine&nbsp;
this product or service&nbsp;&nbsp;

133

00:12:16.560  -->  00:12:20.043
with another product or service to improve it?

134

00:12:20.640  -->  00:12:26.256
Adapt: How could we adapt this product&nbsp;
or service to another audience?

135

00:12:26.720  -->  00:12:32.204
Modify: What component of this product&nbsp;
or service can we modify to improve it?

136

00:12:33.040  -->  00:12:35.600
Put to another use: What is another use for&nbsp;&nbsp;

137

00:12:35.600  -->  00:12:39.404
this product or service that&nbsp;
we have not considered yet?

138

00:12:40.160  -->  00:12:43.200
Eliminate: What unnecessary elements can we&nbsp;&nbsp;

139

00:12:43.200  -->  00:12:47.137
eliminate from this product&nbsp;
or service to streamline it?

140

00:12:47.680  -->  00:12:53.513
Reverse: What would happen if we reversed&nbsp;
our process or reorganized this product?

141

00:12:53.680  -->  00:12:56.720
By looking at the product or&nbsp;
service from these different angles,&nbsp;&nbsp;

142

00:12:56.720  -->  00:13:01.298
you may arrive at solutions that&nbsp;
you would not otherwise think of.&nbsp;

143

00:13:02.800  -->  00:13:06.000
Storyboarding is an excellent&nbsp;
technique for bringing a design&nbsp;&nbsp;

144

00:13:06.000  -->  00:13:12.400
challenge to life and exploring different&nbsp;
avenues in a visual way. Storyboarding every&nbsp;&nbsp;

145

00:13:12.400  -->  00:13:16.720
step of your process can also be helpful, as&nbsp;
you may realize you missed an essential step.

146

00:13:18.000  -->  00:13:22.341
It is a useful technique when&nbsp;
designing or improving processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

147

00:13:22.560  -->  00:13:26.720
Participants create a visual story that&nbsp;
presents their ideas and the possible outcomes&nbsp;&nbsp;

148

00:13:26.720  -->  00:13:31.568
of those ideas, helping them understand&nbsp;
what works and what needs improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;

149

00:13:32.080  -->  00:13:37.760
Track your customer's journey through the process,&nbsp;
including the impact of your solutions. Think of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

150

00:13:37.760  -->  00:13:43.920
storyboard as a comic strip, but don't worry about&nbsp;
artistic skills. Depict each step in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

151

00:13:43.920  -->  00:13:49.938
with squares filled with text or images describing&nbsp;
the user's journey, and arrows between them.&nbsp;

152

00:13:51.520  -->  00:13:55.920
The worst possible idea technique is great&nbsp;
for putting the group at ease and removing&nbsp;&nbsp;

153

00:13:55.920  -->  00:14:02.080
creative blocks. It often makes for a more fun&nbsp;
environment as participants try to entertain&nbsp;&nbsp;

154

00:14:02.080  -->  00:14:08.080
each other and use their creativity to come up&nbsp;
with ridiculous ideas. Thinking about what's so&nbsp;&nbsp;

155

00:14:08.080  -->  00:14:13.888
terrible about these ideas can provide valuable&nbsp;
insights into what a good idea might look like.

156

00:14:14.560  -->  00:14:20.160
Suppose you are looking for ideas to solve the&nbsp;
problem of traffic congestion in cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

157

00:14:20.160  -->  00:14:27.539
Very bad ideas are, for example, a global pandemic,&nbsp;
more taxis or the removal of all traffic signs.

158

00:14:28.480  -->  00:14:31.840
If you turn that around, you come&nbsp;
up with better ideas, for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

159

00:14:31.840  -->  00:14:38.443
more working from home, car sharing&nbsp;
or better navigation options.

160

00:14:38.880  -->  00:14:43.360
Reverse thinking is a fun variation to turn&nbsp;
the problem upside down and come up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

161

00:14:43.360  -->  00:14:48.400
new ideas. The solutions you come up with for&nbsp;
the reverse challenge can help you envision&nbsp;&nbsp;

162

00:14:48.400  -->  00:14:53.219
what the opposite could be, bringing you&nbsp;
closer to the solution you really need.

163

00:14:53.600  -->  00:14:58.640
Once the ideation session is complete, it's time&nbsp;
to turn the ideas into concepts for prototyping&nbsp;&nbsp;

164

00:14:58.640  -->  00:15:05.360
and testing. It's not possible to test every&nbsp;
idea, so how do you choose which ideas to pursue?

165

00:15:05.360  -->  00:15:09.600
This is called the "convergent&nbsp;
phase," where ideas are evaluated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

166

00:15:09.600  -->  00:15:14.902
compared, ranked, clustered, and even dumped&nbsp;
to bring together some great ideas to act on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

167

00:15:15.040  -->  00:15:20.473
The following methods can help you select the best&nbsp;
idea at the end of an ideation session:&nbsp;

168

00:15:23.200  -->  00:15:28.421
With dot voting, all members get a number&nbsp;
of votes to choose their favorite ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

169

00:15:28.720  -->  00:15:34.000
Ideas generated during the ideation sessions are&nbsp;
written on individual post-its and members can&nbsp;&nbsp;

170

00:15:34.000  -->  00:15:39.840
vote by using stickers or a marker to put a dot on&nbsp;
the post-it corresponding to the ideas they like.&nbsp;&nbsp;

171

00:15:40.880  -->  00:15:47.403
This process allows each member to have an&nbsp;
equal say in choosing from the nominated ideas.&nbsp;

172

00:15:48.480  -->  00:15:53.840
The four categories method encourages you to&nbsp;
consider crazy but meaningful ideas. In this&nbsp;&nbsp;

173

00:15:53.840  -->  00:15:58.480
way the teams can take into consideration&nbsp;
also potentially interesting ideas with&nbsp;&nbsp;

174

00:15:58.480  -->  00:16:02.449
low degree of rationality but&nbsp;
potentially interesting outcomes.

175

00:16:02.800  -->  00:16:09.440
In this method, divide the ideas into 4&nbsp;
categories: most rational, most delightful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

176

00:16:10.560  -->  00:16:17.086
darling and long shot. Then have the team&nbsp;
select a few ideas from each category.

177

00:16:17.280  -->  00:16:19.840
The “rational choice” refers to ideas that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

178

00:16:19.840  -->  00:16:23.328
most logical and provide the&nbsp;
highest amount of utility.

179

00:16:23.440  -->  00:16:25.600
The “most likely to delight” refers to ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

180

00:16:25.600  -->  00:16:30.287
that will potentially deliver a high&nbsp;
degree of gratification or pleasure.

181

00:16:30.560  -->  00:16:33.760
The “darling” refers to the&nbsp;
evaluators’ favorite ideas.

182

00:16:33.760  -->  00:16:37.680
The “long shot” refers to ideas&nbsp;
that involve a great risk but&nbsp;&nbsp;

183

00:16:37.680  -->  00:16:40.528
equally great rewards if successful.

184

00:16:41.040  -->  00:16:45.440
This method ensures that you cover more&nbsp;
ground and include different types of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

185

00:16:46.080  -->  00:16:51.726
This can be combined with the dot voting method&nbsp;
to choose the winners from each category.

186

00:16:54.560  -->  00:17:00.560
A How, Now, Wow matrix helps groups brainstorm&nbsp;
together, plan ideas and organize their thoughts.

187

00:17:01.760  -->  00:17:06.800
Start by drawing a 2×2 matrix. One&nbsp;
axis indicates the originality of&nbsp;&nbsp;

188

00:17:06.800  -->  00:17:12.240
the idea and the other axis shows the ease&nbsp;
of implementation. Label the quadrants as:

189

00:17:13.040  -->  00:17:19.040
Now. Normal ideas that are easy to implement.&nbsp;
These are low-hanging fruit and solutions&nbsp;&nbsp;

190

00:17:19.040  -->  00:17:25.461
to fill existing gaps in processes. These&nbsp;
typically result in incremental benefits.

191

00:17:26.080  -->  00:17:31.920
How. Original ideas that are impossible to&nbsp;
implement. These are groundbreaking ideas in terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

192

00:17:31.920  -->  00:17:39.594
of impact, but absolutely impossible right now due&nbsp;
to current technological or budgetary constraints.

193

00:17:40.080  -->  00:17:46.240
Wow. Original ideas that are easy to implement.&nbsp;
Wow ideas are those that have the potential for&nbsp;&nbsp;

194

00:17:46.240  -->  00:17:50.177
job-shifting change and are immediately possible.

195

00:17:50.560  -->  00:17:55.440
Place the ideas in the corresponding quadrant.&nbsp;
You can use dot voting to decide which ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

196

00:17:55.440  -->  00:18:00.952
are best in each quadrant. The ideas with&nbsp;
the most votes move on to the next stage.

197

00:18:02.240  -->  00:18:07.120
The affinity diagram is a method that allows&nbsp;
you to collect large amounts of data and&nbsp;&nbsp;

198

00:18:07.120  -->  00:18:13.840
organize them into groups or themes based on their&nbsp;
relationships. It works best with post-its. Take&nbsp;&nbsp;

199

00:18:13.840  -->  00:18:19.920
one post-it and make it the first of a group. Take&nbsp;
the next post-it and ask, "Is this similar to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

200

00:18:19.920  -->  00:18:26.080
first or different?". Then place it in the first&nbsp;
group or in its own group. The sticky notes allow&nbsp;&nbsp;

201

00:18:26.080  -->  00:18:31.200
the design team to easily hang and move bits of&nbsp;
data to create clusters of similar themes, groups,&nbsp;&nbsp;

202

00:18:31.200  -->  00:18:37.520
and patterns. Name the clusters to help you create&nbsp;
an information structure and discover themes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

203

00:18:37.520  -->  00:18:43.275
Then rank the most important clusters above the&nbsp;
less important clusters or use dot voting to vote.&nbsp;

204

00:18:43.760  -->  00:18:46.560
We covered a lot in this lesson.&nbsp;
Let's summarize all the ideation&nbsp;&nbsp;

205

00:18:46.560  -->  00:18:51.520
methods and techniques we discussed.
The ideation phase represents an important&nbsp;&nbsp;

206

00:18:51.520  -->  00:18:56.793
transition step from getting to know your users&nbsp;
and the problem to coming up with solutions.

207

00:18:56.960  -->  00:19:00.480
The main goal is to discover and&nbsp;
explore new angles and avenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

208

00:19:00.480  -->  00:19:06.366
To think outside the box, question the obvious,&nbsp;
challenge the norm and come up with new ideas.

209

00:19:06.480  -->  00:19:10.928
To facilitate a fruitful ideation&nbsp;
session, I've shared some best practices.

210

00:19:11.120  -->  00:19:14.160
Change of environment. Get away from the office.&nbsp;

211

00:19:14.160  -->  00:19:18.800
Create a relaxed environment. Make sure&nbsp;
participants feel comfortable and safe.&nbsp;

212

00:19:18.800  -->  00:19:24.080
No judgments - Ideation sessions are not the&nbsp;
place to argue or question other members' ideas.&nbsp;

213

00:19:24.080  -->  00:19:27.920
There are no bad ideas.. Encourage&nbsp;
weird, crazy and wild ideas.&nbsp;

214

00:19:27.920  -->  00:19:31.680
Aim for quantity.
Build on each other's ideas.&nbsp;

215

00:19:31.680  -->  00:19:36.000
Apply structure. Although it is a&nbsp;
creative process, focus is essential.

216

00:19:36.560  -->  00:19:41.120
There are hundreds of ideation techniques&nbsp;
you can use to spark innovative ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

217

00:19:41.120  -->  00:19:45.600
At the beginning of the ideation phase, it is good&nbsp;
to opt for techniques that stimulate as many ideas&nbsp;&nbsp;

218

00:19:45.600  -->  00:19:51.194
as possible. At the end, you'll use techniques&nbsp;
that help you explore and test your ideas.

219

00:19:51.360  -->  00:19:54.000
We discussed the most common&nbsp;
ideation techniques, like&nbsp;

220

00:19:54.000  -->  00:19:56.928
Brainstorm
Bodystorming&nbsp;

221

00:19:57.040  -->  00:20:00.000
Challenge Assumptions
Mindmap&nbsp;

222

00:20:00.080  -->  00:20:03.007
Provocation
SCAMPER&nbsp;

223

00:20:03.120  -->  00:20:06.634
Storyboarding
and Worst Possible Idea.

224

00:20:07.280  -->  00:20:10.160
Techniques that help you&nbsp;
select and test your ideas are&nbsp;

225

00:20:10.160  -->  00:20:13.760
Dot voting
Four Categories Method&nbsp;

226

00:20:13.760  -->  00:20:17.134
Now Wow How Matrix
Affinity Maps&nbsp;

227

00:20:17.280  -->  00:20:21.703
Once you've completed the ideation phase,&nbsp;
move on to prototyping and user testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

228

00:20:21.920  -->  00:20:27.088
This is where you put your ideas to the test and&nbsp;
highlight any kinks that need to be ironed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

229

00:20:27.280  -->  00:20:30.371
Join me in the next lesson,&nbsp;
where I'll tell you all about it.
