1

00:00:07,520  -->  00:00:10,904
One of the many UX myths 
is that it's just a fad.

2

00:00:10,904  -->  00:00:15,380
But in reality, the value of UX design is
enormous.

3

00:00:15,380  -->  00:00:20,710
Not only for the end user, but also for the
business or the brand behind the user experience.

4

00:00:20,710  -->  00:00:22,376
So why is UX so important?

5

00:00:23,040  -->  00:00:28,310
A good UX process increases a project's chances
of success when it eventually comes to market

6

00:00:28,310  -->  00:00:32,898
or it can play an important role in helping
to achieve business goals and generate revenue.

7

00:00:33,562  -->  00:00:35,730
UX has a direct impact on the user.

8

00:00:35,730  -->  00:00:41,130
An ineffective UX almost always translates
into a user leaving the experience unsatisfied,

9

00:00:41,130  -->  00:00:46,269
while a strong and compelling UX builds trust
and respect for a brand.

10

00:00:46,962  -->  00:00:51,565
Designing first-class user experiences is
therefore absolutely essential to ensure

11

00:00:51,565  -->  00:00:54,808
customer satisfaction and build brand loyalty.

12

00:00:54,808  -->  00:01:00,786
After all, only when a product or service
is problem-free and enjoyable does a user return.

13

00:01:01,368  -->  00:01:06,460
As a result, companies that prioritize UX
receive several benefits, including increased

14

00:01:06,460  -->  00:01:11,021
brand awareness, higher financial returns,
and improved customer satisfaction.

15

00:01:11,613  -->  00:01:15,342
Let’s look at examples where good UX can
have a significant business impact.

16

00:01:15,891  -->  00:01:19,369
Design-driven companies have a strong competitive
advantage.

17

00:01:19,369  -->  00:01:23,380
Because they have the ability to understand
the unique needs, mindsets, and behaviors

18

00:01:23,380  -->  00:01:25,389
of their customers.

19

00:01:25,389  -->  00:01:30,679
According to a study by the Design Management
Institute, design-driven companies consistently

20

00:01:30,679  -->  00:01:37,450
outperformed the S&amp;P 500 
over a 10-year period by 219%.

21

00:01:37,450  -->  00:01:42,399
In addition, a study commissioned by Adobe
found that design thinking provides a measurable

22

00:01:42,399  -->  00:01:44,701
competitive advantage in business.

23

00:01:45,178  -->  00:01:52,109
Design-driven companies reported a 41% higher
market share, 50% more loyal customers, and

24

00:01:52,109  -->  00:01:55,534
46% overall competitive advantage.

25

00:01:56,761  -->  00:02:01,430
The better the experience with a product or
service, the more likely customers will continue

26

00:02:01,430  -->  00:02:03,249
to use and recommend it.

27

00:02:03,249  -->  00:02:07,919
It’s becoming an increasing factor in overall
customer loyalty.

28

00:02:07,919  -->  00:02:11,960
Retain current customers by providing them
with a meaningful experience and sustaining

29

00:02:11,960  -->  00:02:13,940
their relationship with the brand.

30

00:02:13,940  -->  00:02:18,560
By focusing on the users and what is relevant
to them, they can stay satisfied when engaging

31

00:02:18,560  -->  00:02:19,860
with a brand.

32

00:02:19,860  -->  00:02:24,310
When a user is happy with a brand, they will
engage with it again and again, and even refer

33

00:02:24,310  -->  00:02:26,515
it to their friends and families.

34

00:02:27,670  -->  00:02:30,000
The biggest impact is revenue.

35

00:02:30,000  -->  00:02:35,420
Clarity and consistency in UX help users move
quickly and efficiently through for example

36

00:02:35,420  -->  00:02:37,750
an online checkout process.

37

00:02:37,750  -->  00:02:42,350
For major online stores like Amazon, a marginal
improvement in the UX of the checkout process

38

00:02:42,350  -->  00:02:46,600
can make up the difference in 
millions of dollars in sales.

39

00:02:46,600  -->  00:02:50,557
UX can also help sell more products 
efficiently and effectively.

40

00:02:50,918  -->  00:02:55,950
For example, in an online store, if the UX
is easy for a customer, the overall sales process

41

00:02:55,950  -->  00:03:03,265
improves because the user has a purchasing
experience that is simple, enjoyable, and intuitive.

42

00:03:04,280  -->  00:03:09,670
Or how about improving the user experience
through cross-selling, wish lists, recommendations,

43

00:03:09,670  -->  00:03:16,970
and other functionalities that increase ease
of use, as well as extra revenue for the company.

44

00:03:17,692  -->  00:03:21,990
UX can also save a lot of 
unnecessary costs for a company.

45

00:03:21,990  -->  00:03:27,160
First, cost savings can come from fewer errors
in applications and interaction experiences.

46

00:03:27,160  -->  00:03:32,830
By taking the time upfront to build user-friendly
experiences, they won't have to be reworked

47

00:03:32,830  -->  00:03:34,630
in the future.

48

00:03:34,630  -->  00:03:35,630
Second.

49

00:03:35,630  -->  00:03:41,480
By putting the user at the center of the design
process, UX ensures that user needs are met.

50

00:03:41,480  -->  00:03:46,060
Beforehand, rather than at the end of the
development process, which happens often enough,

51

00:03:46,060  -->  00:03:50,421
you can determine the most critical functionality
to build into your interface through user

52

00:03:50,421  -->  00:03:52,528
research and testing.

53

00:03:53,120  -->  00:03:58,278
You no longer have to worry about developing
redundant functions that a user would never use.

54

00:03:59,133  -->  00:04:02,850
A third example is to reduce 
customer support costs.

55

00:04:02,850  -->  00:04:08,540
By providing the user with the necessary,
useful information, such as faqs, manuals,

56

00:04:08,540  -->  00:04:13,490
videos, and the like, you can already answer
many questions that would otherwise have to

57

00:04:13,490  -->  00:04:17,190
be handled by a customer service representative.

58

00:04:17,190  -->  00:04:22,161
Or you can reduce returns because users feel
they can't use the product or service effectively.

59

00:04:23,490  -->  00:04:28,300
The better the UX on a website, the more likely
users are to spend more time on the site and

60

00:04:28,300  -->  00:04:30,569
return at a later date.

61

00:04:30,569  -->  00:04:34,510
More traffic and time spent on the site or
app has a direct correlation with rankings

62

00:04:34,510  -->  00:04:36,790
in search engines such as Google.

63

00:04:36,790  -->  00:04:40,389
And the higher the ranking, the more additional
traffic will visit the site.

64

00:04:40,389  -->  00:04:43,870
In short, better experiences mean more customers.

65

00:04:45,141  -->  00:04:49,530
And finally, the better the UX, the better
the overall impression of the brand.

66

00:04:50,093  -->  00:04:54,340
A bad experience leads to a bad brand perception.

67

00:04:54,340  -->  00:04:58,720
UX is not something that many users notice
unless it is bad or broken.

68

00:04:58,720  -->  00:05:02,120
In those cases, users will definitely notice
the experience.

69

00:05:02,120  -->  00:05:05,099
The user may leave angry or decide not to
return.

70

00:05:05,099  -->  00:05:10,372
Or even worse, talk about the negative experience
with others or leave a bad review.

71

00:05:11,210  -->  00:05:15,050
So bad UX can be extremely costly 
and damaging to a business.

72

00:05:15,960  -->  00:05:19,939
A good user experience, on the other hand,
leads to positive brand impressions and

73

00:05:19,939  -->  00:05:22,860
a higher brand value in the long term.

74

00:05:22,860  -->  00:05:26,520
When users find what they need, they gain
confidence in a company and its ability to

75

00:05:26,520  -->  00:05:29,430
deliver on its brand promises.

76

00:05:29,430  -->  00:05:33,610
When a user feels a website is credible and
understands their needs, they are more likely

77

00:05:33,610  -->  00:05:36,949
to trust the brand and continue to buy a product.

78

00:05:37,772  -->  00:05:40,860
As you can see, the value of UX is enormous.

79

00:05:40,860  -->  00:05:45,669
In summary, the areas where good UX can have
a positive business impact include:

80

00:05:45,669  -->  00:05:50,469
Competitive advantage, 
customer satisfaction and loyalty.

81

00:05:50,469  -->  00:05:52,081
Revenue

82

00:05:52,456  -->  00:05:54,000
Cost reduction

83

00:05:54,739  -->  00:05:56,237
Increase traffic

84

00:05:56,785  -->  00:05:58,785
Brand expression

85

00:05:59,630  -->  00:06:04,298
