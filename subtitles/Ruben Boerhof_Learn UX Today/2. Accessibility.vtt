00:00:07.730  -->  00:00:13.440
Accessibility is closely related to usability,
which we discussed in the previous lesson.

2

00:00:13.440  -->  00:00:17.990
When websites or apps are poorly designed,
they create accessibility barriers.

3

00:00:17.990  -->  00:00:22.500
This makes it difficult or even impossible
for some people to use it.

4

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:28.078
Combining accessibility and usability standards
ensures that it is usable for everyone.

5

00:00:28.078  -->  00:00:30.029
Access for all is essential.

6

00:00:30.029  -->  00:00:35.030
The United Nations defines access to information
as a fundamental human right.

7

00:00:35.030  -->  00:00:38.940
To provide equal access and opportunities
for people of different abilities.

8

00:00:38.940  -->  00:00:44.637
And in more and more countries, meeting basic
accessibility standards has become a legal rule.

9

00:00:44.637  -->  00:00:47.989
So accessibility is no longer just a nice
thing to have.

10

00:00:48.879  -->  00:00:53.109
The problem, however, is that we often idealize
our users.

11

00:00:53.109  -->  00:00:57.467
As a result, we rarely think of disabilities
as potential friction points for

12

00:00:57.467  -->  00:01:00.547
a users' interaction with a product.

13

00:01:00.547  -->  00:01:04.189
So we fail to design a solution, 
which means they continue 

14

00:01:04.189  -->  00:01:06.280
to struggle to use our products.

15

00:01:06.280  -->  00:01:10.107
It is therefore crucial to test your designs
for accessibility.

16

00:01:10.768  -->  00:01:14.653
Special needs can be divided
into the following categories:

17

00:01:14.653  -->  00:01:17.950
Visual. These are sensitivity disorders.

18

00:01:17.950  -->  00:01:22.310
Examples are color blindness, 
visual impairment or blindness.

19

00:01:22.310  -->  00:01:29.160
Auditory disabilities range from mild hearing
loss in one or both ears to complete deafness.

20

00:01:29.160  -->  00:01:31.984
Some people with hearing impairments 
can hear sounds

21

00:01:31.984  -->  00:01:34.320
but sometimes not enough to understand all speech.

22

00:01:34.320  -->  00:01:36.390
Especially if there is background noise.

23

00:01:36.931  -->  00:01:40.070
Motor. These are physical limitations.

24

00:01:40.070  -->  00:01:45.770
Examples include limitations in muscle control,
limitations of sensation, joint disorders,

25

00:01:45.770  -->  00:01:50.260
pain that interferes with movement, or missing
limbs.

26

00:01:50.260  -->  00:01:55.013
Cognitive disabilities include neurological
disorders, as well as behavioral

27

00:01:55.013  -->  00:01:57.025
and mental health disorders.

28

00:01:57.025  -->  00:02:01.470
They influence how well people understand
information.

29

00:02:01.470  -->  00:02:06.750
Speech disabilities include problems producing
speech that is recognizable to others.

30

00:02:06.750  -->  00:02:11.700
For example, the loudness or clarity of a
person's voice can be difficult to understand.

31

00:02:11.700  -->  00:02:13.700
From stuttering to silence.

32

00:02:14.303  -->  00:02:17.790
It’s important to know that not all disabilities
are permanent.

33

00:02:17.790  -->  00:02:21.493
The limitations can also be temporary or situational.

34

00:02:21.493  -->  00:02:26.819
You should also consider how a situation can
affect the visual, auditory or motor skills

35

00:02:26.819  -->  00:02:28.569
of your users.

36

00:02:28.569  -->  00:02:32.569
To do this, you need to consider the context
of your user journeys.

37

00:02:32.569  -->  00:02:36.819
Are there any tasks that are usually performed
while the user is on the move and thus has

38

00:02:36.819  -->  00:02:38.939
limited mobility?

39

00:02:38.939  -->  00:02:42.300
Or in the dark, where visibility is limited.

40

00:02:42.300  -->  00:02:47.379
Is the user using your app in a noisy place,
limiting hearing capabilities?

41

00:02:47.379  -->  00:02:51.569
Or is the person in a situation that causes
a lot of stress, which can affect thinking

42

00:02:51.569  -->  00:02:53.659
and understanding.

43

00:02:53.659  -->  00:02:58.510
These limitations can be permanent, temporary
or situational.

44

00:02:58.510  -->  00:02:59.719
Permanent.

45

00:02:59.719  -->  00:03:06.415
These are people with disabilities, such as
loss of limbs, vision, hearing, or speech.

46

00:03:06.415  -->  00:03:12.663
Temporary is when a person has short-term
injuries—for example, wearing a plaster cast.

47

00:03:12.663  -->  00:03:16.049
Temporary loss of vision because of cataract.

48

00:03:16.049  -->  00:03:19.180
Or if a person suffers from an ear infection.

49

00:03:19.180  -->  00:03:24.510
These temporary limitations can occur as a
result of an accident, surgery, or medication.

50

00:03:24.740  -->  00:03:26.138
Situational.

51

00:03:26.138  -->  00:03:31.459
This is when people experience limitations
due to situational aspects.

52

00:03:31.459  -->  00:03:35.400
For example, a new parent holding her child
in her arms.

53

00:03:35.400  -->  00:03:39.859
A driver who is distracted when operating
the radio or navigation.

54

00:03:39.859  -->  00:03:42.609
Or if they see less because of bright sunlight.

55

00:03:42.609  -->  00:03:47.011
Or a bartender who has a bad hearing in a
crowded bar due to a loud environment.

56

00:03:48.160  -->  00:03:50.560
Accessibility is not a barrier to design.

57

00:03:50.560  -->  00:03:55.689
On the contrary, although accessibility is
primarily aimed at people with disabilities,

58

00:03:55.689  -->  00:03:58.219
it ultimately benefits everybody.

59

00:03:58.219  -->  00:04:03.950
It allows users to interact with products
in different ways, making it more user-friendly.

60

00:04:03.950  -->  00:04:08.868
Let's look at two real-life examples where
everybody benefits from accessible design.

61

00:04:10.178  -->  00:04:16.250
Forms of voice control such as Siri, Google
Assistant, and Alexa were intended to allow

62

00:04:16.250  -->  00:04:20.680
visually impaired people to easily navigate
their devices by voice.

63

00:04:20.680  -->  00:04:26.200
Everyone now uses voice control for all sorts
of things, such as checking the weather, playing

64

00:04:26.200  -->  00:04:30.234
music, turning on lights, or looking up information.

65

00:04:30.234  -->  00:04:33.320
Subtitles were intended for the deaf and hard
of hearing.

66

00:04:33.320  -->  00:04:35.260
They now benefit everyone.

67

00:04:35.260  -->  00:04:39.460
For example, to understand the content when
you are in a noisy environment.

68

00:04:39.460  -->  00:04:41.400
Or where you need to be quiet.

69

00:04:41.400  -->  00:04:45.750
An increasing proportion of YouTube videos
are watched with subtitles only.

70

00:04:46.985  -->  00:04:51.029
Now that we've established that accessible
design benefits everybody.

71

00:04:51.029  -->  00:04:54.653
Let's take a look at how it benefits businesses.
A few examples.

72

00:04:55.915  -->  00:04:57.829
Expend the market reach

73

00:04:57.829  -->  00:05:02.070
It is often thought that people with disabilities
are only a small target group.

74

00:05:02.070  -->  00:05:08.450
Yet, according to the World Health Organization,
15% of the world is disabled, equal to more

75

00:05:08.450  -->  00:05:10.750
than a billion people.

76

00:05:10.750  -->  00:05:15.705
Designing products accessible to this community
will increase market reach and income.

77

00:05:15.848  -->  00:05:17.980
Improved usability.

78

00:05:17.980  -->  00:05:22.190
If a website or app works well for people
with special needs, it will work well for

79

00:05:22.190  -->  00:05:24.170
all users.

80

00:05:24.170  -->  00:05:29.770
Usability improvements increase repeat users,
conversions, and therefore revenue.

81

00:05:30.431  -->  00:05:33.310
Improved Search Engine Optimization.

82

00:05:33.310  -->  00:05:38.370
Many of the accessibility guidelines are the
same as search engine optimization techniques.

83

00:05:38.370  -->  00:05:43.680
Search engine bots can only use text content,
so they see web pages the same way a blind

84

00:05:43.680  -->  00:05:45.090
user would.

85

00:05:45.090  -->  00:05:49.485
Improving accessibility also means improving
search results.

86

00:05:50.059  -->  00:05:52.580
Richer experiences.

87

00:05:52.580  -->  00:05:57.240
Accessibility guidelines advocate using multiple
views to make content more understandable

88

00:05:57.240  -->  00:05:58.623
and useful.

89

00:05:58.623  -->  00:06:04.099
This makes experiences richer for other users
as there is a variety of content types.

90

00:06:04.099  -->  00:06:08.622
In WhatsApp, for example, everyone can choose
how they want to communicate.

91

00:06:08.622  -->  00:06:14.437
Via text, speech, images, gifs, or emoticons.

92

00:06:14.437  -->  00:06:19.772
This provides a more personalized, engaging
experience for all users.

93

00:06:20.777  -->  00:06:25.363
Easier maintenance: 
Designing and developing for accessibility

94

00:06:25.363  -->  00:06:27.770
usually means following standards.

95

00:06:27.770  -->  00:06:32.844
It's much easier to support and maintain designs
and code created to known standards.

96

00:06:33.849  -->  00:06:35.720
Positive brand values.

97

00:06:35.720  -->  00:06:40.670
Major brands, including Apple, have paved
the way for accessible design.

98

00:06:40.670  -->  00:06:45.730
By supporting accessibility for marginalized
groups, you generate positive feelings for

99

00:06:45.730  -->  00:06:47.218
your brand.

100

00:06:47.218  -->  00:06:51.099
This ensures credibility and strengthens loyalty.

101

00:06:51.960  -->  00:06:58.150
More and more countries are enacting legislation
on the accessibility of digital products.

102

00:06:58.150  -->  00:07:02.924
Web accessibility is already a legal requirement
in many situations.

103

00:07:04.188  -->  00:07:06.710
Design always starts with empathy.

104

00:07:06.710  -->  00:07:11.000
But accessible design is something that many
people are not familiar with.

105

00:07:11.000  -->  00:07:15.580
As beautiful as designs are, they are not
always functional and do not match the wishes

106

00:07:15.580  -->  00:07:16.840
of the users.

107

00:07:16.840  -->  00:07:19.634
In-depth research is therefore necessary.

108

00:07:20.619  -->  00:07:25.710
Observe how people use your product in their
environment and identify their needs.

109

00:07:25.710  -->  00:07:29.502
Collecting this knowledge is crucial to making
accessible products.

110

00:07:29.502  -->  00:07:35.280
I’ll share some best practices and guidelines
to keep in mind when designing for accessibility.

111

00:07:36.372  -->  00:07:41.240
Visually impaired people depend on changing
the presentation into shapes that better suit

112

00:07:41.240  -->  00:07:43.473
their specific needs.

113

00:07:43.473  -->  00:07:49.570
For example, if your audience is a bit older
or visually impaired, spend extra time on readability.

114

00:07:49.570  -->  00:07:52.802
After all, large text is easier to read.

115

00:07:52.802  -->  00:07:58.370
Make customizable settings for increasing
and decreasing text size or spacing.

116

00:07:58.370  -->  00:08:00.830
So that people can adapt to what suits them.

117

00:08:00.830  -->  00:08:03.920
They also often use magnifiers.

118

00:08:03.920  -->  00:08:08.532
Make sure that the text can be enlarged without
losing its structure.

119

00:08:08.532  -->  00:08:13.340
Color blindness is real and more common than
you might think.

120

00:08:13.340  -->  00:08:18.120
Use colors and contrast so that both colorblind
and partially sighted people can distinguish

121

00:08:18.120  -->  00:08:20.063
text and objects.

122

00:08:20.063  -->  00:08:24.650
This means choosing and testing 
color combinations carefully.

123

00:08:24.650  -->  00:08:29.200
Using high contrast and making sure not only
color is used to convey information.

124

00:08:29.200  -->  00:08:34.019
Always ensure that important information has
extra elements, such as icons or text, to

125

00:08:34.019  -->  00:08:36.149
support the color.

126

00:08:37.471  -->  00:08:42.389
Visually impaired people may prefer to use
a keyboard or speech recognition software

127

00:08:42.389  -->  00:08:45.699
for input, as they cannot see the mouse pointer.

128

00:08:45.699  -->  00:08:50.210
For a website, it is important that it can
be operated with a keyboard.

129

00:08:50.210  -->  00:08:54.670
Visually impaired people use software called
screen readers to read everything on the web.

130

00:08:54.670  -->  00:08:58.550
Make sure you follow the guidelines to ensure
that a website can be read by a screen reader

131

00:08:58.550  -->  00:09:02.434
and that all elements follow 
a natural reading structure.

132

00:09:03.573  -->  00:09:08.819
Multimedia on the web offers many possibilities
for people with a hearing impairment.

133

00:09:08.819  -->  00:09:14.490
But it also presents a challenge when content
is not designed to be accessible.

134

00:09:14.490  -->  00:09:18.410
Video content is an important tool to convey
information visually.

135

00:09:18.410  -->  00:09:23.300
It is important that there are alternatives,
such as text transcription or subtitling,

136

00:09:23.300  -->  00:09:26.815
to make this information accessible to the
deaf and hard of hearing.

137

00:09:27.677  -->  00:09:31.328
For the hearing impaired, 
high-quality foreground sound

138

00:09:31.328  -->  00:09:35.930
which is distinguishable from background noise, 
is very important.

139

00:09:35.930  -->  00:09:42.000
Such as the options to stop, pause and adjust
the volume of audio content.

140

00:09:42.000  -->  00:09:47.269
For some people with hearing disabilities,
sign language is the primary language.

141

00:09:47.269  -->  00:09:51.449
They may not read the 
written language very fluently.

142

00:09:51.449  -->  00:09:56.399
Providing important information in sign language
and using simpler text supplemented with images,

143

00:09:56.399  -->  00:10:02.445
charts and other illustrations makes web content
more understandable for many people.

144

00:10:03.479  -->  00:10:09.899
Some people cannot use a mouse, including
many older users with limited fine motor skills.

145

00:10:09.899  -->  00:10:12.329
An accessible website does not depend on the
mouse.

146

00:10:12.329  -->  00:10:16.339
It makes all functionality available from
a keyboard.

147

00:10:16.339  -->  00:10:21.350
People with reduced mobility use a range of
assistive technologies, depending on the severity

148

00:10:21.350  -->  00:10:22.958
of the disability.

149

00:10:22.958  -->  00:10:28.380
Most of these work via the keyboard, so providing
full keyboard access to a website is an important

150

00:10:28.380  -->  00:10:31.809
first step in accessibility.

151

00:10:31.809  -->  00:10:36.410
Also objects or moving elements that are too
small make interaction with a site or app

152

00:10:36.410  -->  00:10:38.759
difficult for this group.

153

00:10:38.759  -->  00:10:43.870
Providing large clickable areas, sufficient
time to complete tasks, and error correction

154

00:10:43.870  -->  00:10:47.668
options for forms are important design aspects.

155

00:10:48.753  -->  00:10:54.920
People with cognitive, learning, and neurological
disabilities often rely on:

156

00:10:54.920  -->  00:10:59.050
Clearly structured content that facilitates
overview and orientation.

157

00:10:59.050  -->  00:11:05.319
This helps people with a wide range of special
needs to understand and navigate a website.

158

00:11:05.319  -->  00:11:09.879
Make sure the reading level of your website
is as simple and clear as possible for the

159

00:11:09.879  -->  00:11:12.180
intended audience.

160

00:11:12.180  -->  00:11:17.149
Use simple words, and simpler grammar, which
is supplemented with pictures, charts, and

161

00:11:17.149  -->  00:11:18.700
other illustrations.

162

00:11:18.700  -->  00:11:23.660
So that people who are not very good at your
language can read without much effort.

163

00:11:24.349  -->  00:11:27.880
Make the content shorter so that the listening
does not take too long.

164

00:11:27.880  -->  00:11:30.548
Make it easy to jump within long pages.

165

00:11:30.548  -->  00:11:32.899
Make it easy to scan.

166

00:11:32.899  -->  00:11:37.550
Limit the use of noticeable but unimportant
elements and animations such as scrolling

167

00:11:37.550  -->  00:11:39.719
text and popups.

168

00:11:40.581  -->  00:11:46.720
Speech-impaired people face barriers to speech-based
services, such as a telephone help desk as

169

00:11:46.720  -->  00:11:50.459
the sole means of communicating with an organization.

170

00:11:50.459  -->  00:11:55.997
Alternative means of communication such as
email or a text chat to communicate help this group.

171

00:11:56.920  -->  00:12:00.350
To make products more accessible, it's good
to have some guidelines.

172

00:12:00.350  -->  00:12:03.584
The internationally recognized standards 
for websites are the 

173

00:12:03.584  -->  00:12:06.307
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

174

00:12:06.307  -->  00:12:10.647
They have a set of guidelines organized under
4 principles:

175

00:12:10.647  -->  00:12:13.619
Perceivable
Operable

176

00:12:13.619  -->  00:12:16.419
Understandable
Robust

177

00:12:17.137  -->  00:12:23.230
The first principle focuses on making content
available and recognizable to all users.

178

00:12:23.230  -->  00:12:28.680
Regardless of how the user perceives information
or the tools they use to access it, such as

179

00:12:28.680  -->  00:12:30.158
screen readers.

180

00:12:30.158  -->  00:12:31.860
A few examples:

181

00:12:31.860  -->  00:12:37.029
An example guideline is to provide text alternatives
for non-text content.

182

00:12:37.029  -->  00:12:39.809
This can be changed to other forms that people
need.

183

00:12:39.809  -->  00:12:47.375
Such as large letters, braille, speech, symbols,
or simpler language.

184

00:12:47.375  -->  00:12:50.990
An example is an ALT tag in the code of web
pages.

185

00:12:50.990  -->  00:12:56.269
You see a photo, but someone with a screen
reader hears what the photo is about.

186

00:12:56.269  -->  00:12:58.499
Provide synchronized alternatives to multimedia.

187

00:12:58.499  -->  00:13:02.323
Such as video subtitles or transcripts.

188

00:13:02.323  -->  00:13:07.720
Create content that can be presented in different
ways without losing information, meaning,

189

00:13:07.720  -->  00:13:09.170
or structure.

190

00:13:09.170  -->  00:13:12.680
For example with a simpler layout.

191

00:13:12.680  -->  00:13:18.990
Sighted users scan and read content through
visual cues such as headlines or bold text.

192

00:13:18.990  -->  00:13:24.410
Likewise, web content must be structured in
a logical way so that assistive technology

193

00:13:24.410  -->  00:13:28.084
can process it and translate it to the user.

194

00:13:28.917  -->  00:13:33.300
Make it easier for users to see and hear content.

195

00:13:33.300  -->  00:13:39.050
Never use color just to convey important information,
such as error messages.

196

00:13:39.050  -->  00:13:43.808
If the only sign of an error message in a
form is a red border in front of the input field

197

00:13:43.808  -->  00:13:47.389
it may not be noticed by 
visually impaired people.

198

00:13:47.389  -->  00:13:52.483
So add text and a descriptive visual element
like an icon.

199

00:13:54.149  -->  00:13:59.360
The second principle states that all components
of the user interface and navigation must

200

00:13:59.360  -->  00:14:01.271
be operational.

201

00:14:01.271  -->  00:14:05.459
An example guideline is to make all functionality
available from a keyboard.

202

00:14:05.459  -->  00:14:10.089
In this way, you offer the user an alternative
means of navigation.

203

00:14:10.089  -->  00:14:15.459
For example, a user can navigate a web page
using only the tab key on the keyboard.

204

00:14:15.459  -->  00:14:18.791
But also make it easier to use inputs other
than the keyboard.

205

00:14:20.083  -->  00:14:24.079
Give users plenty of time to read and use
the content.

206

00:14:24.079  -->  00:14:29.410
For example, when the user's session is about
to end, as you often see on a bank website.

207

00:14:29.410  -->  00:14:33.569
The user should always have the option to
continue the session and not be logged out

208

00:14:33.569  -->  00:14:35.641
without warning.

209

00:14:35.641  -->  00:14:39.579
Do not use content that causes seizures or
physical reactions.

210

00:14:39.579  -->  00:14:43.110
So limit the use of flashing elements.

211

00:14:43.110  -->  00:14:47.209
Help users navigate, find content, and determine
where they are.

212

00:14:47.209  -->  00:14:50.829
Breadcrumbs are a good example 
of secondary navigation.

213

00:14:50.829  -->  00:14:56.296
This gives the user a visual representation
of his exact location on the site.

214

00:14:56.296  -->  00:15:00.800
It is good practice to make these steps clickable
so that the user can move forward or backward

215

00:15:00.800  -->  00:15:02.935
in their journey.

216

00:15:03.829  -->  00:15:08.420
The third principle focuses on simplifying
the content so that it is easy to understand.

217

00:15:08.420  -->  00:15:14.439
The user must know how to operate the user
interface and access information

218

00:15:14.439  -->  00:15:16.660
Make text readable and understandable.

219

00:15:16.660  -->  00:15:20.959
So don't use words and phrases that could
be misunderstood.

220

00:15:20.959  -->  00:15:27.499
Be sure to set the language in a webpage's
code so screen readers can access it.

221

00:15:27.499  -->  00:15:31.420
Make content appear and work in predictable
ways.

222

00:15:31.420  -->  00:15:36.019
Notify the user if an action will change the
context of the user experience.

223

00:15:36.019  -->  00:15:39.589
For example, when you change the language
or country.

224

00:15:39.589  -->  00:15:43.209
Also, be careful about adding links that open
new windows.

225

00:15:43.209  -->  00:15:49.160
This can be disorienting to the user if they
have no visual context about what is happening.

226

00:15:49.677  -->  00:15:52.420
Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

227

00:15:52.420  -->  00:15:55.399
Prevent the user from entering incorrect data.

228

00:15:55.399  -->  00:16:00.643
For example, by labeling the input fields
with visible and descriptive labels.

229

00:16:00.643  -->  00:16:05.329
If the user is expected to enter a contact
number, no alphabetic characters are allowed

230

00:16:05.329  -->  00:16:07.234
to be entered.

231

00:16:08.153  -->  00:16:15.139
The last principle - robust - focuses on compatibility
with current and future user tools.

232

00:16:15.139  -->  00:16:20.747
The content and its interpretation must be
reliable and compatible with different devices,

233

00:16:20.747  -->  00:16:24.540
browsers and assistive technologies.

234

00:16:24.540  -->  00:16:29.279
As technology evolves, content still needs
to be accessible on as many devices and

235

00:16:29.279  -->  00:16:31.509
user agents as possible.

236

00:16:31.509  -->  00:16:36.699
To maximize compatibility with future user
tools, the websites should be built to known

237

00:16:36.699  -->  00:16:39.234
and credible technical standards.

238

00:16:40.519  -->  00:16:44.790
To achieve compliance, there are testable
success criteria for each guideline, that

239

00:16:44.790  -->  00:16:47.620
reflect the priority of support:

240

00:16:47.620  -->  00:16:54.240
A is for essential: If not, assistive technology
may not be able to read, understand, or operate

241

00:16:54.240  -->  00:16:56.790
the page or display.

242

00:16:56.790  -->  00:16:59.139
AA: Ideal support.

243

00:16:59.139  -->  00:17:02.059
Required for many government websites.

244

00:17:02.059  -->  00:17:04.532
AAA means specialized support.

245

00:17:04.532  -->  00:17:11.209
This is usually reserved for parts of websites
and web apps that serve a specialized audience.

246

00:17:11.209  -->  00:17:15.750
Triple-A compliance usually requires a website
to be built from scratch with accessibility

247

00:17:15.750  -->  00:17:16.750
in mind.

248

00:17:16.750  -->  00:17:20.949
You can find the link to the complete checklist
below this video.

249

00:17:22.069  -->  00:17:24.799
As you can see, accessibility is complicated.

250

00:17:24.799  -->  00:17:29.110
An accessibility evaluation is not a simple
pass or fail test.

251

00:17:29.110  -->  00:17:34.012
Instead, it's a holistic assessment of the
content, design, and code.

252

00:17:34.012  -->  00:17:38.340
Aiming to highlight areas that users are likely
to find challenging.

253

00:17:38.340  -->  00:17:44.625
No interface is fully accessible, so the accessibility
evaluation is an ongoing process.

254

00:17:45.343  -->  00:17:51.269
There are four methods for conducting accessibility
evaluation that can be used alone or in combination

255

00:17:51.269  -->  00:17:53.269
with each other.

256

00:17:53.269  -->  00:17:58.172
Automated evaluation
Manual evaluation

257

00:17:58.172  -->  00:18:03.929
Usability testing
Assistive technology testing

258

00:18:03.929  -->  00:18:08.360
There are many tools that help streamline
the evaluation process.

259

00:18:08.360  -->  00:18:14.720
Some focus on specific aspects of digital
accessibility, such as color contrast validator.

260

00:18:14.720  -->  00:18:19.390
Other tools such as WAVE perform a general
check and help uncover important structural

261

00:18:19.390  -->  00:18:23.919
issues that are difficult to spot on complex
interfaces.

262

00:18:23.919  -->  00:18:28.230
The WebAIM browser extension is as simple
as opening the website in the browser and

263

00:18:28.230  -->  00:18:32.049
a window will open on the left with a list
of errors.

264

00:18:32.049  -->  00:18:38.084
W3 has an extensive list of web accessibility
assessment tools for all levels and purposes.

265

00:18:38.084  -->  00:18:41.100
They are a good starting point for the evaluation
process.

266

00:18:41.100  -->  00:18:47.610
But, they do not cover all accessibility issues
and should not completely replace a manual audit.

267

00:18:48.580  -->  00:18:53.539
To know if you have taken accessibility and
assistive technologies into account, you also

268

00:18:53.539  -->  00:18:55.737
need to test manually.

269

00:18:55.737  -->  00:19:00.100
This is a process of checking and reviewing
the interface against a list of standards

270

00:19:00.100  -->  00:19:03.390
and making recommendations for improvement.

271

00:19:03.390  -->  00:19:05.100
This is time-consuming.

272

00:19:05.100  -->  00:19:10.049
It often takes longer to view and interact
with websites if you have a disability, so

273

00:19:10.049  -->  00:19:13.953
simulating a disability will experience the
same delays.

274

00:19:13.953  -->  00:19:19.799
This is useful because it is valuable to be
aware of the difficulties users are experiencing.

275

00:19:19.799  -->  00:19:25.220
Test your product in different browsers, on
different devices, and on operating systems.

276

00:19:25.220  -->  00:19:30.460
Download a screen reader or use the built-in
for your operating system and view your website

277

00:19:30.460  -->  00:19:32.450
through it.

278

00:19:32.450  -->  00:19:34.799
Navigate your website using only a keyboard.

279

00:19:34.799  -->  00:19:40.279
Boost your fonts up to 200% and see what it
does to your website.

280

00:19:40.279  -->  00:19:45.539
Change the viewport to responsive, then resize
it to any size and see what happens to your website.

281

00:19:45.539  -->  00:19:49.779
Test how your website works on a slow 
2G or 3G connection.

282

00:19:49.779  -->  00:19:51.706
And so on …

283

00:19:52.568  -->  00:19:54.980
A web accessibility assessment is usually

284

00:19:54.980  -->  00:19:58.880
performed based on the 
web content accessibility guidelines.

285

00:19:58.880  -->  00:20:01.220
You can use this as a comprehensive checklist.

286

00:20:01.220  -->  00:20:05.289
Or you can use another checklist, such as
Gibson's Accessibility Matrix.

287

00:20:05.289  -->  00:20:08.446
Links to these checklists 
can be found below the video.

288

00:20:09.452  -->  00:20:14.399
You can already take many steps through this
automatic and manual accessibility assessment.

289

00:20:14.399  -->  00:20:20.127
But, nothing beats observing real people with
impaired abilities using your interface.

290

00:20:20.127  -->  00:20:23.382
Getting feedback on the challenges they face.

291

00:20:23.382  -->  00:20:28.240
The process is like a standard usability test:
each user is asked to perform a series of

292

00:20:28.240  -->  00:20:32.670
common tasks on the interface and to comment
on things that work well and areas that could

293

00:20:32.670  -->  00:20:34.558
be improved.

294

00:20:34.558  -->  00:20:39.120
These sessions should be conducted in person,
to give the observer an accurate picture of

295

00:20:39.120  -->  00:20:43.736
the wider context and any tools
or interactions off-screen.

296

00:20:45.028  -->  00:20:50.870
Many users with limited skills rely on assistive
technologies to help them navigate the interface,

297

00:20:50.870  -->  00:20:56.139
so it's important to be aware of what this
process can look like and the potential challenges

298

00:20:56.139  -->  00:20:58.029
users may face.

299

00:20:58.029  -->  00:21:03.589
This can be done as part of the manual evaluation
process, usability testing, or both.

300

00:21:04.336  -->  00:21:07.159
I hope you got a better idea of what accessibility
means.

301

00:21:07.159  -->  00:21:12.753
It is a complex and continuously changing
field, so even after this lesson

302

00:21:12.753  -->  00:21:15.521
it is good to stay informed about this topic.

303

00:21:15.521  -->  00:21:18.951
First. Let's summarize what we've covered
in this lesson.

304

00:21:19.468  -->  00:21:25.560
Accessibility is closely related to usability,
which we discussed in the previous lesson.

305

00:21:25.560  -->  00:21:32.399
Combining accessibility and usability standards
ensures that it is usable for everyone.

306

00:21:32.399  -->  00:21:33.769
Access for all is essential.

307

00:21:33.769  -->  00:21:39.230
The United Nations defines access to information
as a fundamental human right.

308

00:21:39.230  -->  00:21:44.831
And in more and more countries, meeting basic
accessibility standards has become a legal rule.

309

00:21:45.990  -->  00:21:49.470
Special needs can be divided into the following
categories:

310

00:21:49.470  -->  00:21:51.130
Visual.

311

00:21:51.130  -->  00:21:53.770
These are sensitivity disorders.

312

00:21:53.770  -->  00:21:58.283
Examples are color blindness, visual impairment,
or blindness.

313

00:21:58.283  -->  00:22:02.780
Auditory disabilities range from mild hearing
loss to complete deafness.

314

00:22:02.780  -->  00:22:06.747
Motor. These are physical limitations.

315

00:22:07.320  -->  00:22:11.643
Cognitive disabilities include neurological
disorders, as well as behavioral

316

00:22:11.643  -->  00:22:14.529
and mental health disorders.

317

00:22:14.529  -->  00:22:19.686
Speech disorders include problems producing
speech that is recognizable to others.

318

00:22:19.686  -->  00:22:23.289
It is important to know that not all disabilities
are permanent.

319

00:22:23.289  -->  00:22:27.830
The limitations can also be temporary or situational.

320

00:22:27.830  -->  00:22:34.236
You should also consider how a situation can
affect your users' visual, auditory, or motor skills.

321

00:22:35.320  -->  00:22:37.570
Accessibility is not a barrier to design.

322

00:22:37.570  -->  00:22:42.700
On the contrary, although accessibility is
primarily aimed at people with disabilities,

323

00:22:42.700  -->  00:22:44.880
it ultimately benefits everyone.

324

00:22:44.880  -->  00:22:48.000
And it is good for business as well.

325

00:22:48.507  -->  00:22:51.029
Design always starts with empathy.

326

00:22:51.029  -->  00:22:55.730
But accessible design is something that many
people are not familiar with.

327

00:22:55.730  -->  00:22:59.610
As beautiful as designs are, they are not
always functional and do not match the wishes

328

00:22:59.610  -->  00:23:01.110
of the user.

329

00:23:01.110  -->  00:23:04.399
In-depth research is therefore necessary.

330

00:23:04.399  -->  00:23:08.200
To make products more accessible, it's good
to have some guidelines.

331

00:23:08.200  -->  00:23:11.546
We've looked at the internationally recognized
standards for websites:

332

00:23:11.546  -->  00:23:14.556
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

333

00:23:14.556  -->  00:23:18.950
They have a set of guidelines organized under
4 principles:

334

00:23:18.950  -->  00:23:21.429
Perceivable
Operable

335

00:23:21.429  -->  00:23:24.000
Understandable
Robust

336

00:23:25.895  -->  00:23:30.710
An accessibility evaluation is not a simple
pass or fail test.

337

00:23:30.710  -->  00:23:36.308
Instead, it's a holistic assessment of the
content, design, and code.

338

00:23:36.308  -->  00:23:42.140
There are four methods for conducting accessibility
evaluation that can be used alone or in combination

339

00:23:42.140  -->  00:23:43.830
with each other.

340

00:23:43.830  -->  00:23:48.039
Automated evaluation
Manual evaluation

341

00:23:48.039  -->  00:23:51.886
Usability testing
Assistive technology testing

342

00:23:53.437  -->  00:23:58.509
Empathizing and understanding the user is
crucial to design for accessibility.

343

00:23:58.509  -->  00:24:00.502
To design for people.

344

00:24:00.502  -->  00:24:04.279
In the next lesson on user research, I'll
tell you how to understand user behavior,

345

00:24:04.279  -->  00:24:06.301
needs, and their pain points.
