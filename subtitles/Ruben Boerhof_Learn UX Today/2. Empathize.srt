1

00:00:07,419  -->  00:00:10,880
In this lesson, we'll discuss the early stages
of a design process.

2

00:00:10,880  -->  00:00:17,310
But before investing time in a design thinking
process, most teams start with discovery.

3

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:22,500
A discovery is a stage prior to the UX design
process and always starts with a broad objective.

4

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:26,930
Because once teams have already decided which
product to build, it is no longer a discovery.

5

00:00:26,930  -->  00:00:31,660
The discovery phase seamlessly transitions
into the empathize and define phase.

6

00:00:31,660  -->  00:00:35,390
The first phases of the design thinking process.

7

00:00:35,390  -->  00:00:39,842
The double diamond model introduced by the
UK Design Council illustrates this process

8

00:00:39,842  -->  00:00:46,547
and you can see how it contains the same phases
as the first four steps of the design thinking process.

9

00:00:46,549  -->  00:00:51,019
This model shows the two different problem-solving
approaches and shows the contrast between

10

00:00:51,019  -->  00:00:55,370
the divergent thinking and the convergent
thinking approach.

11

00:00:55,370  -->  00:01:00,389
A discovery starts broad and requires team
members to explore the problem space

12

00:01:00,389  -->  00:01:02,850
 in many different ways.

13

00:01:02,850  -->  00:01:09,370
Divergent thinking allows you to generate
ideas and develop multiple solutions to a problem.

14

00:01:09,380  -->  00:01:15,140
Convergent thinking is the opposite of divergent
thinking and focuses on achieving one well-defined

15

00:01:15,140  -->  00:01:17,490
solution to a problem.

16

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:22,210
This happens in the define phase, which we
will discuss in the next lesson.

17

00:01:22,210  -->  00:01:27,320
The steps ensure that we do not jump into
creating solutions prematurely, or with biases

18

00:01:27,320  -->  00:01:29,590
and assumptions.

19

00:01:29,590  -->  00:01:33,119
Through this approach, the team focuses on
the issues that will have the greatest impact

20

00:01:33,119  -->  00:01:35,000
on that outcome.

21

00:01:35,000  -->  00:01:40,130
Well-executed discoveries ensure that any
solutions proposed later are desirable to users,

22

00:01:40,130  -->  00:01:46,347
viable for the organization, and achievable
with the available technology.

23

00:01:46,347  -->  00:01:49,041
What to do during the discovery phase?

24

00:01:49,041  -->  00:01:51,369
Discoveries are best made with multidisciplinary teams.

25

00:01:51,369  -->  00:01:55,719
Depending on the size of the problem and the
activities, the number of people involved

26

00:01:55,719  -->  00:01:59,259
and the type of roles can vary.

27

00:01:59,259  -->  00:02:03,657
There are many different types of activities that can be 
performed, but these are the most common ones.

28

00:02:05,679  -->  00:02:09,119
With exploratory research you learn new things

29

00:02:09,119  -->  00:02:12,820
about a domain and generate new, open insights.

30

00:02:12,820  -->  00:02:17,020
By conducting this research, you will learn
more about the problem space.

31

00:02:17,020  -->  00:02:22,069
Commonly used research methods include user
interviews, diary studies, focus groups, and

32

00:02:22,069  -->  00:02:24,690
field studies with a representative group
of users.

33

00:02:24,690  -->  00:02:29,299
We’ll discuss more about conducting user
research in chapter 3.

34

00:02:29,299  -->  00:02:34,150
Stakeholders often have unique knowledge,
insight and data about internal processes

35

00:02:34,150  -->  00:02:38,624
behind the scenes and about the users who
interact with them.

36

00:02:38,624  -->  00:02:42,810
Stakeholder interviews provide an additional
layer of insight that helps the team understand

37

00:02:42,810  -->  00:02:47,400
the magnitude of the problem and also the
feasibility of subsequent solutions.

38

00:02:47,400  -->  00:02:51,909
During the discovery, the team works with
stakeholders to understand the overarching

39

00:02:51,909  -->  00:02:56,009
business goals and desired outcomes and get
answers to questions like:

40

00:02:56,009  -->  00:02:57,650
 "what do we want to achieve?"

41

00:02:57,650  -->  00:03:01,069
or 'what does success look like?'

42

00:03:01,069  -->  00:03:06,629
Workshops align team members and stakeholders
and are a useful tactic for discovery.

43

00:03:06,629  -->  00:03:09,500
The type of workshop is very dependent on
the problem.

44

00:03:09,500  -->  00:03:14,069
Some workshops that are commonly used in discovery
are a kickoff workshop at the beginning to

45

00:03:14,069  -->  00:03:20,252
create alignment, problem-framing workshops,
or service-blueprinting workshops.

46

00:03:20,252  -->  00:03:24,299
At the end of the discovery, the team has
a detailed understanding of the problem.

47

00:03:24,299  -->  00:03:26,566
And the results it should pursue.

48

00:03:26,566  -->  00:03:30,870
The end of a discovery can also be a 
decision not to proceed with the project.

49

00:03:30,870  -->  00:03:33,300
For example, if there is no user need.

50

00:03:34,730  -->  00:03:40,110
The discovery phase transitions into the first
phase of the design thinking process: 'empathize'.

51

00:03:40,110  -->  00:03:44,840
It is the first step towards thoughtfully
designed products that prove that the designers

52

00:03:44,840  -->  00:03:49,161
built with a compassionate eye for their users.

53

00:03:49,161  -->  00:03:54,620
Understanding the user is arguably the most
crucial step in UX methodology.

54

00:03:54,620  -->  00:03:58,560
Without a good understanding of the user,
the solutions you create have a high chance

55

00:03:58,560  -->  00:04:00,090
of failing.

56

00:04:00,090  -->  00:04:03,840
But this can be a deceptively challenging
process.

57

00:04:03,840  -->  00:04:08,090
Many companies think they know a lot about
their target customers, but the UX process

58

00:04:08,090  -->  00:04:13,190
requires you to understand users at a level
of detail often overlooked by marketing managers

59

00:04:13,190  -->  00:04:15,509
or business owners.

60

00:04:15,509  -->  00:04:18,489
Empathy is the ability to understand other
people's feelings.

61

00:04:18,489  -->  00:04:22,650
It's about becoming aware of what other people
are feeling and sharing their emotions.

62

00:04:22,650  -->  00:04:25,960
It serves as a way to connect yourself and
another.

63

00:04:25,960  -->  00:04:31,673
When you say "put yourself in someone else's
shoes," you are referring to empathy.

64

00:04:31,673  -->  00:04:34,830
Empathy is often confused with sympathy.

65

00:04:34,830  -->  00:04:39,720
While empathy involves sharing another person's
feelings or emotions by putting yourself in

66

00:04:39,720  -->  00:04:41,250
their position.

67

00:04:41,250  -->  00:04:44,670
Sympathy is about showing concern or compassion
for someone else.

68

00:04:44,670  -->  00:04:49,950
In this phase, design teams conduct research
to gain personal insight into the needs of

69

00:04:49,950  -->  00:04:51,050
their users.

70

00:04:51,050  -->  00:04:55,480
It is important to set your own assumptions
aside, and to gain insight into the world

71

00:04:55,480  -->  00:04:59,570
of the users by observing and consulting them.

72

00:04:59,570  -->  00:05:03,530
Only in this way can you really understand
the experiences, motivations and problems

73

00:05:03,530  -->  00:05:05,304
of users.

74

00:05:05,304  -->  00:05:10,107
Empathy is therefore a crucial skill for increasing
user satisfaction.

75

00:05:10,107  -->  00:05:14,750
Simply put, empathy allows designers to better
understand users, because you can relate to

76

00:05:14,750  -->  00:05:17,130
them and their emotions.

77

00:05:17,130  -->  00:05:19,200
So to empathize is to research.

78

00:05:19,200  -->  00:05:22,880
You need to become completely objective before
you can see through the eyes of your users

79

00:05:22,880  -->  00:05:24,940
and interpret their points of view.

80

00:05:24,940  -->  00:05:27,860
To do this you have a range of options.

81

00:05:28,522  -->  00:05:30,934
The first option is interviewing users.

82

00:05:30,934  -->  00:05:34,322
The most fundamental user research method
for the UX design process is the 

83

00:05:34,322  -->  00:05:36,782
one-on-oneuser interview.

84

00:05:36,803  -->  00:05:40,200
It is important to ask open questions and
not guiding questions.

85

00:05:40,200  -->  00:05:45,520
Also, try to listen unbiased instead of focusing
on points that confirm your beliefs.

86

00:05:45,520  -->  00:05:50,660
A second option is to observe or shadow real
users.

87

00:05:50,660  -->  00:05:54,250
You observe these users while they try to
solve an issue with your design.

88

00:05:54,250  -->  00:05:59,350
Even more effective is observing users in
their natural environment.

89

00:05:59,350  -->  00:06:04,830
This often yields additional insights beyond
what is revealed in a standard user interview.

90

00:06:04,830  -->  00:06:06,490
Video journals and diary studies.

91

00:06:06,490  -->  00:06:11,196
With this method you ask users to record or
write down their own experiences

92

00:06:11,196  -->  00:06:13,050
 in approaching a problem.

93

00:06:13,050  -->  00:06:15,880
These may capture their pain points more accurately.

94

00:06:15,880  -->  00:06:18,180
Another option is online surveys.

95

00:06:18,180  -->  00:06:23,090
If you are redesigning an existing website,
polling current users for their feedback provides

96

00:06:23,090  -->  00:06:27,100
great insight on what works and what doesn't.

97

00:06:27,100  -->  00:06:28,960
And the last option is immerse.

98

00:06:28,960  -->  00:06:33,250
This means put yourself in the shoes of your
customer and try out your own product in a

99

00:06:33,250  -->  00:06:34,720
real situation.

100

00:06:34,720  -->  00:06:36,440
Or that of the competition.

101

00:06:36,440  -->  00:06:39,700
It's great for building contextual knowledge
and empathy.

102

00:06:39,700  -->  00:06:41,330
These are just a few methods.

103

00:06:41,330  -->  00:06:46,130
We'll discuss more methods in 
our user research lesson in chapter 3.

104

00:06:46,130  -->  00:06:50,360
To understand people and connect with their
experiences and problems, you need to be an

105

00:06:50,360  -->  00:06:52,270
empathetic observer.

106

00:06:52,270  -->  00:06:54,270
How do you do that?

107

00:06:54,270  -->  00:06:58,384
Empathy in research is not something that
can be taken for granted, but it is a skill

108

00:06:58,384  -->  00:07:00,510
that can be cultivated.

109

00:07:01,022  -->  00:07:03,450
As you approach your research, 
you’ll need to:

110

00:07:03,450  -->  00:07:04,790
Let go of your ego.

111

00:07:04,790  -->  00:07:07,440
In other words, it's not about you.

112

00:07:07,440  -->  00:07:12,130
To understand and empathize with your users,
you need to let go of your assumptions and

113

00:07:12,130  -->  00:07:13,130
biases.

114

00:07:13,130  -->  00:07:18,880
Instead, focus on your users' thoughts, 
feelings, and experiences.

115

00:07:18,880  -->  00:07:20,030
Embrace humility.

116

00:07:20,030  -->  00:07:24,740
You may be an expert in your field, but that
doesn't mean you know everything.

117

00:07:24,740  -->  00:07:29,760
Practice humility while observing your users
and learning about their experiences.

118

00:07:29,760  -->  00:07:32,020
Be open to the fact that 
you can learn from them.

119

00:07:32,020  -->  00:07:35,150
Be humble enough to accept new perspectives.

120

00:07:35,150  -->  00:07:39,363
And consider solutions you would not have
thought of on your own.

121

00:07:39,363  -->  00:07:40,940
Actively listen.

122

00:07:40,940  -->  00:07:44,250
Good listeners put aside their assumptions.

123

00:07:44,250  -->  00:07:46,610
Don't interrupt or discourage your users.

124

00:07:46,610  -->  00:07:49,710
Instead, let them finish their thoughts so
that you can understand their perspective

125

00:07:49,710  -->  00:07:51,720
and experience.

126

00:07:51,720  -->  00:07:55,770
In the next phase of the design thinking process,
you will synthesize the results and define

127

00:07:55,770  -->  00:07:57,240
the problem.

128

00:07:57,240  -->  00:08:01,509
One tool to help you record your lessons from
this stage is to create an empathy map.

129

00:08:02,470  -->  00:08:07,130
An empathy map is a visualization of the 
attitude and behavior of the users.

130

00:08:07,130  -->  00:08:10,190
It helps teams to have a shared 
understanding of user needs.

131

00:08:10,190  -->  00:08:15,670
In doing so, it also reveals any holes in
the existing user data.

132

00:08:15,670  -->  00:08:20,520
As their name suggests, empathy maps simply
help us build empathy with our end users.

133

00:08:20,520  -->  00:08:24,600
Once created, it should act as a source of
truth throughout the project, protecting it

134

00:08:24,600  -->  00:08:28,810
from bias or baseless assumptions.

135

00:08:28,810  -->  00:08:37,524
Traditional empathy maps are split into 
4 quadrants: say, think, do and feel with the

136

00:08:37,524  -->  00:08:40,051
user in the middle.

137

00:08:40,051  -->  00:08:44,880
The Says quadrant contains what the user says
out loud in an interview or other survey.

138

00:08:44,880  -->  00:08:49,310
Ideally, it should contain direct quotes 
from research.

139

00:08:49,310  -->  00:08:52,980
The Thinks quadrant captures what the user
thinks throughout the experience.

140

00:08:52,980  -->  00:08:54,110
What is important to the user?

141

00:08:54,110  -->  00:08:56,070
What keeps the user busy?

142

00:08:56,070  -->  00:09:00,649
Pay special attention to what users think,
but may not be willing to say.

143

00:09:00,649  -->  00:09:02,160
Why are they hesitant to share?

144

00:09:02,160  -->  00:09:07,511
Are they insecure, self-conscious, 
polite or afraid?

145

00:09:07,511  -->  00:09:10,790
The Does quadrant contains the actions that
the user takes.

146

00:09:10,790  -->  00:09:13,300
What does the user physically 
do from the survey?

147

00:09:13,300  -->  00:09:15,683
How does the user work?

148

00:09:15,683  -->  00:09:19,959
The Feels quadrant is about the emotional
state of the user.

149

00:09:19,959  -->  00:09:22,279
Ask yourself: what worries the user?

150

00:09:22,279  -->  00:09:23,959
What does the user get excited about?

151

00:09:23,959  -->  00:09:27,560
What does the user think of the experience?

152

00:09:27,560  -->  00:09:31,370
So how do you create a valid and actionable
empathy map?

153

00:09:31,370  -->  00:09:35,620
Start by drawing this diagram on a whiteboard
or in a digital tool.

154

00:09:35,620  -->  00:09:37,370
Gather the research you will be using.

155

00:09:37,370  -->  00:09:42,189
Empathy mapping is a qualitative method, so
you need qualitative input such as user interviews,

156

00:09:42,189  -->  00:09:46,959
field studies, diary studies 
or qualitative surveys.

157

00:09:46,959  -->  00:09:51,600
Based on the research, each team member writes
what strikes them, and adds it to the corresponding

158

00:09:51,600  -->  00:09:53,694
quadrant on the whiteboard.

159

00:09:53,694  -->  00:09:57,439
For instance, in the says quadrant you can
find quotes like:

160

00:09:57,439  -->  00:09:59,589
“I don’t understand what to do from here.”

161

00:09:59,589  -->  00:10:01,615
“This is too expensive.”

162

00:10:01,615  -->  00:10:04,670
“I was expecting something different.”

163

00:10:04,670  -->  00:10:08,000
The Thinks quadrant captures what the user
thinks throughout the experience.

164

00:10:08,000  -->  00:10:09,192
For example,

165

00:10:09,192  -->  00:10:10,940
“This product seems confusing.”

166

00:10:10,940  -->  00:10:14,910
“Or this looks good”
“Do they think I’m stupid?”

167

00:10:14,910  -->  00:10:18,410
“I wonder if there’s a better alternative.”

168

00:10:18,410  -->  00:10:20,910
In The Does quadrant you put actions that
the user takes.

169

00:10:20,910  -->  00:10:21,910
Such as

170

00:10:21,910  -->  00:10:25,209
Refreshes the page
Search for an alternative

171

00:10:25,209  -->  00:10:27,930
Walks away from product

172

00:10:27,930  -->  00:10:31,560
And the Feels quadrant is about the emotional
state of the user.

173

00:10:31,560  -->  00:10:36,010
Overwhelmed: too many options
Impatient: pages load too slowly

174

00:10:36,010  -->  00:10:40,940
Worried: they are doing something wrong
When everyone is ready, the team collectively

175

00:10:40,940  -->  00:10:45,860
go through the stickies on the board and group
similar notes that belong to the same quadrant.

176

00:10:45,860  -->  00:10:50,389
The activity of clustering facilitates discussion
and alignment.

177

00:10:50,389  -->  00:10:52,370
Which outliers are there?

178

00:10:52,370  -->  00:10:54,709
Which themes recurred in all quadrants?

179

00:10:54,709  -->  00:10:57,300
Which themes exist in only one quadrant?

180

00:10:57,300  -->  00:11:00,730
What gaps are there in our understanding?

181

00:11:00,730  -->  00:11:06,540
You may see inconsistencies, ambiguities or
overlaps between notes in the quadrants.

182

00:11:06,540  -->  00:11:10,272
For example, apparently positive actions but
also negative quotes

183

00:11:10,272  -->  00:11:12,290
that come from the same user.

184

00:11:12,290  -->  00:11:16,249
These are important signals to look out for
as they can be very valuable in learning more

185

00:11:16,249  -->  00:11:18,360
about the user.

186

00:11:18,360  -->  00:11:23,019
If you don't have anything to put in a particular
quadrant, it's a strong signal that you need

187

00:11:23,019  -->  00:11:28,149
more user research before moving forward with
the design process.

188

00:11:28,149  -->  00:11:33,140
Keep empathy maps "alive" by reviewing and
adapting them as you do more research.

189

00:11:33,140  -->  00:11:38,649
The information from the empathy map, also
helps you to create or update your personas

190

00:11:38,649  -->  00:11:40,379
and customer journey maps.

191

00:11:40,379  -->  00:11:44,329
As we discussed in chapter 1, in the lesson
about UX inputs.

192

00:11:44,329  -->  00:11:47,660
To create these types of maps you must do
user research.

193

00:11:47,660  -->  00:11:50,649
Otherwise these are not based on anything
and have no value.

194

00:11:50,649  -->  00:11:54,283
You’ll learn more on doing 
research in chapter 3.

195

00:11:54,283  -->  00:11:59,160
Empathy requires practice, but as you cultivate
empathy in your design thinking, you’ll

196

00:11:59,160  -->  00:12:01,809
be a more effective UX professional.

197

00:12:01,809  -->  00:12:04,508
Let’s recap what we’ve discussed 
in this lesson.

198

00:12:05,170  -->  00:12:10,350
I started by showing you the double diamond
model which shows the contrast between the

199

00:12:10,350  -->  00:12:13,759
divergent thinking and the convergent thinking
approach.

200

00:12:13,759  -->  00:12:18,755
Through this approach, teams focus on the
issues that will have the greatest impact..

201

00:12:19,567  -->  00:12:22,370
Discoveries are best made with multidisciplinary
teams.

202

00:12:22,370  -->  00:12:27,759
We discussed some common activities that you
can do with your team during a discovery phase.

203

00:12:27,759  -->  00:12:35,269
The discovery phase transitions into the first
phase of the design thinking process: 'empathize'.

204

00:12:35,269  -->  00:12:37,839
Empathy is the ability to understand other
people's feelings.

205

00:12:37,839  -->  00:12:41,790
To put yourself in the shoes of the user.

206

00:12:41,790  -->  00:12:43,730
To empathize is to research.

207

00:12:43,730  -->  00:12:47,610
You need to become completely objective before
you can see through the eyes of your users

208

00:12:47,610  -->  00:12:50,389
and understand their points of view.

209

00:12:50,389  -->  00:12:54,520
To do this I have shown you a range of options.

210

00:12:54,520  -->  00:12:58,430
Empathy in research is not something that
can be taken for granted, but it is a skill

211

00:12:58,430  -->  00:13:00,000
that can be cultivated.

212

00:13:00,000  -->  00:13:03,029
I gave you three tips to do this.

213

00:13:03,029  -->  00:13:06,899
At last I have shown you how to create an
empathy map, to help you record your lessons

214

00:13:06,899  -->  00:13:08,754
from this stage.

215

00:13:08,754  -->  00:13:13,889
Once you have a good idea of who your users
are and, most importantly, their wants, needs,

216

00:13:13,889  -->  00:13:18,545
and pain-points, you’re ready to turn this
empathy into an actionable problem statement.

217

00:13:18,545  -->  00:13:20,642
Which I will show you in the next lesson.
