1

00:00:07,260  -->  00:00:13,020
Content strategy is an important discipline within&nbsp;
UX. A solid content strategy framework&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:13,020  -->  00:00:16,200
ensures a high-quality, relevant UX for the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:21,780
But before discussing the role of content&nbsp;
strategy, it is important to first define what&nbsp;&nbsp;

4

00:00:21,780  -->  00:00:24,824
we mean by 'content'. 
What is it exactly?

5

00:00:25,597  -->  00:00:28,087
Simply put, content = information.&nbsp;

6

00:00:28,560  -->  00:00:34,320
Whenever information is created and delivered&nbsp;
to people, in whatever form, it is content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:34,320  -->  00:00:42,180
Long text, short text, single words, audio,&nbsp;
video, infographics, chatbots, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

8

00:00:42,720  -->  00:00:45,669
Content is central to any user experience.

9

00:00:46,597  -->  00:00:50,848
So why is content important? 
The answer&nbsp;is quite simple.

10

00:00:50,848  -->  00:00:55,955
It is impossible to design a&nbsp;
great user experience for bad content.

11

00:00:55,955  -->  00:01:01,816
In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;user experiences without content would be&nbsp;
meaningless and useless artifacts. 

12

00:01:01,816  -->  00:01:06,543
Imagine your&nbsp;favorite app without any content. 
Would you still&nbsp;use it? 

13

00:01:06,543  -->  00:01:09,901
Would it even be possible? Probably not.&nbsp;

14

00:01:10,680  -->  00:01:14,340
Content provides users with the information&nbsp;
they need to achieve their goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15

00:01:15,000  -->  00:01:19,740
You often see companies investing heavily in the&nbsp;
design of the interaction and visual experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:20,460  -->  00:01:23,640
And not fill that experience&nbsp;
with useful and relevant content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:01:24,600  -->  00:01:28,860
It is often seen as an afterthought and is&nbsp;
not considered until everything is ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;

18

00:01:29,640  -->  00:01:34,878
Whereas if the content does not meet the needs of&nbsp;
your users they may not return to your experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:35,220  -->  00:01:38,280
If you're passionate about&nbsp;
creating better user experiences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

20

00:01:38,280  -->  00:01:43,449
you can't help but care about delivering&nbsp;
useful, actionable, and engaging content.&nbsp;

21

00:01:44,640  -->  00:01:50,040
Content strategists or UX writers are responsible&nbsp;
for the content design and strategy in a company.&nbsp;&nbsp;

22

00:01:50,982  -->  00:01:54,660
It is a discipline in itself.&nbsp;
And the field is very wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:01:54,660  -->  00:01:59,520
In this lesson, we'll cover the essentials of&nbsp;
content strategy and the basics you need to know.

24

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:04,740
Content strategy can be defined&nbsp;
as guiding the creation, delivery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

25

00:02:04,740  -->  00:02:07,929
and governance of useful and usable content.

26

00:02:08,700  -->  00:02:14,280
A strategy helps you identify what already&nbsp;
exists, what needs to come, and most importantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

27

00:02:14,280  -->  00:02:20,700
why it needs to be created. It is a user-centric&nbsp;
practice that empowers organizations to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:02:20,700  -->  00:02:25,860
strategic decisions based on user empathy.&nbsp;
So what is a content strategy all about?&nbsp;

29

00:02:27,720  -->  00:02:33,585
Content strategy connects your organization's&nbsp;
content efforts with business goals and&nbsp;user needs.&nbsp;

30

00:02:33,585  -->  00:02:38,324
Everything you do related to&nbsp;
content must conform to those requirements.

31

00:02:39,060  -->  00:02:43,080
You can divide content strategy into&nbsp;
four areas. They are defined by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

32

00:02:43,080  -->  00:02:48,780
Brain Traffic team as the components of the&nbsp;
content strategy. This Content Quad is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:02:48,780  -->  00:02:54,120
most widely used and respected visualization&nbsp;
of content strategy. The work of a content&nbsp;&nbsp;

34

00:02:54,120  -->  00:03:00,000
strategist usually falls into one of two&nbsp;
groups: content design or system design.&nbsp;

35

00:03:01,680  -->  00:03:07,680
In the top half you will find content design.&nbsp;
Content design is the process of using data&nbsp;&nbsp;

36

00:03:07,680  -->  00:03:13,620
and evidence to give audiences the content they&nbsp;
need when they need it, and in a way they expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;

37

00:03:13,620  -->  00:03:17,570
A term coined by Sarah Richards of&nbsp;
Content Design London. &nbsp;

38

00:03:17,570  -->  00:03:23,590
The two areas of&nbsp;focus that intersect in content design 
are&nbsp;editorial strategy and experience design.&nbsp;

39

00:03:25,200  -->  00:03:28,920
Editorial elements such as&nbsp;
voice and tone, audiences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

40

00:03:28,920  -->  00:03:34,380
and brand guidelines represent the quadrant on&nbsp;
the left. You try to answer questions such as:

41

00:03:34,380  -->  00:03:38,212
What is our editorial mission?
Who are our target groups?&nbsp;

42

00:03:38,212  -->  00:03:41,152
What is our position?
What is our voice and tone?&nbsp;

43

00:03:41,640  -->  00:03:44,546
What brand and language&nbsp;
standards do we need to meet?&nbsp;

44

00:03:44,940  -->  00:03:47,400
Where and when will you deliver the content?&nbsp;

45

00:03:49,320  -->  00:03:56,033
Experience elements such as user needs, customer&nbsp;
journeys, and content layout make up the right&nbsp;part.

46

00:03:56,033  -->  00:04:01,500
Effective content design requires you to&nbsp;
know your audience. Their needs, preferences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

47

00:04:01,500  -->  00:04:07,080
and expectations. When you balance these&nbsp;
with the business goals, it produces useful,&nbsp;&nbsp;

48

00:04:07,080  -->  00:04:12,180
actionable content that people will love.&nbsp;
Experience design answers questions such as:

49

00:04:12,180  -->  00:04:16,680
Who are your end-users?
What are the needs and preferences of our users?&nbsp;

50

00:04:17,220  -->  00:04:19,080
What are our customers' journeys?&nbsp;

51

00:04:19,080  -->  00:04:23,880
What does our content ecosystem look like?
What formats will our content take?&nbsp;

52

00:04:24,660  -->  00:04:27,720
How will design patterns shape&nbsp;
our content on mobile and beyond?&nbsp;

53

00:04:29,700  -->  00:04:35,340
At the bottom we find systems design. 
Systems&nbsp;design is the process of defining the&nbsp;&nbsp;

54

00:04:35,340  -->  00:04:42,000
architecture, modules, interfaces, and&nbsp;
data for a system to satisfy specified&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp;

55

00:04:42,000  -->  00:04:46,260
To maintain the&nbsp;integrity of content 
over time and to enable us to

56

00:04:46,260  -->  00:04:52,224
create, deliver, and manage content to consistent&nbsp;
standards and meaningful results. 

57

00:04:52,224  -->  00:04:58,466
The two areas of&nbsp;&nbsp;focus that intersect in content system design&nbsp;
are content structure and process design.&nbsp;

58

00:05:00,000  -->  00:05:04,694
Structure also called content engineering&nbsp;
represents the left side.

59

00:05:04,694  -->  00:05:10,620
It's about how&nbsp;content is organized, such as tags and&nbsp;
categories. Depending on the field,&nbsp;&nbsp;

60

00:05:10,620  -->  00:05:15,540
this can go as far as browsing a web page to&nbsp;
personalization and artificial intelligence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

61

00:05:16,560  -->  00:05:19,801
Structure focuses on the following considerations:

62

00:05:20,100  -->  00:05:22,740
How do we organize content&nbsp;
so that users can find it?&nbsp;

63

00:05:23,400  -->  00:05:25,920
Which tags are the most intuitive for users?&nbsp;

64

00:05:26,580  -->  00:05:30,687
How are we going to categorize&nbsp;
content for efficient management?&nbsp;

65

00:05:30,687  -->  00:05:34,475
How are we going to structure&nbsp;
our content for future reuse?&nbsp;

66

00:05:34,740  -->  00:05:38,700
What are the requirements for&nbsp;
personalization or dynamic delivery?&nbsp;

67

00:05:40,920  -->  00:05:47,040
The last quadrant, process, looks at the content&nbsp;
lifecycle, governance, and content measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp;

68

00:05:47,700  -->  00:05:50,513
Process design answers the following questions:

69

00:05:50,513  -->  00:05:55,680
How will content progress through its lifecycle?
What tools will we use to create,&nbsp;&nbsp;

70

00:05:55,680  -->  00:06:00,720
deliver, and maintain content?
Who is responsible and liable for the content?&nbsp;

71

00:06:00,720  -->  00:06:04,056
Who should be consulted&nbsp;
and informed along the way?&nbsp;

72

00:06:04,200  -->  00:06:08,820
What standards and metrics will we use to measure&nbsp;
the quality and performance of our content?&nbsp;

73

00:06:09,540  -->  00:06:12,601
How and when do we take care&nbsp;
of our existing content?&nbsp;

74

00:06:14,160  -->  00:06:19,260
These four quadrants are all design features&nbsp;
that all have an impact on your content product.&nbsp;&nbsp;

75

00:06:19,980  -->  00:06:25,440
As you can see, content strategy is a&nbsp;
mix of editorial work, experience design,&nbsp;&nbsp;

76

00:06:25,440  -->  00:06:30,720
and system design. The content strategy&nbsp;
works to connect the dots between them.&nbsp;

77

00:06:31,980  -->  00:06:36,000
As you've seen in this quadrant,&nbsp;
content strategy is a very broad area.

78

00:06:36,000  -->  00:06:41,940
The methodologies that make up the work&nbsp;
also vary widely. It's impossible to cover&nbsp;&nbsp;

79

00:06:41,940  -->  00:06:46,080
them all in this short amount of time, but&nbsp;
let's highlight some of the most important.&nbsp;

80

00:06:48,360  -->  00:06:57,481
Common methodologies are omnichannel publishing,&nbsp;
marketing, branding, and information architecture.&nbsp;

81

00:06:58,860  -->  00:07:03,780
Omni-Channel Publishing is one of them.&nbsp;
A content strategist can be a publisher,&nbsp;&nbsp;

82

00:07:03,780  -->  00:07:07,200
responsible for considering&nbsp;
omnichannel publishing needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

83

00:07:07,860  -->  00:07:13,080
This is different from multichannel&nbsp;
or cross-channel. Multichannel refers&nbsp;&nbsp;

84

00:07:13,080  -->  00:07:17,280
to delivering content and considering the&nbsp;
consumer experience on more than one channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

85

00:07:18,000  -->  00:07:24,233
Omnichannel is about understanding and optimizing&nbsp;
the entire journey across all channels.&nbsp;

86

00:07:25,080  -->  00:07:30,300
It's vital that the experiences consumers share&nbsp;
with your brand feel consistent and unified.&nbsp;&nbsp;

87

00:07:31,080  -->  00:07:36,840
Some form of content is present at every point in&nbsp;
the consumer's journey, and it plays a huge role&nbsp;&nbsp;

88

00:07:36,840  -->  00:07:43,320
in making that unified experience a reality.&nbsp;
A well-designed experience encourages greater&nbsp;&nbsp;

89

00:07:43,320  -->  00:07:48,060
consumer engagement and provides valuable&nbsp;
content across all relevant touchpoints.&nbsp;

90

00:07:49,020  -->  00:07:55,080
While content strategy focuses on the content&nbsp;
that creates an experience, rather than how that&nbsp;&nbsp;

91

00:07:55,080  -->  00:07:59,820
experience can be marketed. There is a lot of&nbsp;
overlap with areas of work such as marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92

00:08:00,660  -->  00:08:05,160
Marketing and content strategies&nbsp;
depend on each other to be successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

93

00:08:06,000  -->  00:08:09,420
They often build each other&nbsp;
up into a cohesive strategy.&nbsp;

94

00:08:10,560  -->  00:08:16,080
The same goes for branding. When a content&nbsp;
strategist focuses on creating a message or&nbsp;&nbsp;

95

00:08:16,080  -->  00:08:24,240
providing guidelines that evoke a specific voice,&nbsp;
they use branding techniques. Brands are visual,&nbsp;&nbsp;

96

00:08:24,240  -->  00:08:30,180
represented in logos and color palettes, but&nbsp;
also verbally, in language and style of speech.&nbsp;

97

00:08:31,500  -->  00:08:36,540
Content Strategy borrows and learns from&nbsp;
Information Architecture to prioritize&nbsp;&nbsp;

98

00:08:36,540  -->  00:08:41,220
content and help users find the information&nbsp;
they need, in the places they expect to find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

99

00:08:41,940  -->  00:08:45,447
You have probably already seen some&nbsp;
overlap with the previous lesson.&nbsp;

100

00:08:45,840  -->  00:08:51,180
Both should consider things like current&nbsp;
state content, taxonomies, content models,&nbsp;&nbsp;

101

00:08:51,180  -->  00:08:53,880
cross-platform requirements, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102

00:08:54,780  -->  00:09:01,440
But an IA is rarely responsible for editorial,&nbsp;
workflow, or governance components of content&nbsp;&nbsp;

103

00:09:01,440  -->  00:09:05,400
planning and development. This is more&nbsp;
the work field of the content strategist.

104

00:09:06,720  -->  00:09:13,380
The duties of a content strategist include&nbsp;
conducting content audits, CMS research, content&nbsp;&nbsp;

105

00:09:13,380  -->  00:09:18,120
mapping, creating voice and tone guidelines,&nbsp;
and of course developing content strategies.&nbsp;

106

00:09:18,985  -->  00:09:25,008
Right from the start, from the Discovery phase, 
a content strategist is involved in a UX project. 

107

00:09:25,008  -->  00:09:32,760
Their work is unique in&nbsp;that it continues almost to the 
end of the&nbsp;project. Unlike a researcher, UI designer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

108

00:09:32,760  -->  00:09:37,672
or developer, who might own one stage of&nbsp;
the project and then move on to other work.

109

00:09:38,520  -->  00:09:44,580
Producing compelling and sustainable content means&nbsp;
understanding and following the content lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

110

00:09:45,780  -->  00:09:50,460
Content strategist Erin Scime notes that there&nbsp;
are five stages in the content lifecycle:&nbsp;&nbsp;

111

00:09:51,000  -->  00:10:02,220
Audit, strategy, plan, create and maintain.
The first step includes objective analysis and&nbsp;&nbsp;

112

00:10:02,220  -->  00:10:07,740
evaluation of the content environment, competitive&nbsp;
analysis, stakeholder interviews, and more.

113

00:10:08,760  -->  00:10:14,340
Content audits can take many forms, but they&nbsp;
usually start with an inventory. For example&nbsp;&nbsp;

114

00:10:14,340  -->  00:10:19,800
in a spreadsheet. The steps for completing an&nbsp;
audit are similar to the steps for creating an&nbsp;&nbsp;

115

00:10:19,800  -->  00:10:24,240
inventory. In fact, the exercise is often&nbsp;
done simultaneously with the inventory.

116

00:10:25,440  -->  00:10:30,780
Even if you don't have an existing experience from&nbsp;
which to define a new one, you still have content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117

00:10:31,560  -->  00:10:34,500
By rating these, you can&nbsp;
determine what new content&nbsp;&nbsp;

118

00:10:34,500  -->  00:10:42,120
will support your goals for the future experience.
The inventory is a catalog of all the content used&nbsp;&nbsp;

119

00:10:42,120  -->  00:10:47,580
in a project. Content strategists use this tool to&nbsp;
determine the quantitative value of the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

120

00:10:48,420  -->  00:10:53,580
The inventory also helps determine what types&nbsp;
of content there are, how they are labeled and&nbsp;&nbsp;

121

00:10:53,580  -->  00:11:00,060
organized, and what type of structure is needed&nbsp;
to support each. It also helps determine what&nbsp;&nbsp;

122

00:11:00,060  -->  00:11:04,800
is needed in the future solution and where each&nbsp;
piece of content should be within the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

123

00:11:05,820  -->  00:11:10,620
How complex or in-depth depends a lot on&nbsp;
the size and type of products a company has.&nbsp;&nbsp;

124

00:11:11,820  -->  00:11:16,080
The best choice for a content inventory&nbsp;
documenting tool is a spreadsheet program&nbsp;&nbsp;

125

00:11:16,080  -->  00:11:20,400
such as Microsoft Excel, Numbers&nbsp;
from Apple, or Google's variant.&nbsp;

126

00:11:22,860  -->  00:11:27,660
The audit is then the qualitative analysis&nbsp;
of the inventory. It supplements the&nbsp;&nbsp;

127

00:11:27,660  -->  00:11:33,000
content inventory with extra information to&nbsp;
assess the quality of the existing content.

128

00:11:33,840  -->  00:11:38,067
This tool will help you visualize&nbsp;
how much content you have and its&nbsp;quality.

129

00:11:38,067  -->  00:11:42,960
It captures any issues, gaps,&nbsp;
and strengths of the existing content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

130

00:11:43,800  -->  00:11:49,320
It provides an easy reference when planning&nbsp;
your information architecture. Or to identify&nbsp;&nbsp;

131

00:11:49,320  -->  00:11:53,640
opportunities and untapped areas to&nbsp;
consider in an omnichannel strategy.&nbsp;

132

00:11:55,560  -->  00:12:01,620
If you're redesigning an existing website or app,&nbsp;
evaluating its content can help you decide which&nbsp;&nbsp;

133

00:12:01,620  -->  00:12:08,042
content should not be included in the redesign&nbsp;
because it's no longer valid or duplicates other&nbsp;content.

134

00:12:08,042  -->  00:12:13,098
It will also help you decide what content&nbsp;
you want to promote more because it is popular.

135

00:12:14,040  -->  00:12:19,218
There are many types of content audits and&nbsp;
the correct execution depends on the purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

136

00:12:19,380  -->  00:12:25,020
A content audit can be compared to competitor&nbsp;
sites for a competitive audit, or it can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

137

00:12:25,020  -->  00:12:30,720
turned into a content evaluation, where the&nbsp;
strategist rates each page against specific goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

138

00:12:31,860  -->  00:12:37,860
The content inspector can then be reused&nbsp;
as a report of prioritized pages to create,&nbsp;&nbsp;

139

00:12:37,860  -->  00:12:43,140
edit, retire, or migrate to a new&nbsp;
CMS, all depending on the project.&nbsp;

140

00:12:45,300  -->  00:12:49,920
Stakeholder interviews reveal the needs&nbsp;
and requirements of your internal users.&nbsp;&nbsp;

141

00:12:50,880  -->  00:12:55,440
Start by listing all the stakeholders&nbsp;
involved with the content. Such as the content&nbsp;&nbsp;

142

00:12:55,440  -->  00:13:02,160
contributors, legal department, SEO specialists,&nbsp;
brand managers, marketing managers, and so on.

143

00:13:03,120  -->  00:13:07,620
The purpose of the interviews is to bring to&nbsp;
light issues in the current state, including the&nbsp;&nbsp;

144

00:13:07,620  -->  00:13:12,360
content itself, the way the content is published,&nbsp;
and any other issues that affect the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

145

00:13:13,320  -->  00:13:16,680
You should also use the interview&nbsp;
as an opportunity to gather content&nbsp;&nbsp;

146

00:13:16,680  -->  00:13:18,960
requirements for the future state experience.&nbsp;

147

00:13:21,360  -->  00:13:27,448
After this step you can start designing the&nbsp;
Content Strategy. And this requires many different&nbsp;tasks.

148

00:13:27,448  -->  00:13:33,001
Content strategy is not a discipline in&nbsp;
which only one or two core activities are carried&nbsp;out.

149

00:13:33,001  -->  00:13:38,640
This means, for example, determining&nbsp;
current territories of ownership, taxonomy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

150

00:13:38,640  -->  00:13:43,740
the content production workflow, sourcing&nbsp;
plan, voice and brand definition, and so on.

151

00:13:44,640  -->  00:13:47,820
There are many different types of&nbsp;
tasks included in content strategy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

152

00:13:47,820  -->  00:13:51,120
and they depend largely on&nbsp;
the solution you are creating.&nbsp;&nbsp;

153

00:13:51,120  -->  00:13:55,680
Given the breadth of this topic, we'll focus&nbsp;
on the most important content strategy tasks.&nbsp;

154

00:13:57,780  -->  00:14:01,680
The first is identifying which content&nbsp;
types are needed for your experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

155

00:14:01,680  -->  00:14:07,080
called content mapping. This information is&nbsp;
collected through stakeholder interviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;

156

00:14:07,080  -->  00:14:14,280
personas and user journeys, and user research&nbsp;
and insights. By reviewing the audit, inventory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

157

00:14:14,280  -->  00:14:20,220
and recommendations, a range of content types&nbsp;
can be formalized. A content strategist often&nbsp;&nbsp;

158

00:14:20,220  -->  00:14:24,960
works with an information architect to ensure that&nbsp;
the content types are reflected in the new design.&nbsp;

159

00:14:26,880  -->  00:14:32,770
Second is understanding how to label and&nbsp;
organize content and creating a content model.&nbsp;&nbsp;

160

00:14:33,060  -->  00:14:38,700
Content mapping is the process of identifying&nbsp;
the types of content while content modeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

161

00:14:38,700  -->  00:14:44,040
adds definition and structure. For each area&nbsp;
of ​​the experience, extract a content rule and&nbsp;&nbsp;

162

00:14:44,040  -->  00:14:50,460
capture it in a tool called a content model.
Another important aspect is voice and tone&nbsp;&nbsp;

163

00:14:50,460  -->  00:14:56,580
guidelines. Whether the end product is a marketing&nbsp;
website, app, or other digital interfaces,&nbsp;&nbsp;

164

00:14:56,580  -->  00:15:03,480
the end-user expects certain things. One of&nbsp;
those things is consistency. If one writer&nbsp;&nbsp;

165

00:15:03,480  -->  00:15:08,640
uses formal writing and another is more casual,&nbsp;
the voice will feel inconsistent and awkward.

166

00:15:10,140  -->  00:15:14,460
Voice and tone guidelines can be as simple as&nbsp;
outlining the general feel of the language,&nbsp;&nbsp;

167

00:15:14,460  -->  00:15:20,400
or as specific as identifying key&nbsp;
vocabulary terms and branding language.&nbsp;&nbsp;

168

00:15:21,240  -->  00:15:26,340
Usually, these guidelines outline the goals&nbsp;
of the product and any market research that&nbsp;&nbsp;

169

00:15:26,340  -->  00:15:31,140
influences the decisions and connects the&nbsp;
brand voice with visual brand elements.&nbsp;

170

00:15:32,880  -->  00:15:38,280
Next is planning. This includes staffing&nbsp;
recommendations, a communication plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

171

00:15:38,280  -->  00:15:42,480
a content migration plan, and recommendations&nbsp;
for the content management system.

172

00:15:43,680  -->  00:15:48,300
A content management system is an&nbsp;
application designed to house all the content that&nbsp;&nbsp;

173

00:15:48,300  -->  00:15:54,780
appears on a site or application. A well-known&nbsp;
example is WordPress or Shopify for webshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;

174

00:15:55,800  -->  00:16:01,200
For most teams, the best CMS depends a lot on&nbsp;
their goals and the capabilities of their team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

175

00:16:01,800  -->  00:16:04,200
For example, a team without a developer needs a&nbsp;&nbsp;

176

00:16:04,200  -->  00:16:08,520
CMS that can be managed with little&nbsp;
to no additional code, like Webflow.

177

00:16:11,040  -->  00:16:14,580
An organization that relies&nbsp;
heavily on user surveys wants&nbsp;&nbsp;

178

00:16:14,580  -->  00:16:19,500
a CMS that easily integrates forms. A&nbsp;
content strategist may be responsible&nbsp;&nbsp;

179

00:16:19,500  -->  00:16:23,760
for gathering these various requirements&nbsp;
and narrowing the field of viable CMSs.&nbsp;

180

00:16:27,720  -->  00:16:31,560
Creating in the content lifecycle&nbsp;
includes writing content,&nbsp;&nbsp;

181

00:16:31,560  -->  00:16:37,707
asset production, governance model, search&nbsp;
engine optimization, and quality assurance.

182

00:16:38,220  -->  00:16:43,140
Content creation is the step in the process&nbsp;
where content is actually created. In the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

183

00:16:43,140  -->  00:16:47,820
of copy writing, it is what an author&nbsp;
writes. In the case of video, it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

184

00:16:47,820  -->  00:16:53,520
involve several steps including storyboarding,&nbsp;
scripting, shooting, editing, and finalization.&nbsp;&nbsp;

185

00:16:54,480  -->  00:16:59,460
Images may require a different set of steps.&nbsp;
This type of content requires very different&nbsp;&nbsp;

186

00:16:59,460  -->  00:17:04,980
sub-steps within the creation process. So each&nbsp;
of these content types has a unique life cycle.&nbsp;

187

00:17:07,500  -->  00:17:13,260
Finally, maintain. This includes scheduling&nbsp;
periodic audits. Recommend a governance model that&nbsp;&nbsp;

188

00:17:13,260  -->  00:17:18,960
maintains the quality of the experience. Set goals&nbsp;
for success measures that you can measure through&nbsp;&nbsp;

189

00:17:18,960  -->  00:17:24,780
analytics and user research. It also means giving&nbsp;
advice to the client, which completes the circle.&nbsp;

190

00:17:26,339  -->  00:17:31,903
This was a small glimpse into the diverse and&nbsp;
important field of work of a content strategist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

191

00:17:31,903  -->  00:17:34,357
Let's recap what we discussed in this lesson.

192

00:17:35,207  -->  00:17:37,774
I started by explaining what content is.

193

00:17:38,100  -->  00:17:41,341
Simply put, content = information.

194

00:17:41,880  -->  00:17:44,640
Content is central to any user experience.

195

00:17:44,640  -->  00:17:47,880
It provides users with the information&nbsp;
they need to achieve their goals.

196

00:17:48,780  -->  00:17:53,040
Content strategy can be defined&nbsp;
as guiding the creation, delivery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

197

00:17:53,040  -->  00:17:55,620
and governance of useful and usable content.

198

00:17:56,760  -->  00:17:59,460
You can divide content strategy into four areas.

199

00:18:00,180  -->  00:18:03,720
The work of a content strategist&nbsp;
usually falls into one of two groups:&nbsp;&nbsp;

200

00:18:04,500  -->  00:18:06,660
content design or systems design.&nbsp;

201

00:18:08,400  -->  00:18:14,340
Content design is the process of using data and&nbsp;
evidence to give audiences the content they need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

202

00:18:14,340  -->  00:18:18,780
when they need it, and in a way&nbsp;
they expect. The two areas of&nbsp;&nbsp;

203

00:18:18,780  -->  00:18:23,400
focus that intersect in content design are&nbsp;
editorial strategy and experience design.

204

00:18:24,840  -->  00:18:28,380
At the bottom, we find systems&nbsp;
design. The two areas of focus&nbsp;&nbsp;

205

00:18:28,380  -->  00:18:32,760
that intersect in content system design&nbsp;
are content structure and process design.

206

00:18:34,320  -->  00:18:40,440
Content strategy is a mix of editorial work,&nbsp;
experience design, and system design. The content&nbsp;&nbsp;

207

00:18:40,440  -->  00:18:46,920
strategy works to connect the dots between them.
Next, we've discussed Common Methodologies like:

208

00:18:46,920  -->  00:18:48,600
Omni-Channel Publishing&nbsp;

209

00:18:49,260  -->  00:18:53,110
Marketing &amp; branding
Information Architecture

210

00:18:53,760  -->  00:18:58,800
Producing compelling and sustainable content means&nbsp;
understanding and following the content lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

211

00:18:59,580  -->  00:19:03,060
I showed you the five stages&nbsp;
in the content lifecycle.

212

00:19:03,060  -->  00:19:06,360
Audit and Analysis
Strategy&nbsp;

213

00:19:07,320  -->  00:19:10,073
Plan
Create&nbsp;

214

00:19:10,225  -->  00:19:11,497
Maintain

215

00:19:12,468  -->  00:19:16,280
Content is essential for good&nbsp;user 
interaction with a product.&nbsp;

216

00:19:16,280  -->  00:19:19,962
The dialogue&nbsp;between a system 
and a person using it.

217

00:19:19,962  -->  00:19:25,413
We'll&nbsp;go into more detail about this in the next lesson&nbsp;
on interaction design. See you there.
