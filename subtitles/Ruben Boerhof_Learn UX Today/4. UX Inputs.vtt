00:00:07.030  -->  00:00:12.390
When starting a new UX project, you need to
understand your goals before designing anything.

2

00:00:12.390  -->  00:00:13.850
Two of them.

3

00:00:13.850  -->  00:00:17.770
And nothing is more important to your success
as a UX designer.

4

00:00:17.770  -->  00:00:19.626
The first are the user's goals.

5

00:00:19.626  -->  00:00:25.620
Like getting into college, learning to bake
cookies, or becoming a licensed driver.

6

00:00:25.620  -->  00:00:30.300
User goals are descriptions of end states
that users want to achieve.

7

00:00:30.300  -->  00:00:34.820
Real end states, and not limited to the scope
of the product that you’re working on.

8

00:00:34.820  -->  00:00:38.160
Because that product will be most useful when
it is designed with an understanding of the

9

00:00:38.160  -->  00:00:40.370
larger context of the user.

10

00:00:40.900  -->  00:00:45.559
A website that makes all content discoverable
and makes all its interactions intuitive may

11

00:00:45.559  -->  00:00:47.250
be usable.

12

00:00:47.250  -->  00:00:51.807
But it will never be useful unless it is relevant
to a real purpose a user has.

13

00:00:52.887  -->  00:00:56.030
So how do you find the user's goals?

14

00:00:56.030  -->  00:01:00.280
Asking project stakeholders is not an optimal
way to find user goals.

15

00:01:00.280  -->  00:01:05.179
Even those who communicate directly with users
often have different goals.

16

00:01:05.179  -->  00:01:07.620
It is better to look for other, 
objective sources.

17

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:09.159
Like doing user research.

18

00:01:09.159  -->  00:01:11.678
I will tell you more about this in 
Chapter 3.

19

00:01:12.635  -->  00:01:14.850
Second, there are the business goals.

20

00:01:14.850  -->  00:01:18.118
The most fundamental input into the 
UX design process is understanding 

21

00:01:18.118  -->  00:01:21.380
the underlying business objectives.

22

00:01:21.380  -->  00:01:25.460
Because every organization has a reason to
create a site or app in the first place.

23

00:01:25.460  -->  00:01:28.521
So what are you trying to achieve?

24

00:01:28.521  -->  00:01:33.979
Examples of business goals for a travel website
might include selling more hotel stays,

25

00:01:33.979  -->  00:01:37.806
lower customer service costs, 
or more repeat customers.

26

00:01:37.806  -->  00:01:41.868
A clear definition of the company's objectives
is an essential step.

27

00:01:42.242  -->  00:01:47.120
After you define these goals, you also need
to determine how you will measure success.

28

00:01:47.120  -->  00:01:49.417
What does success look like?

29

00:01:49.417  -->  00:01:53.393
This is usually accomplished by increasing
critical business metrics such as

30

00:01:53.393  -->  00:01:57.070
conversion rates, sales, retention, and so on.

31

00:01:57.967  -->  00:02:03.058
It's also critical to define these key success
metrics at the outset of the project.

32

00:02:03.058  -->  00:02:08.030
Because they affect all the other design decisions
you make during the process.

33

00:02:08.030  -->  00:02:12.134
These metrics also ensure that the final experience
aligns with your original goals.

34

00:02:12.598  -->  00:02:17.110
Going back to the examples of travel website
business goals, you can make them more specific

35

00:02:17.110  -->  00:02:20.450
and measurable by adding success metrics.

36

00:02:20.450  -->  00:02:22.370
For instance:

37

00:02:22.370  -->  00:02:26.143
Instead of ‘sell more hotel stays’, 
a better goal would be: 

38

00:02:26.143  -->  00:02:31.439
Increase net conversion of hotel stays in Italy by 10% in Q1

39

00:02:32.662  -->  00:02:35.780
Reduce customer service calls by 20% per year,

40

00:02:35.780  -->  00:02:39.699
instead of ‘lower customer service cost’.

41

00:02:41.146  -->  00:02:43.160
More returning customers could be:

42

00:02:43.160  -->  00:02:46.870
Increase the number of repeat 
customers by 10 customers per week

43

00:02:46.870  -->  00:02:50.660
This makes the business goals specific 
and measurable.

44

00:02:51.251  -->  00:02:55.651
The real test of a UX designer is how well
you can align those goals so that the company

45

00:02:55.651  -->  00:02:59.010
benefits when the user achieves their goal.

46

00:02:59.010  -->  00:03:01.549
It's all about finding the right balance.

47

00:03:01.549  -->  00:03:04.389
Where do user goals meet business goals?

48

00:03:05.000  -->  00:03:06.580
Take YouTube as an example.

49

00:03:06.580  -->  00:03:10.294
They make money from ads 
and users want to find good videos.

50

00:03:10.294  -->  00:03:14.156
So, it makes sense to place ads in 
or before the videos.

51

00:03:14.156  -->  00:03:19.210
But more than that, by making it easy to search
for videos and find similar videos

52

00:03:19.210  -->  00:03:20.875
users will watch more.

53

00:03:20.875  -->  00:03:23.003
Making YouTube more money.

54

00:03:23.003  -->  00:03:26.580
User experience and business goals 
often go hand in hand.

55

00:03:26.580  -->  00:03:29.180
If we go back to the earlier example of the
travel website.

56

00:03:29.180  -->  00:03:34.190
A clear page about the hotel and its prices
would most likely save time and improve the

57

00:03:34.190  -->  00:03:36.110
experience for the user.

58

00:03:36.110  -->  00:03:38.520
As well as increasing the conversion rate.

59

00:03:38.520  -->  00:03:40.189
Everyone wins.

60

00:03:40.189  -->  00:03:41.579
Sometimes they don't.

61

00:03:41.579  -->  00:03:46.693
For example, if you make it too easy for a
customer to cancel a booked overnight stay for free.

62

00:03:46.693  -->  00:03:50.190
When, on closer inspection, 
they find it too expensive.

63

00:03:50.190  -->  00:03:52.000
The user feels positive relief.

64

00:03:52.000  -->  00:03:57.760
But this also increases the cancellation rate
and the company loses money.

65

00:03:57.760  -->  00:04:02.178
A good UX designer is needed to find the best
balance between these two goals.

66

00:04:02.178  -->  00:04:06.689
For example, by making it easy enough to 
cancel the overnight stay.

67

00:04:06.689  -->  00:04:11.560
While still striving to maximize the number
of users who want to book an alternative hotel.

68

00:04:11.560  -->  00:04:17.250
For example, by offering alternative options
that better fit the user's budget.

69

00:04:17.250  -->  00:04:18.446
The user is happy.

70

00:04:18.446  -->  00:04:19.636
The company is happy.

71

00:04:20.635  -->  00:04:25.520
Meaningful experiences transform a digital
creation into a great outcome for users and

72

00:04:25.520  -->  00:04:27.298
businesses alike.

73

00:04:27.298  -->  00:04:29.669
Users engage
and businesses grow.

74

00:04:30.260  -->  00:04:35.590
You'll spend less time and money getting these
results because effective UX design and research

75

00:04:35.590  -->  00:04:39.340
will show you what to do and what not to do.

76

00:04:39.340  -->  00:04:43.453
Ot the other hand, if you try to avoid UX, you will 
find yourself pursuing unattainable goals

77

00:04:43.453  -->  00:04:45.730
and failure will soon follow.

78

00:04:46.830  -->  00:04:51.384
The business goals and user needs as we just
discussed are the most important to start with.

79

00:04:51.384  -->  00:04:55.099
But the building blocks of the UX design process
focus on a few more things.

80

00:04:55.995  -->  00:05:02.109
Strategic input also includes the competitive
landscape, technical architecture,

81

00:05:02.109  -->  00:05:04.490
design and content input.

82

00:05:04.490  -->  00:05:07.235
You should consider all these areas 
when building a user experience

83

00:05:07.235  -->  00:05:10.000
as each affects the overall experience.

84

00:05:10.624  -->  00:05:16.250
Before starting the design process, it is
important to consider the competitive landscape.

85

00:05:16.250  -->  00:05:20.510
Assessing your competition means assessing
what others in the same industry are doing.

86

00:05:20.510  -->  00:05:22.830
Especially around all types of 
user interaction they create.

87

00:05:22.830  -->  00:05:24.630
For instance:

88

00:05:24.630  -->  00:05:27.970
Who else has a similar product or service
on the market?

89

00:05:27.970  -->  00:05:31.580
What can you learn from assessing 
the UX of that service?

90

00:05:31.580  -->  00:05:34.759
What features or content might be missing?

91

00:05:34.759  -->  00:05:38.723
Any ideas you can get for building 
a best-in-class user experience?

92

00:05:38.723  -->  00:05:43.310
It is particularly helpful to take an in-depth
look at similar experiences of products that

93

00:05:43.310  -->  00:05:45.000
exist on the market.

94

00:05:45.000  -->  00:05:50.509
You can learn a lot by reviewing these services
and avoiding many of the pitfalls of UX design.

95

00:05:50.509  -->  00:05:54.990
The second element to include is 
the technological architecture.

96

00:05:54.990  -->  00:05:59.503
Studying this ensures that the underlying
technology supports the design choices you make.

97

00:06:00.340  -->  00:06:03.699
Some of the fundamental questions to answer
include:

98

00:06:03.699  -->  00:06:06.600
Which technology supports your solution?

99

00:06:06.600  -->  00:06:09.039
What is technically feasible?

100

00:06:09.039  -->  00:06:12.370
Are there any restrictions 
you should be aware of?

101

00:06:12.370  -->  00:06:14.069
Where will this user experience exist?

102

00:06:14.069  -->  00:06:17.300
Is that a website on a mobile or desktop?

103

00:06:17.300  -->  00:06:18.930
Or a screen in a store?

104

00:06:18.930  -->  00:06:20.590
The interface of a thermostat?

105

00:06:20.590  -->  00:06:23.850
Or the navigation screen in your car?

106

00:06:23.850  -->  00:06:26.249
Which web browsers are supported 
in the case of a website?

107

00:06:26.249  -->  00:06:32.490
Or in the case of an app, which operating
systems are supported such as Apple or Android?

108

00:06:32.490  -->  00:06:37.580
What technology is needed to create, produce,
publish and maintain your user experience?

109

00:06:37.580  -->  00:06:40.240
What about a content management system?

110

00:06:40.240  -->  00:06:44.460
Does a user need to register or authenticate
for the website or app?

111

00:06:44.460  -->  00:06:47.850
As you can see these topics can get very technical.

112

00:06:47.850  -->  00:06:51.639
All team members of a UX project should have
a common understanding of the technologies

113

00:06:51.639  -->  00:06:53.869
that enable the experience.

114

00:06:53.869  -->  00:06:57.960
Intensive collaboration and coordination with
your colleagues from the engineering department

115

00:06:57.960  -->  00:06:59.550
is crucial.

116

00:07:00.447  -->  00:07:05.210
Another fundamental building block of UX is
understanding your users.

117

00:07:05.210  -->  00:07:09.710
Who are they, how will they use your solution
and what do you know about them?

118

00:07:10.118  -->  00:07:16.520
To design successful user-centric solutions,
two tools provide useful insights.

119

00:07:16.520  -->  00:07:21.276
Personas help determine what user behavior
should be taken into account in your ultimate experience.

120

00:07:21.276  -->  00:07:25.687
While scenarios or journeys provide 
the different paths a user can take 

121

00:07:25.687  -->  00:07:28.520
to complete a task within the experience.

122

00:07:30.150  -->  00:07:32.370
Let's look at personas first.

123

00:07:32.370  -->  00:07:35.330
Often the problem is not the lack of 
information about your users.

124

00:07:35.330  -->  00:07:39.960
The challenge is to prioritize the information
you know about users.

125

00:07:39.960  -->  00:07:42.840
Not all users are equally important.

126

00:07:42.840  -->  00:07:49.100
In the example of our hotel website, people
who camp or couch surf are of less or no importance

127

00:07:49.100  -->  00:07:54.020
compared to a couple going on a city trip
or a business traveler.

128

00:07:54.020  -->  00:07:58.569
You should document which type of user has
your highest priority.

129

00:07:58.569  -->  00:08:02.900
User information is usually distilled into
simple and digestible formats.

130

00:08:02.900  -->  00:08:05.770
Called user profiles or personas.

131

00:08:05.770  -->  00:08:08.551
As you can see in this example.

132

00:08:08.551  -->  00:08:13.300
Personas help bring the target user to life,
showcase business-critical information about

133

00:08:13.300  -->  00:08:16.270
that user, and remove unnecessary details.

134

00:08:16.270  -->  00:08:20.000
You use these personas 
throughout the project lifecycle.

135

00:08:20.000  -->  00:08:23.169
In Chapter 2, we'll cover the design process.

136

00:08:25.370  -->  00:08:31.492
To bring a future solution to life, a persona
is usually linked to a scenario or user journey.

137

00:08:31.492  -->  00:08:35.979
Scenarios tell a simple story of the process
a target user goes through and how your new

138

00:08:35.979  -->  00:08:39.030
solution is used along the way.

139

00:08:39.030  -->  00:08:43.200
For the hotel website example, your scenario
might explain the process a couple goes through

140

00:08:43.200  -->  00:08:46.620
when they want to book a hotel room in a city.

141

00:08:46.620  -->  00:08:51.440
The user journey tells a story in the same
way, but is usually a higher-level story,

142

00:08:51.440  -->  00:08:53.570
with more reach and impact.

143

00:08:54.161  -->  00:08:58.350
For example, a scenario can illustrate how
the couple is researching a hotel with a swimming

144

00:08:58.350  -->  00:09:00.630
pool in the city in question.

145

00:09:00.630  -->  00:09:06.264
While the user journey shows the broader process
of initiating and experiencing the holiday trip.

146

00:09:07.424  -->  00:09:10.510
Brand guidelines are also an important factor.

147

00:09:10.510  -->  00:09:13.630
You want to understand all your organization's
branding requirements.

148

00:09:13.630  -->  00:09:17.420
As they can impact the final user experience.

149

00:09:17.420  -->  00:09:22.170
Most companies work with brand guidelines
and design systems that describe color palettes,

150

00:09:22.170  -->  00:09:24.840
spacing, fonts, and so on.

151

00:09:24.840  -->  00:09:28.200
Here are examples from some major companies.

152

00:09:28.200  -->  00:09:30.930
I've posted links to these design systems
below this video.

153

00:09:30.930  -->  00:09:36.467
It is very instructive to browse through these
design systems and see how they are built.

154

00:09:37.038  -->  00:09:40.120
Another important input is the content.

155

00:09:40.120  -->  00:09:43.760
Essential to successful user experiences,
as it informs what types of information are

156

00:09:43.760  -->  00:09:46.920
made available to your users.

157

00:09:46.920  -->  00:09:49.520
I'll briefly discuss two tools that can help
you with this.

158

00:09:49.520  -->  00:09:56.270
In Chapter 3, we go deeper into topics such
as content strategy and information architecture.

159

00:09:56.270  -->  00:09:59.090
The first is how you organize and label information.

160

00:09:59.090  -->  00:10:01.031
Also called taxonomy.

161

00:10:01.031  -->  00:10:03.760
This ensures your users can find what they
need.

162

00:10:03.760  -->  00:10:09.257
For example, consider a library where books
are organized by author, title, or subject.

163

00:10:09.257  -->  00:10:11.386
This makes it easier to find a book.

164

00:10:11.936  -->  00:10:16.000
If you've bought a product online, you've
probably come across a taxonomy without even

165

00:10:16.000  -->  00:10:18.030
realizing it.

166

00:10:18.030  -->  00:10:23.474
For example, take a look at the classification
of products on Amazon or videos on Netflix.

167

00:10:23.474  -->  00:10:27.910
Without a good and robust taxonomy, your users
may not be able to find what they need

168

00:10:27.910  -->  00:10:29.512
so that's essential.

169

00:10:30.327  -->  00:10:33.731
So how do you get all these inputs and requirements?

170

00:10:33.731  -->  00:10:37.314
The more you understand what you can't do
and what you must do

171

00:10:37.314  -->  00:10:40.157
the better your final designs will be.

172

00:10:40.157  -->  00:10:45.273
As a UX designer, your ideas often stem from
the constraints you define by studying the problem.

173

00:10:46.230  -->  00:10:50.330
Collect problems that can be solved, things
that cannot be changed, and technical things

174

00:10:50.330  -->  00:10:52.534
that must be included.

175

00:10:52.872  -->  00:10:55.760
Your design affects other parts of the business.

176

00:10:55.760  -->  00:10:58.920
For example, the sales team 
has products to sell.

177

00:10:58.920  -->  00:11:02.642
The engineers may have legacy code that is
difficult to change.

178

00:11:02.642  -->  00:11:05.680
Executives have long-term goals to be achieved.

179

00:11:06.291  -->  00:11:11.090
So, always enter into a dialogue with each
of the stakeholders involved in the design.

180

00:11:11.090  -->  00:11:15.680
By talking to stakeholders, you avoid making
mistakes that can cost you time and money.

181

00:11:16.401  -->  00:11:20.890
I hope that after this lesson you will have
a better idea of all the input you need.

182

00:11:20.890  -->  00:11:22.721
Let's summarize what we learned in this lesson.

183

00:11:23.047  -->  00:11:26.710
You need to understand your goals 
before designing anything.

184

00:11:26.710  -->  00:11:28.610
The first are the user goals.

185

00:11:28.610  -->  00:11:31.911
Descriptions of end states that 
users want to achieve.

186

00:11:31.911  -->  00:11:34.210
Second, there are the business goals.

187

00:11:34.210  -->  00:11:36.186
What are you trying to achieve?

188

00:11:36.186  -->  00:11:39.110
You also need to determine 
how you will measure success.

189

00:11:39.110  -->  00:11:40.856
What does success look like?

190

00:11:40.856  -->  00:11:43.370
What business metrics 
are important to look at?

191

00:11:44.022  -->  00:11:46.730
The next thing is how well 
you can align these goals.

192

00:11:46.730  -->  00:11:50.090
So that the company benefits when the user
achieves their goal.

193

00:11:50.701  -->  00:11:52.560
But there are more things to look at.

194

00:11:52.560  -->  00:11:57.129
Strategic input also includes the competitive
landscape, technical architecture, 

195

00:11:57.129  -->  00:11:59.780
design and content input.

196

00:11:59.780  -->  00:12:04.890
You should consider all these areas when building
a user experience, as each affects the experience.

197

00:12:05.542  -->  00:12:09.229
