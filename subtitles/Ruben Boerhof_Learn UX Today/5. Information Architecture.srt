00:00:07,520  -->  00:00:09,600
If you've done some reading about UX,&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:09,600  -->  00:00:13,280
you've probably come across the&nbsp;
term information architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:13,280  -->  00:00:15,492
Or simply: IA.

4

00:00:15,492  -->  00:00:20,320
Information architecture is one of&nbsp;
the most fundamental components within UX.

5

00:00:20,320  -->  00:00:25,668
In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of information&nbsp;
architecture and the main things you need to know.&nbsp;

6

00:00:26,160  -->  00:00:32,080
What is it? Information architecture is how you&nbsp;
organize and present your content to the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;

7

00:00:32,080  -->  00:00:36,080
So that they can find everything&nbsp;
they need without great effort.

8

00:00:36,080  -->  00:00:41,062
You can find it in websites, apps, and other&nbsp;
digital products, but also in the physical&nbsp;world.

9

00:00:41,062  -->  00:00:44,101
Such as libraries, museums, and shops.

10

00:00:45,067  -->  00:00:47,360
A well-structured information architecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:00:47,360  -->  00:00:52,518
makes it easier for visitors to find what they&nbsp;
need and use it to achieve their goals. 

12

00:00:52,518  -->  00:00:57,920
Trust&nbsp;me, it's not always easy. 
As you'll soon&nbsp;discover, there's a lot to think about.&nbsp;

13

00:00:57,920  -->  00:01:02,709
As consumers, we are used to&nbsp;
finding exactly what we need,&nbsp;where we expect it.

14

00:01:02,709  -->  00:01:08,096
And what happens if we don't&nbsp;find it? 
We give up in a few seconds and move on.

15

00:01:08,096  -->  00:01:11,440
Disorganized content makes navigation difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:11,440  -->  00:01:17,879
Users can get lost and irritated. 
Even&nbsp;the most beautiful design fails without&nbsp;the right IA. 

17

00:01:17,879  -->  00:01:22,901
Your user experience is only&nbsp;
as strong as your information architecture.&nbsp;

18

00:01:24,080  -->  00:01:30,480
Famed UX designer, Jared Spool, once said: 
“Good&nbsp;design becomes invisible when it's done right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:30,480  -->  00:01:33,520
It's when it's done poorly that we notice it.”

20

00:01:33,520  -->  00:01:40,000
The same goes for IA. If everything is in order,&nbsp;
it becomes invisible. If a user experience has a&nbsp;&nbsp;

21

00:01:40,000  -->  00:01:45,684
weak underlying information architecture, the&nbsp;
overarching user experience is bound to fail.&nbsp;

22

00:01:46,240  -->  00:01:52,000
A good IA is the foundation of any user&nbsp;
experience. If something is easy to find,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:01:52,000  -->  00:01:57,360
it is usually no coincidence. It's the&nbsp;
result of extensive user research and testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:01:57,360  -->  00:02:01,801
Let's look at common methodologies&nbsp;
and how to follow a good process.&nbsp;

25

00:02:02,320  -->  00:02:06,456
According to Peter Morville and Louis Rosenfeld.&nbsp;
The authors of the leading book: &nbsp;&nbsp;

26

00:02:06,456  -->  00:02:09,253
Information Architecture 
for the World Wide Web

27

00:02:09,253  -->  00:02:12,800
a website's IA needs to address 
different user needs.

28

00:02:12,800  -->  00:02:16,400
They distinguish 4 main types of needs:

29

00:02:16,400  -->  00:02:22,720
Known-item seeking: Users will come to the website&nbsp;
to search for something desirable and known.&nbsp;

30

00:02:22,720  -->  00:02:27,718
Exploratory seeking: Users will come to the&nbsp;
website looking for inspiration.

31

00:02:27,718  -->  00:02:31,871
They’re looking&nbsp;for something desirable 
but not sure what exactly.

32

00:02:31,871  -->  00:02:35,169
Exhaustive research: Users are in the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

33

00:02:35,169  -->  00:02:39,878
of extensive research. They want to&nbsp;
find as much information as possible.&nbsp;

34

00:02:39,878  -->  00:02:46,640
Re-finding: A user needs a desired&nbsp;
item again and is trying to find it.

35

00:02:46,640  -->  00:02:49,120
When thinking about information architecture

36

00:02:49,120  -->  00:02:51,553
it’s&nbsp;important to think about the different users

37

00:02:51,553  -->  00:02:55,243
and&nbsp;how they will 
navigate, search, or use filters.

38

00:02:55,840  -->  00:03:01,200
Think of an e-commerce website. If you’re looking&nbsp;
for a new dress for a party, you might want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

39

00:03:01,200  -->  00:03:08,857
filter by style and by color. But if you’re after&nbsp;a gift, 
you might want to see some curated gift&nbsp;ideas.

40

00:03:08,857  -->  00:03:13,835
If you know exactly what you want, you want&nbsp;
the option to quickly find it without browsing.&nbsp;

41

00:03:14,720  -->  00:03:19,600
A good information architecture has a&nbsp;
major impact on the user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

42

00:03:19,600  -->  00:03:25,280
The faster the users reach their final&nbsp;
destination, the greater their satisfaction.

43

00:03:25,280  -->  00:03:29,280
So, we must never forget that knowing the&nbsp;
users and their information-seeking behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

44

00:03:29,280  -->  00:03:33,680
is the key to success. Once we know the&nbsp;
needs of our users, we can focus on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

45

00:03:33,680  -->  00:03:35,234
architectural components to built.

46

00:03:36,320  -->  00:03:38,480
The main components of IA are:

47

00:03:38,480  -->  00:03:44,560
Organization Schemes and Structures: 
How&nbsp;you categorize and structure information.

48

00:03:44,560  -->  00:03:48,724
Labeling Systems: How you represent information.

49

00:03:48,724  -->  00:03:53,780
Navigation Systems: How users browse 
or&nbsp;move through information.

50

00:03:53,780  -->  00:03:57,996
Search Systems: How users look for information&nbsp;

51

00:03:58,640  -->  00:04:00,560
When building the information architecture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52

00:04:00,560  -->  00:04:05,840
there are many things to consider besides&nbsp;
organizing the information in a logical way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

53

00:04:05,840  -->  00:04:12,000
Depending on the size of a website or app, it can&nbsp;
be a complex task requiring ongoing maintenance.&nbsp;

54

00:04:16,240  -->  00:04:21,040
An expert in this field for over 20 years,&nbsp;
Dan Brown developed eight principles&nbsp;&nbsp;

55

00:04:21,040  -->  00:04:27,840
that help build or test a good information&nbsp;
architecture. Let's go through them one by one.&nbsp;

56

00:04:28,400  -->  00:04:33,840
The principle of objects means that content&nbsp;
should be treated as a living, breathing thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

57

00:04:33,840  -->  00:04:40,480
It has life cycles, behaviors, and attributes.&nbsp;
Identifying the application's content is as&nbsp;&nbsp;

58

00:04:40,480  -->  00:04:44,640
crucial as identifying the behavior of the&nbsp;
content when the user interacts with it.

59

00:04:45,200  -->  00:04:49,520
For example, a text and an image gallery&nbsp;
are two different types of objects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

60

00:04:49,520  -->  00:04:54,000
Each with a different content,&nbsp;
structure, and user interaction.&nbsp;

61

00:04:54,480  -->  00:04:58,400
You could think of all pages that are&nbsp;
text as the same content type, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

62

00:04:58,400  -->  00:05:05,200
there's plenty of variety here too. For example,&nbsp;
take a recipe as a content type, with ingredients,&nbsp;&nbsp;

63

00:05:05,200  -->  00:05:11,426
quantities, a cooking process, an image of&nbsp;
the dish being prepared, nutritional value,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;

64

00:05:11,426  -->  00:05:17,556
Still mostly text, but very different&nbsp;
from, say, a product page or a news article.&nbsp;

65

00:05:18,080  -->  00:05:24,000
The principle of choices is simple: Keep the&nbsp;
number of choices small. Less is more.&nbsp;&nbsp;

66

00:05:24,000  -->  00:05:30,000
Users can become overwhelmed and even paralyzed with&nbsp;
indecision if you give them too many choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;

67

00:05:30,000  -->  00:05:33,920
Create pages that provide users&nbsp;
with meaningful choices, where&nbsp;&nbsp;

68

00:05:33,920  -->  00:05:37,840
the available choices are task-oriented&nbsp;
and therefore relevant to the user.

69

00:05:38,560  -->  00:05:42,240
A shorter list of navigation links&nbsp;
will be used more than a long list&nbsp;&nbsp;

70

00:05:42,240  -->  00:05:48,000
of navigation links. Keep the choices&nbsp;
users have to make as few as possible.&nbsp;

71

00:05:49,040  -->  00:05:53,280
Only display enough information to help&nbsp;
people understand what kind of information&nbsp;&nbsp;

72

00:05:53,280  -->  00:05:58,240
they will find if they dig deeper. Humans&nbsp;
can only process so much information at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;

73

00:05:58,880  -->  00:06:04,806
Rather than submit everything to them at once,&nbsp;
limit the content to what they absolutely need.&nbsp;

74

00:06:05,760  -->  00:06:07,973
Like this example of an accordion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

75

00:06:07,973  -->  00:06:12,682
which helps users understand what kind of&nbsp;
information is hidden when they dig deeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;

76

00:06:13,120  -->  00:06:17,853
Or an icon with some brief information about&nbsp;
the page you find when you click on it.

77

00:06:18,160  -->  00:06:23,360
The idea is to present information in layers.&nbsp;
Also, keep in mind that each layer of information&nbsp;&nbsp;

78

00:06:23,360  -->  00:06:28,901
is part of a larger content story that&nbsp;
the end-user can understand and follow.

79

00:06:29,840  -->  00:06:34,880
Show examples when describing the content of&nbsp;
the categories, to show users what they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

80

00:06:34,880  -->  00:06:40,800
be able to access. This concept is based on the&nbsp;
psychology behind how the human brain categorizes&nbsp;&nbsp;

81

00:06:40,800  -->  00:06:47,200
items to process information faster and better.&nbsp;
Especially if some category options don't speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

82

00:06:47,200  -->  00:06:53,536
for themselves. Images are particularly helpful&nbsp;
for this. As you can see in these examples.&nbsp;

83

00:06:54,640  -->  00:06:58,240
Not all users will enter your&nbsp;
site on the homepage. Assume that&nbsp;&nbsp;

84

00:06:58,240  -->  00:07:02,593
the majority of users will even use a&nbsp;
different access point than the home page.

85

00:07:02,960  -->  00:07:07,840
You, therefore, want to make sure that each&nbsp;
page in itself gives your end-user an idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

86

00:07:07,840  -->  00:07:13,815
where they are and what they can do next.&nbsp;
With useful information and navigation&nbsp;aids.

87

00:07:13,815  -->  00:07:18,800
Breadcrumbs, for example, are a very useful&nbsp;
tool for this. They immediately let the user know&nbsp;&nbsp;

88

00:07:18,800  -->  00:07:24,787
where and how deep they are in the website. As you&nbsp;
can see in these examples from Apple and Google.&nbsp;

89

00:07:25,680  -->  00:07:30,640
This principle is based on providing easy&nbsp;
ways to find information on your website.&nbsp;&nbsp;

90

00:07:31,360  -->  00:07:36,960
Provide users with different ways to browse&nbsp;
the site's content. Using top-level search&nbsp;&nbsp;

91

00:07:36,960  -->  00:07:41,680
and menus are two ways to do this. Some&nbsp;
users may want to browse the hierarchy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

92

00:07:41,680  -->  00:07:45,840
so make sure your information architecture&nbsp;
meets their needs. As you can see in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

93

00:07:45,840  -->  00:07:52,720
example on the Apple website. You can find pages&nbsp;
via the menu bar at the top, the search function,&nbsp;&nbsp;

94

00:07:52,720  -->  00:07:55,868
or the links in the footer&nbsp;
at the bottom of the page.

95

00:07:56,400  -->  00:08:00,800
Keep the navigation aids consistent.&nbsp;
Make sure menus cover the same areas&nbsp;&nbsp;

96

00:08:00,800  -->  00:08:04,235
and don't mix topics or confuse the user.

97

00:08:04,480  -->  00:08:09,440
A good strategy is to have different menus for&nbsp;
different types of information whenever possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;

98

00:08:10,240  -->  00:08:13,760
As we have shown in the Apple example,&nbsp;
the footer has a different navigation&nbsp;&nbsp;

99

00:08:13,760  -->  00:08:16,858
strategy than the main menu options.&nbsp;&nbsp;

100

00:08:16,858  -->  00:08:20,057
Assume that the content on the website will grow. 

101

00:08:20,057  -->  00:08:24,438
The growth principle speaks for&nbsp;
designing with the future in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102

00:08:24,438  -->  00:08:29,725
Assume that the content you have today is a small&nbsp;
part of the content you will have tomorrow.

103

00:08:30,080  -->  00:08:32,317
Make sure the website is scalable. 

104

00:08:32,317  -->  00:08:35,760
The content&nbsp;&nbsp;you start with is only a small&nbsp;
part of the content you get.

105

00:08:35,760  -->  00:08:42,294
So your site needs to be scalable. Give it room&nbsp;
to grow and develop organically and by addition.&nbsp;

106

00:08:43,040  -->  00:08:48,320
We live in a world where people want instant&nbsp;
gratification. This, coupled with an abundance&nbsp;&nbsp;

107

00:08:48,320  -->  00:08:55,077
of information and choice, means you really need&nbsp;
to deliver the right content at the right time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

108

00:08:55,840  -->  00:08:59,200
If the process of finding&nbsp;
information is too complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

109

00:08:59,200  -->  00:09:04,994
or too slow, the user will simply exit&nbsp;
the process and move on. &nbsp;

110

00:09:04,994  -->  00:09:10,684
Investing time&nbsp;in developing an effective 
information&nbsp;architecture yields many benefits.

111

00:09:12,320  -->  00:09:18,000
Happy users. Poor information architecture 
always leads&nbsp;to poor usability. &nbsp;

112

00:09:18,000  -->  00:09:22,400
A good information architecture&nbsp;
ensures that users can easily and quickly find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

113

00:09:22,400  -->  00:09:28,400
most used and most useful content and features&nbsp;
within an experience. That an experience behaves&nbsp;&nbsp;

114

00:09:28,400  -->  00:09:33,705
the way a user expects it to behave. Which&nbsp;
leads to greater customer satisfaction.&nbsp;

115

00:09:35,040  -->  00:09:38,800
More profit.
Lost business is one of the most obvious&nbsp;&nbsp;

116

00:09:38,800  -->  00:09:44,880
consequences of poor customer-centric IA. After&nbsp;
all, if users can't find the products they want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

117

00:09:44,880  -->  00:09:50,534
they won't be able to buy them. They will usually&nbsp;
find a competitor who solves their problem.&nbsp;

118

00:09:51,040  -->  00:09:55,434
While a good IA can actually&nbsp;
reduce costs. Two examples.

119

00:09:55,434  -->  00:10:00,240
When the information architecture makes it easy&nbsp;
for users to find what they are looking for,&nbsp;&nbsp;

120

00:10:00,240  -->  00:10:03,840
the cost of live help will drop significantly

121

00:10:04,560  -->  00:10:08,080
Organizing the data and content&nbsp;
of the website affects usability,&nbsp;&nbsp;

122

00:10:08,080  -->  00:10:13,920
conversions, and ranking. Ranking places the&nbsp;
website higher in the search results, usability&nbsp;&nbsp;

123

00:10:13,920  -->  00:10:19,057
makes the website user-friendly and a seamless&nbsp;
flow leads to a higher conversion rate.

124

00:10:19,057  -->  00:10:26,315
This means&nbsp;that significantly less money needs to be spent&nbsp;
on paid advertising to achieve the same results.&nbsp;

125

00:10:27,200  -->  00:10:33,440
Defining an effective information architecture&nbsp;
brings efficiency to the UX design process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

126

00:10:33,440  -->  00:10:39,520
Paying attention to the basics requires less effort for&nbsp;
the design. It also makes it easier and cheaper to&nbsp;&nbsp;

127

00:10:39,520  -->  00:10:44,960
maintain the experience. Since IA breaks down&nbsp;
the experience into reusable components and&nbsp;&nbsp;

128

00:10:44,960  -->  00:10:51,120
helps separate form and function. Good IA helps&nbsp;
reduce the cost of updating the experience by&nbsp;&nbsp;

129

00:10:51,120  -->  00:10:57,120
allowing updates to specific reusable components&nbsp;
of the system rather than to each page.

130

00:10:57,120  -->  00:11:02,560
So as you can see, the costs of poor&nbsp;
IA can quickly add up. What processes&nbsp;&nbsp;

131

00:11:02,560  -->  00:11:08,243
does a business employ to ensure they don’t&nbsp;
waste money or miss out on potential revenue?&nbsp;

132

00:11:08,720  -->  00:11:14,534
So now that you know the importance of IA, what&nbsp;
are the key information architecture processes?

133

00:11:14,880  -->  00:11:19,280
First. Define the business goals.&nbsp;
You can ask yourself two questions:&nbsp;&nbsp;

134

00:11:20,160  -->  00:11:24,846
Why do you want to do it and 
what do you&nbsp;want to achieve with it? 

135

00:11:24,846  -->  00:11:28,061
Goals fall into categories such as 
making more money, 

136

00:11:28,061  -->  00:11:31,812
reducing&nbsp;costs, or helping people 
make better decisions.&nbsp;

137

00:11:33,360  -->  00:11:38,240
Two. Define the user's goals. 
The first&nbsp;step to understanding how to design a&nbsp;&nbsp;

138

00:11:38,240  -->  00:11:43,680
robust architecture is to understand your&nbsp;
users. What are these users going to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

139

00:11:43,680  -->  00:11:46,905
on the website or app? 
What are their goals?&nbsp;&nbsp;

140

00:11:47,040  -->  00:11:52,960
Who are the people who will be using the website?&nbsp;
Follow UX practices: conduct user interviews,&nbsp;&nbsp;

141

00:11:52,960  -->  00:11:56,861
create personas, scenarios, and so on.&nbsp;

142

00:11:57,616  -->  00:12:01,177
Analyze competitors and their 
information architecture.&nbsp;

143

00:12:01,177  -->  00:12:05,600
Where do they show information?&nbsp;
What information is a common denominator?&nbsp;&nbsp;

144

00:12:05,600  -->  00:12:10,594
Is the website easy to navigate? 
What&nbsp;makes it good and what makes it bad?&nbsp;

145

00:12:12,240  -->  00:12:18,560
And define content. If a website already has&nbsp;
content, review it first and decide what to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

146

00:12:18,560  -->  00:12:25,405
and what to remove. If it's a complex site, focus&nbsp;
on the important parts and higher levels first.

147

00:12:26,960  -->  00:12:32,240
The content structure depends on several&nbsp;
factors. First of all, IA experts take into&nbsp;&nbsp;

148

00:12:32,240  -->  00:12:38,960
account the specific needs of the target audience,&nbsp;
because IA puts user satisfaction as a priority.&nbsp;&nbsp;

149

00:12:38,960  -->  00:12:44,276
The structure also depends on the type&nbsp;
of product and the offers companies have.

150

00:12:44,400  -->  00:12:48,080
For example, if we compare a&nbsp;
shopping website and a blog&nbsp;&nbsp;

151

00:12:48,080  -->  00:12:52,880
we see two absolutely different structures.&nbsp;
The content is therefore leading.&nbsp;&nbsp;

152

00:12:52,880  -->  00:12:57,760
Content is the heart of the website and should&nbsp;
be taken seriously from the start of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

153

00:12:57,760  -->  00:13:02,134
Build your website around&nbsp;
content, not the other way around.&nbsp;

154

00:13:02,960  -->  00:13:09,667
Creating the IA can be done in three steps:
Group and label the content.

155

00:13:09,798  -->  00:13:14,015
Define navigation and create&nbsp;
a site map and wireframes.

156

00:13:14,426  -->  00:13:16,850
User testing.

157

00:13:18,000  -->  00:13:21,200
Step 1: Group and label the content.

158

00:13:21,200  -->  00:13:25,920
Once you have a list of all&nbsp;
content, prioritize it and group.

159

00:13:25,920  -->  00:13:31,120
When identifying what content is a high priority&nbsp;
for the experience. The primary criteria should&nbsp;&nbsp;

160

00:13:31,120  -->  00:13:37,596
be what content is most important to users.&nbsp;
The card sorting exercise can help with this.&nbsp;

161

00:13:37,760  -->  00:13:42,560
Many corporate websites make the mistake&nbsp;
of using departments as a way to organize&nbsp;&nbsp;

162

00:13:42,560  -->  00:13:47,440
content in an experience. Always view the&nbsp;
experience from the user's point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;

163

00:13:47,440  -->  00:13:53,200
Don't make blind guesses when prioritizing&nbsp;
and categorizing your content. If you're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

164

00:13:53,200  -->  00:13:59,675
sure what type of content is most important to&nbsp;
users there's an easy solution: ask your users.&nbsp;

165

00:14:00,000  -->  00:14:04,320
Use for example card-sorting techniques&nbsp;
to help you group the content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

166

00:14:04,320  -->  00:14:09,200
We already talked about this a bit in the&nbsp;
chapter on research. Card sorting is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

167

00:14:09,200  -->  00:14:14,080
participatory design technique, which we use&nbsp;
to determine how users group different items&nbsp;&nbsp;

168

00:14:14,080  -->  00:14:20,925
into different categories. In the end, group&nbsp;
names can be refined into a menu and sitemap.&nbsp;

169

00:14:21,200  -->  00:14:23,154
It's a simple concept. 

170

00:14:23,154  -->  00:14:29,581
You write topics, pages,&nbsp;or features on cards 
and then ask the user to&nbsp;categorize them.

171

00:14:29,581  -->  00:14:33,440
Card sorting is invaluable&nbsp;
in figuring out how to structure something.&nbsp;&nbsp;

172

00:14:33,440  -->  00:14:37,564
An important step towards creating an&nbsp;
intuitive information architecture.

173

00:14:38,160  -->  00:14:42,160
Card sorting is a research technique&nbsp;
that makes it easy and affordable to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

174

00:14:42,160  -->  00:14:45,114
patterns in the way users organize content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

175

00:14:45,360  -->  00:14:49,920
These patterns are called the mental model of&nbsp;
the user. The relationships they create between&nbsp;&nbsp;

176

00:14:49,920  -->  00:14:56,347
cards will teach you which ideas or functions&nbsp;
are most related in the minds of the users.&nbsp;

177

00:14:57,440  -->  00:15:02,880
Card sorting is not the ultimate technique to find&nbsp;
the perfect IA of a website, it's merely a tool&nbsp;&nbsp;

178

00:15:02,880  -->  00:15:09,387
to understand the existing content and its flaws,&nbsp;
or the potential strengths of future content on a&nbsp;website.

179

00:15:09,387  -->  00:15:14,566
You need probably around 15 participants&nbsp;
to get good results and spot patterns.

180

00:15:14,880  -->  00:15:19,600
The words or phrases you write on the cards depend&nbsp;
on what you're trying to learn from your users.&nbsp;&nbsp;

181

00:15:19,600  -->  00:15:23,840
For example, if you want to know if&nbsp;
the way your website is organized is&nbsp;&nbsp;

182

00:15:23,840  -->  00:15:27,200
easy to understand, you can write&nbsp;
down the different pages of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

183

00:15:27,200  -->  00:15:32,236
website and ask users to sort them into&nbsp;
categories that make sense to them.&nbsp;

184

00:15:32,960  -->  00:15:38,240
This is an open card sorting session that&nbsp;
generates new ideas and category names.&nbsp;&nbsp;

185

00:15:38,240  -->  00:15:42,800
In contrast, in a closed card sort, you&nbsp;
provide participants with a predefined&nbsp;&nbsp;

186

00:15:42,800  -->  00:15:48,000
set of categories and ask them to sort&nbsp;
the items into the available categories.

187

00:15:48,000  -->  00:15:53,025
You can perform a card sorting session using&nbsp;
physical index cards or a digital tool.&nbsp;

188

00:15:53,840  -->  00:15:56,720
After conducting this research&nbsp;
and defining the content,&nbsp;&nbsp;

189

00:15:56,720  -->  00:16:01,760
the next step is to analyze the data. And make&nbsp;
decisions about where information is located.&nbsp;&nbsp;

190

00:16:02,400  -->  00:16:07,000
This is done in close collaboration with the&nbsp;
content strategist or copywriter in your team.&nbsp;

191

00:16:07,360  -->  00:16:11,840
Let's first look at groups or the categories&nbsp;
into which the information is divided.&nbsp;&nbsp;

192

00:16:11,840  -->  00:16:19,646
There are three main organizational structures:&nbsp;
hierarchical, sequential, and matrix.&nbsp;

193

00:16:20,080  -->  00:16:24,320
In hierarchical structures, also called tree&nbsp;
structures, there is a top-down approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;

194

00:16:25,040  -->  00:16:29,200
Many users are familiar with&nbsp;
structuring information in hierarchies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

195

00:16:29,200  -->  00:16:34,080
Users start with broader categories of&nbsp;
information. Then progress through the structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

196

00:16:34,080  -->  00:16:40,800
to find narrower, more detailed information.
Sequential structures require users to go step&nbsp;&nbsp;

197

00:16:40,800  -->  00:16:46,880
by step and follow a specific path through&nbsp;
the content. Sequential structures assume&nbsp;&nbsp;

198

00:16:46,880  -->  00:16:52,640
that there is an optimal ordering of content. 
An&nbsp;example of this type of structure is when a user&nbsp;&nbsp;

199

00:16:52,640  -->  00:16:58,754
tries to buy something. Also, this online course&nbsp;
you're taking right now is a sequential structure.&nbsp;

200

00:16:59,040  -->  00:17:04,880
A matrix structure allows users to define their&nbsp;
own path as content is linked in different ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;

201

00:17:04,880  -->  00:17:10,320
For example, one user may choose to navigate&nbsp;
through a range of content based on date.&nbsp;&nbsp;

202

00:17:10,320  -->  00:17:16,895
While another user navigates by subject.&nbsp;
Wikipedia is a great example of the matrix model.&nbsp;

203

00:17:17,040  -->  00:17:22,240
When structuring content it is important to decide&nbsp;
how you gonna group similar types of content&nbsp;&nbsp;

204

00:17:22,240  -->  00:17:26,946
or pieces of information. 
This is what we call&nbsp;taxonomies. 

205

00:17:27,217  -->  00:17:31,714
For example, a clothing store
may&nbsp;consider multiple taxonomies. 

206

00:17:31,714  -->  00:17:37,175
One based on fabric&nbsp;type, another based on clothing, 
and another based&nbsp;on color. 

207

00:17:37,175  -->  00:17:44,240
You can label a shirt with cotton, or&nbsp;
nylon, as well as a shirt or top and white. 

208

00:17:44,240  -->  00:17:50,976
That way, a shopper with the mental model “I need a new&nbsp;
shirt” could easily find this white cotton shirt.&nbsp;

209

00:17:51,600  -->  00:17:57,200
Labeling, or what we call pages and links on a&nbsp;
site, ensures that our navigation and hierarchy&nbsp;&nbsp;

210

00:17:57,200  -->  00:18:03,026
are properly titled, which plays a big role&nbsp;
in whether users can find that information.&nbsp;

211

00:18:03,680  -->  00:18:08,585
Step 2: Define navigation and&nbsp;
create site map &amp; wireframes.

212

00:18:08,880  -->  00:18:12,080
Information architecture is&nbsp;
not visible to the visitors but&nbsp;&nbsp;

213

00:18:12,080  -->  00:18:18,000
forms a backbone of the website. You can&nbsp;
represent it in a diagram called a sitemap.

214

00:18:18,320  -->  00:18:23,778
This illustrates the grouping of related&nbsp;
content and the hierarchical structure of&nbsp;a website.

215

00:18:23,778  -->  00:18:30,000
How do the pages within the website&nbsp;relate to each other 
and what dependencies exist&nbsp;between them? 

216

00:18:30,000  -->  00:18:34,434
To create a sitemap, you need&nbsp;
to have content that is grouped and labeled.&nbsp;

217

00:18:34,800  -->  00:18:40,504
Creating a sitemap seems like a simple task.&nbsp;
However, there is much more to creating a solid&nbsp;sitemap

218

00:18:40,504  -->  00:18:45,760
than listing all the available pages and&nbsp;
linking them together to form the website content.

219

00:18:45,760  -->  00:18:50,320
The sitemap consists of a hierarchical&nbsp;
structure with global navigation displayed&nbsp;&nbsp;

220

00:18:50,320  -->  00:18:52,490
in the first level of this structure.

221

00:18:52,852  -->  00:18:57,891
All pages&nbsp;within the website should flow 
logically from&nbsp;the main navigation. 

222

00:18:57,891  -->  00:19:01,120
From the first level of the&nbsp;
hierarchical structure, the content is structured&nbsp;&nbsp;

223

00:19:01,120  -->  00:19:04,078
in a second and possibly third level. 

224

00:19:04,078  -->  00:19:09,910
Don't make&nbsp;the hierarchical structure too deep, 
as the user&nbsp;can quickly get lost and not find content.

225

00:19:09,910  -->  00:19:13,325
In general, your sitemap will either be very flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

226

00:19:13,325  -->  00:19:17,578
With more sections in the menu and fewer&nbsp;
clicks needed to get to the bottom. 

227

00:19:17,578  -->  00:19:23,221
Or your&nbsp;sitemap will be deep menus, 
but more clicks to&nbsp;get to where you are. 

228

00:19:23,221  -->  00:19:26,005
Sites with many products such as Amazone, 

229

00:19:26,005  -->  00:19:30,560
often need deep architecture.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the menus will be ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp;

230

00:19:30,560  -->  00:19:36,000
Sites like YouTube, which only users and&nbsp;
videos interact with, tend to be flatter.

231

00:19:36,640  -->  00:19:39,920
While a sitemap can show possible&nbsp;
navigation paths between two parts&nbsp;&nbsp;

232

00:19:39,920  -->  00:19:44,400
of a site, it usually cannot show&nbsp;
every possible navigation path.&nbsp;&nbsp;

233

00:19:44,400  -->  00:19:47,840
Please note that the sitemap is a&nbsp;
general representation of the experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

234

00:19:47,840  -->  00:19:54,356
not a definitive blueprint of every aspect or&nbsp;
detail of how the ultimate experience will behave.&nbsp;

235

00:19:55,200  -->  00:20:01,015
For some UX designers, wireframes are the best&nbsp;
way to represent the connections between different&nbsp;screens.

236

00:20:01,015  -->  00:20:06,800
Wireframes visualize a user path or flow,&nbsp;
as well as page layouts, information hierarchy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

237

00:20:06,800  -->  00:20:12,635
and even interactions. Even though they look&nbsp;
simple, that doesn't mean you made them easy.

238

00:20:12,800  -->  00:20:19,666
Good wireframes take time. Every little piece has&nbsp;
to be carefully planned and placed on a specific&nbsp;page.

239

00:20:19,666  -->  00:20:26,685
Every page needs a link to get there.&nbsp;
Wireframes are 90% thinking and 10% drawing.&nbsp;

240

00:20:27,680  -->  00:20:30,880
Anyone, regardless of his or her drawing ability,&nbsp;&nbsp;

241

00:20:30,880  -->  00:20:35,464
can sketch a wireframe to explore&nbsp;
possible solutions to design problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

242

00:20:35,840  -->  00:20:43,026
Take it step by step and use common components&nbsp;
to create fast, messy, yet useful wireframes.

243

00:20:43,280  -->  00:20:48,806
Unless you're creating a very complex site with&nbsp;a lot of 
different content, you don't need an expensive tool. &nbsp;&nbsp;

244

00:20:48,806  -->  00:20:54,400
Most are too complicated, most of&nbsp; the time. 
You can just use Figma, Sketch, or even&nbsp;&nbsp;

245

00:20:54,400  -->  00:21:01,044
Keynote and Powerpoint to create them. The easiest&nbsp;
is with pencil and paper, or even a whiteboard.&nbsp;

246

00:21:02,160  -->  00:21:08,560
A wireframe primarily focuses on the information,&nbsp;
interface, and navigation of the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

247

00:21:08,560  -->  00:21:13,135
All major components of an experience should&nbsp;
be reflected in the wireframe of your page.&nbsp;&nbsp;

248

00:21:13,135  -->  00:21:18,000
Use simple shapes instead of real images,&nbsp;
copy or text, and label them. &nbsp;

249

00:21:18,000  -->  00:21:21,456
Messy is&nbsp; fine. They are wireframes, 
not the Mona Lisa.

250

00:21:22,180  -->  00:21:24,720
Step 3: User testing

251

00:21:24,720  -->  00:21:28,640
There are a number of ways to test whether&nbsp;
the information architecture works,&nbsp;&nbsp;

252

00:21:28,640  -->  00:21:31,585
depending on the design stage and goals.

253

00:21:32,000  -->  00:21:36,480
Tree testing is a quantitative research&nbsp;
method that allows you to test the hierarchy&nbsp;&nbsp;

254

00:21:36,480  -->  00:21:42,560
and findability of topics in an app or website.&nbsp;
During tree testing, only the text version of&nbsp;&nbsp;

255

00:21:42,560  -->  00:21:47,760
the site is given to the participants, who&nbsp;
are asked to complete a series of tasks.

256

00:21:47,760  -->  00:21:51,200
For instance, add a banana to your shopping cart.

257

00:21:51,200  -->  00:21:55,040
Tree tests show us whether the names&nbsp;
of the categories are understandable.&nbsp;

258

00:21:55,040  -->  00:22:01,960
Whether they convey the content correctly.
If the content is categorized in a&nbsp;user-oriented way.

259

00:22:01,960  -->  00:22:05,001
Whether the titles&nbsp;are distinguishable from each other.

260

00:22:05,001  -->  00:22:08,613
And whether the information is easy to find.&nbsp;

261

00:22:08,613  -->  00:22:12,720
You can use cart sorting when defining&nbsp;
the IA, but you can also use it later on&nbsp;&nbsp;

262

00:22:12,720  -->  00:22:17,360
to test the new website architecture.&nbsp;
This time you use the closed variant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

263

00:22:17,360  -->  00:22:21,289
Where the category names are already defined.&nbsp;

264

00:22:21,289  -->  00:22:24,827
Click tests are a quick and easy way 
to test&nbsp;wireframes.

265

00:22:24,827  -->  00:22:30,000
It shows us which navigation&nbsp;elements are used 
and which are overlooked or&nbsp;avoided. 

266

00:22:30,000  -->  00:22:35,680
The test provides participants with a&nbsp;
static wireframe, before asking questions such as&nbsp;&nbsp;

267

00:22:35,680  -->  00:22:40,160
Where would you click to launch a&nbsp;
specific action to another page?

268

00:22:40,160  -->  00:22:45,360
The places on the screen where a user clicks&nbsp;
is recorded for post-test analysis, with&nbsp;&nbsp;

269

00:22:45,360  -->  00:22:51,968
the first place they select being the most common&nbsp;
measurement, often referred to as first-click&nbsp;testing.

270

00:22:51,968  -->  00:22:57,974
The generated results can take the&nbsp;
visual form of a heatmap, clickmap, or a darkmap.&nbsp;

271

00:22:58,320  -->  00:23:04,262
Usability testing is used to determine how&nbsp;
and why users use a website or a product.&nbsp;&nbsp;

272

00:23:04,400  -->  00:23:09,120
It is one of the qualitative testing techniques.&nbsp;
We described this method in detail in one&nbsp;&nbsp;

273

00:23:09,120  -->  00:23:13,600
of the lessons before, so check out the UX&nbsp;
research lesson again for more information.&nbsp;

274

00:23:14,320  -->  00:23:19,680
In summary, we can say that information&nbsp;
architecture is a core part of user experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

275

00:23:19,680  -->  00:23:24,880
Efficient IA helps users navigate&nbsp;
content and find everything they need.

276

00:23:24,880  -->  00:23:27,903
Let's&nbsp;summarize what we discussed 
during this lesson.

277

00:23:28,658  -->  00:23:32,822
Information architecture is how you organize 
and&nbsp;present your content to the user. 

278

00:23:32,822  -->  00:23:36,800
So that they can&nbsp;find everything they need 
without great effort.

279

00:23:36,800  -->  00:23:40,960
A website's IA needs to address&nbsp;
four different user needs.&nbsp;

280

00:23:40,960  -->  00:23:46,640
Known-item seeking: Users will come to the website&nbsp;
to search for something desirable and known.&nbsp;

281

00:23:46,640  -->  00:23:51,520
Exploratory seeking: Users will come to the&nbsp;
website looking for inspiration. 

282

00:23:51,520  -->  00:23:54,514
They’re looking&nbsp;for something desirable 
but not sure what exactly.

283

00:23:55,208  -->  00:23:58,777
Exhaustive research: Users are in the 
process&nbsp;of extensive research. 

284

00:23:58,777  -->  00:24:01,684
They want to&nbsp;find as much 
information as possible.&nbsp;

285

00:24:01,920  -->  00:24:06,794
Re-finding: A user needs a desired&nbsp;
item again and is trying to find it.

286

00:24:07,760  -->  00:24:09,920
The main components of IA are:

287

00:24:09,920  -->  00:24:15,120
Organization Schemes and Structures: 
How&nbsp; you categorize and structure information.

288

00:24:15,120  -->  00:24:19,084
Labeling Systems: 
How you represent information.

289

00:24:19,084  -->  00:24:23,654
Navigation Systems:&nbsp;
How users browse or move through information.

290

00:24:23,654  -->  00:24:26,981
Search Systems: 
How users look for information.&nbsp;

291

00:24:27,920  -->  00:24:33,455
Dan Brown developed eight principles that help&nbsp;
build or test a good information architecture.

292

00:24:33,600  -->  00:24:36,000
1. The principle of objects

293

00:24:36,000  -->  00:24:40,363
This principle means that content should&nbsp;
be treated as a living, breathing thing.

294

00:24:41,117  -->  00:24:43,202
2. The principle of choices

295

00:24:43,202  -->  00:24:48,000
The principle of choices is simple: Keep&nbsp;
the number of choices small. Less is more.

296

00:24:48,320  -->  00:24:50,880
3. The principle of disclosure

297

00:24:50,880  -->  00:24:54,480
Only display enough information to&nbsp;
help people understand what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

298

00:24:54,480  -->  00:24:57,645
of information they will find if they dig deeper.

299

00:24:58,320  -->  00:25:00,720
4. The principle of exemplars

300

00:25:00,720  -->  00:25:03,760
Shows examples when describing&nbsp;
the content of the categories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

301

00:25:03,760  -->  00:25:06,834
to show users what they will be able to access.

302

00:25:07,600  -->  00:25:10,000
5. The principle of front doors

303

00:25:10,000  -->  00:25:13,200
Not all users will enter your&nbsp;
site on the homepage. Assume that&nbsp;&nbsp;

304

00:25:13,200  -->  00:25:18,400
the majority of users will even use a&nbsp;
different access point than the home page.

305

00:25:18,400  -->  00:25:21,312
6. The principle of multiple classifications

306

00:25:21,312  -->  00:25:25,891
This principle is based on providing&nbsp;
easy ways to find information on your&nbsp;website. 

307

00:25:25,891  -->  00:25:29,715
Provide users with different&nbsp;
ways to browse the site's content.

308

00:25:30,560  -->  00:25:33,360
7. The principle of focused navigation

309

00:25:33,360  -->  00:25:37,680
Keep the navigation aids consistent.&nbsp;
Make sure menus cover the same areas&nbsp;&nbsp;

310

00:25:37,680  -->  00:25:40,955
and don't mix topics or confuse the users.

311

00:25:41,200  -->  00:25:43,040
8. The principle of growth

312

00:25:43,040  -->  00:25:46,022
Assume that the content on the website will grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

313

00:25:46,022  -->  00:25:49,805
The growth principle speaks for&nbsp;
designing with the future in mind.&nbsp;

314

00:25:50,240  -->  00:25:54,480
Investing time in developing effective&nbsp;
information architecture, therefore, yields&nbsp;&nbsp;

315

00:25:54,480  -->  00:26:00,705
many benefits like happy users, more&nbsp;
profit, cost reduction, and efficiency

316

00:26:00,880  -->  00:26:04,960
To start the process
Define the business goals.

317

00:26:04,960  -->  00:26:09,600
Define the user's goals.
Analyze competitors.

318

00:26:09,600  -->  00:26:11,364
Define content.

319

00:26:12,080  -->  00:26:16,320
Creating the IA can be done in three steps:
Group and label the content.

320

00:26:16,320  -->  00:26:20,564
Define navigation and create site map.
User testing.

321

00:26:21,840  -->  00:26:25,200
As you can see, a well-structured&nbsp;
information architecture&nbsp;&nbsp;

322

00:26:25,200  -->  00:26:30,640
makes it easier for visitors to find what&nbsp;
they need. Content is therefore central to&nbsp;&nbsp;

323

00:26:30,640  -->  00:26:36,361
every user experience. That's what our next&nbsp;
lesson on content strategy is all about.
