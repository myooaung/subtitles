1

00:00:06,970  -->  00:00:11,289
Have you ever used a website or app that frustrated
you so much that you wanted to throw your

2

00:00:11,289  -->  00:00:12,860
device out the window?

3

00:00:12,860  -->  00:00:17,570
Then you know what it means 
to encounter a bad user experience.

4

00:00:17,570  -->  00:00:22,119
Almost everything you do in life is 
a user experience.

5

00:00:22,119  -->  00:00:25,101
The mobile payment for your takeaway coffee.

6

00:00:25,101  -->  00:00:28,276
Or the reservation you make at your favorite restaurant.

7

00:00:28,276  -->  00:00:31,695
Your friend's photo you like on Instagram

8

00:00:31,983  -->  00:00:37,399
The car you drive.
The navigation you use to find your way

9

00:00:37,399  -->  00:00:38,739
Or the Uber that you order

10

00:00:38,739  -->  00:00:40,640
They are all a user experience.

11

00:00:40,640  -->  00:00:41,990
Or in short UX.

12

00:00:43,355  -->  00:00:46,400
Hi! Welcome to Learn UX Today.

13

00:00:46,400  -->  00:00:51,420
My name is Ruben and I have been working as
a UX designer for over 20 years.

14

00:00:51,420  -->  00:00:56,940
In this course I share some personal insights
and stories about my experience in the industry.

15

00:00:56,940  -->  00:01:01,210
During this course, you will gain a thorough
understanding of the UX principles that come

16

00:01:01,210  -->  00:01:06,080
together to create a user experience when
using a product or service.

17

00:01:06,080  -->  00:01:11,000
Along the way, you'll learn the value UX provides
and which aspects to consider when designing

18

00:01:11,000  -->  00:01:13,123
great user experiences.

19

00:01:13,123  -->  00:01:16,230
Let's have a look at what you can 
expect in the upcoming lessons.

20

00:01:16,230  -->  00:01:20,360
In the first chapter, I'm going to give you
an introduction to UX.

21

00:01:20,360  -->  00:01:26,073
I will explain what UX really is, the factors
that influence the user experience.

22

00:01:26,073  -->  00:01:30,310
How the profession came to be, 
the input needed for a good experience, 

23

00:01:30,310  -->  00:01:32,810
the different disciplines, and more.

24

00:01:32,810  -->  00:01:36,430
In the second chapter, 
we cover the UX design process.

25

00:01:36,430  -->  00:01:40,870
In six lessons I guide you through every step
of the design thinking framework.

26

00:01:40,870  -->  00:01:46,890
This is an iterative process in which we try
to understand the user, question assumptions,

27

00:01:46,890  -->  00:01:51,594
and redefine problems to find alternative
strategies and innovative solutions.

28

00:01:52,534  -->  00:01:57,857
In the final chapter, I'll talk about the
fundamentals that fall under the broad spectrum of UX

29

00:01:58,320  -->  00:02:07,270
We cover usability, accessibility, user research,
cognitive psychology, information architecture,

30

00:02:07,270  -->  00:02:12,134
content strategy, interaction design, 
and visual design.

31

00:02:12,134  -->  00:02:16,300
But first, let's start by explaining what
UX really is.

32

00:02:16,300  -->  00:02:19,340
Simply put, UX stands for user experience.

33

00:02:19,340  -->  00:02:23,810
It refers to any interaction someone has with
a product or a service.

34

00:02:24,388  -->  00:02:28,910
It takes into account every element that makes up 
this experience, how it makes them

35

00:02:28,910  -->  00:02:32,645
feel, and how easy it is to accomplish 
their desired tasks.

36

00:02:32,645  -->  00:02:34,560
This could be anything.

37

00:02:34,560  -->  00:02:40,174
From how a physical product lies in your hand
to how easy an online checkout process is.

38

00:02:40,174  -->  00:02:43,140
It can be about all kinds of products 
and services.

39

00:02:43,140  -->  00:02:48,080
In general, however, the term user experience
design is used for digital products such as

40

00:02:48,080  -->  00:02:51,880
websites, apps, and other digital interfaces.

41

00:02:51,880  -->  00:02:57,810
Good UX ensures that customers use and enjoy
the experiences you designed.

42

00:02:57,810  -->  00:03:01,160
Essential for creating 
customer loyalty and goodwill.

43

00:03:01,160  -->  00:03:05,319
A UX designer, therefore, puts the user at
the center of all considerations so that the

44

00:03:05,319  -->  00:03:11,616
final experience delivers interactions that
are intuitive, useful, and enjoyable.

45

00:03:12,383  -->  00:03:16,180
And that's essentially what 
a good user experience is all about.

46

00:03:16,180  -->  00:03:20,180
The top three questions every 
UX professional should ask are:

47

00:03:20,180  -->  00:03:22,790
Does the site or app provide 
value to the user?

48

00:03:22,790  -->  00:03:25,000
In other words, is it useful?

49

00:03:25,000  -->  00:03:28,569
Does the user find it easy to use and navigate?

50

00:03:28,569  -->  00:03:30,770
Is it usable?

51

00:03:30,770  -->  00:03:34,170
Does the user like using the site or app?

52

00:03:34,170  -->  00:03:35,650
Is it desirable?

53

00:03:35,650  -->  00:03:40,349
If the answer to all the above is yes, then
you are on the right track.

54

00:03:40,349  -->  00:03:43,540
Because user experience is such 
an evolving concept.

55

00:03:43,540  -->  00:03:49,110
It is difficult to provide a comprehensive
definition of the term 'user experience'.

56

00:03:49,110  -->  00:03:53,379
The most used definition in the industry is
that of Don Norman, the pioneer, and inventor

57

00:03:53,379  -->  00:03:55,733
of the term "user experience".

58

00:03:57,000  -->  00:03:59,629
“User experience encompasses all aspects

59

00:03:59,629  -->  00:04:05,440
of the end-users interaction with the company,
its services, and its products.”

60

00:04:06,879  -->  00:04:12,700
As Norman points out, user experience is an
umbrella term that covers many different areas.

61

00:04:12,700  -->  00:04:15,280
From interaction design to content design.

62

00:04:15,280  -->  00:04:20,079
And it has interfaces with fields from 
architecture to psychology.

63

00:04:20,079  -->  00:04:24,440
This illustration can be very overwhelming,
but to think that you have to be an expert

64

00:04:24,440  -->  00:04:27,720
in all these circles is of course absurd.

65

00:04:27,720  -->  00:04:32,880
So don't see this as the only roadmap for
the entire UX design industry, but as an assumption

66

00:04:32,880  -->  00:04:36,900
about why it's so complicated 
to get good UX.

67

00:04:36,900  -->  00:04:40,516
It's good to know which areas impact 
the userexperience so you know 

68

00:04:40,516  -->  00:04:42,796
what tools are available to you.

69

00:04:43,199  -->  00:04:48,060
The first requirement for a good user experience
is to meet the customer's needs.

70

00:04:48,060  -->  00:04:51,480
And this goes way beyond giving 
customers what they want.

71

00:04:51,480  -->  00:04:56,440
Ideally, the user experience is designed to
avoid frustration and delays.

72

00:04:56,440  -->  00:04:58,540
It’s seamless and effortless.

73

00:04:58,540  -->  00:05:03,470
And the user understands what to do and how
to get where they want to go.

74

00:05:03,470  -->  00:05:07,030
It's also good to know that everything has
a user experience.

75

00:05:07,030  -->  00:05:09,130
It's not your job to create the user experience.

76

00:05:09,130  -->  00:05:12,470
It's your job to make it a good one.

77

00:05:12,470  -->  00:05:16,081
User experience is such a popular term in
today's digital industry 

78

00:05:16,081  -->  00:05:18,830
that everyone uses it freely.

79

00:05:18,830  -->  00:05:23,130
Although building a product with an enjoyable
user experience sounds easy, is this where

80

00:05:23,130  -->  00:05:25,270
most people are wrong.

81

00:05:25,270  -->  00:05:31,401
So before we dive deep into the world of UX,
we need to debunk a persistent misconception.

82

00:05:31,952  -->  00:05:36,879
We tend to assume that people who will use
the products we've designed are just like us.

83

00:05:37,400  -->  00:05:42,130
When non-UX professionals speak of what they
believe is a better user experience

84

00:05:42,130  -->  00:05:45,060
they often refer to their own experience.

85

00:05:45,060  -->  00:05:49,239
While they only have one example of someone
using the interface… themselves.

86

00:05:50,009  -->  00:05:51,140
And this is dangerous thinking.

87

00:05:51,140  -->  00:05:56,461
The real people who use your product every
day are not like you, even if you are one

88

00:05:56,461  -->  00:05:57,461
of them.

89

00:05:57,461  -->  00:06:02,389
Your needs, problems and understanding of
the experience are not the same.

90

00:06:02,389  -->  00:06:05,380
That's why it's important to always keep one
thing in mind...

91

00:06:08,527  -->  00:06:10,259
“You are not the user” has become one

92

00:06:10,259  -->  00:06:13,250
of the mantras of user experience
and for good reason.

93

00:06:13,250  -->  00:06:14,710
We all make assumptions.

94

00:06:14,710  -->  00:06:17,800
It's a very human, natural thing to do.

95

00:06:17,800  -->  00:06:24,190
But, you can't learn anything about users
if you work with your own assumptions.

96

00:06:24,190  -->  00:06:28,300
UX professionals always start with the fact
that they are different from their users.

97

00:06:28,300  -->  00:06:32,119
Otherwise, we'll make generalizations based
on that one example...

98

00:06:32,119  -->  00:06:33,267
our own experience.

99

00:06:34,979  -->  00:06:39,120
Assuming you are your user is natural and
it is a misconception that is ingrained in

100

00:06:39,120  -->  00:06:40,729
the human mind.

101

00:06:40,729  -->  00:06:43,440
It's called the false consensus effect.

102

00:06:43,440  -->  00:06:48,990
The false-consensus effect refers to people’s
tendency to assume that others share their

103

00:06:48,990  -->  00:06:53,270
beliefs and will behave similarly 
in a given context.

104

00:06:53,270  -->  00:06:57,102
Only people who are very different from them
would make different choices.

105

00:06:58,380  -->  00:07:00,550
So what can you do to overcome this?

106

00:07:00,550  -->  00:07:04,500
First, acknowledge this bias
so that you are aware of it.

107

00:07:04,500  -->  00:07:07,710
Second, talk to the people that 
you're designing a product for.

108

00:07:07,710  -->  00:07:11,039
And by this I mean real users, not your colleagues.

109

00:07:11,039  -->  00:07:15,790
Know who your users are and test how they
respond to your designs by seeing them use

110

00:07:15,790  -->  00:07:16,830
those designs.

111

00:07:16,830  -->  00:07:22,220
When you do user research, you can provide
your users with the best solutions because

112

00:07:22,220  -->  00:07:24,780
you have discovered exactly what they need.

113

00:07:24,780  -->  00:07:26,650
So don't make assumptions.

114

00:07:26,650  -->  00:07:31,017
Later in this course, you'll learn all about
researching user motivations and needs.

115

00:07:31,272  -->  00:07:33,720
Now that we've got that out of the way.

116

00:07:33,720  -->  00:07:37,330
What skills and qualities do you need to be
a good UX professional?

117

00:07:37,330  -->  00:07:39,729
In other words, what does it mean to do UX?

118

00:07:39,729  -->  00:07:45,090
A UX role can vary widely from organization
to organization, but they always demand that

119

00:07:45,090  -->  00:07:50,330
they be the user advocate and put the needs
of the users at the center of all design efforts.

120

00:07:50,330  -->  00:07:54,599
Whether you are a UX designer, UX writer,
or researcher.

121

00:07:54,599  -->  00:07:59,400
The commonality between all UX roles is a
strong focus on users.

122

00:07:59,400  -->  00:08:02,770
It involves a process very similar to doing
science.

123

00:08:02,770  -->  00:08:06,349
You do research to understand the users and
the problem space.

124

00:08:06,349  -->  00:08:10,870
You make ideas to solve the needs of the users
and the business, and you build and check

125

00:08:10,870  -->  00:08:13,860
those solutions in the real world to see whether
they work.

126

00:08:13,860  -->  00:08:19,180
I will show you in detail how this design
process works in chapter 2.

127

00:08:19,180  -->  00:08:23,380
No standard background or path is leading
to a career in UX.

128

00:08:23,380  -->  00:08:25,700
This course is hopefully your first step.

129

00:08:25,700  -->  00:08:30,940
UX designers come from all walks of life such
as visual design, marketing, psychology, and

130

00:08:30,940  -->  00:08:32,840
interaction design.

131

00:08:32,840  -->  00:08:37,330
So what skills do you need to become a 
UX designer or researcher?

132

00:08:37,330  -->  00:08:42,349
UX professionals are strategic thinkers with
a conceptual approach to problem-solving.

133

00:08:42,349  -->  00:08:44,209
They love the challenge of diving into data.

134

00:08:44,209  -->  00:08:48,680
They understand the importance of every piece
of information and no means are therefore

135

00:08:48,680  -->  00:08:51,339
left untouched during the research phase.

136

00:08:51,339  -->  00:08:55,352
They know that the UX strategy is only as
strong as the data and research.

137

00:08:56,120  -->  00:09:01,239
The best UX professionals typically share
certain qualities and attributes, including:

138

00:09:01,239  -->  00:09:07,759
An ability to think both creatively and analytically.
A user-first mentality

139

00:09:07,759  -->  00:09:11,410
Interest in technology 
and how people interact with it

140

Strong problem-solving skills.
Strong communication and presentation skills.

144

00:09:28,350  -->  00:09:31,310
Flexibility and adaptability

145

00:09:31,559  -->  00:09:33,559
So much for the first lesson.

146

00:09:33,559  -->  00:09:35,639
Let's recap what we've covered.

147

00:09:35,639  -->  00:09:39,720
I started by explaining what UX really is.

148

00:09:39,720  -->  00:09:42,699
Simply put, UX stands for user experience.

149

00:09:42,699  -->  00:09:47,240
It refers to any interaction someone has with
a product or service.

150

00:09:47,240  -->  00:09:51,129
It takes into account every element that is
part of this experience, how it makes them

151

00:09:51,129  -->  00:09:55,158
feel, and how easy it is to accomplish their
desired tasks.

152

00:09:55,465  -->  00:10:00,230
A UX designer puts the user at the center
of all considerations so that the final experience

153

00:10:00,230  -->  00:10:05,119
delivers interactions that are intuitive,
useful, and enjoyable.

154

00:10:05,867  -->  00:10:10,529
The first requirement for a good user experience
is to meet the user’s needs.

155

00:10:10,529  -->  00:10:14,360
And it’s important to keep in mind that
you are not that user.

156

00:10:14,360  -->  00:10:15,540
We all make assumptions.

157

00:10:15,540  -->  00:10:17,949
It's a very human, natural thing to do.

158

00:10:17,949  -->  00:10:23,100
But, you can't learn anything about users
if you work with your own assumptions.

159

00:10:23,100  -->  00:10:28,010
UX professionals always start with the fact
that they are different from their users.

160

00:10:28,010  -->  00:10:31,759
They are strategic thinkers with a conceptual
approach to problem-solving.

161

00:10:32,776  -->  00:10:37,980
Before we dive deeper into the world of UX,
it's good to go back in time to see how the

162

00:10:37,980  -->  00:10:39,579
UX field came to be.

163

00:10:39,579  -->  00:10:43,600
And how companies have designed their products
with the needs of their users in mind.

164

00:10:43,600  -->  00:10:46,899
I'll tell you all about it in the next lesson.
