1

00:00:07,120  -->  00:00:08,850
Once you've empathized with your users.

2

00:00:08,850  -->  00:00:13,559
You can move on to the second phase of the
Design Thinking process: the define phase.

3

00:00:13,559  -->  00:00:19,070
Here you get a clear picture of exactly what
problem you are trying to solve for the user.

4

00:00:19,070  -->  00:00:22,700
You then work this out into a meaningful problem
statement that will function as your northern

5

00:00:22,700  -->  00:00:25,730
lights during the design process.

6

00:00:25,730  -->  00:00:29,309
This is perhaps the most challenging part
of the Design Thinking process.

7

00:00:29,309  -->  00:00:34,690
It requires you to synthesize your observations
about your users from the first stage.

8

00:00:34,690  -->  00:00:40,109
The relationship between the empathize and
define stages is best described in terms of

9

00:00:40,109  -->  00:00:42,534
analysis and synthesis.

10

00:00:42,534  -->  00:00:47,760
In the first phase, we used analysis to break
down everything we observed and discovered

11

00:00:47,760  -->  00:00:51,989
about our users into smaller, 
easier-to-understand components.

12

00:00:51,989  -->  00:00:54,977
For example by creating an empathy map.

13

00:00:54,977  -->  00:00:58,702
In the definition phase, we piece these 
components back together to create 

14

00:00:58,702  -->  00:01:00,909
a detailed overall picture.

15

00:01:00,909  -->  00:01:06,580
We organize, interpret and give meaning to
the data we have collected to formulate a problem.

16

00:01:06,580  -->  00:01:09,749
This is called synthesizing.

17

00:01:09,749  -->  00:01:14,450
A problem statement identifies the gap between
the current state and the desired state of

18

00:01:14,450  -->  00:01:17,070
a process or product.

19

00:01:17,070  -->  00:01:20,370
You can see the user problem as an unmet need.

20

00:01:20,370  -->  00:01:24,640
By designing a solution that meets this need,
you can satisfy the user and ensure a pleasant

21

00:01:24,640  -->  00:01:26,704
user experience.

22

00:01:26,704  -->  00:01:29,280
A problem statement frames this need in a
way that is feasible.

23

00:01:29,280  -->  00:01:34,460
It gives a clear description of the problem
you want to tackle, with the user at the center

24

00:01:34,460  -->  00:01:36,790
at all times.

25

00:01:36,790  -->  00:01:40,890
Without a well-defined problem statement,
it is difficult to know what you want to achieve.

26

00:01:40,890  -->  00:01:45,490
It is also difficult to explain to stakeholders
and team members exactly what you are trying

27

00:01:45,490  -->  00:01:46,934
to achieve.

28

00:01:46,934  -->  00:01:51,290
A meaningful, actionable problem statement
will therefore steer you in the right direction

29

00:01:51,290  -->  00:01:54,512
during the ideation process.

30

00:01:55,988  -->  00:02:00,602
Here are some tips that will help you create
a meaningful problem statement:

31

00:02:00,602  -->  00:02:05,290
Focus on the user: The problem statement should
be about the people you are trying to help.

32

00:02:05,290  -->  00:02:09,720
Not about technology, product specifications
or business goals.

33

00:02:09,720  -->  00:02:11,560
Concentrate on the user's perspective.

34

00:02:12,751  -->  00:02:18,819
Keep it broad: A good problem statement should
not focus too narrowly on a specific implementation.

35

00:02:18,819  -->  00:02:24,709
It prevents you from exploring areas that
may offer unexpected value or new insights.

36

00:02:24,709  -->  00:02:30,549
A good problem definition therefore leaves
room for innovation and creative freedom.

37

00:02:30,549  -->  00:02:35,249
Make it manageable: On the other hand, don't
try to address too many user needs in one

38

00:02:35,249  -->  00:02:36,709
problem statement.

39

00:02:36,709  -->  00:02:40,340
It then becomes too overwhelming, 
while it also has to give direction.

40

00:02:40,340  -->  00:02:45,069
So give it sufficient constraints to make
the project manageable.

41

00:02:45,069  -->  00:02:46,890
So how do you define a problem statement?

42

00:02:46,890  -->  00:02:50,150
There are four steps you can follow.

43

00:02:50,150  -->  00:02:54,760
One of the first steps in defining a problem
statement is to organize your findings from

44

00:02:54,760  -->  00:02:56,911
the empathize stage.

45

00:02:56,911  -->  00:03:01,269
A popular method is to collect all observations
and findings in one place to create a collage

46

00:03:01,269  -->  00:03:04,930
of experiences, thoughts, insights and stories.

47

00:03:04,930  -->  00:03:08,090
They call this: Space saturation and group.

48

00:03:08,090  -->  00:03:11,999
The term "saturate" describes the way the
team covers the space with their collective

49

00:03:11,999  -->  00:03:19,799
images, notes, observations, data, experiences,
interviews, thoughts, insights, and stories

50

00:03:19,799  -->  00:03:24,980
to create a wall of information to support
the problem-defining process.

51

00:03:25,656  -->  00:03:30,840
Second, you group these findings to explore
which themes and patterns emerge.

52

00:03:30,840  -->  00:03:35,319
It is then possible to connect the dots and
to develop new and deeper insights that help

53

00:03:35,319  -->  00:03:38,219
define the problem and develop possible solutions.

54

00:03:38,219  -->  00:03:42,695
In other words: go from analysis to synthesis.

55

00:03:42,695  -->  00:03:48,209
The best way to get to the heart of the problem
is to look at it from multiple angles.

56

00:03:48,209  -->  00:03:54,230
By answering a few basic questions, you can
formulate a better definition of your problem.

57

00:03:54,230  -->  00:03:58,920
With all your findings from the empathy phase
in one place, ask yourself the following four

58

00:03:58,920  -->  00:04:03,540
questions: who, what, where, and why?

59

00:04:04,749  -->  00:04:06,529
Who is experiencing the problem?

60

00:04:06,529  -->  00:04:10,889
Start by defining your target user, their
needs and motivations, and how they interact

61

00:04:10,889  -->  00:04:12,529
with your product.

62

00:04:12,529  -->  00:04:14,680
What's the problem?

63

00:04:14,680  -->  00:04:17,810
What are the pain points that emerged in the
empathy phase?

64

00:04:17,810  -->  00:04:22,731
What task is the user trying to accomplish
and what is standing in the way?

65

00:04:22,731  -->  00:04:24,270
Where is the problem?

66

00:04:24,270  -->  00:04:28,990
What space, situation or context is the user
in when confronted with this problem?

67

00:04:28,990  -->  00:04:30,680
Physical or digital?

68

00:04:30,680  -->  00:04:32,699
Are other people involved?

69

00:04:32,699  -->  00:04:36,551
This will give you a better understanding
of the context.

70

00:04:36,551  -->  00:04:38,720
Why is it important to solve this problem?

71

00:04:38,720  -->  00:04:41,449
This question is perhaps the most in-depth
of all four questions.

72

00:04:41,449  -->  00:04:45,763
You will be asked what it would mean for your
user if the problem were solved.

73

00:04:47,150  -->  00:04:51,910
Another question-based strategy is the five
whys technique that can help you get to the

74

00:04:51,910  -->  00:04:53,840
root of the problem.

75

00:04:53,840  -->  00:04:59,970
It involves asking a first question and then
asking "why" for each subsequent answer.

76

00:04:59,970  -->  00:05:05,330
Once you've identified the root cause, you'll
have something to focus on.

77

00:05:05,330  -->  00:05:09,430
Take as an example a working professional
who wants to eat healthy, but has difficulty

78

00:05:09,430  -->  00:05:10,430
with it.

79

00:05:10,430  -->  00:05:14,310
With the five whys you can find out the cause
of the problem.

80

00:05:14,310  -->  00:05:16,259
The first question could be:

81

00:05:16,259  -->  00:05:19,169
Why isn't he eating healthy?

82

00:05:19,169  -->  00:05:22,060
- He orders takeaway every day.

83

00:05:22,060  -->  00:05:23,960
Why does he order takeout every day?

84

00:05:23,960  -->  00:05:26,770
- The refrigerator is empty.

85

00:05:26,770  -->  00:05:28,969
Why is the fridge empty?

86

00:05:28,969  -->  00:05:31,880
- He hasn't been grocery shopping for a while.

87

00:05:31,880  -->  00:05:34,319
Why hasn’t he been grocery shopping?

88

00:05:34,319  -->  00:05:37,470
- He does not have time to go to the supermarket.

89

00:05:37,470  -->  00:05:40,659
Why doesn't he have time?

90

00:05:40,659  -->  00:05:44,330
- He works long hours and is exhausted.

91

00:05:44,330  -->  00:05:49,370
The root cause why our user isn’t eating
healthy is a lack of time.

92

00:05:49,370  -->  00:05:53,699
So you now know that your solution should
focus on efficiency and convenience.

93

00:05:54,908  -->  00:06:00,470
A great format for writing a meaningful and
useful problem statement is a Point Of View.

94

00:06:00,470  -->  00:06:05,340
It defines who your user is, what their needs
are, and any surprising elements or insights

95

00:06:05,340  -->  00:06:07,270
you've gathered from your research.

96

00:06:08,106  -->  00:06:14,250
You articulate a POV by combining these three
elements: the user, their needs

97

00:06:14,250  -->  00:06:15,766
and your insights.

98

00:06:16,746  -->  00:06:18,690
An example might be easier.

99

00:06:18,690  -->  00:06:22,669
If we continue with the example of our busy
professional who likes to eat healthy.

100

00:06:22,669  -->  00:06:25,770
Then you could define the problem statement
as follows:

101

00:06:25,770  -->  00:06:31,400
“Busy working professionals need an easy,
time-efficient way to eat healthy because

102

00:06:31,400  -->  00:06:36,317
they often work long hours and don’t have
time go grocery shopping and prepare their meals"

103

00:06:37,259  -->  00:06:42,340
In the define phase, you start with "Why"
to find out how to solve a design challenge.

104

00:06:42,340  -->  00:06:46,320
By asking this several times you get to the
heart of the problem.

105

00:06:46,320  -->  00:06:50,430
You can now work backwards from that abstract
statement by asking 'how' for each statement.

106

00:06:50,430  -->  00:06:53,759
This is called the Why-How Laddering technique.

107

00:06:53,759  -->  00:06:58,530
You can now start using your problem statement
by asking a specific question 

108

00:06:58,530  -->  00:07:01,169
that starts with: "How might we?"

109

00:07:01,169  -->  00:07:05,830
These are questions that have the potential
to trigger ideation sessions such as brainstorms

110

00:07:05,830  -->  00:07:10,949
and should allow you to come up with many
possible solutions.

111

00:07:10,949  -->  00:07:14,849
Your ‘How Might We’ questions help you
move from the define phase to the next phase

112

00:07:14,849  -->  00:07:21,129
in design thinking, the ideation phase, where
you look for specific innovative solutions.

113

00:07:21,129  -->  00:07:22,569
For example:

114

00:07:22,569  -->  00:07:25,960
How might we make preparing meals easier?

115

00:07:25,960  -->  00:07:29,462
How might we best present healthy options?

116

00:07:29,462  -->  00:07:33,428
How might we make grocery shopping faster?

117

00:07:33,428  -->  00:07:37,610
At the end of the define phase you have converted
your findings from the empathy phase into

118

00:07:37,610  -->  00:07:39,733
a meaningful problem statement.

119

00:07:39,733  -->  00:07:42,970
Let me summarize what we covered in this lesson.

120

00:07:42,970  -->  00:07:47,469
In the define phase we organize and give meaning
to the data we have collected to formulate

121

00:07:47,469  -->  00:07:48,469
a problem.

122

00:07:48,469  -->  00:07:50,817
This is called synthesizing.

123

00:07:50,817  -->  00:07:55,930
A problem statement identifies the gap between
the current state and the desired state of

124

00:07:55,930  -->  00:07:58,886
a process or product.

125

00:07:58,886  -->  00:08:02,439
I showed you some tips to help you create
a meaningful problem statement.

126

00:08:02,439  -->  00:08:06,301
And the steps you need to 
follow to define one.

127

00:08:06,710  -->  00:08:10,919
The best way to get to the heart of the problem
is to look at it from multiple angles.

128

00:08:10,919  -->  00:08:16,749
By answering a few basic questions, you can
formulate a better definition of your problem.

129

00:08:16,749  -->  00:08:24,090
Like asking yourself the following four questions:
who, what, where, and why?

130

00:08:24,090  -->  00:08:28,249
Another question-based strategy is the five
whys technique that can help you get to the

131

00:08:28,249  -->  00:08:30,009
root of the problem.

132

00:08:30,009  -->  00:08:35,680
It involves asking a first question and then
asking "why" for each subsequent answer.

133

00:08:35,680  -->  00:08:40,370
Once you've identified the root cause, you'll
have something to focus on.

134

00:08:40,370  -->  00:08:45,380
A great format for writing a meaningful and
useful problem statement is a Point Of View.

135

00:08:45,380  -->  00:08:51,020
It defines who your user is, what their needs
are, and any surprising elements or insights

136

00:08:51,020  -->  00:08:53,856
you've gathered from your research.

137

00:08:53,856  -->  00:08:56,680
Finally, I showed you the why-how laddering
technique.

138

00:08:56,680  -->  00:09:01,260
To help you move from the define phase to
the ideation phase,

139

00:09:01,260  -->  00:09:05,029
With your problem statement at hand, you are
ready to move on to the ideation phase and

140

00:09:05,029  -->  00:09:07,060
