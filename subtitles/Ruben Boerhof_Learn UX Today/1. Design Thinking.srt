1

00:00:07,564  -->  00:00:09,540
Hi, welcome back.

2

00:00:09,540  -->  00:00:11,969
In this chapter, we'll cover 
the UX design process.

3

00:00:11,969  -->  00:00:17,730
This is an iterative process in which we try
to understand the user, question assumptions

4

00:00:17,730  -->  00:00:20,087
and redefine problems.

5

00:00:20,087  -->  00:00:24,080
To find alternative strategies and 
create innovative solutions.

6

00:00:24,080  -->  00:00:28,279
The framework we use for this is called 
design thinking.

7

00:00:28,279  -->  00:00:32,380
You will learn how to understand and define
the needs of your users, how to generate lots

8

00:00:32,380  -->  00:00:35,540
of ideas, and how to test those ideas by:

9

00:00:35,540  -->  00:00:37,329
Observational research.

10

00:00:37,329  -->  00:00:40,930
This helps to build empathy and define needs.

11

00:00:40,930  -->  00:00:42,129
Visual sense-making.

12

00:00:42,129  -->  00:00:45,802
To make insights tangible and visualize relationships

13

00:00:45,802  -->  00:00:46,991
Rapid prototyping.

14

00:00:46,991  -->  00:00:51,579
A fast and cost-effective way to test your
ideas.

15

00:00:51,579  -->  00:00:54,739
Some of the world's leading brands, such as
Apple and Google, have adopted the

16

00:00:54,739  -->  00:00:57,116
design thinking approach.

17

00:00:57,116  -->  00:01:01,629
Design thinking is a different way of thinking,
in which the people affected by a solution

18

00:01:01,629  -->  00:01:03,590
are central.

19

00:01:03,590  -->  00:01:08,524
This leads to a deep understanding of those
people and the problem space.

20

00:01:08,524  -->  00:01:13,240
Design thinking brings together what is desirable
from a human point of view with what is feasible

21

00:01:13,240  -->  00:01:15,220
and viable.

22

00:01:15,220  -->  00:01:19,780
Desirability means: 
What is the solution your customer really needs?

23

00:01:19,780  -->  00:01:24,659
Feasibility means: What is technically possible
within the foreseeable future?

24

00:01:24,659  -->  00:01:29,680
Viability means: What is likely to become part of
a sustainable business model?

25

00:01:29,680  -->  00:01:34,797
You can see design thinking as an innovative
way to solve problems.

26

00:01:34,797  -->  00:01:40,170
It is extremely helpful in addressing problems
that are ill-defined or unknown by re-framing

27

00:01:40,170  -->  00:01:42,999
the problem in a human-centric way.

28

00:01:42,999  -->  00:01:47,420
At the same time, it is also a practical approach
to solving problems.

29

00:01:47,420  -->  00:01:52,490
It focuses on developing many potential solutions
that are prototyped and validated to get it

30

00:01:52,490  -->  00:01:54,200
right the first time.

31

00:01:54,200  -->  00:01:57,710
It involves ongoing experimentation.

32

00:01:57,710  -->  00:02:02,416
Design thinking is therefore not just a process,
it is a toolbox.

33

00:02:02,416  -->  00:02:04,490
Design thinking is not new.

34

00:02:04,490  -->  00:02:09,200
Throughout history, many designers have applied
a human-centric design process to create

35

00:02:09,200  -->  00:02:11,737
meaningful and effective solutions.

36

00:02:11,737  -->  00:02:16,090
Despite this, design has traditionally been
an afterthought in the business world, often

37

00:02:16,090  -->  00:02:19,070
applied only to improve the aesthetics of
a product.

38

00:02:19,070  -->  00:02:23,730
However, this has led companies to develop
products that do not meet the real needs of

39

00:02:23,730  -->  00:02:26,000
their customers.

40

00:02:26,000  -->  00:02:29,320
That's why forward-thinking companies have
moved their designers from the end of the

41

00:02:29,320  -->  00:02:32,640
product development process to the beginning.

42

00:02:32,640  -->  00:02:36,920
This people-oriented design approach proved
to be a differentiator and design thinking

43

00:02:36,920  -->  00:02:39,330
was born.

44

00:02:39,330  -->  00:02:43,630
To be able to apply this approach in large
organizations, it had to be standardized.

45

00:02:43,630  -->  00:02:49,260
Herbert Simon sketched one of the first formal
models of this process in 1969 and it still

46

00:02:49,260  -->  00:02:52,886
forms the basis of all design thinking process
models used today.

47

00:02:53,533  -->  00:02:58,300
However, the specific term "design thinking"
was not coined until the 1990s by

48

00:02:58,300  -->  00:03:00,350
David Kelley and Tim Brown.

49

00:03:00,350  -->  00:03:04,940
They summarized methods and ideas that had
been around for years into one concept,

50

00:03:04,940  -->  00:03:08,086
which has brought design thinking 
to the business world.

51

00:03:09,158  -->  00:03:13,670
“Design thinking is a human-centered approach
to innovation that draws from the designer’s

52

00:03:13,670  -->  00:03:18,970
toolkit to integrate the needs of people,
the possibilities of technology, and the requirements

53

00:03:18,970  -->  00:03:20,658
for business success.”

54

00:03:21,751  -->  00:03:26,580
Today, there are many variants of the design
thinking process in use, and while they can

55

00:03:26,580  -->  00:03:30,990
have different numbers of stages, ranging
from three to seven, they are all based on

56

00:03:30,990  -->  00:03:34,130
the same principles as in Simon's 1969 model.

57

00:03:35,122  -->  00:03:39,810
For this course, we will focus on the Norman
Nielsen Group's design thinking model, founded

58

00:03:39,810  -->  00:03:43,496
by the pioneers of user experience: 
Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman.

59

00:03:44,285  -->  00:03:55,010
The model follows six phases: empathize, define,
ideate, prototype, test, and implement.

60

00:03:55,010  -->  00:03:57,300
Let's go through the steps.

61

00:03:57,300  -->  00:04:01,930
The first stage of the design thinking process
is to understand the problem you are trying

62

00:04:01,930  -->  00:04:05,260
to solve, the users, and their needs.

63

00:04:05,260  -->  00:04:09,950
This means consulting experts to better understand
the problem space and talking with users to

64

00:04:09,950  -->  00:04:12,380
understand the human needs involved.

65

00:04:13,068  -->  00:04:17,410
Your first step is therefore always research
to develop knowledge about what your users

66

00:04:17,410  -->  00:04:21,275
do, say, think and feel.

67

00:04:21,275  -->  00:04:24,970
Empathy is crucial for a 
human-centered design process.

68

00:04:24,970  -->  00:04:29,350
As well as immersing yourself in the physical
environment so that you can gain a deeper

69

00:04:29,350  -->  00:04:32,906
personal understanding of the issues involved.

70

00:04:32,906  -->  00:04:37,700
Empathy enables design thinkers to set aside
their own assumptions about the world to understand

71

00:04:37,700  -->  00:04:40,000
users and their needs.

72

00:04:41,255  -->  00:04:47,100
During the define stage, you combine all this
research and observe where your users' problems are.

73

00:04:47,100  -->  00:04:52,000
You will analyze and synthesize your observations
to define the core issues you have identified

74

00:04:52,000  -->  00:04:53,605
so far.

75

00:04:53,605  -->  00:04:58,540
The next step is to define it as a problem
statement in a human-centered way.

76

00:04:58,540  -->  00:05:02,980
By looking at your users' needs, their problems,
and your insights.

77

00:05:02,980  -->  00:05:08,195
Organize all your observations and draw parallels
between your users' current experiences.

78

00:05:08,195  -->  00:05:10,120
Identify unmet user needs.

79

00:05:10,120  -->  00:05:14,020
Is there for example a common pain point across
many different users?

80

00:05:14,020  -->  00:05:19,090
This will help you and your team members gather
ideas as you progress to the third stage:

81

00:05:19,090  -->  00:05:20,580
Ideate

82

00:05:21,410  -->  00:05:25,680
You have now gained insight into your users
from the empathy phase and you have defined

83

00:05:25,680  -->  00:05:28,660
a human-centered problem statement.

84

00:05:28,660  -->  00:05:32,520
During the third phase of the design thinking
process, you are ready to generate ideas in

85

00:05:32,520  -->  00:05:34,490
ideation sessions.

86

00:05:34,490  -->  00:05:39,990
Brainstorm a range of crazy, creative ideas
that address unmet user needs.

87

00:05:39,990  -->  00:05:41,990
Give yourself and your team total freedom.

88

00:05:41,990  -->  00:05:46,930
No idea is too far-fetched and quantity takes
precedence over quality.

89

00:05:46,930  -->  00:05:48,200
Sketch out many different ideas.

90

00:05:48,200  -->  00:05:53,440
Then share these with each other so that you
build on each other's ideas.

91

00:05:53,440  -->  00:05:58,200
In the prototype phase, you will create representations
for a subset of your ideas.

92

00:05:58,200  -->  00:06:04,120
The goal is to understand which parts of your
ideas work and which don't, with some inexpensive,

93

00:06:04,120  -->  00:06:06,180
scaled-down versions.

94

00:06:06,180  -->  00:06:10,530
This gives you insight into the impact and
feasibility of your ideas.

95

00:06:10,530  -->  00:06:14,580
They can be shared and tested within the team
itself or on a small group of people outside

96

00:06:14,580  -->  00:06:16,407
the design team.

97

00:06:16,407  -->  00:06:20,400
This is an experimental phase and the aim
is to find the best possible solution to each

98

00:06:20,400  -->  00:06:24,610
of the problems identified during the first
three phases.

99

00:06:24,610  -->  00:06:25,610
So make your ideas tangible.

100

00:06:25,610  -->  00:06:29,830
If it's a new landing page, draw a wireframe
and get feedback internally.

101

00:06:29,830  -->  00:06:34,150
Change it based on feedback, quickly prototype
it again and share it with another group of people.

102

00:06:34,970  -->  00:06:39,340
In the test phase, you return to your user
for feedback on your prototype.

103

00:06:39,340  -->  00:06:44,510
Ask yourself, "Does this solution meet the
needs of users?" and 'Has it improved how

104

00:06:44,510  -->  00:06:48,700
they feel, think, or perform their tasks?'

105

00:06:48,700  -->  00:06:53,060
Because design thinking is an iterative process,
the results generated during the testing phase

106

00:06:53,060  -->  00:06:56,190
are often used to redefine a solution.

107

00:06:56,190  -->  00:06:59,990
At the end of this phase, the UX team will
have a better idea of how real users would

108

00:06:59,990  -->  00:07:03,300
behave, think and feel 
when they use your product.

109

00:07:03,988  -->  00:07:08,400
This is the most important part of design
thinking, but it is often forgotten.

110

00:07:08,400  -->  00:07:13,400
However impactful design thinking can be for
an organization, it only leads to real innovation

111

00:07:13,400  -->  00:07:16,360
if the vision is actually implemented.

112

00:07:16,360  -->  00:07:18,660
This sixth step is therefore crucial.

113

00:07:18,660  -->  00:07:21,200
At this stage, it is time to put the vision
into effect.

114

00:07:21,200  -->  00:07:25,727
To make sure your solution sees the light
of day and touches the lives of your end-users.

115

00:07:26,415  -->  00:07:31,400
It is important to note that these six phases
are not always consecutive.

116

00:07:31,400  -->  00:07:35,470
Design thinking is an iterative and 
non-linear process.

117

00:07:35,470  -->  00:07:39,460
The framework is there to simplify things,
but it’s the mindset and principles behind it

118

00:07:39,460  -->  00:07:41,267
that really matter.

119

00:07:41,788  -->  00:07:44,130
It should be treated more like a guide than
a manual.

120

00:07:44,130  -->  00:07:49,340
They do not have to follow a specific order,
but can even occur in parallel and be repeated

121

00:07:49,340  -->  00:07:51,449
several times.

122

00:07:51,449  -->  00:07:55,110
New insights often make you jump back and
forth between phases.

123

00:07:55,110  -->  00:07:56,110
For example:

124

00:07:56,110  -->  00:07:59,110
After testing with your users, you can get
new ideas.

125

00:07:59,110  -->  00:08:04,820
Or you have to go back and redefine the problem
or do new user research.

126

00:08:04,820  -->  00:08:06,919
What else do you need to know about the user?

127

00:08:06,919  -->  00:08:11,660
What new use cases have emerged from the prototype
that you haven't explored before?

128

00:08:11,660  -->  00:08:16,480
A UX team continuously uses the results to
improve their initial assumptions.

129

00:08:16,480  -->  00:08:20,930
It provides new insights so you can see alternative
solutions that may not have been available

130

00:08:20,930  -->  00:08:24,639
with your previous level of understanding.

131

00:08:24,639  -->  00:08:27,900
Let's zoom out for a bit for a better understanding.

132

00:08:27,900  -->  00:08:36,810
You can place the 6 phases: empathize, define,
ideate, prototype, test and implement

133

00:08:36,810  -->  00:08:41,863
in a general flow of understanding, 
exploration, and materialization.

134

00:08:43,037  -->  00:08:47,510
To simplify the process, we have represented
it as a linear process.

135

00:08:47,510  -->  00:08:49,796
But in reality it is not.

136

00:08:49,796  -->  00:08:55,260
This illustration shows you that it is a perpetual
loop in which you continually gain new insights

137

00:08:55,260  -->  00:08:57,958
and improve the user experience.

138

00:08:57,958  -->  00:09:01,190
And that is where the real power of design
thinking lies.

139

00:09:01,190  -->  00:09:08,636
Each stage is intended to be iterative and
cyclical, as opposed to a strictly linear process.

140

00:09:08,636  -->  00:09:12,060
So don't think of it as a step-by-step recipe
for success.

141

00:09:12,060  -->  00:09:16,310
Instead, use it as a toolbox to support you
when and where you need it.

142

00:09:16,310  -->  00:09:20,990
Be a master chef, not a line cook: take the
recipe as a framework, adjust as needed, and

143

00:09:20,990  -->  00:09:22,746
adapt it to fit your needs.

144

00:09:23,575  -->  00:09:27,560
Design thinking, as you have noticed, 
is a powerful framework.

145

00:09:27,560  -->  00:09:30,878
Let's summarize the benefits and why you should
use design thinking:

146

00:09:32,396  -->  00:09:38,487
Design thinking puts people first and tests
assumptions and ideas with real users.

147

00:09:38,487  -->  00:09:42,820
It immediately makes insights visual

148

00:09:42,820  -->  00:09:47,340
It targets the right problem before going
into implementation mode.

149

00:09:47,340  -->  00:09:52,650
It stimulates innovation by exploring multiple
avenues for the same problem.

150

00:09:52,650  -->  00:09:57,966
It uses collective expertise and unleashes
creative energy in the team

151

00:09:57,966  -->  00:10:03,800
Design thinking is often referred to as "outside
the box thinking" because it offers new ways

152

00:10:03,800  -->  00:10:07,820
of thinking over the more general 
problem-solving methods.

153

00:10:07,820  -->  00:10:12,440
It combines a user-oriented perspective with
rational and analytical research with the

154

00:10:12,440  -->  00:10:15,934
aim of creating innovative solutions.

155

00:10:15,934  -->  00:10:21,230
Design thinking may look intimidating, but
it's not necessarily a lengthy process.

156

00:10:21,230  -->  00:10:25,170
As design thinking requires a user-centered
approach, the amount of discovery you need

157

00:10:25,170  -->  00:10:30,000
to do depends on how much or how little you
know about the problem and user at hand.

158

00:10:30,927  -->  00:10:35,630
It's good to know that, despite the name,
design thinking is not exclusive to designers.

159

00:10:35,630  -->  00:10:40,950
It is a design methodology that provides a
solution-focused approach to problem-solving

160

00:10:40,950  -->  00:10:45,110
that can be used by anyone and belongs at
every level of business.

161

00:10:45,110  -->  00:10:48,270
Let’s recap what we’ve 
discussed this lesson.

162

00:10:49,525  -->  00:10:54,050
Design thinking is a different way of thinking,
in which the people involved in a solution

163

00:10:54,050  -->  00:10:55,676
are central.

164

00:10:55,676  -->  00:11:00,525
This leads to a deep understanding of those
people and the problem space.

165

00:11:00,525  -->  00:11:05,660
Design thinking brings together what is desirable
from a human point of view, with what is feasible

166

00:11:05,660  -->  00:11:07,170
and viable.

167

00:11:07,170  -->  00:11:08,690
In other words:

168

00:11:08,690  -->  00:11:12,160
What is the solution your customer really
needs?

169

00:11:12,160  -->  00:11:15,647
What is technically possible 
within the foreseeable future?

170

00:11:15,647  -->  00:11:19,589
What is likely to become part of a sustainable
business model?

171

00:11:20,095  -->  00:11:29,290
The model follows six phases: empathize, define,
ideate, prototype, test and implement.

172

00:11:30,000  -->  00:11:34,600
It is important to note that these six phases
are not always consecutive.

173

00:11:34,600  -->  00:11:38,120
Design thinking is an iterative 
and non-linear process.

174

00:11:38,120  -->  00:11:42,440
They do not have to follow a specific order,
but can even occur in parallel and be repeated

175

00:11:42,440  -->  00:11:44,276
several times.

176

00:11:44,276  -->  00:11:48,260
So don't see it as a step-by-step recipe for
success.

177

00:11:48,260  -->  00:11:50,883
Adjust it if necessary and adapt it to your
needs.

178

00:11:51,490  -->  00:11:54,649
Join me in the next lesson where I will discuss
the first step of this process.

179

00:11:54,649  -->  00:11:58,231
You learn to understand the problem
you are trying to solve, the users

180

00:11:58,231  -->  00:11:59,477
and their needs.
