1

00:00:07,340  -->  00:00:11,580
The umbrella term user experience encompasses
many different broad activities.

2

00:00:11,580  -->  00:00:17,583
In this section, we'll highlight these components
to help you better understand what makes up UX

3

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:20,790
In chapter 3, we take a better look at each
of these areas.

4

00:00:20,790  -->  00:00:25,000
UX can be divided into 8 main disciplines:

5

00:00:25,000  -->  00:00:27,000
User Research

6

00:00:27,000  -->  00:00:29,699
Content strategy

7

00:00:29,699  -->  00:00:31,720
Information architecture

8

00:00:31,720  -->  00:00:33,465
Visual design

9

00:00:33,465  -->  00:00:35,448
Cognitive psychology

10

00:00:35,448  -->  00:00:37,448
Interaction design

11

00:00:37,448  -->  00:00:39,649
Usability evaluation

12

00:00:39,649  -->  00:00:41,479
Accessibility evaluation

13

00:00:42,275  -->  00:00:46,101
Let’s start with user research.

14

00:00:46,101  -->  00:00:50,973
User research is the most important first
step a UX designer takes.

15

00:00:50,973  -->  00:00:55,170
It is a crucial part of the human-centric
design process.

16

00:00:55,170  -->  00:00:59,360
Much of what a UX professional does during
their work day depends on the desired mix

17

00:00:59,360  -->  00:01:02,899
of UX design and UX research.

18

00:01:02,899  -->  00:01:07,520
Some companies have specific design and research
functions, although many functions are often

19

00:01:07,520  -->  00:01:10,280
a combination of both.

20

00:01:10,280  -->  00:01:15,330
UX research is the process of gaining valuable
insights and understanding of users' behaviors,

21

00:01:15,330  -->  00:01:22,310
needs, and pain points using various observation
techniques and feedback methodologies.

22

00:01:22,310  -->  00:01:26,584
The goal is to provide context and perspectives
to make informed decisions 

23

00:01:26,584  -->  00:01:29,401
and build user-centric products.

24

00:01:29,401  -->  00:01:33,750
Research should take place at every stage
of the design process, from early interviews

25

00:01:33,750  -->  00:01:38,828
and field studies to prototype testing and
post-launch monitoring.

26

00:01:38,828  -->  00:01:43,464
As such, UX research involves continuous questioning
and evidence gathering.

27

00:01:43,464  -->  00:01:48,068
A process whereby findings and insights from
the study of people are used to create 

28

00:01:48,068  -->  00:01:51,127
intuitive human-centered experiences.

29

00:01:51,849  -->  00:01:55,224
There are four key benefits of integrating
UX research throughout 

30

00:01:55,224  -->  00:01:57,263
the product and development process.

31

00:01:57,263  -->  00:02:02,150
One of the main benefits of incorporating
UX research into the design and product development

32

00:02:02,150  -->  00:02:07,429
process is that it helps you understand user
behavior and thereby make better and more

33

00:02:07,429  -->  00:02:09,647
informed decisions.

34

00:02:09,647  -->  00:02:14,026
Second, it removes bias from the
user experience design process. 

35

00:02:14,026  -->  00:02:19,230
Confirmation bias is the tendency to give
attention and value to information that confirms

36

00:02:19,230  -->  00:02:22,434
one's ideas, beliefs, or hypotheses.

37

00:02:22,625  -->  00:02:27,530
In general, people tend to seek, and remember
information in a way that supports their personal

38

00:02:27,530  -->  00:02:33,260
ideas, while paying less attention to information
that contradicts those ideas.

39

00:02:33,260  -->  00:02:36,239
Doing thorough user research prevents this.

40

00:02:36,239  -->  00:02:41,730
Third, user research allows you to test and
validate concepts early on, without waiting

41

00:02:41,730  -->  00:02:44,599
for launch day to collect feedback.

42

00:02:44,599  -->  00:02:49,290
When it comes to testing and validating design
ideas, usability testing with users early

43

00:02:49,290  -->  00:02:53,631
in the process allows you to test everything
from a low-fidelity mock-up 

44

00:02:53,631  -->  00:02:56,563
to high-fidelity prototypes.

45

00:02:56,563  -->  00:03:01,489
Finally, a key benefit of UX research is that
you work with solutions that deliver real

46

00:03:01,489  -->  00:03:04,774
value to customers and are intuitive to use.

47

00:03:04,774  -->  00:03:08,340
This allows you to successfully 
market your products.

48

00:03:08,340  -->  00:03:12,829
UX research plays a vital role in helping
product marketing managers understand customer

49

00:03:12,829  -->  00:03:17,420
needs and effectively communicate product
value to the market.

50

00:03:22,480  -->  00:03:25,122
The next discipline is about content strategy.

51

00:03:25,122  -->  00:03:30,079
A content strategy is a plan for creating,
delivering, and managing content.

52

00:03:30,079  -->  00:03:34,404
High-quality content is a core component of
successful design.

53

00:03:34,404  -->  00:03:40,260
UX writers and designers need to review and
create clear content that people find useful.

54

00:03:40,260  -->  00:03:45,801
The content for the experience is an important
part of defining the user's overall experience.

55

00:03:45,801  -->  00:03:52,520
Content strategy determines how, why, where
and when content goes into an experience.

56

00:03:52,520  -->  00:03:58,420
It can refer to any type of information that
has been captured, such as text, video, images,

57

00:03:58,420  -->  00:04:01,420
or other pieces of information.

58

00:04:01,420  -->  00:04:06,000
All content within an experience must have
a purpose and make sense to help a user complete

59

00:04:06,000  -->  00:04:07,431
a task.

60

00:04:11,101  -->  00:04:15,797
With content strategy comes information architecture,
or IA for short.

61

00:04:15,797  -->  00:04:21,561
Content should be organized in such a way
that it is understandable, findable, and meaningful.

62

00:04:21,561  -->  00:04:27,040
Information architecture is the practice of
organizing information and content in a meaningful

63

00:04:27,040  -->  00:04:28,130
and accessible way.

64

00:04:28,130  -->  00:04:32,840
It helps users understand their location within
a design, what to expect, and to navigate

65

00:04:32,840  -->  00:04:34,499
through a product.

66

00:04:34,499  -->  00:04:39,389
It informs many parts of UX design including
the content, interface, and interactions,

67

00:04:39,389  -->  00:04:43,670
making it one of the most fundamental components
of good UX design.

68

00:04:44,669  -->  00:04:49,639
To determine the IA of a particular product,
information architects consider the relationship

69

00:04:49,639  -->  00:04:52,300
between different sets of content.

70

00:04:52,300  -->  00:04:56,660
They also pay close attention to the copy
used, making sure it is consistent.

71

00:04:56,660  -->  00:05:01,134
And the visual priority of page elements,
where things are on the screen.

72

00:05:02,268  -->  00:05:07,548
Information architecture is usually brought
to life through a wireframe during the design process.

73

00:05:07,910  -->  00:05:11,120
A blueprint of a web page or an app.

74

00:05:11,120  -->  00:05:15,580
Often these also include technological and
functional requirements, which help determine

75

00:05:15,580  -->  00:05:19,329
how the experience will change when a user
interacts with them.

76

00:05:24,367  -->  00:05:28,983
UX designers also need to think about how
the product they design behaves.

77

00:05:28,983  -->  00:05:33,979
This is what Interaction design focuses on. 
It looks at how the user interacts with a system.

78

00:05:33,979  -->  00:05:38,800
It takes into account all interactive elements
such as buttons, transitions, animations,

79

00:05:38,800  -->  00:05:39,913
and so on.

80

00:05:40,360  -->  00:05:44,021
The field of interaction design is growing
as the type of interaction 

81

00:05:44,021  -->  00:05:45,978
with digital products increases.

82

00:05:46,211  -->  00:05:51,169
For example, most smartphones enable touchscreen
interactions, which has opened up new models

83

00:05:51,169  -->  00:05:55,307
of interaction design, including touch, swipe,
and pinch, that didn't exist 

84

00:05:55,307  -->  00:05:57,314
with the computer before.

85

00:05:58,377  -->  00:06:03,830
Interaction design helps define the journey
a user goes through to accomplish a task.

86

00:06:03,830  -->  00:06:08,449
What types of interaction should the website
or app contain so that all of the user's needs

87

00:06:08,449  -->  00:06:10,389
are met?

88

00:06:10,389  -->  00:06:14,580
Interaction designers strive for intuitive
designs that allow the user to perform core

89

00:06:14,580  -->  00:06:16,909
tasks and actions effortlessly.

90

00:06:22,458  -->  00:06:25,737
Visual design is obviously an important discipline.

91

00:06:25,737  -->  00:06:30,960
Anybody who pays a professional to 
create an interface wants it to look good.

92

00:06:30,960  -->  00:06:36,910
But a beautiful website with difficult or 
unintuitive navigation won't impress anyone.

93

00:06:37,250  -->  00:06:42,949
The visual aspects of each user's experience
are the most visible components of the solution.

94

00:06:42,949  -->  00:06:47,730
Visual design not only helps to ensure that
a solution is aesthetically pleasing

95

00:06:47,730  -->  00:06:51,599
but it also ensures that the solution 
follows brand consistency.

96

00:06:51,599  -->  00:06:56,387
In addition, visual design helps a user process
all the content on any screen

97

00:06:56,387  -->  00:06:59,199
adding greatly to the usability of an experience.

98

00:07:00,219  -->  00:07:04,449
It is important that as a UX designer you
are not guided by your personal preference

99

00:07:04,449  -->  00:07:06,159
or taste.

100

00:07:06,159  -->  00:07:10,321
As a UX designer, your definition of "design"
will be much less artistic 

101

00:07:10,321  -->  00:07:12,490
than that of many designers.

102

00:07:12,490  -->  00:07:17,100
It doesn't matter if you 'like' it, but do
your users think it looks good?

103

00:07:17,100  -->  00:07:19,154
Do they trust it right away?

104

00:07:19,154  -->  00:07:23,319
In UX it's about how the design works, and
it's something you can prove.

105

00:07:23,319  -->  00:07:25,000
It's not a matter of style.

106

00:07:30,000  -->  00:07:33,349
To design for people, 
you also need to understand people.

107

00:07:33,349  -->  00:07:38,780
The way people acquire, process, and store
information in their brain is what

108

00:07:38,780  -->  00:07:40,534
cognitive psychology focuses on.

109

00:07:41,752  -->  00:07:46,979
When designing products, we spend a lot of
time on different research methods to understand

110

00:07:46,979  -->  00:07:50,220
the behavior, habits, and needs of our users.

111

00:07:50,220  -->  00:07:53,830
But there are some general patterns that we
see in most people.

112

00:07:53,830  -->  00:08:00,530
This branch of psychology examines a wide
variety of mental processes, including perception,

113

00:08:00,530  -->  00:08:08,060
thinking, memory, attention, language, problem-solving,
and learning.

114

00:08:08,060  -->  00:08:13,099
As with the other disciplines, this is a very
broad subject and a field in its own right.

115

00:08:13,099  -->  00:08:17,780
In the lesson on cognitive psychology in chapter 3, 
I take you through some principles and

116

00:08:17,780  -->  00:08:21,768
examples that are good to know when working
on user experiences.

117

00:08:25,807  -->  00:08:31,500
Usability is one of the most important components
that make for an enjoyable user experience.

118

00:08:31,500  -->  00:08:36,175
Usability evaluation is about measuring the
quality of this user experience.

119

00:08:36,261  -->  00:08:40,000
It rates how easy user interfaces are to use.

120

00:08:40,000  -->  00:08:45,060
Usability is an area of ​​research and
testing that primarily ensures that any digital

121

00:08:45,060  -->  00:08:49,161
solution works, and is easy to use and intuitive.

122

00:08:49,161  -->  00:08:54,109
Usability refers to how well the experience
performs against users' interactions with it.

123

00:08:55,641  -->  00:09:00,910
For example, you test whether the experience
is clear and intuitive for users, or whether

124

00:09:00,910  -->  00:09:05,590
active concentration is required to fulfill
basic functions or needs.

125

00:09:05,590  -->  00:09:10,270
You check whether the website or app is constructed
in such a way that it is understandable for

126

00:09:10,270  -->  00:09:11,420
a user.

127

00:09:11,420  -->  00:09:16,200
Are there navigation paths that don't lead
to a user's task completion, dead links, buttons

128

00:09:16,200  -->  00:09:21,640
that don't work, or links that take users
to features they didn't expect?

129

00:09:21,640  -->  00:09:23,010
What about cognitive overload?

130

00:09:23,010  -->  00:09:27,570
Are you asking the user to process too much
information or fill in too many functions

131

00:09:27,570  -->  00:09:29,090
or fields?

132

00:09:29,090  -->  00:09:33,440
Or have you designed a user flow that might
be too complex to understand?

133

00:09:33,440  -->  00:09:39,130
The most important measures of usability are
clarity, consistency, and ease of use.

134

00:09:39,130  -->  00:09:43,650
So if you build an experience that's clear,
concise, and easy to use, there's a good chance

135

00:09:43,650  -->  00:09:47,566
your solution will be effective and 
keep your users happy.

136

00:09:52,137  -->  00:09:57,226
And last, but certainly not least, is the
accessibility evaluation.

137

00:09:57,226  -->  00:10:01,967
Measuring the quality of a product to be accessed
irrespective of personal abilities

138

00:10:01,967  -->  00:10:03,881
or device properties.

139

00:10:04,051  -->  00:10:09,584
A UX designer ensures that all users can access
and interact with a service or system,

140

00:10:09,584  -->  00:10:12,907
regardless of their personal capabilities.

141

00:10:12,907  -->  00:10:17,840
Accessibility testing is the practice of making
your web and mobile apps usable by as many

142

00:10:17,840  -->  00:10:19,770
people as possible.

143

00:10:19,770  -->  00:10:25,560
It makes them accessible to people with disabilities,
such as the visually impaired, hearing impaired,

144

00:10:25,560  -->  00:10:28,576
and other physical or cognitive impairments.

145

00:10:29,894  -->  00:10:35,520
Accessibility evaluation is not a simple test
if the interface passes or fails.

146

00:10:35,520  -->  00:10:41,040
Instead, it's a holistic assessment of the
content, design, and code against a range

147

00:10:41,040  -->  00:10:45,300
of the most common impairments, aiming to
highlight the areas users are most likely

148

00:10:45,300  -->  00:10:47,424
to find challenging.

149

00:10:47,424  -->  00:10:49,420
Disability is complicated.

150

00:10:49,420  -->  00:10:53,910
That's why in chapter 3 we take a closer look
at accessibility and designing for a wide

151

00:10:53,910  -->  00:10:56,220
range of people.

152

00:10:56,220  -->  00:10:59,980
As you have seen, UX is a very versatile field.

153

00:10:59,980  -->  00:11:04,687
While these are the core disciplines of UX,
they are by no means the only ones.

154

00:11:04,687  -->  00:11:08,999
Depending on the industry you work in, you
can add things like service design

155

00:11:08,999  -->  00:11:14,500
or behavioral design, product design, psychology,
and so on.

156

00:11:14,500  -->  00:11:17,510
With the UX disciplines, we are almost at
the end of this chapter.

157

00:11:17,510  -->  00:11:21,990
But before we get into the next one, let's
recap what you learned and the most important

158

00:11:21,990  -->  00:11:24,161
things to remember.

159

00:11:24,161  -->  00:11:29,160
UX research is the process of gaining valuable
insights and understanding of users' behaviors,

160

00:11:29,160  -->  00:11:31,390
needs, and pain points.

161

00:11:31,390  -->  00:11:34,140
It should take place at every stage of the
design process.

162

00:11:34,140  -->  00:11:38,706
To make informed decisions and build user-centric
products.

163

00:11:38,706  -->  00:11:46,320
Content strategy determines how, why, where
and when content goes into an experience.

164

00:11:46,320  -->  00:11:50,770
All content within an experience must have
a purpose and make sense to help a user complete

165

00:11:50,770  -->  00:11:52,925
a task.

166

00:11:52,925  -->  00:11:57,660
Information architecture is the practice of
organizing information and content in a meaningful

167

00:11:57,660  -->  00:11:59,830
and accessible way.

168

00:11:59,830  -->  00:12:04,420
It helps users understand their location within
a design, what to expect, and to navigate

169

00:12:04,420  -->  00:12:06,937
through a product.

170

00:12:06,937  -->  00:12:11,680
Interaction design looks at how the user interacts
with a system.

171

00:12:11,680  -->  00:12:16,580
Taking into account all interactive elements
such as buttons, page transitions, animations

172

00:12:16,580  -->  00:12:19,010
and so on.

173

00:12:19,010  -->  00:12:23,424
Visual design not only helps to ensure that
a solution is aesthetically pleasing, but

174

00:12:23,424  -->  00:12:28,840
it should help a user process all the content
on any screen, adding greatly to the usability

175

00:12:28,840  -->  00:12:31,208
of an experience.

176

00:12:31,208  -->  00:12:36,520
To design for people, you also need to understand
people.The way people acquire, process, and

177

00:12:36,520  -->  00:12:41,807
store information in their brains is what
cognitive psychology focuses on.

178

00:12:42,466  -->  00:12:47,750
Usability evaluation is about measuring the
quality of the user experience when interacting

179

00:12:47,750  -->  00:12:49,820
with a product or system.

180

00:12:49,820  -->  00:12:53,760
It rates how easy user interfaces are to use.

181

00:12:53,760  -->  00:12:57,895
And last, but certainly not least, is the
accessibility evaluation.

182

00:12:57,895  -->  00:13:03,310
A UX designer ensures that all users can access
and interact with a service or system, regardless

183

00:13:03,310  -->  00:13:06,270
of their personal capabilities.

184

00:13:06,270  -->  00:13:08,650
You now have a better understanding of the
basics of user experience.

185

00:13:08,650  -->  00:13:13,980
Join me in the next chapter where I will walk
you through the UX design process.
