00:00:05.973  -->  00:00:10.960
Research is a critical part
of the human-centric design process.

2

00:00:10.960  -->  00:00:14.290
UX researchers study end users to collect
and analyze data.

3

00:00:14.290  -->  00:00:19.660
This provides valuable insights and understanding
of the user's behavior, needs and pain points.

4

00:00:19.660  -->  00:00:26.789
Without it, it is impossible to create solutions
that deliver value and meet their expectations.

5

00:00:26.789  -->  00:00:31.465
That's the first benefit of integrating UX
research into the design process.

6

00:00:31.465  -->  00:00:35.035
UX research is vital to deliver solutions
that deliver real value to customers 

7

00:00:35.035  -->  00:00:38.439
and are intuitive to use.

8

00:00:38.439  -->  00:00:42.510
The second benefit is: Make informed decisions based on data.

9

00:00:42.510  -->  00:00:45.319
Not opinions, and not assumptions.

10

00:00:45.319  -->  00:00:48.069
User research is not a way to confirm your
beliefs.

11

00:00:48.069  -->  00:00:50.449
It's a way to discover them.

12

00:00:50.449  -->  00:00:54.489
UX research helps you understand user behavior
and make better, more informed decisions.

13

00:00:55.689  -->  00:00:59.460
The third benefit is: Successfully take products to market.

14

00:00:59.489  -->  00:01:03.350
The better you understand your customers,
the better you can create products that meet

15

00:01:03.350  -->  00:01:07.268
their expectations and tailor your strategy
to their specific needs.

16

00:01:08.269  -->  00:01:12.560
The fourth benefit is: Test and validate concepts early.

17

00:01:12.560  -->  00:01:14.441
UX research allows you to test your ideas
early 

18

00:01:14.441  -->  00:01:17.460
without waiting for launch day to collect feedback.

19

00:01:17.460  -->  00:01:21.570
It is part of an iterative design process,
as discussed in Chapter 2.

20

00:01:21.570  -->  00:01:26.969
By listening, learning and making continuous
improvements by understanding user needs.

21

00:01:26.969  -->  00:01:32.619
As such, user research should happen any each
stage of the design process.

22

00:01:32.619  -->  00:01:36.870
The earlier the research, the more impact
the findings will have on your final product.

23

00:01:36.870  -->  00:01:40.689
There are different types of user research
for different purposes.

24

00:01:40.689  -->  00:01:43.337
To select suitable types of research methods,

25

00:01:43.337  -->  00:01:45.906
you need to understand what you are trying to achieve.

26

00:01:47.189  -->  00:01:53.899
We can distinguish two types of research:
generative research and evaluative research.

27

00:01:53.899  -->  00:01:58.290
Generative research helps us understand our
users in depth and learn their needs, wants

28

00:01:58.290  -->  00:02:04.179
and challenges. It looks at: "What problem might we solve?"

29

00:02:04.179  -->  00:02:08.820
Evaluative research helps us to test whether
the solutions we've come up with address those

30

00:02:08.820  -->  00:02:13.770
needs, wants, and challenges. How well is
our solution working?

31

00:02:13.770  -->  00:02:18.280
Using both generative and evaluative UX research
during the design process ensures that the

32

00:02:18.280  -->  00:02:22.810
product you're building addresses real needs
and resolves existing pain points.

33

00:02:22.810  -->  00:02:26.480
Generative research is an effective way to
discover new insights.

34

00:02:26.480  -->  00:02:31.890
It‘s also known as exploratory or discovery
research because it usually takes place before

35

00:02:31.890  -->  00:02:35.500
the start of the design process when little
or nothing is known.

36

00:02:35.500  -->  00:02:40.940
You can use it to discover new information
about your users and put forward new ideas.

37

00:02:40.940  -->  00:02:45.820
Generative research methods such as user interviews
are used to gain a deep understanding of people's

38

00:02:45.820  -->  00:02:49.390
motivations, pain points, and behaviors.

39

00:02:49.390  -->  00:02:53.250
This allows you to clearly define the problem
you want to solve for your customers and not

40

00:02:53.250  -->  00:02:57.250
run the risk of building a product that no
one needs or will use.

41

00:02:57.250  -->  00:03:02.480
It is important to have an open mind when
conducting generative research and not to

42

00:03:02.480  -->  00:03:06.980
fixate on what has already been built or on
existing solutions.

43

00:03:06.980  -->  00:03:11.310
This way you can focus your efforts on designing
solutions that solve relevant problems and

44

00:03:11.310  -->  00:03:15.090
add real value to your users.

45

00:03:15.090  -->  00:03:17.730
On the other hand, we have evaluative research.

46

00:03:17.730  -->  00:03:23.240
You use this to assess how well something
is working and to identify areas for improvement.

47

00:03:23.240  -->  00:03:28.480
This type of research can begin once you understand
your user's needs.

48

00:03:28.480  -->  00:03:31.345
There are two types of evaluative research
that you can use: 

49

00:03:31.345  -->  00:03:34.190
formative and summative research.

50

00:03:34.190  -->  00:03:39.760
In the early stages of the design process,
formative research is done to iteratively

51

00:03:39.760  -->  00:03:42.530
test existing or new solutions.

52

00:03:42.530  -->  00:03:46.280
You can test and identify problems in the
solutions as you create them, and improve

53

00:03:46.280  -->  00:03:48.629
them based on user feedback.

54

00:03:48.629  -->  00:03:52.032
For example, a well-known evaluative research
method that we discussed earlier 

55

00:03:52.032  -->  00:03:54.290
is a usability test.

56

00:03:54.290  -->  00:03:59.160
A summative evaluation helps you understand
how a design is performing in general.

57

00:03:59.160  -->  00:04:02.342
It is usually done at the end of the design
process to test usability 

58

00:04:02.342  -->  00:04:04.970
or detect overlooked issues.

59

00:04:04.970  -->  00:04:06.140
For example with a survey.

60

00:04:06.140  -->  00:04:09.260
And it doesn't stop with the launch of a new
product.

61

00:04:09.260  -->  00:04:13.410
For the best user experience, solutions should
be monitored and improved upon

62

00:04:13.410  -->  00:04:16.959
based on customer feedback.

63

00:04:16.959  -->  00:04:20.360
Generative and evaluative research are both
valuable decision-making tools 

64

00:04:20.360  -->  00:04:22.620
in the researcher's arsenal.

65

00:04:22.620  -->  00:04:25.760
They should be used in the same way during
the product development process as they both

66

00:04:25.760  -->  00:04:27.260
help you get the evidence you need.

67

00:04:27.260  -->  00:04:31.491
It depends on the knowledge you need and want
to gain, and the resources available to you.

68

00:04:38.222  -->  00:04:42.000
Before you start, it's good practice to map out the entire research project.

69

00:04:42.290  -->  00:04:47.850
A user research plan acts as an overview and
helps to get the project started.

70

00:04:47.850  -->  00:04:50.950
It should be co-created with your
stakeholders.

71

00:04:50.950  -->  00:04:55.700
This ensures that everyone is aligned with
regard to objectives, timelines and expectations.

72

00:04:55.700  -->  00:05:01.335
It is also less likely that conflicts about
user needs 

73

00:05:01.335  -->  00:05:04.110
and design decisions will arise in the future.

74

00:05:04.110  -->  00:05:06.260
So, what's in the plan?

75

00:05:06.260  -->  00:05:09.160
First you need to determine what the problem
is that you want to solve.

76

00:05:09.160  -->  00:05:13.950
A problem statement explains what the project
is about and provides background information.

77

00:05:15.015  -->  00:05:18.250
Once you've identified the
problem statement, think about the research goals

78

00:05:18.250  -->  00:05:24.057
What you're doing, why you're doing
it, and what you expect from the UX research process.

79

00:05:24.250  -->  00:05:26.994
Setting clear goals will help you define the
scope of the project 

80

00:05:26.994  -->  00:05:29.730
and the questions you need to answer.

81

00:05:30.664  -->  00:05:34.710
After you have defined your problem statement,
make an inventory of what is already present

82

00:05:34.710  -->  00:05:38.310
in your team, company in the market and in
other literature.

83

00:05:38.310  -->  00:05:43.360
What research has already been done on the
intended users or in the relevant industry?

84

00:05:43.360  -->  00:05:44.820
What do we already know?

85

00:05:44.820  -->  00:05:49.716
What still needs to be discovered? 
These are the question you want to answer.

86

00:05:49.716  -->  00:05:54.139
Now you have enough information to plan the
investigation for what you don't know.

87

00:05:54.139  -->  00:05:56.556
Choosing the right research methods 
will depend on your goals, 

88

00:05:56.556  -->  00:06:01.330
the design stage you are in, 
resources and timeline.

89

00:06:01.330  -->  00:06:05.200
For example, if you are at the beginning of
the design process, a generative research method

90

00:06:05.200  -->  00:06:10.080
such as user interviews or field research
can help you generate new insights 

91

00:06:10.080  -->  00:06:11.320
about the target group.

92

00:06:11.320  -->  00:06:16.240
Or, if you need to evaluate how a design
is performing with users before handover,

93

00:06:16.240  -->  00:06:21.530
you can run usability tests to gain actionable
design insights.

94

00:06:21.530  -->  00:06:24.618
Establishing the research project timeline
is an essential step 

95

00:06:24.618  -->  00:06:27.230
in creating a UX research plan.

96

00:06:27.230  -->  00:06:31.400
Estimate how long the research project will
take and when the findings can be expected.

97

00:06:31.400  -->  00:06:36.430
This helps to manage stakeholder expectations
of the process and results.

98

00:06:36.430  -->  00:06:41.120
The next part of a research plan is to create
a guide for your research sessions.

99

00:06:41.120  -->  00:06:46.260
You will use this during user interviews,
field research or in-person sessions.

100

00:06:46.260  -->  00:06:51.820
The guide is there to remind you what questions
to ask and to keep the sessions on track.

101

00:06:51.820  -->  00:06:54.514
Any research plan should include information
about the participants 

102

00:06:54.514  -->  00:06:56.910
you need in the research studies.

103

00:06:56.910  -->  00:07:00.370
When selecting participants, make sure they
represent all your target personas.

104

00:07:00.370  -->  00:07:05.540
If you test on people who are not like your
users, the results will not be valid.

105

00:07:05.540  -->  00:07:09.750
The number of participants varies based on
the methods used, so be sure to define how

106

00:07:09.750  -->  00:07:15.180
many people you need to get enough data to
be sure of the results.

107

00:07:15.180  -->  00:07:17.971
To bring a research project to a successful conclusion

108

00:07:17.971  -->  00:07:20.190
a lot of logistics have to be arranged.

109

00:07:20.190  -->  00:07:24.770
Some questions to think about: How do you
recruit participants for your research?

110

00:07:24.770  -->  00:07:26.110
Where will the research take place?

111

00:07:26.110  -->  00:07:31.830
Will it be done in the field, in a lab, remotely
with a moderator, or unmoderated?

112

00:07:31.830  -->  00:07:34.187
Who facilitates the test or conducts the interviews?

113

00:07:34.187  -->  00:07:37.110
What equipment do you need for the research?

114

00:07:38.699  -->  00:07:42.150
Once you've prepared your research study,
it's a good practice to run a pilot test to

115

00:07:42.150  -->  00:07:46.330
make sure it's working as you expect.

116

00:07:46.330  -->  00:07:48.840
Doing research is only part of the process.

117

00:07:48.840  -->  00:07:51.479
After you have conducted the research, you
must present the results.

118

00:07:51.479  -->  00:07:55.175
It is important after all your sessions to
review the final results

119

00:07:55.175  -->  00:07:58.500
discuss this results and decide what to implement.

120

00:07:58.500  -->  00:08:01.900
With your team and other stakeholders.

121

00:08:01.900  -->  00:08:05.520
Everyone benefits from understanding the issues
users are experiencing and helping them make

122

00:08:05.520  -->  00:08:07.940
informed decisions to improve them.

123

00:08:12.692  -->  00:08:15.070
Once you know what you want to research

124

00:08:15.070  -->  00:08:17.410
you can decide which methods you want to use.

125

00:08:17.410  -->  00:08:21.120
UX research includes various methods and techniques.

126

00:08:21.120  -->  00:08:26.270
Each project benefits from multiple research
methods and from combining insights.

127

00:08:26.270  -->  00:08:29.919
To better understand when to use which method,
use this chart.

128

00:08:29.919  -->  00:08:34.999
It has two axes: behavioral versus attitudinal
and qualitative versus quantitative.

129

00:08:34.999  -->  00:08:39.930
On the vertical axis you will find behavioral
versus attitudinal.

130

00:08:39.930  -->  00:08:43.456
The difference between the two is listening
to 'what people say' 

131

00:08:43.456  -->  00:08:46.459
versus observing 'what people do'.

132

00:08:46.459  -->  00:08:48.610
Very often these give different insights.

133

00:08:48.610  -->  00:08:55.610
In the lower part you will find methods such
as interviews, focus groups and surveys.

134

00:08:55.610  -->  00:08:59.519
These can provide insight into what people
think about a brand or product 

135

00:08:59.519  -->  00:09:02.600
or the mental model of the user.

136

00:09:02.600  -->  00:09:05.699
On the other hand, you'll find behavioral
methods to understand what people are doing

137

00:09:05.699  -->  00:09:07.350
with the product.

138

00:09:07.350  -->  00:09:12.170
Research methods in the top half help you
discover needs that your user has, but usually

139

00:09:12.170  -->  00:09:14.130
doesn't articulate.

140

00:09:14.130  -->  00:09:17.779
By combining methods from both sides, you
bridge the gap between what users say and

141

00:09:17.779  -->  00:09:20.330
how they actually feel.

142

00:09:20.330  -->  00:09:24.850
Another distinction we can make is between
quantitative and qualitative research methods.

143

00:09:24.850  -->  00:09:29.809
Quantitative methods are used to gain insight
into the statistical analysis while qualitative

144

00:09:29.809  -->  00:09:34.369
methods are used to gain a deeper understanding
of the opinions and views of the user.

145

00:09:34.369  -->  00:09:39.800
Quantitative research is used to collect and
analyze data, identify patterns, make predictions,

146

00:09:39.800  -->  00:09:41.519
and generalize findings.

147

00:09:41.519  -->  00:09:45.040
This data is collected indirectly.

148

00:09:45.040  -->  00:09:49.079
For example, quantitative usability testing
collects metrics such as

149

00:09:49.079  -->  00:09:51.540
time on task, error rate, or success rate.

150

00:09:51.540  -->  00:09:55.949
With an app or web analytics tool you can
track your product's performance, see what

151

00:09:55.949  -->  00:09:59.670
people are doing in your product, and identify
issues.

152

00:09:59.670  -->  00:10:04.639
You can use this information to monitor your
product's UX and ensure it improves over time.

153

00:10:04.639  -->  00:10:09.850
One of the advantages of quantitative research
is the ability to conduct large-sample studies

154

00:10:09.850  -->  00:10:12.800
and collect statistically relevant data.

155

00:10:12.800  -->  00:10:17.569
Unlike qualitative feedback, quantitative
research is more objective and representative

156

00:10:17.569  -->  00:10:20.699
of a wider audience.

157

00:10:20.699  -->  00:10:25.490
On the flip side, quantitative research does
not tell you why and how an effect occurs.

158

00:10:25.490  -->  00:10:28.149
For that you need qualitative user research.

159

00:10:28.149  -->  00:10:32.970
This includes research methods such as user
interviews and field studies.

160

00:10:32.970  -->  00:10:37.170
Then you collect qualitative data through
direct observation of participants.

161

00:10:37.170  -->  00:10:42.411
This provides insight into people's motivations,
thoughts and attitudes.

162

00:10:42.411  -->  00:10:45.420
This type of research is key to uncovering
the "why" behind actions.

163

00:10:45.420  -->  00:10:49.730
To develop a deep understanding of the problem
you are investigating.

164

00:10:49.730  -->  00:10:53.929
Qualitative methods are often used during
the research and concept phases, as they answer

165

00:10:53.929  -->  00:10:57.230
questions about why and how things happen.

166

00:10:57.230  -->  00:11:02.660
These are very important questions to ask
when researching and doing concept design.

167

00:11:02.660  -->  00:11:04.480
So which one should you choose?

168

00:11:04.480  -->  00:11:09.490
Qualitative and quantitative are both essential
for conducting effective research and obtaining

169

00:11:09.490  -->  00:11:10.519
actionable insights.

170

00:11:10.519  -->  00:11:14.839
In fact, they reinforce each other and help
to triangulate the research results.

171

00:11:14.839  -->  00:11:21.689
You can be sure of your findings if both qualitative and quantitative approaches yield comparable results.

172

00:11:22.689  -->  00:11:27.189
Use qualitative research to explore ideas
and discover new insights, then use quantitative

173

00:11:27.189  -->  00:11:31.779
research methods to test a hypothesis or final
solution.

174

00:11:31.779  -->  00:11:34.879
Choosing the right research method starts
with knowing what problem you are trying to

175

00:11:34.879  -->  00:11:39.070
solve and what type of data you need to collect.

176

00:11:39.070  -->  00:11:41.034
Understanding where you are in the design
process will help you 

177

00:11:41.034  -->  00:11:43.350
choose the right UX research method.

178

00:11:43.350  -->  00:11:49.142
For example, if the team is very early in
the process, it makes sense to do more exploratory work.

179

00:11:49.142  -->  00:11:52.910
Using generative research methods, such as
field studies.

180

00:11:52.910  -->  00:11:58.420
On the other hand, if you need to test a prototype,
evaluative research methods such as usability

181

00:11:58.420  -->  00:12:00.239
testing work best.

182

00:12:00.239  -->  00:12:04.009
Let's have a look at some of the most common
UX research methods to help you decide on

183

00:12:04.009  -->  00:12:07.059
the best solution for your project.

184

00:12:07.059  -->  00:12:10.769
There are several methods available, but in
this lesson we will highlight the most important

185

00:12:10.769  -->  00:12:13.566
techniques you need to know when conducting research.

186

00:12:18.938  -->  00:12:21.259
User interviews are a well-known research method

187

00:12:21.259  -->  00:12:25.720
that allows you to gather information
through conversations with your users.

188

00:12:25.720  -->  00:12:30.269
Unlike focus groups, user interviews are one-on-one
sessions where you learn in-depth what the

189

00:12:30.269  -->  00:12:32.569
participant thinks about a topic.

190

00:12:32.569  -->  00:12:35.399
Which will lead to the discovery of new ideas
and insights.

191

00:12:35.399  -->  00:12:40.740
To get the most out of user interviews, I'll
share some best practices with you.

192

00:12:40.740  -->  00:12:42.029
Create a discussion guide.

193

00:12:42.029  -->  00:12:47.149
Here you list the questions you want to ask,
in a logical conversation order and priority.

194

00:12:47.149  -->  00:12:50.970
If you're short on time during an interview,
you want to make sure you've covered the key points.

195

00:12:51.344  -->  00:12:53.208
But don't be too tied to the script.

196

00:12:53.208  -->  00:12:56.649
If it makes sense during the interview, be
open to deviations.

197

00:12:56.649  -->  00:13:01.199
Prepare more questions than you think you
will have time to ask.

198

00:13:01.199  -->  00:13:04.339
Some participants talk a lot and give very
long answers.

199

00:13:04.339  -->  00:13:07.990
Others need a follow-up question to provide
the same amount of information.

200

00:13:07.990  -->  00:13:12.410
But don't rush the user, let them finish their
thoughts and don't interrupt them.

201

00:13:12.410  -->  00:13:17.929
Below this video you will find information
on how to best create a discussion guide.

202

00:13:17.929  -->  00:13:23.949
To get the most out of your interview session,
it is important to avoid leading, closed or

203

00:13:23.949  -->  00:13:25.699
vague questions.

204

00:13:25.699  -->  00:13:29.529
Leading questions direct the user by proposing
an answer.

205

00:13:29.529  -->  00:13:33.889
For example, a question like "Why do you like
using Instagram so much?"

206

00:13:33.889  -->  00:13:37.640
suggests that the user uses and enjoys the
product.

207

00:13:37.640  -->  00:13:40.149
A better question might be, "Why do you use
Instagram?"

208

00:13:40.149  -->  00:13:42.860
or "What do you think of Instagram?"

209

00:13:42.860  -->  00:13:47.799
Closed questions stop the conversation and
cut surprises.

210

00:13:47.799  -->  00:13:53.180
If you ask closed questions, you may limit
or prompt someone to give a certain answer.

211

00:13:53.180  -->  00:13:55.059
They create “yes” or “no” answers.

212

00:13:55.059  -->  00:13:59.480
For example, if an interviewer asks, "So you
use Instagram every day?"

213

00:13:59.480  -->  00:14:03.810
then you will most likely only get a "yes"
without further explanation.

214

00:14:03.810  -->  00:14:09.730
A better question might be: "Can you tell
me how you use Instagram?"

215

00:14:09.730  -->  00:14:13.540
Asking open-ended questions is critical to
get actionable insights and feedback.

216

00:14:13.540  -->  00:14:18.939
People may share motivations you didn't expect
or mention concerns you didn't know about.

217

00:14:18.939  -->  00:14:22.600
You can use closed questions as an introduction
to open answers.

218

00:14:22.600  -->  00:14:26.029
For example: "Do you have an Instagram account?"

219

00:14:26.029  -->  00:14:31.471
Which is a closed question, followed by: 
Why is that? When do you use it? 

220

00:14:31.471  -->  00:14:35.508
Or can you tell me about the last time you posted?

221

00:14:35.508  -->  00:14:38.529
Also make sure that you ask one thing at a time.

222

00:14:38.529  -->  00:14:43.600
Instead of “Do you use a social media network,
and if so, which one do you use?”

223

00:14:43.600  -->  00:14:47.249
Try "How often do you use social media?"

224

00:14:47.249  -->  00:14:51.170
then continue with:
"Which one do you use?"

225

00:14:55.161  -->  00:14:57.260
Where user interviews are one-on-one discussions,

226

00:14:57.260  -->  00:15:02.069
a focus group is a qualitative research method
in which a group of people, their beliefs

227

00:15:02.069  -->  00:15:03.389
and opinions are studied.

228

00:15:03.389  -->  00:15:07.549
They are guided by discussions on various
topics.

229

00:15:07.549  -->  00:15:11.870
Focus groups are very suitable for finding
new opportunities in the market or exploring

230

00:15:11.870  -->  00:15:13.779
new concepts.

231

00:15:13.779  -->  00:15:18.629
In a 1-on-1 conversation, an interviewer can
give socially desirable answers, so as not

232

00:15:18.629  -->  00:15:21.920
to criticize the interviewer or the product.

233

00:15:21.920  -->  00:15:24.889
This happens less quickly in a group.

234

00:15:24.889  -->  00:15:27.693
Focus groups are therefore very suitable if
you want your participants 

235

00:15:27.693  -->  00:15:31.189
to give unbiased answers.

236

00:15:31.189  -->  00:15:35.550
On the other hand, there may also be more
group dynamics that influence the participants'

237

00:15:35.550  -->  00:15:36.550
responses.

238

00:15:36.550  -->  00:15:38.839
You have to pay close attention to this.

239

00:15:38.839  -->  00:15:43.309
You also have less room to discuss topics
in detail.

240

00:15:43.309  -->  00:15:47.379
It therefore strongly depends on your research
goal which type of interview is most suitable.

241

00:15:47.379  -->  00:15:50.980
It does take some work to steer a discussion
in the right direction.

242

00:15:50.980  -->  00:15:55.087
About five to ten participants are recommended
to keep the sessions focused and organized.

243

00:16:00.026  -->  00:16:02.449
A fundamental role of the user researcher

244

00:16:02.449  -->  00:16:08.660
is to bridge the gap between what users say
and how they actually feel.

245

00:16:08.660  -->  00:16:12.104
Through generative research, 
you can discover needs that your user has 

246

00:16:12.104  -->  00:16:15.109
but usually doesn't articulate.

247

00:16:15.109  -->  00:16:20.850
Field studies are a great method to uncover
context, unknown motivations or limitations

248

00:16:20.850  -->  00:16:24.089
that affect the user experience.

249

00:16:24.089  -->  00:16:28.939
Field studies are ethnographic research activities
that take place in the user's natural environment.

250

00:16:28.939  -->  00:16:34.059
There is no stronger form of research than
observing users behave as they will when using

251

00:16:34.059  -->  00:16:35.220
your product.

252

00:16:35.220  -->  00:16:40.149
For example, see how an Uber driver uses the
app while picking up customers.

253

00:16:40.149  -->  00:16:43.199
How people use your banking app to pay at
a restaurant.

254

00:16:43.199  -->  00:16:46.370
Or how they use your app to check in and board
a plane.

255

00:16:46.370  -->  00:16:51.740
A field study is super helpful for understanding
the context in which users complete tasks,

256

00:16:51.740  -->  00:16:55.970
learn about their needs, and gather in-depth
user stories.

257

00:16:55.970  -->  00:17:00.040
It helps you understand how the product fits
into their everyday life.

258

00:17:00.040  -->  00:17:02.040
It's great for creating customer journey maps.

259

00:17:02.040  -->  00:17:08.159
Because you see first-hand all the steps your
users are taking, their emotions and motivations.

260

00:17:12.131  -->  00:17:15.500
This research method involves users keeping diaries

261

00:17:15.500  -->  00:17:20.230
explaining their activities, and
highlighting things that stand out to them.

262

00:17:20.230  -->  00:17:25.010
Diary studies provide you with a great way
to see how a user uses a product on a daily

263

00:17:25.010  -->  00:17:27.990
basis and how it fits into their lives.

264

00:17:27.990  -->  00:17:31.960
Diary studies are one of the few ways you
can actually see how users interact with a

265

00:17:31.960  -->  00:17:34.700
product in a real-life scenario.

266

00:17:34.700  -->  00:17:40.529
The feedback you collect gives you real-time
information to help you create a better product

267

00:17:40.529  -->  00:17:44.399
For an effective diary study, you need to
be clear about what participants should do.

268

00:17:44.399  -->  00:17:47.429
What kind of feedback they should provide,
and how they should share it with you.

269

00:17:47.429  -->  00:17:53.130
It is also important to be available to the
participants for any questions.

270

00:17:53.130  -->  00:17:55.450
Keep in mind that most diary studies can take
a while.

271

00:17:55.450  -->  00:17:58.811
But, a longer duration also means that you
have a broader period 

272

00:17:58.811  -->  00:18:01.269
and a wider range of situations.

273

00:18:01.269  -->  00:18:04.750
Meaning that you have a better chance of understanding
all the problems.

274

00:18:04.750  -->  00:18:08.450
Because it shows the real, natural behavior
of the user over time.

275

00:18:08.450  -->  00:18:13.059
Things like this often don't come up in a
quick-time-boxed test or interview.

276

00:18:17.997  -->  00:18:20.240
Surveys are a research tool that allows you

277

00:18:20.240  -->  00:18:23.960
to collect data from a group of participants.

278

00:18:23.960  -->  00:18:26.659
Usually quantitative by collecting a large
number of answers.

279

00:18:26.659  -->  00:18:31.559
But you can also use them for qualitative
research by asking people for feedback

280

00:18:31.559  -->  00:18:34.013
with open-ended comments.

281

00:18:34.013  -->  00:18:39.000
Surveys are good because it is easy and inexpensive
to create and send one.

282

00:18:39.000  -->  00:18:41.240
Instead of talking to people one by one.

283

00:18:41.240  -->  00:18:46.570
The downside is that you can't ask follow-up
questions.

284

00:18:46.570  -->  00:18:50.010
As with interviews or focus groups, avoid
leading questions.

285

00:18:50.010  -->  00:18:55.201
This prompts the participant to respond in
a certain way, giving you biased answers.

286

00:18:59.850  -->  00:19:02.720
Card sorting is a research method where users

287

00:19:02.720  -->  00:19:05.890
categorize subject cards in a way that makes
sense to them.

288

00:19:05.890  -->  00:19:07.120
It's a simple concept.

289

00:19:07.120  -->  00:19:14.870
You write topics, pages or features on cards
and then you ask the user to categorize them.

290

00:19:14.870  -->  00:19:18.023
The words or phrases you write on the cards
depend on what you're trying 

291

00:19:18.023  -->  00:19:19.870
to learn from your users.

292

00:19:19.870  -->  00:19:25.169
For example, if you want to know if the way
your website is organized is easy to understand,

293

00:19:25.169  -->  00:19:29.269
you can write down the different pages of
your website and ask users to sort them into

294

00:19:29.269  -->  00:19:31.220
categories that make sense to them.

295

00:19:31.220  -->  00:19:36.049
This is an open card sorting session that
generates new ideas and category names.

296

00:19:36.049  -->  00:19:42.210
In contrast, in a closed card sorting, you provide
participants with a predefined set of categories

297

00:19:42.210  -->  00:19:47.539
and ask them to sort the items into the available
categories.

298

00:19:47.539  -->  00:19:53.210
You can perform a card sorting session using
physical index cards or a digital tool.

299

00:19:53.210  -->  00:19:57.970
You need probably around 15 participants 
to get good results and spot patterns.

300

00:19:57.970  -->  00:20:01.320
Card sorting is invaluable in figuring out
how to structure something.

301

00:20:01.320  -->  00:20:06.299
An important step towards creating an intuitive
information architecture.

302

00:20:06.299  -->  00:20:09.030
It's also a good way to understand your users'
mental models.

303

00:20:09.030  -->  00:20:13.279
The relationships they create between cards
will teach you which ideas or functions are

304

00:20:13.279  -->  00:20:16.015
most related in the minds of the users.

305

00:20:20.719  -->  00:20:24.110
With usability testing, you ask users to complete

306

00:20:24.110  -->  00:20:27.889
a list of tasks while observing and recording
their interactions.

307

00:20:27.889  -->  00:20:33.389
The purpose is to understand if your design
is intuitive and easy to use, and if there

308

00:20:33.389  -->  00:20:36.539
are any usability issues.

309

00:20:36.539  -->  00:20:38.970
Usability tests are incredibly effective.

310

00:20:38.970  -->  00:20:42.400
They give you plenty of learning opportunities
and insights.

311

00:20:42.400  -->  00:20:46.400
Because you test tangible work instead of
general concepts.

312

00:20:46.400  -->  00:20:50.200
There are several usability testing methods
that you can use.

313

00:20:50.200  -->  00:20:54.620
In a moderated usability test, users perform
tasks while a researcher 

314

00:20:54.620  -->  00:20:56.639
observes and takes notes.

315

00:20:56.639  -->  00:20:59.610
This is usually done in an in-house laboratory.

316

00:20:59.610  -->  00:21:05.330
Remote, unmoderated testing with tools like
Usertesting.com is also very popular.

317

00:21:05.330  -->  00:21:10.149
This is usability testing, but without dragging
users into a lab environment.

318

00:21:10.149  -->  00:21:14.680
The main advantage of these tools is that
you can set up the test, find participants

319

00:21:14.680  -->  00:21:16.750
and then run it in the background.

320

00:21:16.750  -->  00:21:23.500
The only disadvantage is that you cannot adjust
the test based on the answers of the participant.

321

00:21:23.500  -->  00:21:27.789
Usability testing steers your work in the
right direction and brings you closer to shipping.

322

00:21:27.789  -->  00:21:31.130
And the great thing is that you don't need
many participants.

323

00:21:31.130  -->  00:21:35.400
In fact, research from the Nielsen Norman
group indicates that only five people are

324

00:21:35.400  -->  00:21:37.040
needed per test.

325

00:21:37.040  -->  00:21:42.860
It shows that those five users can find 85%
of serious problems in an interface.

326

00:21:42.860  -->  00:21:48.080
Adding more users improves the percentage
marginally, but increases the cost significantly.

327

00:21:48.080  -->  00:21:50.990
It is therefore good to opt for an iterative
setup.

328

00:21:50.990  -->  00:21:56.889
The user experience is much more improved
by 3 usability tests with 5 users each in

329

00:21:56.889  -->  00:22:01.820
which you continue to process the improvement
points after each session, than by one sample

330

00:22:01.820  -->  00:22:04.523
study with 15 users.

331

00:22:09.261  -->  00:22:12.030
A/B testing is testing between two versions

332

00:22:12.030  -->  00:22:13.030
of an interface.

333

00:22:13.030  -->  00:22:18.960
Half of the people are using version A and
the other half are using version B. 

334

00:22:18.960  -->  00:22:24.740
It's great to show which of two design decisions 
will have the most impact.

335

00:22:24.740  -->  00:22:28.370
You measure the effect of use in each group
and determine which version is better based

336

00:22:28.370  -->  00:22:29.720
on a metric.

337

00:22:29.720  -->  00:22:34.010
To measure this, everything except the test
condition must remain the same in each group.

338

00:22:34.010  -->  00:22:39.080
They must be the same size and experience
the test in the same period.

339

00:22:39.080  -->  00:22:42.159
The downside is that you can only vary one
thing at a time.

340

00:22:42.159  -->  00:22:46.289
To make sure that's what causes the difference
between the groups.

341

00:22:46.289  -->  00:22:51.840
For example, if you make various adjustments
such as images, colors or heading styles.

342

00:22:51.840  -->  00:22:55.039
You won't know how much each change affected
the end result.

343

00:22:55.039  -->  00:22:59.630
It is better to test only small pieces of
the user interface.

344

00:22:59.630  -->  00:23:04.429
There are many tools like Google Optimize
that you can use to do your own A/B testing

345

00:23:04.429  -->  00:23:06.080
on a website.

346

00:23:06.080  -->  00:23:10.820
Before you begin, it's good practice to write
down a hypothesis and decide on goals, expectations,

347

00:23:10.820  -->  00:23:11.820
and metrics.

348

00:23:16.695  -->  00:23:19.820
Knowing what your users are looking at when

349

00:23:19.820  -->  00:23:23.179
using your system can tell you a lot about
the usability of your product.

350

00:23:23.179  -->  00:23:26.890
It helps in user interface design and to rank
types of content.

351

00:23:26.890  -->  00:23:31.470
Eye tracking tracks how users' eyes move across
web pages.

352

00:23:31.470  -->  00:23:36.909
This requires specialized technology and is
thus often only used in a UX lab.

353

00:23:36.909  -->  00:23:39.720
There are online alternatives to use, such
as heatmaps.

354

00:23:39.720  -->  00:23:44.940
They don't follow eye movements, but mouse
clicks and hovers on a website.

355

00:23:44.940  -->  00:23:48.620
These create heatmaps that show where users
spend time and attention on a page.

356

00:23:48.620  -->  00:23:51.299
They can be done remotely with automated tools.

357

00:23:51.299  -->  00:23:55.320
These are some of the most well-known research
methods.

358

00:23:55.320  -->  00:23:59.750
There are dozens of other techniques available
for different purposes.

359

00:23:59.750  -->  00:24:03.909
If you would like to delve even further into
this, we have collected a series of interesting

360

00:24:03.909  -->  00:24:07.140
articles and books for you below this video.

361

00:24:07.140  -->  00:24:10.299
This also brings us to the end of this lesson.

362

00:24:10.299  -->  00:24:12.870
Let's briefly review what we've covered in
this lesson.

363

00:24:12.870  -->  00:24:17.480
I started by explaining that user experience
research is a critical part of 

364

00:24:17.480  -->  00:24:19.519
the human-centered design process.

365

00:24:19.519  -->  00:24:23.330
User research should take place at every stage
of the design process.

366

00:24:23.330  -->  00:24:28.550
The earlier the investigation, the more impact
the findings will have on your product.

367

00:24:28.550  -->  00:24:35.600
We can distinguish two types of research:
generative research and evaluative research.

368

00:24:35.600  -->  00:24:38.990
Generative research helps us understand what
problem we might solve.

369

00:24:38.990  -->  00:24:44.289
Evaluative research helps us to test how well
our solution works.

370

00:24:44.289  -->  00:24:49.000
Using both generative and evaluative UX research
during the design process ensures that the

371

00:24:49.000  -->  00:24:55.140
product you're building addresses real needs
and resolves existing pain points.

372

00:24:55.140  -->  00:24:58.940
Before you start, it's good practice to map
out the entire research process.

373

00:24:58.940  -->  00:25:04.850
A user research plan acts as an overview and
helps to get the project started.

374

00:25:04.850  -->  00:25:10.710
Once you know what you want to research, you
can decide which research methods to use.

375

00:25:10.710  -->  00:25:15.149
To better understand when to use which method,
I've shown you this chart.

376

00:25:15.149  -->  00:25:19.900
The difference between attitude and behavior
is listening to 'what people say' versus observing

377

00:25:19.900  -->  00:25:22.090
'what people do'.

378

00:25:22.090  -->  00:25:27.789
Quantitative methods are used to gain insight
into the statistical analysis while qualitative

379

00:25:27.789  -->  00:25:32.899
methods are used to gain deeper insight into
the opinions and views of the user.

380

00:25:32.899  -->  00:25:37.879
Finally, we've gone through the most common
UX research methods to help you decide on

381

00:25:37.879  -->  00:25:41.206
the best solution for your project.

382

00:25:41.206  -->  00:25:45.279
To design for people,
you have to understand people.

383

00:25:45.279  -->  00:25:49.320
As I showed in this lesson, user research
plays an important role in this.

384

00:25:49.320  -->  00:25:54.352
But there are also some general patterns of
how people process information, 

385

00:25:54.352  -->  00:25:55.779
think and learn.

386

00:25:55.779  -->  00:26:00.080
I'll tell you more about this in the next
chapter on cognitive psychology.
