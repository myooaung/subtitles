00:00:07.267  -->  00:00:10.840
To design for people, you also need to understand
people.

2

00:00:10.840  -->  00:00:15.110
When designing products, we spend a lot of
time on different research methods to understand

3

00:00:15.110  -->  00:00:17.980
the behavior, habits, and needs of our users.

4

00:00:17.980  -->  00:00:21.511
But there are some general patterns that we
see in most people.

5

00:00:22.600  -->  00:00:27.635
The way people acquire, process, and store
information in their brains is what

6

00:00:27.635  -->  00:00:30.284
cognitive psychology focuses on.

7

00:00:30.284  -->  00:00:36.390
This branch of psychology examines a wide
variety of mental processes, including perception,

8

00:00:36.390  -->  00:00:44.670
thinking, memory, attention, language, 
problem-solving, and learning.

9

00:00:44.670  -->  00:00:48.928
As with the other chapters, this is a vast
subject and a field in its own right.

10

00:00:48.928  -->  00:00:53.010
In this lesson, I want to take you through
some principles and examples that are good

11

00:00:53.010  -->  00:00:56.034
to know when working on user experiences.

12

00:01:00.647  -->  00:01:02.580
Let's start with memory.

13

00:01:02.580  -->  00:01:07.470
The first thing to know about memory is that
it is limited, especially short-term memory.

14

00:01:07.470  -->  00:01:12.250
There is only a limited amount of information
that people can hold in their working memory

15

00:01:12.250  -->  00:01:14.110
before they forget it.

16

00:01:14.110  -->  00:01:18.860
For example, if you're trying to remember
a name and phone number and someone starts

17

00:01:18.860  -->  00:01:22.860
talking to you at the same time, you'll likely
forget it quickly.

18

00:01:22.860  -->  00:01:25.935
If you don't focus, you lose it from your
working memory.

19

00:01:26.749  -->  00:01:29.420
We can prove this with a simple test.

20

00:01:29.420  -->  00:01:32.770
I'll show you three letters that I want you
to remember.

21

00:01:32.770  -->  00:01:34.200
Don't cheat by writing it down.

22

00:01:34.200  -->  00:01:39.210
Next, I'm going to show you a number and I
want you to count backward from the number

23

00:01:39.210  -->  00:01:41.530
by subtracting three from it.

24

00:01:41.530  -->  00:01:46.420
For example 30, 27 ,24 and so on.

25

00:01:46.420  -->  00:01:48.502
Until I tell you to stop.

26

00:01:48.502  -->  00:01:50.254
Ready?

27

00:01:50.254  -->  00:01:53.681
I want you to remember these letters.

28

00:01:55.780  -->  00:02:02.892
Now count back by three until I tell you to
stop, starting with 637.

29

00:02:14.893  -->  00:02:16.950
Do you remember the three letters?

30

00:02:16.950  -->  00:02:20.542
The correct group was: KTZ.

31

00:02:20.542  -->  00:02:23.790
If you did remember them, give yourself a
pat on the back.

32

00:02:23.790  -->  00:02:28.247
If you didn't, take comfort in the fact that
most people don't remember it either.

33

00:02:29.051  -->  00:02:35.149
This test is part of a famous experiment done
in 1959 by psychology researchers

34

00:02:35.149  -->  00:02:37.428
Lloyd and Margaret Peterson.

35

00:02:37.428  -->  00:02:41.010
They tested how quickly people forget information.

36

00:02:41.010  -->  00:02:44.520
After six seconds, only half of the participants
remembered the letters.

37

00:02:44.520  -->  00:02:50.130
After 12 seconds as in our example, 
it was only 15%.

38

00:02:50.130  -->  00:02:53.599
The test seemed simple, but something intervened.

39

00:02:53.599  -->  00:02:57.370
Counting down to three is a classic example
of interference.

40

00:02:57.370  -->  00:03:00.959
The counting behavior creates new information
in your brain.

41

00:03:00.959  -->  00:03:05.560
New information overshadows information from
the past, making us less able to store and

42

00:03:05.560  -->  00:03:07.534
retrieve memories.

43

00:03:07.534  -->  00:03:10.050
The same thing happens online.

44

00:03:10.050  -->  00:03:12.440
Interference affects the user experience.

45

00:03:12.440  -->  00:03:16.977
For example, we need to remember all kinds
of information when we shop online.

46

00:03:16.977  -->  00:03:24.282
Prices, sizes, scores, ratings, reward points,
availability, and many others.

47

00:03:24.282  -->  00:03:28.485
Taken in isolation, each piece of information
is easy to remember.

48

00:03:28.485  -->  00:03:34.680
However, we also perform multiple behaviors
when shopping online: navigating between screens,

49

00:03:34.680  -->  00:03:40.569
adding to carts, creating passwords for accounts,
and entering shipping information into forms.

50

00:03:40.569  -->  00:03:43.847
This makes it very difficult to remember all
the information.

51

00:03:44.366  -->  00:03:48.790
If you want to optimize user experience, it
is very effective to reduce the cognitive

52

00:03:48.790  -->  00:03:50.630
load on your user.

53

00:03:50.630  -->  00:03:52.034
Some best practices.

54

00:03:52.889  -->  00:03:55.563
Recognition rather than recall

55

00:03:55.829  -->  00:03:58.813
Chunking helps content processing

56

00:03:59.491  -->  00:04:03.953
It's easier for users to recall the 
first and last items of a list.

57

00:04:04.524  -->  00:04:07.119
Limit the number of options

58

00:04:07.300  -->  00:04:11.129
But donâ€™t simplify too much

59

00:04:11.129  -->  00:04:16.590
As already mentioned in the chapter on usability,
recognition trumps recall.

60

00:04:16.590  -->  00:04:22.509
Recognizing data is often easier than recalling
data without sequence or context.

61

00:04:22.509  -->  00:04:24.813
Users spend most of their time on other sites.

62

00:04:24.813  -->  00:04:28.860
This means that users prefer your site to
work in the same way as any other site they

63

00:04:28.860  -->  00:04:30.565
already know.

64

00:04:30.565  -->  00:04:35.503
Words, images, icons, and functionality have
context in both your application

65

00:04:35.503  -->  00:04:38.199
and any other experience.

66

00:04:39.547  -->  00:04:43.970
Users assume that "Cancel" means that an application
stops an operation.

67

00:04:43.970  -->  00:04:47.980
They expect a back arrow to return to a previous
screen.

68

00:04:47.980  -->  00:04:51.780
They expect a website's checkout to work like
any other checkout.

69

00:04:51.780  -->  00:04:54.188
They recognize it instead of remembering it.

70

00:04:55.199  -->  00:05:00.770
The mental effort required to complete a task
is called the cognitive load.

71

00:05:00.770  -->  00:05:06.900
You can think of it as the processing power
that the user needs to interact with a product.

72

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:11.552
If the information to be processed exceeds
the user's ability to cope with it

73

00:05:11.552  -->  00:05:13.801
the cognitive load is too high.

74

00:05:14.344  -->  00:05:19.020
There is a limit to the number of items an
average person can keep in their working memory.

75

00:05:19.020  -->  00:05:24.949
In 1956, George Miller claimed that the scope
of working memory is limited to about 7 pieces

76

00:05:24.949  -->  00:05:26.410
of information.

77

00:05:26.410  -->  00:05:28.662
Also known as Miller's Law.

78

00:05:28.662  -->  00:05:31.680
The magic number seven 
has been debunked by research.

79

00:05:31.680  -->  00:05:35.810
The idea that you can only store a limited
number of items in your short-term memory

80

00:05:35.810  -->  00:05:38.387
however still stands.

81

00:05:38.879  -->  00:05:45.840
A better way is to organize content into smaller
chunks so that users can easily process, understand,

82

00:05:45.840  -->  00:05:47.660
and remember them.

83

00:05:47.660  -->  00:05:52.680
These chunks bypass the limited working memory
capacity and ensure that the working memory

84

00:05:52.680  -->  00:05:55.150
can work more efficiently.

85

00:05:55.150  -->  00:06:01.650
So how many items a person can easily remember
depends on how the list is "broken".

86

00:06:01.650  -->  00:06:07.060
Psychology professor Nelson Cowan researched
that people are able to remember 3 to 5 parts

87

00:06:07.060  -->  00:06:09.870
of short-term memory tasks.

88

00:06:09.870  -->  00:06:14.548
So it's no coincidence that US phone numbers
look like this.

89

00:06:14.548  -->  00:06:20.330
Instead of having to remember 10 individual
digits, a phone number has three parts, with

90

00:06:20.330  -->  00:06:23.163
four or fewer entries in each part.

91

00:06:23.163  -->  00:06:25.350
This makes it easier to remember.

92

00:06:25.350  -->  00:06:30.000
If you know the area code by heart, then you
don't even have to remember that part of the number.

93

00:06:30.000  -->  00:06:33.722
You see the same principle with 
credit card numbers.

94

00:06:34.784  -->  00:06:39.460
Users tend to remember the first and last
items in a sequence best.

95

00:06:39.460  -->  00:06:41.708
Also called the serial position effect.

96

00:06:41.708  -->  00:06:47.340
A term coined by Herman Ebbinghaus describes
how an item's position in a sequence affects

97

00:06:47.340  -->  00:06:49.795
recall accuracy.

98

00:06:49.795  -->  00:06:54.490
By positioning the most important actions
on the far left and right within elements

99

00:06:54.490  -->  00:06:58.710
such as navigation, memory can be increased.

100

00:06:58.710  -->  00:07:03.285
Or to place the valuable items at the beginning
or end of a list.

101

00:07:04.944  -->  00:07:08.250
More options are therefore not only more difficult
to remember.

102

00:07:08.250  -->  00:07:10.920
They also lead to more difficult decisions.

103

00:07:10.920  -->  00:07:16.160
Hick's law predicts that the time and effort
it takes to make a decision increases with

104

00:07:16.160  -->  00:07:18.426
the number of options.

105

00:07:18.426  -->  00:07:23.410
The more choices, the more time users need
to make their decisions.

106

00:07:23.410  -->  00:07:25.800
Choosing carefully from three things is easy.

107

00:07:25.800  -->  00:07:29.275
Choosing carefully from 30 things is impossible.

108

00:07:29.275  -->  00:07:33.460
Having too many options can lead to a 
choice paradox.

109

00:07:33.460  -->  00:07:36.289
So minimizing the number of choices is the
first step.

110

00:07:36.289  -->  00:07:42.669
If not possible, break complex tasks into
smaller steps to reduce the cognitive load.

111

00:07:44.094  -->  00:07:46.449
But donâ€™t simplify too much.

112

00:07:46.449  -->  00:07:51.590
The best method of reducing complexity is
to avoid it in the first place.

113

00:07:51.590  -->  00:07:57.963
Analyze each element and remove as many as
possible without compromising the overall function.

114

00:07:57.963  -->  00:08:03.328
But keep in mind that if you simplify too
much, you transfer some complexity to the users.

115

00:08:03.328  -->  00:08:06.830
Also known as Tesler's law.

116

00:08:06.830  -->  00:08:12.610
It states that for any system there is a degree
of complexity that cannot be reduced.

117

00:08:12.610  -->  00:08:17.639
All processes have a core of complexity that
cannot be designed away and therefore must

118

00:08:17.639  -->  00:08:21.110
be assumed by the system or the user.

119

00:08:21.110  -->  00:08:25.520
Ensure that users are relieved as much as
possible by dealing with inherent complexity

120

00:08:25.520  -->  00:08:27.858
during design and development.

121

00:08:32.134  -->  00:08:34.589
Memory goes hand in hand with attention.

122

00:08:34.589  -->  00:08:37.250
Which brings us to the next topic.

123

00:08:37.250  -->  00:08:41.478
Our working memory plays a major role in what
we can process.

124

00:08:41.478  -->  00:08:46.261
First, we must pay attention to be able
to perceive that information.

125

00:08:46.261  -->  00:08:49.575
We can distinguish four types of attention.

126

00:08:49.575  -->  00:08:53.431
Selective attention
Divided attention

127

00:08:53.431  -->  00:08:57.374
Focused attention
Sustained Attention

128

00:08:58.125  -->  00:09:03.689
Selective attention is an automatic process
that chooses between important and less important

129

00:09:03.689  -->  00:09:06.610
stimuli depending on the situation.

130

00:09:06.610  -->  00:09:11.110
Since we can only devote ourselves to one
thing at a time, this kind of process helps

131

00:09:11.110  -->  00:09:15.785
to select the most important stimuli in the
given situation.

132

00:09:16.692  -->  00:09:21.625
If a process is automated, several processes
can take place simultaneously.

133

00:09:21.625  -->  00:09:24.198
This is divided attention.

134

00:09:24.198  -->  00:09:28.946
A great example of every day is driving and
talking at the same time.

135

00:09:28.946  -->  00:09:33.819
We can only pay attention to one action at
a time, so the driver stops talking and focuses

136

00:09:33.819  -->  00:09:37.111
on driving if something happens on the road
in front of the driver.

137

00:09:37.111  -->  00:09:42.720
At this point, attention becomes focused,
meaning attention is limited to one object,

138

00:09:42.720  -->  00:09:45.678
action, or stimuli.

139

00:09:45.678  -->  00:09:51.139
Focused attention is the brain's ability to
focus its attention on a target stimulus for

140

00:09:51.139  -->  00:09:53.649
a period of time.

141

00:09:53.649  -->  00:09:58.992
Sustained attention is when we keep our attention
on one subject for a long time, even if we

142

00:09:58.992  -->  00:10:01.840
have to repeat the given action or activity.

143

00:10:01.840  -->  00:10:07.389
This is what we think of when we talk about
focus and concentration. Deep attention that

144

00:10:07.389  -->  00:10:12.615
allows you to absorb and process information
or perform a task that takes longer.

145

00:10:13.600  -->  00:10:18.449
Now that you know the different types of attention,
how can you use them?

146

00:10:18.449  -->  00:10:23.434
Let's look at some key tactics you can use
to design better for your users' attention.

147

00:10:23.880  -->  00:10:27.058
Movement. This is the highest part of your visual system.

148

00:10:27.058  -->  00:10:30.139
So when something moves, 
your attention is drawn to it.

149

00:10:30.139  -->  00:10:34.990
But when everything is in motion, the stationary
item gets the attention.

150

00:10:34.990  -->  00:10:36.612
Sound.

151

00:10:36.612  -->  00:10:41.929
Audible alerts can be one of the most annoying
things on the web, but it does grab your attention.

152

00:10:41.929  -->  00:10:45.578
When used more elegantly, it can work well.

153

00:10:45.578  -->  00:10:47.413
Progress and interruptions.

154

00:10:47.413  -->  00:10:50.981
If something doesn't match what we expect,
we notice.

155

00:10:50.981  -->  00:10:52.586
Big texts.

156

00:10:52.586  -->  00:10:58.945
This usually indicates the main information
in the design, so our eyes tend to go there first.

157

00:10:58.945  -->  00:11:00.866
Contrast and color.

158

00:11:00.866  -->  00:11:05.360
This allows parts of your design to jump out
of your peripheral vision.

159

00:11:05.360  -->  00:11:08.839
Users will notice those parts without looking
directly at them.

160

00:11:08.839  -->  00:11:12.000
In our lesson on visual design, 
Iâ€™ll tell you more about this.

161

00:11:16.743  -->  00:11:19.899
The next topic is about decision making.

162

00:11:19.899  -->  00:11:24.457
How people make a decision 
depends a lot on the choices they have.

163

00:11:24.457  -->  00:11:26.249
Comparisons.

164

00:11:26.249  -->  00:11:29.339
Users choose things based on comparing their
options.

165

00:11:29.339  -->  00:11:34.089
That's why you need to make comparisons that
make your preferred options look better.

166

00:11:34.089  -->  00:11:38.480
The Von Restorff effect, also known as the
isolation effect, predicts that when several

167

00:11:38.480  -->  00:11:41.860
similar objects are present, 
the one that differs from the rest

168

00:11:41.860  -->  00:11:44.540
is most likely to be remembered.

169

00:11:44.540  -->  00:11:49.899
For example, you can indicate which option
is the "best value" or the "most popular".

170

00:11:49.899  -->  00:11:55.762
Or the central stage effect: People tend to
choose the middle option in a series of items.

171

00:11:56.307  -->  00:12:02.277
Another popular method is the decoy effect,
by creating a new option that is easy to ignore.

172

00:12:02.277  -->  00:12:04.309
Take a look at these options and prices.

173

00:12:04.309  -->  00:12:06.810
Which one do you prefer?

174

00:12:06.810  -->  00:12:09.809
And which one do you prefer now?

175

00:12:09.809  -->  00:12:14.180
When choosing between two alternatives, the
addition of a third, less attractive option

176

00:12:14.180  -->  00:12:20.339
the decoy, can influence our perception of
the original two choices.

177

00:12:20.339  -->  00:12:25.407
Most people will only consider the choices
presented to them, even if there are other options.

178

00:12:25.407  -->  00:12:30.000
Whether you're designing shipping options,
subscription features, or survey questions,

179

00:12:30.000  -->  00:12:32.079
this matters.

180

00:12:32.079  -->  00:12:35.970
Each choice should bring the user closer to
their goal, and you can design the choices

181

00:12:35.970  -->  00:12:38.788
to be right for your goals in the process.

182

00:12:43.635  -->  00:12:48.441
Motivations are one of the most powerful 
psychological elements in UX.

183

00:12:48.441  -->  00:12:50.550
Motivations are built-in needs.

184

00:12:50.550  -->  00:12:52.290
Things we want.

185

00:12:52.290  -->  00:12:57.161
Some are physical, you need them to survive,
and some only exist in your mind.

186

00:12:57.161  -->  00:12:58.809
Motivations are relative.

187

00:12:58.809  -->  00:13:02.589
That means it's not about how much you get,
it's about how much more you get compared

188

00:13:02.589  -->  00:13:05.749
to what you have or what other people have.

189

00:13:05.749  -->  00:13:10.149
Motivation increases as users get closer to
their goal.

190

00:13:10.149  -->  00:13:15.299
The shorter the distance to the goal, the
more motivated people are to reach it.

191

00:13:15.299  -->  00:13:17.800
People are even more motivated when the end
is in sight.

192

00:13:17.800  -->  00:13:20.259
We call this the goal-gradient effect.

193

00:13:20.259  -->  00:13:27.240
Interestingly, even artificial or estimated
progress indicators can help motivate users.

194

00:13:27.240  -->  00:13:31.579
That's why it's critical that your experience
provides a clear indication of progress to

195

00:13:31.579  -->  00:13:35.389
provide this feedback to your users.

196

00:13:35.389  -->  00:13:39.429
One of the best examples to illustrate this
is a loyalty card.

197

00:13:39.429  -->  00:13:43.410
Let's say you get a frequent-buyer card at
your local coffee shop.

198

00:13:43.410  -->  00:13:46.901
Every time you buy a cup of coffee, you get
a stamp on your card.

199

00:13:46.901  -->  00:13:49.511
When the card is full, you get a free cup
of coffee.

200

00:13:49.511  -->  00:13:51.810
Here are two different scenarios:

201

00:13:51.810  -->  00:13:57.589
Card A has 10 spaces for the stamps, and when
you get the card, all spaces are empty.

202

00:13:57.589  -->  00:14:02.449
Card B card has 12 spaces for the stamps.
When you get the card, the first two spaces

203

00:14:02.449  -->  00:14:04.249
are already stamped.

204

00:14:04.249  -->  00:14:07.649
The question is which card is filled first,
A or B?

205

00:14:07.649  -->  00:14:12.980
After all, in both scenarios, you have to
buy 10 cups of coffee to get the free coffee.

206

00:14:12.980  -->  00:14:15.309
Does it matter which card you use?

207

00:14:15.309  -->  00:14:16.975
The answer is apparently yes.

208

00:14:16.975  -->  00:14:22.239
You fill the card faster with card B than
you do with card A. And the reason is called

209

00:14:22.239  -->  00:14:24.689
the goal gradient effect.

210

00:14:24.689  -->  00:14:30.339
The goal gradient effect was first studied
in 1934 by Clark Hull with rats.

211

00:14:30.339  -->  00:14:34.980
He found that rats that ran a maze to get
food at the end would run faster as they got

212

00:14:34.980  -->  00:14:36.899
to the end of the maze.

213

00:14:36.899  -->  00:14:41.139
The goal-gradient effect says that you will
speed up your behavior the closer you get

214

00:14:41.139  -->  00:14:43.019
to your goal.

215

00:14:43.019  -->  00:14:48.399
The coffee reward card scenarios I describe
above were part of a study by Ran Kivetz to

216

00:14:48.399  -->  00:14:53.129
see if humans would act as the rats did in
the original 1934 study.

217

00:14:53.129  -->  00:14:55.492
And the answer is yes, they do.

218

00:14:59.639  -->  00:15:03.773
The last topic I want to discuss in this lesson
is persuasion.

219

00:15:03.773  -->  00:15:09.920
Motivation is distinguished from persuasion
in that it includes force, stimulus, or influence

220

00:15:09.920  -->  00:15:12.000
to bring about change.

221

00:15:12.000  -->  00:15:15.524
Forcing users to do things is usually a 
bad idea.

222

00:15:15.524  -->  00:15:17.269
People don't like to be forced.

223

00:15:17.269  -->  00:15:20.989
Instead, we need to convince them to take
action.

224

00:15:20.989  -->  00:15:26.636
UX designers can use the principles of persuasion
to design more effective user experiences.

225

00:15:30.000  -->  00:15:33.519
People feel the need to give something back
when they receive something.

226

00:15:33.519  -->  00:15:35.550
To return a favor.

227

00:15:35.550  -->  00:15:41.215
Reciprocity is a social norm for responding
to one positive action with another positive actions

228

00:15:41.215  -->  00:15:43.577
rewarding kind actions.

229

00:15:43.577  -->  00:15:48.389
In the context of digital product experiences,
users are more likely to engage with your

230

00:15:48.389  -->  00:15:51.107
product if you provide them with value first.

231

00:15:51.107  -->  00:15:53.850
They are more likely to trust and answer you.

232

00:15:53.850  -->  00:15:58.189
That's even more important when you're about
to request something big from your users,

233

00:15:58.189  -->  00:16:00.000
like signup or payment.

234

00:16:01.110  -->  00:16:06.839
For example, many websites offer free downloads
of white papers but require users to provide

235

00:16:06.839  -->  00:16:13.009
some personal information such as their email address, 
before granting access to the download.

236

00:16:13.009  -->  00:16:17.319
Studies have shown that you can often get
a larger amount of valid user data by asking

237

00:16:17.319  -->  00:16:20.441
after a download rather than before.

238

00:16:21.789  -->  00:16:26.919
People often use other people's actions as
the basis for their own actions.

239

00:16:26.919  -->  00:16:30.999
Users adjust their behavior based on what
others are doing.

240

00:16:30.999  -->  00:16:35.649
Social proof is a handy shortcut that users
take to determine how to behave.

241

00:16:35.649  -->  00:16:40.559
When they are unsure or when the situation
is ambiguous, they are likely to view and

242

00:16:40.559  -->  00:16:43.639
accept the actions of others as correct.

243

00:16:43.639  -->  00:16:47.509
The greater the number of people, the more
appropriate the action seems.

244

00:16:47.509  -->  00:16:50.357
Also known as the bandwagon effect.

245

00:16:50.357  -->  00:16:55.419
Customer reviews and testimonials are one
of the most popular ways to exploit this aspect

246

00:16:55.419  -->  00:16:57.576
of persuasion.

247

00:16:58.923  -->  00:17:02.350
People tend to rely on and obey
those in authority.

248

00:17:02.350  -->  00:17:07.709
For example: To help sell products, tell your
potential customers about expert reviews,

249

00:17:07.709  -->  00:17:10.070
awards, and accreditations.

250

00:17:10.070  -->  00:17:15.848
To sell your people, you need to focus on
their qualifications, experience, and achievements.

251

00:17:17.351  -->  00:17:21.720
People are more likely to want something if
the supply is limited.

252

00:17:21.720  -->  00:17:27.529
While scarcity is commonly invoked to encourage
buying behavior, it can also be used to increase

253

00:17:27.529  -->  00:17:33.820
quality by encouraging people to be more judicious
with the actions they take.

254

00:17:33.820  -->  00:17:40.159
It can come in several forms: Limited-time,
Limited number, and Limited access.

255

00:17:40.159  -->  00:17:43.210
Never fake scarcity if you don't want reactance!

256

00:17:43.210  -->  00:17:47.550
Example: Make sure to emphasize limited supplies
or limited-time offers.

257

00:17:48.120  -->  00:17:52.000
With this we have come to the end of this
lesson and you should have a slightly better

258

00:17:52.000  -->  00:17:54.327
picture of how the human brain works.

259

00:17:54.327  -->  00:17:57.450
What have we learned in this lesson?

260

00:17:57.450  -->  00:18:00.610
To design for people, you also need to understand
people.

261

00:18:00.610  -->  00:18:04.942
The way people acquire, process, and store
information in their brains is what

262

00:18:04.942  -->  00:18:07.940
cognitive psychology focuses on.

263

00:18:07.940  -->  00:18:09.620
We started with memory.

264

00:18:09.620  -->  00:18:13.500
And that there is only a limited amount of
information that people can store in their

265

00:18:13.500  -->  00:18:15.294
working memory.

266

00:18:15.294  -->  00:18:19.520
So, if you want to optimize the user experience,
it is very effective to reduce

267

00:18:19.520  -->  00:18:22.080
the cognitive load on your user.

268

00:18:22.080  -->  00:18:23.389
For example, by

269

00:18:23.389  -->  00:18:28.889
Recognition rather than recall
Chunking helps content processing

270

00:18:28.889  -->  00:18:32.850
It's easier for users to recall the first
and last items of a list

271

00:18:32.850  -->  00:18:37.600
Limit the number of options.
But donâ€™t simply too much.

272

00:18:38.092  -->  00:18:40.560
Memory goes hand in hand with attention.

273

00:18:40.560  -->  00:18:42.554
The second topic we discussed.

274

00:18:42.554  -->  00:18:45.429
There are four types of attention:

275

00:18:45.429  -->  00:18:49.059
Selective attention
Divided attention

276

00:18:49.059  -->  00:18:53.470
Focused attention
Sustained attention

277

00:18:53.470  -->  00:18:55.480
The third topic was about decision making.

278

00:18:55.480  -->  00:19:02.080
I showed you that how people make a decision
depends a lot on the choices they have.

279

00:19:02.080  -->  00:19:06.820
We discussed motivations, one of the most
powerful psychological elements.

280

00:19:06.820  -->  00:19:10.850
The shorter the distance to the goal, the
more motivated people are to reach it.

281

00:19:10.850  -->  00:19:14.159
We call this the goal-gradient effect.

282

00:19:14.159  -->  00:19:16.780
The last topic was persuasion.

283

00:19:16.780  -->  00:19:22.269
Motivation is distinguished from persuasion
in that it includes force, stimulus, or influence

284

00:19:22.269  -->  00:19:24.610
to bring about change.

285

00:19:24.610  -->  00:19:26.419
Some examples of persuasion are

286

00:19:26.419  -->  00:19:29.399
Reciprocity
Social proof

287

00:19:29.399  -->  00:19:31.982
Authority
Scarcity

288

00:19:32.889  -->  00:19:37.210
In the next lesson, I'll tell you more about
one of the most fundamental components of UX

289

00:19:37.210  -->  00:19:39.240
Information Architecture.
