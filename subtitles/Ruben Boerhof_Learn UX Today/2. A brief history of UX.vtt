00:00:07.487  -->  00:00:09.633
Hi! Welcome back.

2

00:00:09.633  -->  00:00:15.078
Before we delve deeper into the world of UX,
it is good to know how this field came to be.

3

00:00:15.078  -->  00:00:19.712
Don Norman, the godfather of UX, 
was the first to use the term in his book: 

4

00:00:19.712  -->  00:00:22.689
The Design of Everyday Things.

5

00:00:22.689  -->  00:00:27.880
He coined the term because he found the terms
human interface and usability too restrictive.

6

00:00:27.880  -->  00:00:33.619
He wanted to cover all aspects of a human's
experience with a system.

7

00:00:33.744  -->  00:00:38.219
When you think of UX, you associate it with
apps or websites.

8

00:00:38.219  -->  00:00:40.160
But it is not a modern concept.

9

00:00:40.160  -->  00:00:43.129
And even Norman wasn't the first.

10

00:00:43.129  -->  00:00:47.089
Putting people first was a thing long before
the internet.

11

00:00:47.089  -->  00:00:51.098
Join me in a brief history of UX to understand
how this discipline came to be.

12

00:00:51.569  -->  00:00:58.420
The most basic principles of UX can be traced
back to ancient Chinese and Greek civilizations.

13

00:00:58.420  -->  00:01:02.364
They designed their tools and workplaces based
on how people interact with them.

14

00:01:02.364  -->  00:01:08.540
And also Leonardo da Vinci explored the relationship
between technology and user experience.

15

00:01:08.540  -->  00:01:14.759
Yet it was not until the early 1900s that
UX began to form into a separate discipline.

16

00:01:14.759  -->  00:01:20.030
In the early 20th century, during the Industrial
Revolution, American engineer Frederick Winslow

17

00:01:20.030  -->  00:01:23.030
Taylor initiated a movement called Taylorism.

18

00:01:23.721  -->  00:01:29.100
This focused on how employees use their tools
to perform tasks efficiently.

19

00:01:29.100  -->  00:01:34.103
While Taylorism has been widely criticized
for the way it reduced people to cogs in a machine

20

00:01:34.103  -->  00:01:37.810
Taylor's focus on optimizing the
relationship between people and their tools

21

00:01:37.810  -->  00:01:41.049
is reflected in some key UX principles.

22

00:01:41.818  -->  00:01:47.530
The next step on the timeline takes us to
the 1940s, where Toyota developed a human-centric

23

00:01:47.530  -->  00:01:49.810
manufacturing system.

24

00:01:49.810  -->  00:01:54.310
It was based on respect for people and a lot
of attention was paid to creating an optimal

25

00:01:54.310  -->  00:01:56.460
working environment.

26

00:01:56.460  -->  00:02:00.307
Human input was seen as 
crucial and actively encouraged.

27

00:02:00.307  -->  00:02:04.689
For example, Toyota factory workers could
stop the assembly line if they had feedback

28

00:02:04.689  -->  00:02:07.390
or suggestions to improve the process.

29

00:02:07.390  -->  00:02:12.220
This approach involves humans in the improvement
process for the first time and reduces the

30

00:02:12.220  -->  00:02:14.153
human factor lost in Taylorism.

31

00:02:15.000  -->  00:02:20.043
It was an important step in UX history as
it focused on putting the user first.

32

00:02:20.640  -->  00:02:26.140
Another key figure in the history of UX design
is industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss.

33

00:02:26.140  -->  00:02:30.110
In 1955 he wrote the classic text 
'Designing for People'.

34

00:02:30.110  -->  00:02:36.070
In which he focused on people's experiences,
good or bad, with the design of a product.

35

00:02:36.070  -->  00:02:40.720
One of the many helpful points in his book
is how you can design for a variety of people

36

00:02:40.720  -->  00:02:42.768
to use a service or product.

37

00:02:42.925  -->  00:02:48.010
The book is often cited as a pivotal point
in understanding between people, product,

38

00:02:48.010  -->  00:02:50.010
and design.

39

00:02:50.010  -->  00:02:53.162
This quote from the book 
explains UX in a nutshell:

40

00:02:53.649  -->  00:02:58.470
“When the point of contact between the product
and the people becomes a point of friction,

41

00:02:58.470  -->  00:03:01.053
then the industrial designer has failed.

42

00:03:01.053  -->  00:03:06.930
On the other hand, if people are made safer,
more comfortable, more eager to purchase,

43

00:03:06.930  -->  00:03:12.010
more efficient - or just plain happier - by
contact with the product, then the designer

44

00:03:12.010  -->  00:03:13.010
has succeeded.”

45

00:03:15.821  -->  00:03:20.110
Walt Disney may have even been one of the
first UX Designers.

46

00:03:20.110  -->  00:03:24.060
He had a passion for bringing experiences
for families to share.

47

00:03:24.060  -->  00:03:27.712
Culminating in the construction of 
Disneyland in 1955.

48

00:03:27.712  -->  00:03:34.304
Disney was obsessed with creating magical,
immersive, near-perfect user experiences.

49

00:03:34.304  -->  00:03:39.430
Walt Disney's guiding principles for his team
of engineers were all about knowing your audience,

50

00:03:39.430  -->  00:03:45.340
wearing your guest's shoes, telling stories,
communicating with color, shape, form, texture,

51

00:03:45.340  -->  00:03:46.800
and so on.

52

00:03:46.800  -->  00:03:49.735
Pretty much the job description of a UX designer.

53

00:03:50.049  -->  00:03:55.360
In the 1970s, Xerox's research department gave
form and function to the design of computers

54

00:03:55.360  -->  00:03:56.897
for human use.

55

00:03:57.242  -->  00:04:01.334
Before that, the only people who dealt with
computers were IT professionals.

56

00:04:01.334  -->  00:04:05.635
This changed with the first personal computer
released in the late 1970s.

57

00:04:05.635  -->  00:04:10.180
When this tool became accessible to everyone,
psychologists and engineers teamed up to focus

58

00:04:10.180  -->  00:04:12.370
on the user experience.

59

00:04:12.370  -->  00:04:18.040
This resulted in some groundbreaking technological
innovations that we still use today.

60

00:04:18.040  -->  00:04:22.310
The graphical user interface that the person
uses to interact with the personal computer

61

00:04:22.310  -->  00:04:25.000
was developed to make it user-friendly.

62

00:04:25.000  -->  00:04:29.669
Much like the computer mouse for easily navigating
a personal computer.

63

00:04:29.669  -->  00:04:33.199
It set the tone for personal computing as
we know it today.

64

00:04:34.770  -->  00:04:39.849
Human-computer interaction was founded
in the early 1980s as a discipline that focused

65

00:04:39.849  -->  00:04:42.907
on computer science and human factors engineering.

66

00:04:43.299  -->  00:04:49.800
In recent decades, specialisms such as ergonomics,
cognitive psychology, accessibility, and design

67

00:04:49.800  -->  00:04:52.392
of human interfaces have been added.

68

00:04:53.177  -->  00:04:58.100
Shortly after the graphical user interface
was implemented, computer screens became cluttered

69

00:04:58.100  -->  00:05:02.830
with hundreds of icons that made it difficult
to find files, and the first extension of

70

00:05:02.830  -->  00:05:07.520
human-computer interaction, the search function,
was introduced to make it easy for users to

71

00:05:07.520  -->  00:05:09.519
find what they were looking for.

72

00:05:10.963  -->  00:05:17.770
On January 24, 1984, the first Apple Macintosh
was released by Steve Jobs.

73

00:05:17.770  -->  00:05:22.145
The company's first mass-market personal computer
with a graphical user interface,

74

00:05:22.145  -->  00:05:23.919
built-in display, and mouse.

75

00:05:24.374  -->  00:05:28.400
Since then, Apple has been a true innovator
of the user experience.

76

00:05:28.400  -->  00:05:32.268
The tech giant even had a hand in coining
the term User Experience.

77

00:05:34.263  -->  00:05:39.659
In the 1990s, ‘User Experience’ was widespread
but lacked an official label.

78

00:05:39.659  -->  00:05:44.599
When Donald Norman joined Apple in the early
1990s, he needed a term that would encompass

79

00:05:44.599  -->  00:05:47.150
everything UX is.

80

00:05:47.150  -->  00:05:49.849
He coined the term user experience 
as we know it today.

81

00:05:49.849  -->  00:05:54.430
As he explains, “I invented the term because
I thought Human Interface and usability were

82

00:05:54.430  -->  00:05:55.430
too narrow.

83

00:05:55.430  -->  00:06:00.349
I wanted to cover all aspects of the person’s
experience with a system, including industrial

84

00:06:00.349  -->  00:06:06.580
design, graphics, the interface, the physical
interaction, and the manual.”

85

00:06:06.580  -->  00:06:11.180
Norman published "The Design of Everyday Things",
which remains an important reference for UX

86

00:06:11.180  -->  00:06:13.930
design to this day.

87

00:06:13.930  -->  00:06:18.992
In this book, he promotes usability and user
experience rather than the aesthetics of a product.

88

00:06:19.580  -->  00:06:23.340
Norman's focus on improving usability goes
hand in hand with the person's perception

89

00:06:23.340  -->  00:06:25.156
of the product.

90

00:06:25.156  -->  00:06:30.430
Human-related sciences, technical advancements,
and design-oriented disciplines all contribute

91

00:06:30.430  -->  00:06:35.210
to the enhanced interaction between a person
and the technology they use.

92

00:06:35.210  -->  00:06:39.120
With the introduction of various devices,
the interaction between humans and computers

93

00:06:39.120  -->  00:06:40.837
expanded.

94

00:06:40.837  -->  00:06:44.789
People started using laptops and mobile phones
that became available.

95

00:06:44.789  -->  00:06:49.861
From gradual device expansion, technology
found its way into the everyday life of the user.

96

00:06:50.123  -->  00:06:53.201
Such as in their cars and home appliances.

97

00:06:53.201  -->  00:06:58.479
And it will continue to evolve and become
more integrated into our daily lives and society.

98

00:06:59.076  -->  00:07:04.159
It is a rapidly growing field as the most
important value factor in the tech industry

99

00:07:04.159  -->  00:07:06.821
will be the user experience.

100

00:07:06.821  -->  00:07:11.490
Please join me in the next lesson where we'll look
at all the factors that influence this experience.
