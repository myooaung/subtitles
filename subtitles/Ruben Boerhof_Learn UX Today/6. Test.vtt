00:00:06.720  -->  00:00:09.200
Testing is the fifth stage in&nbsp;
the Design Thinking process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

2

00:00:09.840  -->  00:00:13.760
In this lesson, you'll learn everything you&nbsp;
need to know about testing your prototypes&nbsp;&nbsp;

3

00:00:13.760  -->  00:00:15.605
and collecting real user feedback.

4

00:00:15.605  -->  00:00:17.200
While the Design Thinking process

5

00:00:17.200  -->  00:00:21.680
is a fluid, iterative, and flexible&nbsp;
process, the ideal endpoint is when&nbsp;&nbsp;

6

00:00:21.680  -->  00:00:27.527
the product or service meets the three tests&nbsp;
of desirability, feasibility, and viability.&nbsp;

7

00:00:27.840  -->  00:00:34.000
Testing is simply the process of testing your&nbsp;
prototype on real users. During the test phase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

8

00:00:34.000  -->  00:00:39.158
you will see how your target users interact with&nbsp;
your prototype and collect valuable feedback.

9

00:00:39.520  -->  00:00:43.680
However, user testing can and should&nbsp;
be done throughout the design process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

10

00:00:43.680  -->  00:00:47.840
Be sure to test early and often.&nbsp;
In the early stages of the process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

11

00:00:47.840  -->  00:00:52.960
testing will help you get feedback on your&nbsp;
initial ideas. Towards the end of the process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

12

00:00:52.960  -->  00:00:58.000
you test the overall usability of the product with&nbsp;
high-fidelity, fully-featured digital prototypes&nbsp;&nbsp;

13

00:00:58.000  -->  00:01:04.240
that look and behave just like the real thing.
Testing your ideas early and often can help you&nbsp;&nbsp;

14

00:01:04.240  -->  00:01:12.000
identify design flaws and usability issues before&nbsp;
launching the product. This saves time and money.

15

00:01:12.000  -->  00:01:17.520
User testing also reveals unexpected insights.&nbsp;
No matter how thorough your initial user research&nbsp;&nbsp;

16

00:01:17.520  -->  00:01:22.720
was, or how confident you are that you've designed&nbsp;
the optimal solution to your user's problem. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

17

00:01:22.720  -->  00:01:25.520
are always new insights to discover.
For instance

18

00:01:25.520  -->  00:01:29.920
If users experience problems, the&nbsp;
design team should review their list&nbsp;&nbsp;

19

00:01:29.920  -->  00:01:35.136
of possible solutions and strategies to&nbsp;
find new ways to solve the same problems.

20

00:01:35.520  -->  00:01:39.280
For example, your user observations&nbsp;
in tests can provide crucial insights&nbsp;&nbsp;

21

00:01:39.280  -->  00:01:42.174
that can change the way you formulate the problem.

22

00:01:42.480  -->  00:01:46.160
User feedback is therefore priceless.&nbsp;
Without understanding what users need,&nbsp;&nbsp;

23

00:01:46.160  -->  00:01:51.760
the iterative process will fail. That's why you&nbsp;
need to use real people for testing purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;

24

00:01:51.760  -->  00:01:57.156
and analyze results to determine where your&nbsp;
prototype succeeds and where it needs improvement.

25

00:02:02.400  -->  00:02:05.680
There are several methods you can&nbsp;
use to test your prototypes. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

26

00:02:05.680  -->  00:02:11.040
this can be performed in person or remotely:
During personal testing, you will be in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

27

00:02:11.040  -->  00:02:16.400
same room as the user while they are testing your&nbsp;
prototype. Sometimes even in the user's natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

28

00:02:16.400  -->  00:02:22.080
environment. This has the great advantage that you&nbsp;
can also observe the user directly, such as facial&nbsp;&nbsp;

29

00:02:22.080  -->  00:02:28.035
expressions, body language and any verbal comments&nbsp;
the user makes while interacting with the product.

30

00:02:28.720  -->  00:02:32.800
Remote user testing offers a cheaper,&nbsp;
more convenient alternative, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

31

00:02:32.800  -->  00:02:37.093
has the disadvantage that you have little&nbsp;
control over the user's test environment.

32

00:02:37.520  -->  00:02:40.880
Remote user testing can be&nbsp;
done moderated or unmoderated.

33

00:02:42.320  -->  00:02:46.880
Live remote testing allows you to observe&nbsp;
your users, for example via a video call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

34

00:02:47.520  -->  00:02:50.800
You can use a screen recording&nbsp;
app to capture the test, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

35

00:02:50.800  -->  00:02:54.800
certain programs will also track and mark where&nbsp;
the user clicks in your digital prototype.

36

00:02:56.080  -->  00:03:01.760
Unmoderated tests can be run through user testing&nbsp;
platforms such as UserZoom and usertesting.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

37

00:03:02.640  -->  00:03:07.680
When you're short on time, such tools make it easy&nbsp;
to run user tests quickly and with minimal effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;

38

00:03:08.560  -->  00:03:14.118
However, you will not be given the opportunity&nbsp;
to observe the users or ask them questions.

39

00:03:15.040  -->  00:03:19.920
Whether you choose to conduct in-person or&nbsp;
third-party user testing all depends on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

40

00:03:19.920  -->  00:03:26.400
budget, time constraints, and the prototype&nbsp;
you are testing. Paper prototypes are best&nbsp;&nbsp;

41

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:30.885
tested in person, while digital prototypes&nbsp;
can be tested both remotely and in person.

42

00:03:31.600  -->  00:03:34.701
So what methods can you use&nbsp;
to test your prototypes?&nbsp;

43

00:03:37.120  -->  00:03:40.880
Concept testing is done in the very&nbsp;
early stages of the design process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

44

00:03:41.600  -->  00:03:46.160
You want to test your concepts and&nbsp;
ideas before you actually design them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

45

00:03:46.160  -->  00:03:50.720
Low-fidelity prototypes can be used to&nbsp;
communicate your idea to your intended users.&nbsp;&nbsp;

46

00:03:51.680  -->  00:03:55.120
Then you interview your users to find&nbsp;
out what they think of the concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;

47

00:03:55.120  -->  00:04:01.136
Is it a product or feature they want to use? Does&nbsp;
it have the potential to solve the user's problem?&nbsp;

48

00:04:02.400  -->  00:04:06.160
A/B testing is used to compare two&nbsp;
different versions of a design.&nbsp;&nbsp;

49

00:04:07.040  -->  00:04:10.480
This method can be used at any&nbsp;
stage of the design process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

50

00:04:10.480  -->  00:04:16.080
be it paper prototypes or fully clickable&nbsp;
digital prototypes. In A/B testing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

51

00:04:16.080  -->  00:04:22.000
you create two different prototypes and test each&nbsp;
version on a different set of users. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

52

00:04:22.000  -->  00:04:27.440
you can test two different layouts or a different&nbsp;
one for a particular CTA button on a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

53

00:04:27.440  -->  00:04:33.556
screen. It is important to A/B test only one&nbsp;
variable at a time so as not to skew the results.&nbsp;

54

00:04:35.120  -->  00:04:39.040
Usability testing is a critical user&nbsp;
testing method that must be used&nbsp;&nbsp;

55

00:04:39.040  -->  00:04:44.480
repeatedly throughout the design process.&nbsp;
It shows how easy your design is to use.&nbsp;&nbsp;

56

00:04:45.520  -->  00:04:51.440
Usability testing is usually an observational&nbsp;
exercise: you ask your users to perform certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

57

00:04:51.440  -->  00:04:57.520
tasks and observe them as they do it . During the&nbsp;
test you see which aspects of the design caused&nbsp;&nbsp;

58

00:04:57.520  -->  00:05:02.240
problems for the user and which aspects&nbsp;
seem to be user-friendly. By doing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

59

00:05:02.240  -->  00:05:07.499
you identify usability issues that you want to&nbsp;
solve in the next iteration of your prototype.&nbsp;

60

00:05:08.720  -->  00:05:13.760
When designing an app or website, you want to&nbsp;
make sure that the user takes the intended action&nbsp;&nbsp;

61

00:05:13.760  -->  00:05:19.760
when they land on a particular page or screen.&nbsp;
First-click tests show you what your users' first&nbsp;&nbsp;

62

00:05:19.760  -->  00:05:24.320
steps are when they encounter an interface;&nbsp;
in other words, what do they click on first?&nbsp;&nbsp;

63

00:05:25.200  -->  00:05:30.160
This helps you determine which images and&nbsp;
content to prioritize, where to place buttons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

64

00:05:30.160  -->  00:05:34.720
icons, and menu items, as well as the type&nbsp;
of language to use for buttons and labels.&nbsp;&nbsp;

65

00:05:35.920  -->  00:05:40.684
First-click testing can be performed with&nbsp;
both low- and high-fidelity prototypes.&nbsp;

66

00:05:41.200  -->  00:05:44.960
Once you've figured out the information&nbsp;
architecture of your digital product,&nbsp;&nbsp;

67

00:05:44.960  -->  00:05:50.320
you can use tree testing to see how easy&nbsp;
it is to use. You give the user a "tree"&nbsp;&nbsp;

68

00:05:50.320  -->  00:05:55.360
of information - representative of how your&nbsp;
site menus would be laid out - and ask them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

69

00:05:55.360  -->  00:06:00.960
find specific items. If users are having trouble&nbsp;
finding certain information, you should rethink&nbsp;&nbsp;

70

00:06:00.960  -->  00:06:06.160
your information architecture. Our lesson&nbsp;
about IA in chapter 3 can help with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

71

00:06:07.280  -->  00:06:14.098
Tree testing is often conducted as an unmoderated&nbsp;
remote survey, but it can also be done in person.

72

00:06:14.960  -->  00:06:20.596
How do you conduct a user test? Start by&nbsp;
making a plan for your user testing session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

73

00:06:20.720  -->  00:06:25.840
It should include your objective, the testing&nbsp;
method, which users you will test for,&nbsp;&nbsp;

74

00:06:25.840  -->  00:06:30.801
how you will document findings, and a script&nbsp;
or discussion guide for asking questions.&nbsp;

75

00:06:31.680  -->  00:06:36.640
The very first thing you need to do is set&nbsp;
a clear goal. What do you want to learn from&nbsp;&nbsp;

76

00:06:36.640  -->  00:06:42.400
your user testing? What question do you hope to&nbsp;
answer? By setting a clear goal, you can build&nbsp;&nbsp;

77

00:06:42.400  -->  00:06:48.320
the right kind of prototype and choose the&nbsp;
most appropriate testing method for users.

78

00:06:48.320  -->  00:06:52.800
Choose your prototype: you know what you want&nbsp;
to test; now it's time to build your prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;

79

00:06:53.600  -->  00:06:57.840
If you're in the very early stages of testing&nbsp;
an idea, stick with low-fidelity prototypes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

80

00:06:58.720  -->  00:07:02.515
Once you've chosen a concept,&nbsp;
test it with a high-fidelity one.

81

00:07:03.680  -->  00:07:08.640
Another critical aspect of user testing is&nbsp;
recruiting the right participants. You want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

82

00:07:08.640  -->  00:07:16.160
test on users who represent your target audience,&nbsp;
so spend some time identifying some key criteria.

83

00:07:16.160  -->  00:07:20.320
Make sure to document your findings&nbsp;
during each user test. You need a thorough&nbsp;&nbsp;

84

00:07:20.320  -->  00:07:25.739
record of each test to analyze your observations&nbsp;
and compare the results of each session.

85

00:07:26.560  -->  00:07:30.720
Consult your plan and make sure you have&nbsp;
everything you need to run the tests:&nbsp;&nbsp;

86

00:07:30.720  -->  00:07:34.640
screen recording software if you're running&nbsp;
tests remotely, pens and paper to take&nbsp;&nbsp;

87

00:07:34.640  -->  00:07:39.280
notes and of course your prototype.
Now that you have your test plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

88

00:07:39.280  -->  00:07:44.160
there are a few things to keep&nbsp;
in mind when doing user testing.

89

00:07:44.160  -->  00:07:50.400
Remember that you are testing the prototype, not&nbsp;
the user. Try to resist the urge to correct them&nbsp;&nbsp;

90

00:07:50.400  -->  00:07:56.881
when they misinterpret how it should be used.&nbsp;
User errors are valuable learning opportunities.

91

00:07:57.440  -->  00:08:03.216
Show, don't tell: let your users experience&nbsp;
the prototype and observe their reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

92

00:08:03.520  -->  00:08:09.143
Avoid over-explaining how your prototype works,&nbsp;
or how it should solve your user's problems.

93

00:08:09.840  -->  00:08:13.920
When users explore and use the prototype,&nbsp;
ask them to tell you what they think.&nbsp;&nbsp;

94

00:08:14.480  -->  00:08:18.665
Always ask questions, even if you&nbsp;
think you know what the user means.

95

00:08:19.360  -->  00:08:24.000
When collecting feedback, be careful not to&nbsp;
disrupt the user's interaction with the prototype.&nbsp;&nbsp;

96

00:08:24.720  -->  00:08:30.488
Try to mimic as much as possible the scenario in&nbsp;
which your users are likely to use the product.

97

00:08:30.960  -->  00:08:34.800
Let your users compare alternatives.&nbsp;
Users often find it easier to explain&nbsp;&nbsp;

98

00:08:34.800  -->  00:08:38.799
what they like and dislike about&nbsp;
prototypes when they can compare.

99

00:08:39.188  -->  00:08:44.800
After a round of user testing, it's time to&nbsp;
analyze the results. You look for patterns&nbsp;&nbsp;

100

00:08:44.800  -->  00:08:49.680
in what you have observed and the feedback&nbsp;
you have received. Your tests will either&nbsp;&nbsp;

101

00:08:49.680  -->  00:08:54.560
confirm that something is working properly, or&nbsp;
will reveal issues that need to be resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;

102

00:08:55.680  -->  00:09:00.751
Either way, the insights you gain from user&nbsp;
testing will inform you about your next steps.&nbsp;

103

00:09:00.880  -->  00:09:04.720
Once your test users have confirmed&nbsp;
that your information architecture is&nbsp;&nbsp;

104

00:09:04.720  -->  00:09:08.534
extremely user-friendly, you're&nbsp;
ready to fine-tune the design.

105

00:09:09.120  -->  00:09:14.560
Then it's time to implement the validated design.&nbsp;
UI and interaction designers further develop the&nbsp;&nbsp;

106

00:09:14.560  -->  00:09:20.400
design and engineers ensure that the app or site&nbsp;
is built. Some of this work may begin as early&nbsp;&nbsp;

107

00:09:20.400  -->  00:09:25.040
as the design stage, but generally the bulk of&nbsp;
it takes place during the implementation stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

108

00:09:26.080  -->  00:09:31.600
Depending on the company and product, many people&nbsp;
are involved: from copywriters, product owners,&nbsp;&nbsp;

109

00:09:31.600  -->  00:09:37.520
engineers to product marketing managers.
Finally, given the iterative nature of&nbsp;&nbsp;

110

00:09:37.520  -->  00:09:43.120
digital design, once a website or app is launched&nbsp;
to the public, continuous efforts must be made&nbsp;&nbsp;

111

00:09:43.120  -->  00:09:49.280
to maintain the quality of the experience. Is the&nbsp;
content still relevant, or should it be updated or&nbsp;&nbsp;

112

00:09:49.280  -->  00:09:54.880
discontinued? Has technology evolved, and if so,&nbsp;
are improvements needed in the user experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

113

00:09:54.880  -->  00:10:00.400
you've created? The best user experiences are&nbsp;
those with content and features that are still&nbsp;&nbsp;

114

00:10:00.400  -->  00:10:05.711
relevant and new, and it's the maintenance phase&nbsp;
that ensures how often the experience is updated.&nbsp;

115

00:10:06.160  -->  00:10:10.960
And that doesn't mean the work is done.&nbsp;
Design Thinking is all about iteration&nbsp;&nbsp;

116

00:10:10.960  -->  00:10:14.720
until a product is ready for launch,&nbsp;
but it often doesn't stop there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

117

00:10:15.520  -->  00:10:19.520
Even once the product is on the market, there&nbsp;
is continuous testing to make improvements.

118

00:10:20.640  -->  00:10:22.640
This brings us to the end of the design&nbsp;&nbsp;

119

00:10:22.640  -->  00:10:25.520
process chapter. Let's summarize&nbsp;
what we learned in this chapter.&nbsp;

120

00:10:26.960  -->  00:10:33.520
Testing is simply the process of evaluating your&nbsp;
prototype with real users. During the test phase,&nbsp;&nbsp;

121

00:10:33.520  -->  00:10:38.160
you will see how your target users interact with&nbsp;
your prototype and collect valuable feedback.

122

00:10:39.360  -->  00:10:44.320
User testing should be done throughout the&nbsp;
design process. Be sure to test early and often.

123

00:10:45.120  -->  00:10:47.440
This can help you identify design flaws and&nbsp;&nbsp;

124

00:10:47.440  -->  00:10:51.200
usability issues before launching&nbsp;
the product. Saving time and money.

125

00:10:52.720  -->  00:10:55.840
User testing also reveals unexpected insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;

126

00:10:55.840  -->  00:11:00.924
No matter how thorough your initial user research&nbsp;
was. There are always new insights to discover.

127

00:11:01.760  -->  00:11:06.480
Whether you choose to conduct in-person or&nbsp;
third-party user testing all depends on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

128

00:11:06.480  -->  00:11:12.640
budget, time constraints, and the prototype&nbsp;
you are testing. Paper prototypes are best&nbsp;&nbsp;

129

00:11:12.640  -->  00:11:17.120
tested in person, while digital prototypes&nbsp;
can be tested both remotely and in person.

130

00:11:18.240  -->  00:11:22.160
There are several methods you can use to&nbsp;
test your prototypes. Weâ€™ve discussed.

131

00:11:22.160  -->  00:11:24.560
Concept testing

00:11:30.880  -->  00:11:36.000
Finally I showed you how to conduct a user test.&nbsp;
Start by making a plan for your user testing&nbsp;&nbsp;

135

00:11:36.000  -->  00:11:41.280
session. It should include your objective,&nbsp;
the testing method, which users you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

136

00:11:41.280  -->  00:11:47.761
test for, how you will document findings, and a&nbsp;
script or discussion guide for asking questions.&nbsp;
