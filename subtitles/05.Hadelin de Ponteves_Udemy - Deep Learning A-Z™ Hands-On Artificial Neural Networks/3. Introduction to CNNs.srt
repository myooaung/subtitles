00:00:00,360  -->  00:00:02,870
Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial
2

2

00:00:02,870  -->  00:00:04,960
on Convolutional Neural Network.
3

3

00:00:04,960  -->  00:00:08,080
So again I have to say congratulations because you've built
4

4

00:00:08,080  -->  00:00:10,690
your first deep learning model in the previous section,
5

5

00:00:10,690  -->  00:00:12,450
an artificial neural network.
6

6

00:00:12,450  -->  00:00:15,120
And as you understood in the Intuition tutorials,
7

7

00:00:15,120  -->  00:00:17,670
a Convolutional Neural Network is just
8

8

00:00:17,670  -->  00:00:20,130
an artificial neural network on which you use
9

9

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:23,780
this convolution trick to add some Convolutional layers.
10

10

00:00:23,780  -->  00:00:25,950
And why do we use this convolutional trick?
11

11

00:00:25,950  -->  00:00:28,790
It's to preserve the facial structure in images
12

12

00:00:28,790  -->  00:00:31,970
and therefore to be able to classify some images.
13

13

00:00:31,970  -->  00:00:33,260
So you've got the point.
14

14

00:00:33,260  -->  00:00:34,990
Convolutional Neural Network are
15

15

00:00:34,990  -->  00:00:37,290
great deep learning models for computer vision,
16

16

00:00:37,290  -->  00:00:40,110
to classify some images, some photographs,
17

17

00:00:40,110  -->  00:00:42,670
or even some images and some videos.
18

18

00:00:42,670  -->  00:00:45,640
So in this section, we are not going to solve
19

19

00:00:45,640  -->  00:00:47,670
any business problem as we used to do
20

20

00:00:47,670  -->  00:00:50,510
in the previous sections, but we are simply going to
21

21

00:00:50,510  -->  00:00:54,070
solve an image classification problem where our goal
22

22

00:00:54,070  -->  00:00:56,590
will be to classify some images and tell for
23

23

00:00:56,590  -->  00:00:59,450
each image the class of the image.
24

24

00:00:59,450  -->  00:01:01,770
And so we're gonna work on a very simple
25

25

00:01:01,770  -->  00:01:03,560
image classification problem.
26

26

00:01:03,560  -->  00:01:06,280
We will have some images of cats and dogs
27

27

00:01:06,280  -->  00:01:10,410
and we will train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict
28

28

00:01:10,410  -->  00:01:14,090
if the image is a photo of a dog or of a cat.
29

29

00:01:14,090  -->  00:01:16,010
So right now some of you might be thinking
30

30

00:01:16,010  -->  00:01:17,800
that it's not very important to predict
31

31

00:01:17,800  -->  00:01:20,840
if an image is a photo of a cat or of a dog
32

32

00:01:20,840  -->  00:01:23,350
but the key thing to understand here is that
33

33

00:01:23,350  -->  00:01:25,710
we'll have a folder full of images.
34

34

00:01:25,710  -->  00:01:28,750
These images will be some images of cats and dogs
35

35

00:01:28,750  -->  00:01:32,290
but once we build our Convolutional Neural Network model
36

36

00:01:32,290  -->  00:01:34,420
you will simply need to change the images
37

37

00:01:34,420  -->  00:01:36,240
of cats and dogs in the folder
38

38

00:01:36,240  -->  00:01:39,010
and replace them by the images you want to work with.
39

39

00:01:39,010  -->  00:01:41,530
For example, if there are any doctors in this course
40

40

00:01:41,530  -->  00:01:44,450
well you will be able to replace these cats and dogs images
41

41

00:01:44,450  -->  00:01:47,910
by some medical images for which you have to predict
42

42

00:01:47,910  -->  00:01:49,550
the category it belongs to.
43

43

00:01:49,550  -->  00:01:52,430
So for example, if you are working with brain images
44

44

00:01:52,430  -->  00:01:54,900
and you have to predict if this brain image
45

45

00:01:54,900  -->  00:01:58,530
contains a tumor or not, well provided you know
46

46

00:01:58,530  -->  00:02:00,710
the answers of many observations
47

47

00:02:00,710  -->  00:02:03,560
like thousands of observations, then you will be able to
48

48

00:02:03,560  -->  00:02:06,490
train a Convolutional Neural Network to predict
49

49

00:02:06,490  -->  00:02:10,910
if some new brain image contains a tumor, yes or no.
50

50

00:02:10,910  -->  00:02:12,950
So, I'm not a doctor here so I hope
51

51

00:02:12,950  -->  00:02:14,980
I'm not telling you things that don't make sense,
52

52

00:02:14,980  -->  00:02:17,630
but I know that deep learning is used in medicine
53

53

00:02:17,630  -->  00:02:20,100
for medical imaging, and I also know they use
54

54

00:02:20,100  -->  00:02:23,530
Convolutional Neural Networks to accelerate cancer research
55

55

00:02:23,530  -->  00:02:26,100
as we can see in this article right here.
56

56

00:02:26,100  -->  00:02:27,650
So that's the point.
57

57

00:02:27,650  -->  00:02:29,720
We are working with very simple images.
58

58

00:02:29,720  -->  00:02:31,210
Images of cats and dogs.
59

59

00:02:31,210  -->  00:02:32,740
But then you will be able to replace them
60

60

00:02:32,740  -->  00:02:35,670
by whatever images you want if you need to predict
61

61

00:02:35,670  -->  00:02:38,700
some categories for your images.
62

62

00:02:38,700  -->  00:02:40,750
Okay so right now what we're going to do is
63

63

00:02:40,750  -->  00:02:43,162
prepare our work environment for our
64

64

00:02:43,162  -->  00:02:45,060
Convolutional Neural Network.
65

65

00:02:45,060  -->  00:02:47,690
Because you're going to see that things are going to change
66

66

00:02:47,690  -->  00:02:50,790
compared to what we used to work with earlier.
67

67

00:02:50,790  -->  00:02:53,280
Because remember, so far in this course,
68

68

00:02:53,280  -->  00:02:56,440
the data set we used to work with were tables.
69

69

00:02:56,440  -->  00:02:59,020
Tables containing some independent variables
70

70

00:02:59,020  -->  00:03:00,810
and one dependent variable.
71

71

00:03:00,810  -->  00:03:03,218
And now we have some images, so we need to do some
72

72

00:03:03,218  -->  00:03:07,140
image pre-processing to be able to input these images
73

73

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:09,630
in our Convolutional Neural Network.
74

74

00:03:09,630  -->  00:03:11,240
So how can we do that?
75

75

00:03:11,240  -->  00:03:13,227
Well first, let's set the right folder
76

76

00:03:13,227  -->  00:03:14,890
in our working directory.
77

77

00:03:14,890  -->  00:03:17,110
So we need to go to file, explore,
78

78

00:03:17,110  -->  00:03:19,360
then we go to our Deep Learning A - Z folder.
79

79

00:03:19,360  -->  00:03:21,930
Right now it is on my desktop, like last time.
80

80

00:03:21,930  -->  00:03:23,500
So we double click on it.
81

81

00:03:23,500  -->  00:03:26,440
Right now we're still in Volume 1 - Supervised Deep Learning
82

82

00:03:26,440  -->  00:03:27,850
so we open it.
83

83

00:03:27,850  -->  00:03:29,130
And this time we are in
84

84

00:03:29,130  -->  00:03:31,630
Part 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks.
85

85

00:03:31,630  -->  00:03:34,810
So let's go inside and after the CNN Intuition lectures
86

86

00:03:34,810  -->  00:03:35,860
that you had with Kirill
87

87

00:03:35,860  -->  00:03:38,310
you are now ready to build the CNN
88

88

00:03:38,310  -->  00:03:40,350
and therefore we want to choose this folder here.
89

89

00:03:40,350  -->  00:03:43,210
Section 8 - Building the CNN, and here we go
90

90

00:03:43,210  -->  00:03:45,560
that's the folder we want to set as working directory.
91

91

00:03:45,560  -->  00:03:47,910
Make sure that you have the data set folder
92

92

00:03:47,910  -->  00:03:50,820
and I will explain what it is in the next tutorial.
93

93

00:03:50,820  -->  00:03:53,430
Okay now to set this folder as working directory
94

94

00:03:53,430  -->  00:03:55,590
we need to click on the tool button here
95

95

00:03:55,590  -->  00:03:59,340
and then we click on set console working directory.
96

96

00:03:59,340  -->  00:04:02,250
Here we go, now we are ready to start building
97

97

00:04:02,250  -->  00:04:04,220
our Convolutional Neural Network.
98

98

00:04:04,220  -->  00:04:06,400
So let's start doing this in the next tutorial
99

99

00:04:06,400  -->  00:04:08,200
and until then, enjoy deep learning!
