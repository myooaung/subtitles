00:00:00.260  -->  00:00:01.970
<v ->Okay, off we go.</v>
2

2

00:00:01.970  -->  00:00:03.660
So this dataset's got a few columns,
3

3

00:00:03.660  -->  00:00:06.870
it's got row number, custom ID, surname.
4

4

00:00:06.870  -->  00:00:10.781
So what we're looking at is a dataset of a bank.
5

5

00:00:10.781  -->  00:00:14.250
Of course it's all fictional, it's not a real bank,
6

6

00:00:14.250  -->  00:00:15.955
but it's very realistic.
7

7

00:00:15.955  -->  00:00:19.170
And here we've got a snapshot of--
8

8

00:00:19.170  -->  00:00:21.070
if you scroll down to the bottom
9

9

00:00:21.070  -->  00:00:22.830
there's going to be 10 thousand customers.
10

10

00:00:22.830  -->  00:00:25.890
So 10 thousand rows in this dataset.
11

11

00:00:25.890  -->  00:00:29.910
And what the bank did is they measured
12

12

00:00:29.910  -->  00:00:32.320
some things about these customers, alright.
13

13

00:00:32.320  -->  00:00:34.530
Why did they undergo this whole thing,
14

14

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:35.363
what's the challenge here?
15

15

00:00:35.363  -->  00:00:39.310
Well, the bank has been seeing unusual churn rates.
16

16

00:00:39.310  -->  00:00:41.740
So churn is when people leave the company
17

17

00:00:41.740  -->  00:00:45.660
and they've seen customers leaving at unusually high rates
18

18

00:00:45.660  -->  00:00:47.590
and they want to understand what the problem is
19

19

00:00:47.590  -->  00:00:50.300
and they want to assess and address that problem.
20

20

00:00:50.300  -->  00:00:51.700
And that's why they've hired you
21

21

00:00:51.700  -->  00:00:54.641
to look into this dataset for them
22

22

00:00:54.641  -->  00:00:57.010
and give them some insights.
23

23

00:00:57.010  -->  00:00:59.020
And how did this dataset come to be?
24

24

00:00:59.020  -->  00:01:02.200
Well, six months ago the bank said alright
25

25

00:01:02.200  -->  00:01:03.490
there's a big problem.
26

26

00:01:03.490  -->  00:01:06.270
We've gotta take a sample of our customers.
27

27

00:01:06.270  -->  00:01:07.650
By the way this is a sample of it.
28

28

00:01:07.650  -->  00:01:10.440
10 thousand is a tiny number for this bank.
29

29

00:01:10.440  -->  00:01:12.740
This bank has millions of customers,
30

30

00:01:12.740  -->  00:01:16.244
it operates, this fictional bank operates in Europe
31

31

00:01:16.244  -->  00:01:20.260
and three countries France, Spain, and Germany.
32

32

00:01:20.260  -->  00:01:22.250
And they have lots and lots of customers.
33

33

00:01:22.250  -->  00:01:24.200
So what they did is they took this sample
34

34

00:01:24.200  -->  00:01:28.730
of 10 thousand customers and they measured six months ago
35

35

00:01:28.730  -->  00:01:30.030
everything they knew about them.
36

36

00:01:30.030  -->  00:01:32.982
Their custom ID, their surname, credit score,
37

37

00:01:32.982  -->  00:01:37.920
their geography, their agenda, their age, their tenure,
38

38

00:01:37.920  -->  00:01:39.690
so how long they've been with the bank,
39

39

00:01:39.690  -->  00:01:42.800
the balance of the customers at that point in time,
40

40

00:01:42.800  -->  00:01:45.460
the number of products they had at that point in time.
41

41

00:01:45.460  -->  00:01:47.130
So the number of products is things like
42

42

00:01:47.130  -->  00:01:48.400
how many products do they have,
43

43

00:01:48.400  -->  00:01:50.538
do they have a savings account, do they have a credit card,
44

44

00:01:50.538  -->  00:01:55.040
do they have a loan, did the customer have a credit card
45

45

00:01:55.040  -->  00:01:57.100
or not, so there's a yes/no flag,
46

46

00:01:57.100  -->  00:02:00.300
is the customer an active member, another yes/no flag.
47

47

00:02:00.300  -->  00:02:02.070
Active member can be measured differently
48

48

00:02:02.070  -->  00:02:04.610
by different organizations, it could be whether or not
49

49

00:02:04.610  -->  00:02:06.690
the customer logged onto their online banking
50

50

00:02:06.690  -->  00:02:09.300
in the past month, whether they did a transaction
51

51

00:02:09.300  -->  00:02:13.615
in the past two months or some other measure like that.
52

52

00:02:13.615  -->  00:02:17.380
And estimated salary, so the bank doesn't know
53

53

00:02:17.380  -->  00:02:19.680
the salary of the customers, but based on the other things
54

54

00:02:19.680  -->  00:02:22.320
they know they could estimate a salary for that customer
55

55

00:02:22.320  -->  00:02:24.080
and they also give you this information.
56

56

00:02:24.080  -->  00:02:27.260
So six months ago they measured all of these things
57

57

00:02:27.260  -->  00:02:29.630
and said alright so for these 10 thousand
58

58

00:02:29.630  -->  00:02:30.950
randomly selected customers
59

59

00:02:30.950  -->  00:02:33.950
we're going to just watch them.
60

60

00:02:33.950  -->  00:02:38.360
And six months down the track we're going to check
61

61

00:02:38.360  -->  00:02:39.990
who of those customers left
62

62

00:02:39.990  -->  00:02:41.560
and who of those customers stayed.
63

63

00:02:41.560  -->  00:02:43.960
And that's what this column Exited represents here.
64

64

00:02:43.960  -->  00:02:46.240
It tells you whether or not the person left
65

65

00:02:46.240  -->  00:02:48.280
the bank within those six months.
66

66

00:02:48.280  -->  00:02:52.330
So this person over here sometime within the six months
67

67

00:02:52.330  -->  00:02:54.930
he left the bank and as of a couple of days ago,
68

68

00:02:54.930  -->  00:02:56.550
he's no longer with the bank.
69

69

00:02:56.550  -->  00:02:58.480
This person over here on the other hand,
70

70

00:02:58.480  -->  00:02:59.430
is still with the bank.
71

71

00:02:59.430  -->  00:03:00.480
So there's a zero here.
72

72

00:03:00.480  -->  00:03:02.530
This person left the bank.
73

73

00:03:02.530  -->  00:03:04.280
This person stayed and so on.
74

74

00:03:04.280  -->  00:03:05.550
So if you see a one that means
75

75

00:03:05.550  -->  00:03:06.980
the person's no longer with the bank
76

76

00:03:06.980  -->  00:03:08.580
and zero the person's still with the bank.
77

77

00:03:08.580  -->  00:03:12.368
And your goal is to create a demographic centric model
78

78

00:03:12.368  -->  00:03:15.160
to tell the bank which of the customers
79

79

00:03:15.160  -->  00:03:17.740
are at highest risk of leaving.
80

80

00:03:17.740  -->  00:03:20.037
What I wanted to mention today is that
81

81

00:03:20.037  -->  00:03:22.100
for a lot of customers centric organization
82

82

00:03:22.100  -->  00:03:23.330
this is going to be value.
83

83

00:03:23.330  -->  00:03:26.490
So I've done this personally, I've done this so many times,
84

84

00:03:26.490  -->  00:03:29.580
it is such a value added to
85

85

00:03:29.580  -->  00:03:31.380
any customer centric organization.
86

86

00:03:31.380  -->  00:03:33.628
So whenever an organization deals with customers,
87

87

00:03:33.628  -->  00:03:35.979
this is a lot of value added.
88

88

00:03:35.979  -->  00:03:39.710
And then the other thing is that this skill
89

89

00:03:39.710  -->  00:03:42.330
that you're going to learn is very transferable.
90

90

00:03:42.330  -->  00:03:44.220
It doesn't have to be for a bank,
91

91

00:03:44.220  -->  00:03:46.339
it doesn't have to be for churn rates.
92

92

00:03:46.339  -->  00:03:48.170
Your demographic segmentation models
93

93

00:03:48.170  -->  00:03:52.610
can be applied to millions of scenarios.
94

94

00:03:52.610  -->  00:03:55.230
So here for instance, even in a bank
95

95

00:03:55.230  -->  00:03:57.033
this same scenario could work.
96

96

00:03:57.033  -->  00:04:00.810
Should the person get a loan or not?
97

97

00:04:00.810  -->  00:04:03.259
Should the person be approved for credit or not?
98

98

00:04:03.259  -->  00:04:05.480
And once again you'd have a binary outcome.
99

99

00:04:05.480  -->  00:04:08.172
So based on prior experience you would know
100

100

00:04:08.172  -->  00:04:10.580
whether not a person is reliable
101

101

00:04:10.580  -->  00:04:12.020
and you'd build the model and say
102

102

00:04:12.020  -->  00:04:14.930
which people are more likely to be reliable
103

103

00:04:14.930  -->  00:04:17.000
and which people are more likely to default.
104

104

00:04:17.000  -->  00:04:18.790
And that could govern the bank's decision
105

105

00:04:18.790  -->  00:04:20.250
on whether or not to give loans.
106

106

00:04:20.250  -->  00:04:23.070
This could be in terms of fraudulent transactions
107

107

00:04:23.070  -->  00:04:26.050
and not even in a bank, in a different financial institution
108

108

00:04:26.050  -->  00:04:28.740
so you could find out which transactions are more likely
109

109

00:04:28.740  -->  00:04:31.218
to be fraudulent which are less likely.
110

110

00:04:31.218  -->  00:04:35.410
There's lots scenarios where you could apply
111

111

00:04:35.410  -->  00:04:37.460
a demographic segmentation model.
112

112

00:04:37.460  -->  00:04:39.640
And it doesn't even have to be your demographic
113

113

00:04:39.640  -->  00:04:42.160
so whenever you have a scenario
114

114

00:04:42.160  -->  00:04:43.380
when you have a binary outcome
115

115

00:04:43.380  -->  00:04:46.220
and you have lots of independent variables,
116

116

00:04:46.220  -->  00:04:48.820
you can build a proper robust model
117

117

00:04:48.820  -->  00:04:51.360
and that'll tell which factors influence the outcome.
118

118

00:04:51.360  -->  00:04:53.970
So can you apply this knowledge,
119

119

00:04:53.970  -->  00:04:56.160
it's good to learn in any kind of scenario.
120

120

00:04:56.160  -->  00:04:59.917
We have a binary outcome and lots of independent variables.
