00:00:00.230  -->  00:00:02.640
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to the third part</v>
2

2

00:00:02.640  -->  00:00:06.290
of the Deep Learning course Recurrent Neural Networks.
3

3

00:00:06.290  -->  00:00:09.310
We're gonna have to tackle a very challenging problem
4

4

00:00:09.310  -->  00:00:11.295
in this part, because we're gonna have to predict
5

5

00:00:11.295  -->  00:00:15.010
the stock price of nothing else than Google.
6

6

00:00:15.010  -->  00:00:16.620
So it's pretty challenging,
7

7

00:00:16.620  -->  00:00:18.990
especially if you have some notions in financial
8

8

00:00:18.990  -->  00:00:22.500
engineering, since indeed there is the Brownian Motion
9

9

00:00:22.500  -->  00:00:25.700
that states that the future variations of the stock price
10

10

00:00:25.700  -->  00:00:27.430
are independent from the past,
11

11

00:00:27.430  -->  00:00:30.034
so it's actually impossible to predict exactly
12

12

00:00:30.034  -->  00:00:32.610
the future stock price otherwise we would all
13

13

00:00:32.610  -->  00:00:35.617
become billionaires but it's actually possible
14

14

00:00:35.617  -->  00:00:37.749
to predict some trends.
15

15

00:00:37.749  -->  00:00:41.590
So we're gonna try to predict the upward and downward trends
16

16

00:00:41.590  -->  00:00:43.750
that exist in the Google stock price.
17

17

00:00:43.750  -->  00:00:46.250
And to do so, the model that we will implement
18

18

00:00:46.250  -->  00:00:49.200
in this part three, will be an LSTM.
19

19

00:00:49.200  -->  00:00:52.630
We will make an LSTM that will try to capture
20

20

00:00:52.630  -->  00:00:56.090
the downward and upward trend of the Google stock price.
21

21

00:00:56.090  -->  00:00:58.890
And with that goal in mind, I can tell you for sure,
22

22

00:00:58.890  -->  00:01:02.810
that LSTM is the most powerful model that can do this.
23

23

00:01:02.810  -->  00:01:07.370
It performs well better than the traditional RMI model.
24

24

00:01:07.370  -->  00:01:09.020
So that's exactly what we're going to implement
25

25

00:01:09.020  -->  00:01:11.406
in this course, besides, we're not gonna implement
26

26

00:01:11.406  -->  00:01:15.570
a simple LSTM, it's gonna be super robust with some
27

27

00:01:15.570  -->  00:01:18.420
high-dimensionality, several layers, it's gonna be
28

28

00:01:18.420  -->  00:01:21.620
a stacked LSTM, then we're gonna add some dropout
29

29

00:01:21.620  -->  00:01:23.933
regularization to avoid overfilling
30

30

00:01:23.933  -->  00:01:27.410
and we will use the most powerful optimizer that we have
31

31

00:01:27.410  -->  00:01:28.770
in the Carris Library.
32

32

00:01:28.770  -->  00:01:30.480
So, and how are we going to do this?
33

33

00:01:30.480  -->  00:01:32.870
How are we going to approach this problem?
34

34

00:01:32.870  -->  00:01:37.010
Well, we're gonna train our LSTM model on five years
35

35

00:01:37.010  -->  00:01:39.290
of the Google stock price, and this is from
36

36

00:01:39.290  -->  00:01:44.160
the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2016 and then,
37

37

00:01:44.160  -->  00:01:48.080
based on this training, based on the correlations identified
38

38

00:01:48.080  -->  00:01:50.887
or captured by the LSTM of the Google stock price,
39

39

00:01:50.887  -->  00:01:55.340
we will try to predict the first month of 2017.
40

40

00:01:55.340  -->  00:01:58.740
We're gonna try to predict January 2017.
41

41

00:01:58.740  -->  00:02:01.200
And again, we're not going to try to predict
42

42

00:02:01.200  -->  00:02:03.121
exactly the stock price, we're gonna try to predict
43

43

00:02:03.121  -->  00:02:05.732
the trend, the upward or downward trend
44

44

00:02:05.732  -->  00:02:07.490
of the Google stock price.
45

45

00:02:07.490  -->  00:02:10.724
So that's the approach, and therefore what I'm gonna do now
46

46

00:02:10.724  -->  00:02:15.724
is show you this Google stock price from beginning 2012
47

47

00:02:15.810  -->  00:02:18.332
to the end of 2016 but just before we do that,
48

48

00:02:18.332  -->  00:02:21.585
let's find the right working directory folder
49

49

00:02:21.585  -->  00:02:25.120
in File Explorer, so the Deep Learning aid is a folder
50

50

00:02:25.120  -->  00:02:25.953
on my desktop.
51

51

00:02:25.953  -->  00:02:27.110
So let's go inside.
52

52

00:02:27.110  -->  00:02:28.550
Now we're still on volume one.
53

53

00:02:28.550  -->  00:02:31.300
Congratulations, you have almost reached the first half
54

54

00:02:31.300  -->  00:02:33.310
of the course, now we're in part three,
55

55

00:02:33.310  -->  00:02:34.780
Recurrent Neural Networks.
56

56

00:02:34.780  -->  00:02:37.469
Let's go inside and right after you saw
57

57

00:02:37.469  -->  00:02:39.850
the intuition lectures with Kirill,
58

58

00:02:39.850  -->  00:02:41.920
let's now put this theory in practice
59

59

00:02:41.920  -->  00:02:45.490
to build a Recurrent Neural Network.
60

60

00:02:45.490  -->  00:02:48.280
Alright, so, that's the working directory folder,
61

61

00:02:48.280  -->  00:02:50.020
as you can see there are three files,
62

62

00:02:50.020  -->  00:02:53.140
the train data, that contains the Google stock price
63

63

00:02:53.140  -->  00:02:56.181
from beginning 2012 to the end of 2016,
64

64

00:02:56.181  -->  00:03:00.229
and then the test data that contains the first month
65

65

00:03:00.229  -->  00:03:05.229
of 2017, that is, the whole financial month of January 2017.
66

66

00:03:06.200  -->  00:03:08.920
So we're gonna have a look at this data more closely now
67

67

00:03:08.920  -->  00:03:12.420
and that's of course our RNN Python file
68

68

00:03:12.420  -->  00:03:16.623
where we will implement the whole Recurrent Neural Network.
69

69

00:03:16.623  -->  00:03:19.430
Alright, we're gonna do that in the next tutorials,
70

70

00:03:19.430  -->  00:03:24.270
and now let's go to Google Sheet, Excel or any spreadsheet
71

71

00:03:24.270  -->  00:03:26.210
you would like to have closer look
72

72

00:03:26.210  -->  00:03:27.800
at the Google stock price.
73

73

00:03:27.800  -->  00:03:29.110
So here's the Google stock price,
74

74

00:03:29.110  -->  00:03:31.370
this is the Google stock price train
75

75

00:03:31.370  -->  00:03:34.418
that is the training data from 2012 to 2016
76

76

00:03:34.418  -->  00:03:38.620
and we're gonna try to predict the open Google stock price,
77

77

00:03:38.620  -->  00:03:41.210
that is the stock price at the beginning
78

78

00:03:41.210  -->  00:03:42.293
of the financial day.
79

79

00:03:43.130  -->  00:03:45.580
So let's have a look at the Google stock price
80

80

00:03:45.580  -->  00:03:46.720
during this period.
81

81

00:03:46.720  -->  00:03:49.783
So, to do this I'm going to select the two columns here
82

82

00:03:49.783  -->  00:03:54.690
and then click on Insert and then click on Chart
83

83

00:03:54.690  -->  00:03:57.720
to have a look at the open Google stock price
84

84

00:03:57.720  -->  00:04:00.930
from 2012 to the end of 2016.
85

85

00:04:00.930  -->  00:04:02.550
There it is, alright.
86

86

00:04:02.550  -->  00:04:04.960
So that's the open Google stock price from,
87

87

00:04:04.960  -->  00:04:09.788
as you can see, the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2016.
88

88

00:04:09.788  -->  00:04:13.417
So as you can see, we can see some upward trends, globally,
89

89

00:04:13.417  -->  00:04:16.336
with several downward trends, alright?
90

90

00:04:16.336  -->  00:04:20.610
So that's the training set, and that's on this data set
91

91

00:04:20.610  -->  00:04:23.300
that our LSTM will be trained.
92

92

00:04:23.300  -->  00:04:25.020
Okay, we're gonna close that
93

93

00:04:25.020  -->  00:04:28.319
and now let's have a quick look at the test set,
94

94

00:04:28.319  -->  00:04:32.640
Google stock price test, that contains the same columns
95

95

00:04:32.640  -->  00:04:34.700
but we're only interested in this one,
96

96

00:04:34.700  -->  00:04:36.470
the open Google stock price,
97

97

00:04:36.470  -->  00:04:41.000
for the first month of January 2017.
98

98

00:04:41.000  -->  00:04:43.780
And make sure to understand that these are financial days,
99

99

00:04:43.780  -->  00:04:46.410
so there's not Saturday or Sunday
100

100

00:04:46.410  -->  00:04:49.219
and that's why here we start from January third
101

101

00:04:49.219  -->  00:04:51.760
and we end up with January 31st
102

102

00:04:51.760  -->  00:04:56.010
but there is not 31 days in this financial month,
103

103

00:04:56.010  -->  00:04:58.246
there's only 20 days, alright?
104

104

00:04:58.246  -->  00:05:02.090
So same, let's have a look at the Google stock price.
105

105

00:05:02.090  -->  00:05:03.710
So I'm taking the two columns here
106

106

00:05:03.710  -->  00:05:07.230
then click on Insert then Chart.
107

107

00:05:07.230  -->  00:05:09.770
And I should get the Google stock price, there it is.
108

108

00:05:09.770  -->  00:05:13.500
So, that's what we have to predict, this model,
109

109

00:05:13.500  -->  00:05:15.271
the LSTM model we will implement
110

110

00:05:15.271  -->  00:05:17.366
will not be trained on this data.
111

111

00:05:17.366  -->  00:05:20.470
So it will have no idea of what the Google stock price
112

112

00:05:20.470  -->  00:05:22.880
will be right after 2016.
113

113

00:05:22.880  -->  00:05:26.037
And so, once our model is trained, we will predict
114

114

00:05:26.037  -->  00:05:29.280
the Google stock price for the whole month of January,
115

115

00:05:29.280  -->  00:05:32.870
and we will compare our predictions to the actual
116

116

00:05:32.870  -->  00:05:34.978
results that is the real results, the real
117

117

00:05:34.978  -->  00:05:36.950
Google stock price.
118

118

00:05:36.950  -->  00:05:37.783
Alright?
119

119

00:05:37.783  -->  00:05:40.090
So, if you're ready, let's implement the LSTM
120

120

00:05:40.090  -->  00:05:42.820
and let's try to tackle this very challenging
121

121

00:05:42.820  -->  00:05:46.750
problem to predict the upward or downward trends.
122

122

00:05:46.750  -->  00:05:50.340
So I'm gonna go back to Anaconda, there we go,
123

123

00:05:50.340  -->  00:05:52.500
and as you can see, we're gonna implement
124

124

00:05:52.500  -->  00:05:54.810
our Recurrent Neural Network in three parts.
125

125

00:05:54.810  -->  00:05:58.120
First, the data for processes, which is gonna be different
126

126

00:05:58.120  -->  00:06:00.910
than the data processing you saw in the first two parts,
127

127

00:06:00.910  -->  00:06:03.430
so we're gonna implement it from scratch.
128

128

00:06:03.430  -->  00:06:06.030
Then part two will be about building the RNN,
129

129

00:06:06.030  -->  00:06:08.840
so we'll build the architecture of the RNN
130

130

00:06:08.840  -->  00:06:11.640
with the different layers, the different number of neurons,
131

131

00:06:11.640  -->  00:06:14.511
in each of the LSTM layers and the output layer,
132

132

00:06:14.511  -->  00:06:18.357
and then, in the third and last part of this implementation,
133

133

00:06:18.357  -->  00:06:22.289
we will make the predictions on January 2017
134

134

00:06:22.289  -->  00:06:24.720
and of course we will visualize the results.
135

135

00:06:24.720  -->  00:06:27.100
The most exciting step.
136

136

00:06:27.100  -->  00:06:28.943
Until then, enjoy Deep Learning.
