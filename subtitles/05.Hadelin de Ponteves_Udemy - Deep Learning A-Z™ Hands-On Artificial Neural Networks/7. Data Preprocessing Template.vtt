00:00:00.590  -->  00:00:03.093
<v Instructor>Hello, and welcome to the final tutorial</v>
2

2

00:00:03.093  -->  00:00:05.100
of data preprocessing.
3

3

00:00:05.100  -->  00:00:07.360
We finally completed all the steps
4

4

00:00:07.360  -->  00:00:10.073
that there is to do to prepare any data set
5

5

00:00:10.073  -->  00:00:13.070
on which we will build our machine learning models
6

6

00:00:13.070  -->  00:00:15.640
and now what we only need to do left is to prepare
7

7

00:00:15.640  -->  00:00:17.490
the data preprocessing template
8

8

00:00:17.490  -->  00:00:19.260
because we learnt a few stuff,
9

9

00:00:19.260  -->  00:00:21.060
we learnt how to import the libraries,
10

10

00:00:21.060  -->  00:00:24.170
to import the data set, to take care of missing data,
11

11

00:00:24.170  -->  00:00:27.560
to encode categorical data, to split the data set
12

12

00:00:27.560  -->  00:00:29.370
into the training set and the test set,
13

13

00:00:29.370  -->  00:00:31.160
and to apply future scaling
14

14

00:00:31.160  -->  00:00:33.830
to put all of our variable on the same scale.
15

15

00:00:33.830  -->  00:00:35.950
However in the data preprocessing template,
16

16

00:00:35.950  -->  00:00:38.000
we're not going to include all of these.
17

17

00:00:38.000  -->  00:00:41.130
We are only going to include the importing the libraries,
18

18

00:00:41.130  -->  00:00:43.067
then of course you need to import the data set,
19

19

00:00:43.067  -->  00:00:44.740
then regarding missing data,
20

20

00:00:44.740  -->  00:00:47.030
I just wanted to show you how to take care of that
21

21

00:00:47.030  -->  00:00:49.337
in case you have some missing data in your data set,
22

22

00:00:49.337  -->  00:00:50.890
you know in your work.
23

23

00:00:50.890  -->  00:00:53.200
So we are not going to include this in the template
24

24

00:00:53.200  -->  00:00:55.350
it's just good to know how to take care of this,
25

25

00:00:55.350  -->  00:00:56.420
but then we will focus
26

26

00:00:56.420  -->  00:00:58.130
on the machine learning models themselves
27

27

00:00:58.130  -->  00:01:01.900
and if in your work experience you encounter missing data,
28

28

00:01:01.900  -->  00:01:05.180
you know how to handle this any missing data issues.
29

29

00:01:05.180  -->  00:01:08.030
Then as for categorical data we won't include it
30

30

00:01:08.030  -->  00:01:10.255
either in the template because we're gonna find
31

31

00:01:10.255  -->  00:01:14.800
very few examples of data where we have to encode the data
32

32

00:01:14.800  -->  00:01:15.975
there will be some examples,
33

33

00:01:15.975  -->  00:01:18.190
but we won't include it in the templates
34

34

00:01:18.190  -->  00:01:20.225
because our data sets are gonna be well prepared
35

35

00:01:20.225  -->  00:01:23.410
so that we can mainly focus on the machine learning models
36

36

00:01:23.410  -->  00:01:25.530
and get the maximum fun.
37

37

00:01:25.530  -->  00:01:28.730
And then, of course we will include this in the templates
38

38

00:01:28.730  -->  00:01:30.507
bringing the data set into the training set
39

39

00:01:30.507  -->  00:01:33.670
and the test set, because that's a very important step.
40

40

00:01:33.670  -->  00:01:36.310
You need to split your data set between training and test
41

41

00:01:36.310  -->  00:01:40.509
because you need to evaluate your model on a different set
42

42

00:01:40.509  -->  00:01:43.441
than the set on which you built your model.
43

43

00:01:43.441  -->  00:01:45.060
And future scaling,
44

44

00:01:45.060  -->  00:01:48.270
sometimes we'll have to use future scaling.
45

45

00:01:48.270  -->  00:01:50.190
Okay so let's start making the templates,
46

46

00:01:50.190  -->  00:01:51.943
it's gonna be very quick.
47

47

00:01:51.943  -->  00:01:53.620
Alright, so what did we say?
48

48

00:01:53.620  -->  00:01:54.740
Importing the libraries?
49

49

00:01:54.740  -->  00:01:55.573
Yes!
50

50

00:01:55.573  -->  00:01:56.406
We keep it.
51

51

00:01:56.406  -->  00:01:57.239
Importing the data set?
52

52

00:01:57.239  -->  00:01:58.072
Yes!
53

53

00:01:58.072  -->  00:01:59.823
That's a compulsory step, if we don't import the data set
54

54

00:01:59.823  -->  00:02:02.070
we cannot make any machinery models,
55

55

00:02:02.070  -->  00:02:03.892
because the model won't have anything to learn.
56

56

00:02:03.892  -->  00:02:06.100
Then taking care of missing data,
57

57

00:02:06.100  -->  00:02:07.450
okay that was just to show you
58

58

00:02:07.450  -->  00:02:09.883
so we are going to remove this.
59

59

00:02:11.490  -->  00:02:14.130
Alright, now encoding categorical data
60

60

00:02:14.130  -->  00:02:16.056
okay so we will encounter very few examples
61

61

00:02:16.056  -->  00:02:19.300
where we will need to encode categorical data.
62

62

00:02:19.300  -->  00:02:22.050
So, same for the missing data we're going to
63

63

00:02:22.050  -->  00:02:23.883
exclude it from the template,
64

64

00:02:24.740  -->  00:02:26.683
and I put it in a separate file.
65

65

00:02:27.960  -->  00:02:30.040
Okay, so the template is getting ready,
66

66

00:02:30.040  -->  00:02:32.420
of course we're keeping the sections, splitting the data set
67

67

00:02:32.420  -->  00:02:34.410
into the training set and the test set,
68

68

00:02:34.410  -->  00:02:36.610
that's absolutely necessary.
69

69

00:02:36.610  -->  00:02:39.640
There will be one or two examples where we won't do it
70

70

00:02:39.640  -->  00:02:42.270
because the context will be quite particular
71

71

00:02:42.270  -->  00:02:44.740
but in general you will need to do this.
72

72

00:02:44.740  -->  00:02:47.240
And finally future scaling,
73

73

00:02:47.240  -->  00:02:50.500
so, the template is ready we can save it.
74

74

00:02:50.500  -->  00:02:53.220
I already called data preprocessing template
75

75

00:02:53.220  -->  00:02:55.070
so what we'll do at the beginning
76

76

00:02:55.070  -->  00:02:56.780
of every machine learning model,
77

77

00:02:56.780  -->  00:03:00.730
is that we will take all of these
78

78

00:03:00.730  -->  00:03:03.880
from this data preprocessing template Python file,
79

79

00:03:03.880  -->  00:03:07.000
copy this, and we will put it at the beginning
80

80

00:03:07.000  -->  00:03:08.570
of our machine learning models
81

81

00:03:08.570  -->  00:03:11.180
before building the model itself.
82

82

00:03:11.180  -->  00:03:13.210
Alright, so that's it for Python,
83

83

00:03:13.210  -->  00:03:15.830
the data preprocessing template is ready.
84

84

00:03:15.830  -->  00:03:19.273
I can't wait to show you how it will save us a lot of time
85

85

00:03:19.273  -->  00:03:21.591
to make our machine learning models.
86

86

00:03:21.591  -->  00:03:24.770
This was the boring part, but a very important part to do
87

87

00:03:24.770  -->  00:03:26.810
so, that's great that we did it,
88

88

00:03:26.810  -->  00:03:28.484
and now it's time to have fun.
89

89

00:03:28.484  -->  00:03:32.130
So thank you for watching this data preprocessing tutorials,
90

90

00:03:32.130  -->  00:03:34.594
congratulations for completing this part.
91

91

00:03:34.594  -->  00:03:37.230
You are now ready to make machine learning models,
92

92

00:03:37.230  -->  00:03:39.810
and I look forward to seeing you in the next part.
93

93

00:03:39.810  -->  00:03:41.560
Until then, enjoy machine learning.
