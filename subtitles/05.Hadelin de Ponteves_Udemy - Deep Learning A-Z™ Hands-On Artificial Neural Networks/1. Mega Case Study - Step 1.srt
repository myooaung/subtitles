00:00:00,150  -->  00:00:01,100
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome</v>
2

2

00:00:01,100  -->  00:00:02,970
to the mega case study of this course,
3

3

00:00:02,970  -->  00:00:05,710
make a hybrid deep learning model.
4

4

00:00:05,710  -->  00:00:06,790
So, as you understood,
5

5

00:00:06,790  -->  00:00:10,130
this challenge is about combining two deep learning models
6

6

00:00:10,130  -->  00:00:11,450
we made in this course.
7

7

00:00:11,450  -->  00:00:12,900
And you can already see where they are.
8

8

00:00:12,900  -->  00:00:14,600
It's the artificial neural network
9

9

00:00:14,600  -->  00:00:16,020
that we made in part one
10

10

00:00:16,020  -->  00:00:17,800
and the self-organizing map
11

11

00:00:17,800  -->  00:00:19,530
that we made in part four.
12

12

00:00:19,530  -->  00:00:21,030
And so, we're gonna start
13

13

00:00:21,030  -->  00:00:23,410
with the credit card applications dataset
14

14

00:00:23,410  -->  00:00:25,220
to identify the frauds.
15

15

00:00:25,220  -->  00:00:26,210
And then the idea is
16

16

00:00:26,210  -->  00:00:28,530
to make an even more advanced deep learning model
17

17

00:00:28,530  -->  00:00:30,570
where we can predict the probability
18

18

00:00:30,570  -->  00:00:32,750
that each customer cheated.
19

19

00:00:32,750  -->  00:00:35,720
And to do this, we need to go from unsupervised
20

20

00:00:35,720  -->  00:00:37,390
to supervised deep learning.
21

21

00:00:37,390  -->  00:00:38,223
So there we are.
22

22

00:00:38,223  -->  00:00:40,720
This challenge takes two parts.
23

23

00:00:40,720  -->  00:00:41,640
In the first part,
24

24

00:00:41,640  -->  00:00:44,500
we'll make the unsupervised deep learning branch
25

25

00:00:44,500  -->  00:00:46,150
of our hybrid deep learning model.
26

26

00:00:46,150  -->  00:00:47,150
And in the second part,
27

27

00:00:47,150  -->  00:00:49,850
we'll make the supervised deep learning branch.
28

28

00:00:49,850  -->  00:00:50,683
And, in the end,
29

29

00:00:50,683  -->  00:00:53,670
we'll get this hybrid deep learning model composed
30

30

00:00:53,670  -->  00:00:57,380
of both unsupervised and supervised deep learning.
31

31

00:00:57,380  -->  00:00:58,650
So, before we start,
32

32

00:00:58,650  -->  00:01:01,190
let's set the right folder as working directory.
33

33

00:01:01,190  -->  00:01:02,820
So we'll go to File explorer
34

34

00:01:02,820  -->  00:01:04,720
to our Deep Learning A-Z folder.
35

35

00:01:04,720  -->  00:01:06,130
And as you can see in this folder,
36

36

00:01:06,130  -->  00:01:09,670
I created a new subfolder called Mega Case Study.
37

37

00:01:09,670  -->  00:01:10,990
And inside this subfolder,
38

38

00:01:10,990  -->  00:01:12,890
you have all the material you need
39

39

00:01:12,890  -->  00:01:15,520
to create this hybrid deep learning model.
40

40

00:01:15,520  -->  00:01:18,380
So you have the Credit_Card_Applications data set,
41

41

00:01:18,380  -->  00:01:20,500
that we've just seen with the self-organizing map,
42

42

00:01:20,500  -->  00:01:23,120
and that contains all the credit card applications
43

43

00:01:23,120  -->  00:01:25,360
from the different customers of a bank.
44

44

00:01:25,360  -->  00:01:28,110
And so you will use the self-organizing map exactly
45

45

00:01:28,110  -->  00:01:31,380
as we did previously, in part four, to identify the fraud.
46

46

00:01:31,380  -->  00:01:33,530
So, there will be nothing new about that.
47

47

00:01:33,530  -->  00:01:36,640
But then, the challenge is to use the results
48

48

00:01:36,640  -->  00:01:38,220
of this self-organizing map
49

49

00:01:38,220  -->  00:01:40,840
to then combine your unsupervised deep learning model
50

50

00:01:40,840  -->  00:01:42,750
to a new supervised deep learning model
51

51

00:01:42,750  -->  00:01:46,180
that will take, as input, the results given
52

52

00:01:46,180  -->  00:01:47,870
by your self-organizing map.
53

53

00:01:47,870  -->  00:01:48,900
So that's the challenge.
54

54

00:01:48,900  -->  00:01:51,550
The challenge is to combine two models.
55

55

00:01:51,550  -->  00:01:54,400
So let's quickly set this folder as working directory.
56

56

00:01:54,400  -->  00:01:57,070
And now, you are ready to go, good luck.
57

57

00:01:57,070  -->  00:02:00,350
And so in the end, what you must obtain is a ranking
58

58

00:02:00,350  -->  00:02:03,620
of the predicted probabilities that each customer cheated.
59

59

00:02:03,620  -->  00:02:05,010
So I just wanna warn you,
60

60

00:02:05,010  -->  00:02:08,050
you will get very small probabilities, but that's normal.
61

61

00:02:08,050  -->  00:02:10,130
It's because there are few frauds identified
62

62

00:02:10,130  -->  00:02:12,150
by the SOM, but that doesn't matter.
63

63

00:02:12,150  -->  00:02:12,983
What's important is
64

64

00:02:12,983  -->  00:02:16,060
that you get this ranking of probabilities.
65

65

00:02:16,060  -->  00:02:17,960
So I hope you will enjoy this homework
66

66

00:02:17,960  -->  00:02:19,930
and keep in mind that the important thing is
67

67

00:02:19,930  -->  00:02:22,740
to practice, practice, practice, and practice.
68

68

00:02:22,740  -->  00:02:24,750
That's how you will make the most progress
69

69

00:02:24,750  -->  00:02:25,920
and that will be the case,
70

70

00:02:25,920  -->  00:02:28,230
even if you don't succeed the homework.
71

71

00:02:28,230  -->  00:02:30,810
So good luck and I'll see you in the next two tutorials
72

72

00:02:30,810  -->  00:02:33,750
to tackle the challenge because we will take it in two part.
73

73

00:02:33,750  -->  00:02:34,640
In part one,
74

74

00:02:34,640  -->  00:02:37,120
we will make the unsupervised deep learning branch
75

75

00:02:37,120  -->  00:02:38,800
that is the self-organizing map.
76

76

00:02:38,800  -->  00:02:39,970
And then in the second tutorial,
77

77

00:02:39,970  -->  00:02:41,490
we will take care of part two,
78

78

00:02:41,490  -->  00:02:43,830
building the supervised deep learning model,
79

79

00:02:43,830  -->  00:02:46,310
which will be our artificial neural network.
80

80

00:02:46,310  -->  00:02:48,560
So I can't wait to do this and until then,
81

81

00:02:48,560  -->  00:02:49,903
enjoy deep learning!
