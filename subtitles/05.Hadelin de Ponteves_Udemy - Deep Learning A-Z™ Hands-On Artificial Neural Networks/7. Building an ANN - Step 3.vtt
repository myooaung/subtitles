00:00:00.200  -->  00:00:02.740
<v Instructor>Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.740  -->  00:00:05.120
So in the previous tutorial we did the boring step
3

3

00:00:05.120  -->  00:00:06.600
of our deep learning journey,
4

4

00:00:06.600  -->  00:00:08.590
which is the data processing step.
5

5

00:00:08.590  -->  00:00:10.270
Not the most exciting part.
6

6

00:00:10.270  -->  00:00:12.010
But of course, compulsory.
7

7

00:00:12.010  -->  00:00:14.440
But now everything is ready and we can eventually get
8

8

00:00:14.440  -->  00:00:16.440
into the exciting part of the journey
9

9

00:00:16.440  -->  00:00:21.220
which is, of course, to make the artificial neural network.
10

10

00:00:21.220  -->  00:00:23.850
So that's exactly what we're gonna do in the next tutorials.
11

11

00:00:23.850  -->  00:00:26.540
And as you can see, I created this second part here,
12

12

00:00:26.540  -->  00:00:27.373
part two now.
13

13

00:00:27.373  -->  00:00:28.590
Let's make the ANN.
14

14

00:00:28.590  -->  00:00:30.840
And I also created a third part,
15

15

00:00:30.840  -->  00:00:34.060
part three making the predictions and evaluating the model.
16

16

00:00:34.060  -->  00:00:35.350
So that you can clearly see
17

17

00:00:35.350  -->  00:00:38.710
which section of the code builds the ANN.
18

18

00:00:38.710  -->  00:00:40.020
So that you can clearly see
19

19

00:00:40.020  -->  00:00:42.110
what we're doing at every step.
20

20

00:00:42.110  -->  00:00:43.370
And speaking of step,
21

21

00:00:43.370  -->  00:00:46.090
now we're gonna make the ANN step by step
22

22

00:00:46.090  -->  00:00:48.250
and we're gonna start with this first step
23

23

00:00:48.250  -->  00:00:50.920
which is to import the keras libraries
24

24

00:00:50.920  -->  00:00:53.080
and the required packages.
25

25

00:00:53.080  -->  00:00:54.770
Because indeed we will not only need
26

26

00:00:54.770  -->  00:00:58.350
to import the keras library but some modules
27

27

00:00:58.350  -->  00:01:00.840
of the keras library which are required
28

28

00:01:00.840  -->  00:01:02.380
to build the neural network.
29

29

00:01:02.380  -->  00:01:05.510
Alright, so, first, let's import the keras library
30

30

00:01:05.510  -->  00:01:07.990
because indeed, we installed keras here,
31

31

00:01:07.990  -->  00:01:09.950
but we haven't imported keras yet.
32

32

00:01:09.950  -->  00:01:11.600
So that's what we're gonna do right now.
33

33

00:01:11.600  -->  00:01:15.110
So import keras and that's it.
34

34

00:01:15.110  -->  00:01:18.910
So let's do it, selecting this line and pressing enter.
35

35

00:01:18.910  -->  00:01:23.040
All right, import keras using TensorFlow backend.
36

36

00:01:23.040  -->  00:01:25.430
That means that the keras library will build
37

37

00:01:25.430  -->  00:01:28.440
the deep neural network based on TensorFlow.
38

38

00:01:28.440  -->  00:01:31.010
If any of you wants to use the Theano backend,
39

39

00:01:31.010  -->  00:01:33.290
well, you can do it, but it's not that direct.
40

40

00:01:33.290  -->  00:01:35.050
So if any of you wants to do that,
41

41

00:01:35.050  -->  00:01:37.310
feel free to ask me some questions in the Q &amp; A,
42

42

00:01:37.310  -->  00:01:38.690
and now I'll tell you how to do it.
43

43

00:01:38.690  -->  00:01:40.160
But here, TensorFlow is fine.
44

44

00:01:40.160  -->  00:01:41.980
Everything will not only work very well,
45

45

00:01:41.980  -->  00:01:43.610
but also very fast.
46

46

00:01:43.610  -->  00:01:47.880
All right, so keras done and now let's import the modules.
47

47

00:01:47.880  -->  00:01:50.240
So we need to import two modules, here.
48

48

00:01:50.240  -->  00:01:52.980
The Sequential module that is required
49

49

00:01:52.980  -->  00:01:55.360
to initialize our neural network
50

50

00:01:55.360  -->  00:01:58.450
and the Dense module that is required
51

51

00:01:58.450  -->  00:02:00.900
to build the layers of our ANN.
52

52

00:02:00.900  -->  00:02:02.250
Alright, so let's do it.
53

53

00:02:02.250  -->  00:02:05.120
Let's first start with the Sequential module.
54

54

00:02:05.120  -->  00:02:06.620
We are going to import this module
55

55

00:02:06.620  -->  00:02:11.620
from the keras.models, here it is.
56

56

00:02:11.690  -->  00:02:15.510
Sub library and import Sequential.
57

57

00:02:17.750  -->  00:02:19.300
Alright, perfect.
58

58

00:02:19.300  -->  00:02:22.420
So that's what we'll use to initialize our neural network.
59

59

00:02:22.420  -->  00:02:24.800
All right, and now the second module, Dense
60

60

00:02:24.800  -->  00:02:29.800
that we import from keras.layers.
61

61

00:02:30.130  -->  00:02:34.100
Here it is, and then import Dense.
62

62

00:02:34.100  -->  00:02:36.780
And that's the model will use to create
63

63

00:02:36.780  -->  00:02:39.430
the layers in our artificial neural network.
64

64

00:02:39.430  -->  00:02:41.340
All right, we have these warnings here
65

65

00:02:41.340  -->  00:02:44.550
simply because okay, we import the library and the modules
66

66

00:02:44.550  -->  00:02:45.960
but we haven't used them yet.
67

67

00:02:45.960  -->  00:02:47.770
So that's fine don't worry about this.
68

68

00:02:47.770  -->  00:02:50.100
We will use them in the next tutorials
69

69

00:02:50.100  -->  00:02:51.960
first to initialize the ANN
70

70

00:02:51.960  -->  00:02:56.060
and then to add the different layers in our ANN.
71

71

00:02:56.060  -->  00:02:57.980
Alright, so all the imports are ready.
72

72

00:02:57.980  -->  00:03:01.950
So let's select this line and execute to import Sequential,
73

73

00:03:01.950  -->  00:03:04.930
and now let's select this line to import Dense.
74

74

00:03:04.930  -->  00:03:06.000
And here we go.
75

75

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:07.950
Now we are ready to move on to the next step
76

76

00:03:07.950  -->  00:03:10.480
which will be to initialize our neural network.
77

77

00:03:10.480  -->  00:03:12.120
So we'll do that in the next tutorial.
78

78

00:03:12.120  -->  00:03:13.953
And until then, enjoy deep learning.
