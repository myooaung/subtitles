00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.203
That's as far as we will dive into authentication for now.

2
00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:08.682
So let's do a recap.

3
00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:12.486
An AuthenticationFilter generates an authentication request and

4
00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:16.897
delegates that request to an AuthenticationManager.

5
00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:22.653
The AuthenticationManager then delegates to one or more AuthenticationProviders.

6
00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:26.080
The AuthenticationProviders use a UserDetailsService to

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.538
retrieve the credentials from an identity store.

8
00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:34.994
The providers will then return an authenticated principal back to the filter,

9
00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.579
which, in turn, will add it to the security context.

10
00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.071
The key takeaways here are that if you want to use a

11
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.147
particular authentication strategy,

12
00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:47.621
then you need to configure the appropriate AuthenticationFilter.

13
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.090
If you have multiple identity stores,

14
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.955
then you can configure additional AuthenticationProviders.

15
00:00:53.955 --> 00:00:58.998
And to integrate with an identity store, you need a UserDetailsService.

16
00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.664
The SecurityContextHolder is a thread local and makes the authenticated

17
00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:06.771
principal accessible to your application in the current thread.

18
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.958
You can extend it and add additional fields and objects.

19
00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.830
But do not store any sensitive data, like credentials and passwords here.

20
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.789
Again, this was an example of a typical authentication flow.

21
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.585
However, Spring is very flexible, and there are exceptions,

22
00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.003
like for example the DigestAuthenticationFilter

23
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.214
doesn't use an AuthenticationManager.

24
00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:31.214
It goes directly to a UserDetailsService.

25
00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:34.698
Now this might all seem a lot to take in, but don't worry.

26
00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:36.181
In the subsequent demos,

27
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:38.946
we'll be customizing and configuring a lot of these

28
00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:47.000
components and seeing how they work real-time. So they will become more familiar to you as you progress in the course.
