Hi, it's Wojciech Lesniak.

2
00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:06.956
Welcome to this module where we will take a peek under the

3
00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:09.663
covers of Spring Security authentication.

4
00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:13.176
At the architecture, the key components and building blocks.

5
00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:16.072
But don't worry, we won't go too deep,

6
00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:20.728
only what you really need to know to effectively navigate the framework.

7
00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:24.173
Spring Boot out-of-the-box configuration for Spring Security.

8
00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:28.558
I'm sure you have seen many tutorials and demos online that make

9
00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:31.381
it look so simple and easy using Spring Boot.

10
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:35.337
But in reality, Security can be more complicated,

11
00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:38.527
and it's to understand the fundamentals of the framework so

12
00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:42.391
that you can more effectively extend and customize or even

13
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.110
disable some of the default features.

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.577
How to set up Form, Basic,

15
00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:53.392
and Digest Authentication and learn about the key differences between each type,

16
00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:57.544
the pros and the cons so that you can make a more informed decision when

17
00:00:57.544 --> 00:01:01.662
selecting the appropriate strategy for your requirements.

18
00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:06.263
We will spend a lot of time exploring the code in the demos and also have

19
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:11.564
some fun performing penetration testing as this is the best way to learn

20
00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:15.511
and master a complicated subject like security.

21
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:26.000
So join me for the remainder of this module where we will take a deep dive into authentication with Spring Security and Spring Boot.
