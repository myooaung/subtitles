00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,149
If you have been following the course,

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,271
you're probably now very familiar with the Configuration class.

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:09,216
We have used it extensively.

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,343
One thing that's bothering me is it's starting to look very

5
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:15,094
cluttered and messy and not very readable.

6
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,456
So let's tidy it up.

7
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,553
Abracadabra.

8
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:19,061
There.

9
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,603
That looks a lot better.

10
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:23,063
I'm sure you can agree.

11
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:26,901
Our starting point is the http builder object.

12
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,257
We indent from there,

13
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:31,556
add our filter and exceptions handling configuration

14
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:34,542
followed by the login builder.

15
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:38,124
Everything related to that we indent and group together.

16
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:43,963
Next, we do the same for the rememberMe and oauth2 builders.

17
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:44,452
Finally,

18
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:48,449
we get to the authorizeRequests builder where we can

19
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,165
configure our authorization logic.

20
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:55,622
Also include the following annotations in comments around this,

21
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,227
formatter:on and formatter:off,

22
00:00:58,227 --> 00:01:00,796
as you don't want your ID to mess everything back

23
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:09,000
up if you select format source. Now let's get stuck into URL authorization in the next sections.
