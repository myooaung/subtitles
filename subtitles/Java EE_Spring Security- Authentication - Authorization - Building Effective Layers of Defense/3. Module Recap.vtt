00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:05.164
This completes the module on OAuth2 authentication.

2
00:00:05.164 --> 00:00:06.121
Easy, wasn't it?

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.663
That's because under the covers,

4
00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:11.463
Spring is taking care of a lot of the complexity for you.

5
00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:14.105
The Spring team have really done a good job here.

6
00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:19.472
Now in this module you learned how authentication is performed using OAuth,

7
00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:24.028
how to use Spring Security OAuth2 to add sign-in with third party providers,

8
00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:26.925
such as Google and Facebook.

9
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:30.305
Now if you want to learn more about Spring Security to OAuth support,

10
00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:33.069
there are some great course on Pluralsight.

11
00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:38.415
Java Microservices with Spring Cloud: Developing Services has a one-hour

12
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:42.235
long module on securing microservices with OAuth2,

13
00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:45.683
Securing Your Microservices with a Declarative Model for

14
00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:48.685
securing your Angular apps with OAuth.

15
00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:52.627
The course, Building Your First App with Spring Boot and Angular,

16
00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:57.225
module Securing the Application, covers this in detail.

17
00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:01.181
Now if you just want to learn more about OAuth and OpenID in general,

18
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:04.793
the course Introduction to OAuth2, OpenID Connect,

19
00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:10.263
and JSON Web Tokens covers this in great detail.

20
00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.553
We have now come to the end of our journey into

21
00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.987
authentication with Spring Security.

22
00:01:14.987 --> 00:01:17.345
If you have been following the course from the start,

23
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:21.089
you now have the foundational knowledge of the framework to

24
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:24.109
tackle most authentication challenges.

25
00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:32.000
I hope you will join me in the next module where we will take a deep dive into authorization with Spring Security.
