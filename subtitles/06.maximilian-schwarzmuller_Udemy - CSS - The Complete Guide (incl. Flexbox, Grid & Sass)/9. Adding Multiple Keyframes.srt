00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,140
In the last lecture, we added a basic animation and I hope these values are all clear,

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:13,910
let's now add another keyframe though and for that, I'll generally change the notation. Instead of

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,990
from and to,

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,580
we can also use percentage values here.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,630
We have 0% and 100% then, that's the same as from and to

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,880
but now we can add as many in-between steps as we want

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,110
simply by adding another block, for example with 50% but you can also use 10, 15, whatever you

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,770
need

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,770
and now you can define which state your animation should have when it's halfway done.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,000
So this is now where I will set transform to rotate set -10 degree.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,920
So now I'll actually start at zero,

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,190
then halfway through the animation, we'll be at 50%

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,480
and by the end, we'll be at 100%.

14
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,630
Now we got three keyframes and therefore way more control over our animation.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,430
Now if we go back to our animation property, where we add it to an element, we still have wiggle,

16
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,220
we still maybe have that duration, maybe we increased it a bit so that we can see that animation

17
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,160
a bit better,

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,720
we still have the delay and the iteration count maybe.

19
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,500
So let's now save this and look what that yields,

20
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,350
now you'll see we have a way better wiggle effect because now we have that in-between step which actually

21
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,270
looks way better than using that alternate mode.

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,950
We can still use alternate here of course, we can still add alternate as a value but this will actually

23
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,630
lead to a strange look here because we're already controlling the full animation perfectly.

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,160
So now here, it will actually play this strange thing because it moves through the entire animation and then plays

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,120
it back which looks ugly in our case.

26
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:57,550
One thing that's good to know is that you can still add a timing function though, you can still add ease

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,090
out and by the way, the order of these values here doesn't really matter

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,180
except for duration and delay,

29
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,690
since both use seconds or milliseconds, here the duration should come first.

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,400
But back to the timing function,

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:19,210
isn't it strange to specify ease out or any other timing function

32
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:27,830
if you have perfect control over the way the animation plays? Well the timing function simply is there

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:34,760
to decide how the movement between the keyframes should be animated because if you go from transform

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,880
rotate set zero to transform rotate set -10 degree,

35
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,370
this change of course has to be animated

36
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,100
and actually, this works exactly as the transition did.

37
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:51,230
So here, it will simply transition from zero to -10 degree and that transition happens over

38
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,220
half the time of your animation

39
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,620
but that time there, between these two keyframes, this is now affected by the timing function.

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,400
You can specify linear or any other function you want, like ease out

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,370
in our case here.

42
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,460
So with that if we reload, we might not even see a big difference here because that's really hard to

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,980
spot

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,060
but now this is actually animating with an ease out timing function between our keyframes steps.
