00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,160
So let's continue working on this webpage

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,370
and I want to continue with this red block.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,750
Right now, it doesn't look super impressive,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:18,270
would be nice if it were a little bit bigger, had more height, maybe some spacing inside of it and also

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,150
that whitespace around it,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,020
I want to get rid of that too. Until we add a navigation bar,

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,020
this red block should be the very first element on our page without surrounding whitespace.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:38,820
Now we can achieve this, we can add all these things, we can control how the block is designed or how

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,950
much space it takes up by working with the box model.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,520
Now what do I mean with that? Every element in HTML is interpreted as a box by CSS and you can see

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,470
that box in the Chrome developer tools if you inspect that element and again you can really select

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,620
any element.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,370
So here, I selected the h1 element,

14
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,370
now let's pick the section element

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,310
but again, any would do it

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:15,210
and if you then at the bottom scroll down below your styles and the inherited styles, you will see this box.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:23,230
This is how CSS thinks about an element, every element has a content, that's the blue area,

18
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,200
that's really what's inside of it.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,960
So for this section, the content actually is the h1 tag, for the h1 tag,

20
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,120
the content is its text.

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,950
So we get that content, the blue area and then we can add a padding.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:45,150
Now we got none here indicated by that dash but we could add a padding which is some internal space within

23
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,800
that section element from the content to the next part, the border,

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,060
we can add a border to each element.

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,780
Now we don't have a border here, so we'll add all these things in just a second of course, a border surrounds

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:06,810
an element and directly comes after the padding which in turn comes directly after the content.

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,050
Now finally, we sometimes also want to have some spacing around an element and that would be the margin.

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,230
It's not part of the core element, that ends with the border including the border but it comes after

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,250
that,

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,640
it's the distance you have between that element and its next sibling.

31
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,410
For example the h1 element has a margin, by default

32
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,670
it's set by the browser,

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,400
you can see this if you scroll up the browser defaults, there you have that strange margin before and after

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,890
thing,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
well that's just the default browser margin

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,790
and there you can see this element happens to have a margin of 19.92 pixels to the top and bottom,

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,080
that's this orange area which is also indicated on the top left corner,

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,250
so here in the loaded page. As you can see already, the margin goes outside of the surrounding section

39
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,760
container because it's not part of the element, which in turn is the content of the section.

40
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,060
Now since the margin is not part, it's not part of the content and therefore not part of the section.

41
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:15,600
This is the box model, these layers, the content, the padding, the border, the margin, every element is interpreted

42
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,360
as such a box in CSS.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,610
Now there are two different types of elements then, block level and inline, something I'll cover in this

44
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,290
module too where some of these things will differ a bit

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,090
but I'll dive into that. For now,

46
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,120
let's simply keep in mind that every element has these layers.

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,140
Now let's work with that.
