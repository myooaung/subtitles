1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,790
The place to start is on sass-lang.com, sass-lang.com,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,180
that's the page of the SASS language if you want to call it like this

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,690
and there you can get started with SASS. There by the way,

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,030
you can also find the documentation where you can dive in much deeper and learn way more about SASS

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,390
if you want to do so

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,300
but again, I will walk you through the core features here.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,590
So for now, let's simply click on learn SASS here and there, you can find out more about how it works and

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:38,570
you also see the command you need to run to compile an SCSS file in this case to a CSS file which

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,510
again you need to do to ship it. Now in order to compile it,

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,250
you need to install it

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:51,350
and for that you can click on that go here link, on that learn SASS page, to learn how to set your machine

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,540
up for SASS development.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,770
Now there, you can find that there are a couple of tools you could install but we will use the command

14
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:05,780
line and for the command line, we can install a certain tool we can execute there to compile our files.

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,690
Now for Windows, you will need to install Ruby first and you can simply follow that link to the Ruby

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:16,190
installer here on the SASS page to simply download and install Ruby.

17
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:23,270
Now we won't write any Ruby code, SASS just is a Ruby gem, so a tool built with Ruby you could say and therefore

18
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,550
it requires the Ruby runtime to work.

19
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:33,020
So make sure to download and install that Ruby installer on Windows, on Mac, this is not required because

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,750
you already start with Ruby installed,

21
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,750
so once that is done, we can continue with these steps here, both on Windows and Mac.

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:50,060
We first of all should open a terminal or a command prompt and then we can install SASS by using the gem

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,490
command which should be available once you get Ruby installed.

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,280
So let's do that real quick,

25
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,380
I did open my Mac terminal here,

26
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:05,370
again you would execute the same command on Windows and now you run gem and then it's install SASS,

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,510
so gem install SASS. This will install that SASS tool which we need.

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,230
Now this can take a couple of seconds, so let's wait for this to finish

29
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,890
and what you might get is a permission error on Mac.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,050
In this case, you should write sudo gem install SASS and you will be prompted to enter your password

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,770
thereafter

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,200
but this will now grant the right permissions so that you can actually successfully install it.

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,930
So now let's wait for this to finish

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,160
and once it's finished, we're already ready to write our SASS code and use that tool.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,170
Now on Mac,

36
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:44,240
you also might get another error where it says that the installation failed, failed to build gem native

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,290
extension, you then need to run xcode-select--install,

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,850
this uses Xcode, the developer tools by Apple and you will be prompted in a new window

39
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,850
then, simply click install there and agree to the agreements and this will now simply download a certain

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,950
toolset from the official developer tools

41
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,710
Apple provides which are needed behind the scenes to compile that successfully.

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,270
So once this is done, we can go back to the terminal and then you should be able to successfully install

43
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,560
SASS.

44
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,430
So let's try this command again now,

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,250
the sudo gem install SASS command and now this looks much better.

46
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:30,220
You can confirm that it was installed successfully by running sass-v here and it should give

47
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,550
you the latest SASS version you just installed.

48
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,170
Now with that, you're ready to write SASS code

49
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,410
and for that, I'll switch back in our project. Now to be precise,

50
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,170
attached to this video, you find a little starting project.

51
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,660
If you open this by double-clicking the index.html file, you will see this,

52
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,210
these links worked by the way, so definitely feel free to dive deeper into this

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,660
after this module.

54
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,200
So this is a normal page styled with normal CSS, split across two files,

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,430
though I will admit the second file is not that big but you will see why that is useful or why this is

56
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,270
interesting. So this is just the CSS code

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,400
and obviously there is nothing wrong with it but we can already notice some things that can be improved

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,330
and hopefully, SASS can help us there.

59
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,110
So let's quickly identify these areas of improvement and let's then dive into SASS.
