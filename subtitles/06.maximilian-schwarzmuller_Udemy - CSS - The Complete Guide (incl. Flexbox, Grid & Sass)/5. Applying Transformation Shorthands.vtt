00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.340
Time for a short summary of what we learned thus far. We learned about that transform property

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.760
and that we can control the origin of the transformation with the transform origin property, we can

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.750
define around which part of the box it should rotate itself, where the axis should go through and so

4
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.720
on

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.800
and we learned about the four key transform functions you have; rotate, translate, scale and skew.

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.720
Now you saw that there are often skewX, skewY and just skew functions and the same for scale, translate

7
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.770
and rotate,

8
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.750
now you can use the shorthands of course. For rotate if we remove the Z,

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.870
let's go back to the packages page,

10
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.590
we actually see we get the same result as before.

11
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.720
So rotate, just like that, by default rotates around the z-axis.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.170
So this is convenient, since we most of the time want to rotate around this axis, most of the time we

13
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
want to have that 2D transformation. Translate,

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.380
if we don't enter anything else, will allow us to enter one or two values. If we only enter one, like this,

15
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.950
you see it doesn't look that bad but it's now only translating on the x-axis,

16
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.270
the second value is what we need to enter to translate on the y-axis. 

17
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.010
So here, if we also enter -1rem, then we have the same as before, we translate on the x-axis and

18
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.450
on the y-axis.

19
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.410
So with these two arguments syntax, we're back to the original result.

20
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.900
Now regarding the other functions, for customers here,

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.730
for skew, we're already using that function where we just skew on the x-axis,

22
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.220
the second value would then be the y-axis as you learned and for scale,

23
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.510
there if we enter one value, we actually scale on both X and Y at the same time.

24
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.200
If you want to scale either of the two, we can use scaleX and scaleY.

25
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.650
This is how you can work with these transform functions

26
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.390
and that's really all that's to transformations.

27
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.640
It's always useful to use these if you want to change elements just as you saw it here. Translate

28
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.560
is useful, also together with animations but highly useful are things like rotate, skew and scale.
